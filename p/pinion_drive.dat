50|$|The {{original}} Phantom Revolution was {{an unfinished}} semi-automatic paintball marker {{developed during the}} early 1990s. It featured an electrically powered rotary breech which was activated by an on-board computer system and microphone which responded {{to the sound of}} the marker being fired. Another notable innovation in the Revolution was its boltless design. The breech, which rotated on an axis in a similar fashion to that of the cylinder of a revolver, allowed a paintball to be fed into the breech which would then align with the firing chamber, creating a seal. The maximum rate of fire was 7 balls per second, or 14 with a two-hole breech. A few working prototypes were demonstrated at the 1996 National Professional Paintball League World Cup in Orlando, Florida by Mike Casady. However, production was halted indefinitely in 1996 due to a technical problem with the motor <b>pinion</b> <b>drive.</b> Additionally, there were several markers being produced or developed at the time which used a switch for a trigger and a circuit board to control the feed and/or the pneumatic firing sequence such as the Smart Parts Shocker. The sport of paintball saw explosive growth during this decade and as the industry became more lucrative, many patent disputes and lawsuits occurred. CCI effectively sidestepped them by focusing solely on the pump paintball market. All together enough parts for 50 prototypes were fabricated, 12 were assembled, and all but two have been accounted for by Casady.|$|E
50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the ring gear.

50|$|The main {{or driving}} disk {{is faced with}} a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In {{practice}} I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of {{a high degree of}} efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum. The friction disk drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the friction disk and traversing <b>pinion</b> <b>drive</b> in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to 300 mi run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the friction disk to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving.|$|E

40|$|In rig constructions two nev designs {{have been}} {{introduced}} apart from the conventional hoisting system. The first one is the Maritime Hydraulics A. S RamRig© drilling concept, based on hydraulic cylinders as actuators powered by up to 3. 4 MW of hydraulic power in a closed loop hydraulic system. This synthesis of the well-known technology allows {{for the use of}} integrated active and passive heave compensation, as well as the storing and reuse of energy from the lowering phase of an operation. The RamRig concept makes mechanical brakes and clutches obsolete, since hoisting and lowering of the load is controlled solely by the closed loop hydraulics. This decreases the number of critical mechanical components in the hoisting system to a minimum. Safe handling and emergency shut down of extreme amounts of hydraulic power is taking care of by cartridge valves, which make rerouting of hydraulic power possible with minor losses of transferred effect. The second is a new land rig concept based on a patented rack & <b>pinion</b> <b>drive</b> system with a new generation of rigs which can instantly switch between the workover, drilling and the snubbing operations. The new rig concept has a direct drive, thus no drill line. The mobilization time is reduced as the rig has fewer truck loads, a faster rig up and a higher automation level. One land rig currently under construction will be the world’s first single operator unit, with a full pipe handling capability and a fully automated control system. The rig is fully equipped with the 250 T top drive which can be used for the rotation and snubbing, the purpose designed snubbing slips and other features supporting the multifunctional well operations.

40|$|The {{quality of}} cutting {{machines}} is affected by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the cutting machine will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the cutting machine was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the cutting machine, and also an innovative solution for beam mounting. The second step was to integrate two types of drives into the design of the cutting machine. The first drive is a classic rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>drive</b> for cutting machines. To increase (improve) the working speed of the machine, linear motors were designed as an alternative drive. The portal of the cutting machine was designed for a working speed of 260 mmin− 1 and acceleration of 25 m. s− 2. The third step was {{based on the results of}} the analysis. In collaboration with Microstep, an experimental cutting machine in a portal version was produced using linear synchronous motors driving the portal on both sides, and with direct linear metering of its position.

40|$|The NASA Ames Research Center {{is working}} to develop a {{methodology}} for the optimization and design of the high lift system for future subsonic airliners with the involvement of two partners. Aerodynamic analysis methods for two dimensional and three dimensional wing performance with flaps and slats deployed are being developed through a grant with the aeronautical department of the University of California Davis, and a flap and slat mechanism design procedure is being developed through a contract with PKCR, Inc., of Seattle, WA. This report documents the work that has been completed in the contract with PKCR on mechanism design. Flap mechanism designs have been completed for seven (7) different mechanisms {{with a total of}} twelve (12) different layouts all for a common single slotted flap configuration. The seven mechanisms are as follows: Simple Hinge, Upside Down/Upright Four Bar Linkage (two layouts), Upside Down Four Bar Linkages (three versions), Airbus A 330 / 340 Link/Track Mechanism, Airbus A 320 Link/Track Mechanism (two layouts), Boeing Link/Track Mechanism (two layouts), and Boeing 767 Hinged Beam Four Bar Linkage. In addition, a single layout has been made to investigate the growth potential from a single slotted flap to a vane/main double slotted flap using the Boeing Link/Track Mechanism. All layouts show Fowler motion and gap progression of the flap from stowed to a fully deployed position, and evaluations based on spanwise continuity, fairing size and number, complexity, reliability and maintainability and weight as well as Fowler motion and gap progression are presented. For slat design, the options have been limited to mechanisms for a shallow leading edge slat.
