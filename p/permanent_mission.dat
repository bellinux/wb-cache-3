To what extent has the EUDEL emerged as a post-Westphalian diplomatic actor that centralizes, complements or competes with the diplomatic activities of member states’ <b>permanent</b> <b>missions?</b> I argue that the EUDEL and its member states have created an ‘umbrella regional diplomacy’, where member states embed their bilateral diplomatic relations in the overall European approach towards the AU.

25|$|Since {{medieval times}} the episcopal see of Rome has been {{recognized}} as a sovereign entity. Earlier, there were papal representatives (apocrisiarii) to the Emperors of Constantinople, beginning in 453, {{but they were not}} thought of as ambassadors. In the eleventh century the sending of papal representatives to princes, on a temporary or <b>permanent</b> <b>mission,</b> became frequent. In the fifteenth century it became customary for states to accredit permanent resident ambassadors to the Pope in Rome. The first permanent papal nunciature was established in 1500 in Venice. Their number grew {{in the course of the}} sixteenth century to thirteen, while internuncios (representatives of second rank) were sent to less-powerful states. After enjoying a brilliant period in the first half of the seventeenth century, papal diplomacy declined after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, being assailed especially by royalists and Gallicans, and the number of functioning nuncios was reduced to two in the time of Napoleon, although in the same period, in 1805, Prussia became the first Protestant state to send an ambassador to Rome. There was a revival after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, which, while laying down that, in general, the order of precedence between ambassadors would be determined by the date of their arrival, allowed special precedence to be given to the nuncio, by which he would always be the dean of the diplomatic corps.|$|E
