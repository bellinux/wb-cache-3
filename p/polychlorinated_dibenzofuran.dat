40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{discrepancies}} between polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin to <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzofuran</b> (PCDD to PCDF) ratios in laboratory and field {{studies in the}} exhaust of combustion sources are not fully explained by available formation models. In this paper we present the results of experimental studies of the surface mediated formation of PCDD/F at the conditions mimicking the combustion cool zone from a mixture of 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene (1, 2 -DCBz) and 2 -monochlorophenol (2 -MCP) over a model surface consisting of 5 % CuO/Silica. The PCDD to PCDF ratio {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on the ratio of chlorinated benzenes to chlorinated phenols and oxygen content. The higher the 1, 2 -DCBz to 2 -MCP ratio, the lower the PCDD to PCDF ratio. PCDFs are formed predominantly from chlorinated benzenes, while chlorinated phenols are responsible for majority of PCDDs.

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} that biocidal organochlorines such as tebuconazole and permethrin, employed in formulations of wood preservatives, produce significant quantities of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzofuran</b> (PCDD/F) when subjected to thermal decomposition under oxidative conditions. Both tebuconazole and permethrin form PCDD/F during gas-phase oxidation, but much greater yields {{occurred in the}} presence of surrogate ash corresponding to wood treated with copper-based fungicides. The significant yields have implications for the increased toxicity of PCDD/F emissions during fires of wood impregnated by combination of organic and copper-based preservatives. The oxidative pyrolysis of tebuconazole and permethrin over simulated wood ash generated amounts of PCDD/F exceeding those of untreated wood by 3 orders of magnitude. We obtained yields of 1000 ng WHO 97 -TEQ/g tebuconazole and 5500 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g permethrin when reacting the organochlorines in an oxidizing atmosphere over surrogate wood ash. Gasphase oxidation also produce measurable quantities of PCDD/F, corresponding to 1 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g tebuconazole and 36 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g permethrin. In the case of tebuconazole, the present measurements correlate well with those obtained from oxidative pyrolysis of CBA-treated wood in the cone calorimeter.

For accumulation in the bronchial mucosa, structural requirements and specific dose dependence of PCBs have been clearly shown; however, pathological and physiological studies have indicated that respiratory involvement in yusho is mainly small airway disease that may be caused by involvement of cellular component (Clara cells) in bronchioles and/or associated infection.

Changes in the immune status in PCB and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzofuran</b> (PCDF) poisoning are as follows: IgA and IgM in the serum are decreased at an early stage of the disease and then return to normal; suppression of cellular immunity was reported in Taiwanese patients and some may remain in the later stages of the disease, as shown in our patients.

Hepatic organochlorine pesticide, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin, <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzofuran,</b> polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), polybrominated diphenyl ether, and nonylphenol concentrations were relatively low; for example, ΣTEQs (toxic equivalents) for PCBs, dioxins, and furans combined ranged from 4. 7  ng/kg wet weight in reference-site (Baynes Sound) birds to 11. 4  ng/kg wet weight in birds from Vancouver Harbour.

In addition, a low proportion of lymphocytes in individuals across locations in early spring samples was associated with poor body condition.

The gaseous emission of PCDD/F from oxidative pyrolysis of CBA contained considerable amounts of PCDD/F of up to 7500 pg TE/Nm(3). A large increase was also observed for the gaseous emission from smoldering of CBA following the oxidative pyrolysis, where 570 pg TE/Nm(3) was detected. The ash residues of CBA remaining after the CBA emissions after oxidative pyrolysis and ensuing smoldering also showed significant propensity to yield PCDD and PCDF, resulting in 3200 ng TE/kg ash. In contrast, flaming combustion of the two treated timbers did not result in the emission of significant quantities of PCDD/F. The concentrations were quantified as 3. 5 and 5. 2 pg TE/Nm(3) for the ACQ and CBA timber samples, and indicate no reasonable increase over that resulting from similar combustion of untreated Pinus radiata, 3. 7 pg TE/Nm(3).

The GC x GC capability was achieved by using a quad jet, dual stage, thermal modulator. Zone compression of the GC peaks from modulation resulted in a significant increase of the signal intensity over classical GC-IDTOFMS. The GC x GC column set used an Rtx-Dioxin 2 phase as the first dimension (D- 1) and an Rtx- 500 as the second dimension (D- 2). The chromatographic separation of the 17 PCDD/Fs and the 4 cPCBs was attained in D- 1 except for 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD and CB 126 for which deconvoluted ion currents (DIC) were required to be reported separately. The Rtx- 500 phase separated the bulk matrix interfering compounds from the target analytes in D- 2. The instrumental limit of detection (iLODs) was 0. 5 pg for 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD. The calibration curves showed good correlation coefficients for all the compounds investigated in the concentration range of 0. 5 - 200 pg.
