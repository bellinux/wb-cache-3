25|$|Saturniid {{caterpillars}} {{are large}} (50 to 100mm {{in the final}} instar), stout, and cylindrical. Most have tubercules that are often also spiny or hairy. Many are cryptic in coloration, with countershading or disruptive coloration to reduce detection, but some are more colourful. Some have urticating bristles. A few species have been noted to produce clicking sounds with the larval mandibles when disturbed (e.g. Saturniini like Actias luna and the <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth,</b> Antheraea polyphemus). The clicks may serve as aposematic warning signals to a regurgitation defense.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his early}} teens Botting began to {{experiment}} {{at home with}} the hybridization of moths, developing his own technique entailing surgical transplantation of female pheromonal scent sacs. Exhibits of his hybrid moths won top honours at the Ontario (Canada) and United States National Science Fairs two years in a rowâ€”in 1960 for [...] "Interesting Variations of the Cynthia Silk Moth", and in 1961 for [...] "Intergeneric Hybridization Among Giant Silk Moths". In particular, he cross-bred the North American <b>Polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> (then called Telea polyphemus) with Japanese and Indian giant silk moths of the genus Antheraea, pointing out that the <b>Polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> really belonged to that genus. The <b>Polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> was subsequently renamed Antheraea polyphemus to accord with his observations.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} period of unemployment and occasional dispiriting office jobs, {{he took to}} observing nature closely instead of looking for work. Among the creatures he observed in Chicago were ballooning spiders, bats, crickets, <b>Polyphemus</b> <b>Moths</b> and Cecropia moths.|$|R
50|$|Parasitic insects, {{for example}} the {{parasitoid}} wasp, lay their eggs in or on the young caterpillars. The eggs then hatch into larvae that consume the insides of the caterpillars. Once the caterpillars pupate, the larvae themselves pupate, killing the polyphemus pupa. Squirrels have also been known to consume the pupae of <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moths,</b> decreasing the population greatly. Pruning of trees and leaving outdoor lights on at night can also be detrimental to the moths.|$|R
50|$|Caffrocrambus <b>polyphemus</b> is a <b>moth</b> in the Crambidae family. It was {{described}} by Bassi in 2002. It is found in South Africa and Swaziland.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> is {{so named}} {{because of the large}} eyespots {{in the middle of the}} hind wings. A number of ships and English steam {{locomotives}} have also been named after the giant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> uses defence {{mechanisms}} {{to protect itself}} from predators. One of its most distinctive mechanisms is a distraction display that serves to confuse, or simply distract, predators. This involves the large eyespots on its hind wings, which give the moth its name (from the Cyclops Polyphemus in Greek mythology). Eyespots are also startle patterns, a subform of distraction patterns, used for camouflage via deceptive and blending coloration. Most startle patterns are brightly colored areas on the outer body of already camouflaged animals. (Another example {{of the use of}} startle patterns is the gray tree frog, with its bright-yellow leggings. When it leaps, a flash of bright yellow appears on its hind legs, usually startling the predator away from its prey.) Distraction patterns are believed to be a form of mimicry, meant to misdirect predators by markings on the moths' wings. The pattern on the hind wings of the <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> resembles that on the head of the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus).|$|E
5000|$|Differentiating between sexes of {{this species}} is very easy. The most obvious {{difference}} is the plumose antennae. Males have very bushy antennae while females have moderately less bushy antennae. The male's antennae are used to detect pheromones released by unmated females. Another {{difference is that the}} females are slightly larger in the abdomen due to carrying eggs. A surprising amount of variation occurs within this species. Color patterns can range from a reddish-cinnamon to a dark brown, but are almost always a shade of brown.In the late 1950s, amateur lepidopterist Gary Botting hybridized the <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> (then known as Telea polyphemus) with Antheraea yamamai from Japan and, later, Antheraea mylitta from India by transferring the pheromone-producing scent sacs from female [...] "T. polyphemus" [...] to the Antheraea females and allowing T. polyphemus males to mate with them. The resultant hybrids were displayed in his winning U.S. National Science Fair exhibit [...] "Intergeneric hybridization among giant silk moths." [...] After Botting consulted with genetic statistician J.B.S. Haldane and his wife, entomologist Helen Spurway, the <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> was reclassified, becoming Antheraea polyphemus.|$|E

50|$|Antheraea polyphemus (<b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth)</b> is a North American {{member of}} the family Saturniidae, the giant silk moths. It is a tan-colored moth, with an average {{wingspan}} of 15 cm (6 in). The most notable feature of the moth is its large, purplish eyespots on its two hind wings. The eye spots give it its name - from the Greek myth of the Cyclops Polyphemus. The species is widespread in continental North America, with local populations found throughout subarctic Canada and the United States. The caterpillar can eat 86,000 times its weight at emergence in a little less than two months.|$|E
50|$|In 1959, at the Indian Statistical Institute {{she turned}} her {{attention}} to the genetics of the giant silkworm Antheraea mylitta, raising them in captivity to test the quality of their silk. In January 1961 she and J.B.S.H., assisted by their associate Krishna Dronamraju, were hosts to United States National Science Fair biology winners Gary Botting (zoology) and Susan Brown (botany). Using a novel technique of pheromone transfer, Botting had cross-bred an Antheraea mylitta female with a Telea polyphemus male, with viable offspring. Botting and Spurway concluded that the <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> was misclassified and should be included under the genus Antheraea.|$|E
40|$|Douglas W. TallamyThe {{proliferation}} of alien plants and their widespread replacement of native plants {{is predicted to}} negatively affect the insect community. Conservation biocontrol seeks to protect natural enemies, such as predators and parasitoids, through methods such as habitat management, in which plants are used to provide necessary resources to natural enemies. Native plants may support a stronger population of natural enemies than exotic plants. Bagworm and <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> larvae were placed in alien and native plant plots, and their survival was tracked until pupation. It was predicted that plots planted with native plants would have enhanced natural enemy communities, resulting in increased mortality in caterpillar larvae. Thus, larval survival {{would serve as a}} relative measure of the natural enemy community in plots planted with alien plants versus plots planted with native plants. No difference was found between the survival of bagworm larvae between alien and native plots. Almost no difference was found in the survival of polyphemus larvae, though the <b>polyphemus</b> <b>moth</b> experiment may have been confounded by differing rates of growth based on food plant.
