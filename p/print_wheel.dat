5000|$|The 1132 {{was built}} around a {{stripped}} down IBM 407 printing mechanism. The 407 was IBM's top-of-the-line accounting machine from the 1950s. The 1130 had 120 power transistors, each wired to the print magnet for one printer column. The magnet released a lever that engaged a cam with a spinning clutch shaft. The engaged cam then made one revolution, pushing its <b>print</b> <b>wheel</b> toward the ribbon and paper, thereby printing one character.|$|E
50|$|As {{the card}} was being read and {{positioned}} for printing, a ‘mechanical bail’ driven by large steel cams would raise 60 geared ‘lifter bars’ which engaged 60 ‘racks’ which engaged 60 ‘intermediate gears’, which drove 60 ‘print wheels’. (You {{can see the}} maintenance problem with 60 of just about everything). The lifter bars were then lowered under spring tension by the ‘mechanical bail’ {{in time with the}} reading of the punched card. Using the impulse from the ‘contact roll’ / ‘card brush’ / ‘wire contact relay’ circuitry, a ‘push rod’ would latch (stop) the individual ‘lifter bar’ on its downward motion with the character to be printed correctly positioned on the <b>print</b> <b>wheel</b> and facing 1 of 60 ‘print hammers’. An ‘alignment bail’ would then seat itself in between the teeth of the ‘print wheels’ to perform vertical alignment.|$|E
50|$|The {{line printer}} could print 600 lines of 120 {{characters}} per minute. It used a print barrel {{made up of}} 120 <b>print</b> <b>wheels</b> each with 50 characters around its edge. Each of the 120 print positions had a print hammer which when fired squeezed the paper and an inked ribbon between itself and the rotating print barrel {{for a fraction of}} a second.

50|$|In {{a typical}} drum printer design, a fixed font {{character}} set is engraved onto {{the periphery of}} a number of <b>print</b> <b>wheels,</b> the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer could <b>print.</b> The <b>wheels,</b> joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed and paper and an inked ribbon is stepped (moved) past the print position. As the desired character for each column passes the print position, a hammer strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the continuous paper. Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers had to be very fast. Typically, they were driven by voice coils mounted on the moving part of the hammer.|$|R

50|$|The IBM 1132 printer {{relied on}} the 1130 {{processor}} rather than internal logic to determine when to fire the <b>print</b> <b>wheels</b> as they rotated. Printers for the Model 4 ran more slowly, but the slower processor still could {{not keep up with}} it. The hardware manual disclosed that when the Model 4 was servicing the two highest-level interrupts (the level 0 card-reader column interrupt or the level 1 printer interrupt), it ran at the faster 3.6 µs cycle time. Some users of the Model 4 would write a phony printer driver that did not dismiss the printer interrupt, in order to benefit from the higher processor speed. However, lower-level interrupts were disabled during this interval, even the end-of-card interrupt (level 4) from the 1442 card reader.|$|R
40|$|Physical {{experiments}} were conducted using 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>wheels</b> and a sand testing bed {{to explore the}} applications and predictive power of the Resistive Force Theory (RFT), an empirical model based on linear superposition designed to predict the interactive forces between solid bodies and granular media. Four-spoke wheel designs, made of four treads with a hinge halfway down each tread set to a prescribed angle 0, and cylindrical wheels were used to validate a scaling law determined from RFT. The 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>wheels</b> were attached to an experimental test rig that consisted of a motor fixed to a carriage free to move horizontally and vertically. Data was gathered {{through a series of}} horizontal, vertical, and angular position sensors and a set of force and torque sensors, then processed with a MATLAB script and determined to validate the RFT scaling law. Next, the design of an actuated wheel capable of altering its shaped while in motion was explored. RFT predicts that as motion conditions of the wheel change, a corresponding change {{in the shape of the}} wheel would lead to an improvement in the wheel's performance. In order to properly analyze the effect of the change of shape of the wheel, the actuated wheel was designed to first only change shape in the in-plane dimension, and second be sufficiently rigid such that it does not exhibit excessive deformation in the new shape while under load. Several designs were explored, and the final form of the "FrankenWheel" is designed with a series of five flaps that rotate to fixed angles using a system of gears, hinges, and a secondary motor. This version of the "FrankenWheel" has been assembled for testing. by David Carrington Motley. Thesis: S. B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2016.

40|$|The {{application}} of Resistive Force Theory to further understand {{the dynamics of}} wheeled locomotion through granular materials was explored. Resistive Force Theory is a new terradynamic model that simplifies the calculation of the forces applied to bodies moving through granular media because it utilizes linear superposition and is easily scalable to any material of interest. First, a MATLAB simulation was created to test different wheel designs rotating through sand. The designs tested include a four-spoke design, consisting of four treads that have a hinge halfway down their length set to a specific angle, and a "superball" design, consisting of different solid shapes defined by the "superball" equation. The average velocity and power were found for each case to find an optimal design. It was found that four-spoke designs with an angle 6 < 1800 were optimal {{as they reached the}} highest velocities, while requiring the least power. Next, dimensional analysis was performed to find a global scaling relationship for the RFT wheel designs. Scaling laws for the power and velocity were found that allow different wheel designs and conditions to be simulated with an entirely new system. Using the simulation, {{it was found that the}} scaling law for a tire rotating on Mars could be tested on Earth up to a high degree of accuracy. Physical experiments, using 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>wheels</b> and a sand testing bed, were carried out to further validate the scaling relationship. Both four-spoke and "superball" designs were tested and seem to show the general scaling trend expected. by James Slonaker. Thesis: S.

50|$|In {{the model}} 407, each type bar was {{replaced}} with a type wheel, with the characters along the outside edge. To <b>print,</b> each <b>wheel</b> was rotated to the correct character position, then the entire wheel was pushed forward to strike the paper. This action was somewhat faster in that the wheels were less massive than the bars and could be positioned more rapidly. Still, however, speeds of 150 lines per minute were all that were achieved. Although this might seem slow by later printing standards, {{the speed at which}} electromechanical accounting machines could read punched cards and perform their basic arithmetic functions meant that no faster printing speeds were needed.

It {{is part of a}} larger on-going collaborative research project between the University of Nottingham in the UK, Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands and LCPC in France on the development and Finite Element (FE) implementation of a non-/inear elastovisco-plastic constitutive model for asphalt. Two devices, a large scale and small scale device, encompassed by the European Standard and the former British Standard were used. Rutting evaluation at the same temperature on two different materials for pavement surface layers was tested under the same conditions allowing the evaluation of the rutting rate to be determined which was found to be very close from one test to another but sensitive to mixture type. In addition to rutting results, the contact dimensions and pressures from the two devices are evaluated in both the static case and during motion using a fiat force transducer on the surface of the slab. The stresses induced in the slabs were calculated using finite element simulations and the measured contact conditions. For different pressure distributions under the wheel the isotropie and deviatoric stresses at the centre of the slab were compared which showed the importance of a good understanding of the wheel slab contact conditions. The paper provides experimental rutting results obtained at the same temperatures for two characteristic materials on two devices. For future mechanical modelling the <b>wheel</b> <b>print</b> was found to be smaller during the motion than static <b>prints.</b> For <b>wheels</b> using inflated tyres a constant pressure over and elliptic area was found to be appropriate.

40|$|With the {{development}} of generalized nonlinear finite element modelling, this paper delineates the various failure modes of a RC slab in terms of damage dominated either by tension cracking in concrete or plastic yielding leading to concrete crushing. Commonly observed failure modes of such slabs are classified according {{to the level of}} each damage component. Such a classification helps separate the flexure-shear failure mode of RC slabs from the true punching or shear mode of collapse. The influence of main tensile reinforcement on the metamorphosis in failure modes is highlighted by the nonlinear finite element model, using as an illustration, patch loads whose size bear a similar ratio {{to the size of the}} slab as the ratio of the <b>print</b> of a <b>wheel</b> to the size of a deck slab.
