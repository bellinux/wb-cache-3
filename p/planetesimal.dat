5|$|Because <b>planetesimals</b> are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system.

In the present work, we examine the distribution of captured <b>planetesimals</b> in circumplanetary disks using orbital integrations. We find that the number of captured <b>planetesimals</b> reaches an equilibrium state as a balance between continuous capture and orbital decay into the planet.

5|$|A recent {{modification}} of the Nice model has the Solar System begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, in a chain of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the Solar System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the <b>planetesimal</b> disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E

In addition to the presence of several <b>planetesimal</b> belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing.

5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.

5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups.

Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 Earth mass <b>planetesimal</b> disk remaining in what they called the Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{scattered}} {{the majority}} of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc. This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances. Eventually, friction within the <b>planetesimal</b> disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.|$|E
40|$|Many massive objects {{have been}} found in the outer region of the Solar system. How they were formed and evolved has not been well understood, {{although}} there have been intensive studies on accretion process of terrestrial planets. One of the mysteries is the existence of binary <b>planetesimals</b> with near-equal mass components and highly eccentric orbits. These binary <b>planetesimals</b> are quite different from the satellites observed in the asteroid belt region. The ratio of the Hill radius to the physical radius of the <b>planetesimals</b> is much larger for the outer region of the disk, compared to the inner region of the disk. The Hill radius increases with the semi major axis. Therefore, <b>planetesimals</b> in the outer region can form close and eccentric binaries, while those in the inner region would simply collide. In this paper, we carried out $N$-body simulations in different regions of the disk and studied if binaries form in the outer region of the disk.

A significant fraction of large <b>planetesimals</b> are components of the binaries. <b>Planetesimals</b> that become the components of binaries eventually collide with a third body, through three-body encounters.

40|$|If protoplanets {{formed from}} 10 to 20 {{kilometer}} diameter <b>planetesimals</b> in a runaway accretion process {{prior to their}} oligarchic growth into the terrestrial planets, it is only logical to ask where these <b>planetesimals</b> may have formed {{in order to assess}} the initial composition of the Earth. We have used Weidenschilling's model for the formation of comets (1997) to calculate an efficiency factor for the formation of <b>planetesimals</b> from the solar nebula, then used this factor to calculate the feeding zones that contribute to material contained within 10, 15 and 20 kilometer diameter <b>planetesimals</b> at 1 A.

40|$|When <b>planetesimals</b> grow via {{collisions}} in {{a turbulent}} disk, stirring through density fluctuation caused by turbulence effectively increases the relative velocities between <b>planetesimals,</b> which suppresses {{the onset of}} runaway growth. We investigate the onset of runaway growth in a turbulent disk through simulations that calculate the mass and velocity evolution of <b>planetesimals.</b> When <b>planetesimals</b> are small, the average relative velocity between <b>planetesimals,</b> v_ r, {{is much greater than}} their surface escape velocity, v_ esc, so that runaway growth does not occur. As <b>planetesimals</b> become large via collisional growth, v_ r approaches v_ esc. When v_ r≈ 1. 5 v_ esc, runaway growth of the <b>planetesimals</b> occurs. During the oligarchic growth subsequent to runaway growth, a small number of planetary embryos produced via runaway growth become massive through collisions with <b>planetesimals</b> with radii of that at the onset of runaway growth, r_ p,run. We analytically derive r_ p,run {{as a function of the}} turbulent strength. Growing ∼ 10 M_⊕ embryos that are suitable to become the cores of Jupiter and Saturn requires r_ p,run∼ 100 km, which is similar to the proposed fossil feature in the size distribution of main belt asteroids. In contrast, the formation of Mars as quickly as suggested from Hf-W isotope studies requires small <b>planetesimals</b> at the onset of runaway growth. Thus, the conditions required to form Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn and the size distribution of the main-belt asteroids indicate that the turbulence increased in amplitude relative to the sound speed with increasing distance from the young Sun.

5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial <b>planetesimal</b> disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequent}} ejection {{of the ice}} giant encountering Jupiter has led David Nesvorný {{and others}} to hypothesize an early Solar System with five giant planets, {{one of which was}} ejected during the instability. In a recent work this five-planet Nice model begins with the giant planets in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonant chain with a <b>planetesimal</b> disk orbiting beyond them. Following the breaking of the resonant chain Neptune first migrates outward into the <b>planetesimal</b> disk reaching 28 AU before encounters between planets begin. This initial migration reduces the mass of the outer disk enabling Jupiter's eccentricity to be preserved and produces a Kuiper belt with an inclination distribution that matches observations if 20 Earth-masses remained in the <b>planetesimal</b> disk when that migration began. Neptune's eccentricity can remain small during the instability since it only encounters the ejected ice giant, allowing an in situ cold-classical belt to be preserved. The lower mass <b>planetesimal</b> belt in combination with the excitation of inclinations and eccentricities by the Pluto-massed objects also significantly reduce the loss of ice by Saturn's inner moons. The combination of a late breaking of the resonance chain and a migration of Neptune to 28 AU before the instability is unlikely with the Nice 2 model. This gap may be bridged by a slow dust-driven migration over several million years following an early escape from resonance.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the capture of <b>planetesimals</b> in Trojan orbits by a growing proto-Jupiter by {{integrating}} numerically the equations of motion of <b>planetesimals</b> in a four-body problem Sun-Jupiter-Saturn-planetesimal. The masses of Jupiter and Saturn increase exponentially with time. Nebular gas drag on small <b>planetesimals</b> is taken into account. We show that {{a fraction of the}} <b>planetesimals</b> near Jupiter's orbit and almost all <b>planetesimals</b> originally in horseshoe orbits are trapped into stable Trojan orbits. This mechanism was probably an important factor together with collisional diffusion, for delivering a large amount of <b>planetesimals</b> into Trojan orbits during the final growth of Jupiter by gas in-fall. We find also that the libration amplitude of trapped Trojans is damped by the increase of Jupiter's mass reinforcing the stability of the resonance lock. For <b>planetesimals</b> small enough to be perturbed by nebular gas drag, we find an asymmetry between the trapping rate in L 5 compared to L 4. Peale (1993, Icarus 106, 308 - 322) noted also that the stability of the L 4 resonant region is reduced in presence of an intense frictional drag. We present here a simple semi-analytical explanation for the trapping asymmetry based on the evolution of the angular difference between the <b>planetesimal's</b> and proto-Jupiter's longitude of perihelion. The asymmetry between L 4 and L 5 could have led to the capture of a larger number of small <b>planetesimals</b> in L 5.

40|$|Massive {{planetary}} cores (∼ 10 Earth masses) trigger rapid gas accretion to form gas giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn. We {{investigate the}} core {{growth and the}} possibilities for cores to reach such a critical core mass. At the late stage, planetary cores grow through collisions with small <b>planetesimals.</b> Collisional fragmentation of <b>planetesimals,</b> which is induced by gravitational interaction with planetary cores, reduces the amount of <b>planetesimals</b> surrounding them, and thus the final core masses. Starting from small <b>planetesimals</b> that the fragmentation rapidly removes, less massive cores are formed. However, planetary cores acquire atmospheres that enlarge their collisional cross section before rapid gas accretion. Once planetary cores exceed about Mars mass, atmospheres significantly accelerate the growth of cores. We show that, {{taking into account the}} effects of fragmentation and atmosphere, initially large <b>planetesimals</b> enable formation of sufficiently massive cores. On the other hand, because the growth of cores is slow for large <b>planetesimals,</b> a massive disk is necessary for cores to grow enough within a disk lifetime.

25|$|This {{evolution}} of Neptune's orbit produces both resonant and non-resonant populations, an outer edge at Neptune's 2:1 resonance, {{and a small}} mass relative to the original <b>planetesimal</b> disk.

The differing initial locations, with the cold classical objects originating primarily from the outer disk, and capture processes, offer explanations for the bi-modal inclination distribution and its correlation with compositions. However, this {{evolution of}} Neptune's orbit fails to account {{for some of the}} characteristics of the orbital distribution. It predicts a greater average eccentricity in classical Kuiper belt object orbits than is observed (0.10–0.13 versus 0.07) and it does not produce enough higher-inclination objects.

25|$|Gravitational {{encounters}} {{between the}} planets scatter Neptune outward into the <b>planetesimal</b> disk with a semi-major axis of ~28 AU and an eccentricity {{as high as}} 0.4. Neptune's high eccentricity causes its mean-motion resonances to overlap and orbits in the region between Neptune and its 2:1 mean motion resonances to become chaotic. The orbits of objects between Neptune and {{the edge of the}} <b>planetesimal</b> disk at this time can evolve outward onto stable low-eccentricity orbits within this region. When Neptune's eccentricity is damped by dynamical friction they become trapped on these orbits. These objects form a dynamically-cold belt, since their inclinations remain small during the short time they interact with Neptune. Later, as Neptune migrates outward on a low eccentricity orbit, objects that have been scattered outward are captured into its resonances and can have their eccentricities decline and their inclinations increase due to the Kozai mechanism, allowing them to escape onto stable higher-inclination orbits. Other objects remain captured in resonance, forming the plutinos and other resonant populations. These two population are dynamically hot, with higher inclinations and eccentricities; due to their being scattered outward and the longer period these objects interact with Neptune.|$|E
25|$|The first {{modifications}} to the Nice model were the initial positions of the giant planets. Investigations {{of the behavior of}} planets orbiting in a gas disk using hydrodynamical models reveal that the giant planets would migrate toward the Sun. If the migration continued it would have resulted in Jupiter orbiting close to the Sun like recently discovered exoplanets known as hot Jupiters. Saturn's capture in a resonance with Jupiter prevents this, however, and the later capture of the other planets results in a quadruple resonant configuration with Jupiter and Saturn in their 3:2 resonance. A late instability beginning from this configuration is possible if the outer disk contains Pluto-massed objects. The gravitational stirring of the outer <b>planetesimal</b> disk by these Pluto-massed objects increases their eccentricities and also results in the inward migration of the giant planets. The quadruple resonance of the giant planets is broken when secular resonances are crossed during the inward migration. A late instability similar to the original Nice model then follows. Unlike the original Nice model the timing of this instability is not sensitive to the distance between the outer planet and the <b>planetesimal</b> disk. The combination of resonant planetary orbits and the late instability triggered by these long distant interactions has been referred to as the Nice 2 model.|$|E

40|$|More {{than half}} of stars reside in binary or {{multiple}} star systems and many planets {{have been found in}} binary systems. From theoretical point of view, however, whether or not the planetary formation proceeds in a binary system is a very complex problem, because secular perturbation from the companion star can easily stir up the eccentricity of the <b>planetesimals</b> and cause high-velocity, destructive collisions between <b>planetesimals.</b> Early stage of planetary formation process in binary systems has been studied by restricted three-body approach with gas drag and it is commonly accepted that accretion of <b>planetesimals</b> can proceed due to orbital phasing by gas drag. However, the gas drag becomes less effective as the <b>planetesimals</b> become massive. Therefore it is still uncertain whether the collision velocity remains small and planetary accretion can proceed, once the <b>planetesimals</b> become massive. We performed N-body simulations of planetary formation in binary systems starting from massive <b>planetesimals</b> whose size is about 100 - 500 km. We found that the eccentricity vectors of <b>planetesimals</b> quickly converge to the forced eccentricity due to the coupling of the perturbation of the companion and the mutual interaction of <b>planetesimals</b> if the initial disk model is sufficiently wide in radial distribution. This convergence decreases the collision velocity and as a result accretion can proceed much {{in the same way as}} in isolated systems. The basic processes of the planetary formation, such as runaway growth and oligarchic growth and final configuration of the protoplanets are essentially the same in binary systems and single star systems, at least in the late stage where the effect of gas drag is small.
