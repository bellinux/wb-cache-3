40|$|Arterio-venous {{differences}} across forearm muscle in man in both prolonged starvation {{and in the}} <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state,</b> show an uptake of glutamate and a relatively greater production of glutamine. Splanchnic arteriovenous differences in the <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state</b> show a net uptake of glutamine and lesser rate of glutamate production. These data suggest that muscle is a major site of glutamine synthesis in man, and that the splanchnic bed is a site of its removal. The relative roles of liver and other tissues in the splanchnic circuit were not directly assessed, only the net balance. These data in man are in conflict with most previous studies in other species attributing the major proportion of glutamine production to the liver and, pari passu, to the splanchnic bed...|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{arginine}} intake {{is believed}} to have favorable effects on the body. However, it might be hypothesized that excessive consumption of an individual amino acid exerts adverse effects on distribution and metabolism of other amino acids. We evaluated the effect of chronic intake of arginine on amino acid concentrations in blood plasma, liver, kidneys, and soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles. Rats were fed a standard diet or a high-arginine diet (HAD) for two months. Half of the animals in each group were sacrificed in the fed state, and the other half after fasting overnight. HAD increased blood plasma concentrations of urea, creatinine, arginine, and ornithine and decreased most other amino acids. Arginine and ornithine also increased in muscles and kidneys; an increase of lysine was observed in both muscle types. Methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, asparagine, glycine, serine, and taurine decreased in most tissues of HAD fed animals. Most of the effects of HAD disappeared after overnight fasting. It is concluded that (i) enhanced dietary arginine intake alters distribution of almost all amino acids; and (ii) to attain a better assessment of the effects of various nutritional interventions, an appropriate number of biochemical measurements must be performed in both postprandial and <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

To evaluate whether there are also sex differences during short-term fasting (< 24 hours), we studied glucose metabolism after 16 and again after 22 hours of starvation in healthy subjects: six men, six women in both the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycle, and six women on oral contraceptives ([OCC] day 12 of cycle). Glucose oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry, and hepatic glucose output by infusion of 3 - 3 H-glucose. There were no differences in hepatic glucose output {{between men and women}} during short-term fasting. The basal (16 hours) plasma glucose concentration was lower in women on OCC than in men (P <. 05). Prolongation of the <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state</b> induced a similar decline in plasma glucose concentrations in all groups. Basal (16 hours) glucose oxidation was lower in women on OCC than in men (P <. 05). Prolongation of the <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state</b> by 6 hours caused a significant decrease in glucose oxidation only in men. After 22 hours of fasting, glucose oxidation was lower in women on OCC than in women with normal menstrual cycles. In conclusion, the metabolic {{adaptation to}} the <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state</b> (< 24 hours of fasting) is regulated differently in women on OCC as compared with women with normal menstrual cycles and men.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{evaluation}} of portal versus peripheral routes for insulin delivery in diabetes with three representative closed-loop glucose control algorithms. A novel noninvasive approach is used {{which is based on}} a model of the blood glucose regulation system which simulates a Type I diabetic subject. The two routes and three algorithms are compared in controlling the simulated patient for 24 h, challenged with two dynamic glucose perturbations. The evaluation is performed by comparing both plasma accessible variables (e. g., glucose and insulin) and metabolic fluxes (e. g., glucose production and uptake, peripheral glucose utilization). Similar performances are achieved by the three algorithms both with peripheral and with portal infusions, especially in the <b>postabsorptive</b> steady <b>state.</b> An almost complete metabolic normalization is obtained with the portal route. With the peripheral route, normality is not restored; in particular, hyperinsulinemia and enhanced insulin-dependent glucose utilization are produced.

Net daily nitrogen balance increased equally in young and older participants, but <b>postabsorptive</b> catabolic <b>state</b> also increased, as indicated by higher whole body protein turnover and leucine oxidation with no change in protein synthesis. Maximal muscle mitochondrial ATP production rate was lower in older people, with no change occurring in diet.

In conclusion, a short-term high-protein diet increased net daily nitrogen balance but increased the postabsorptive use of protein as a fuel. HP did not enhance protein synthesis or muscle mitochondrial function in either young or older participants. Additionally, widening differences in GFR between young and older patients is a potential cause of concern in using HP diet in older people...|$|R

Therefore IDDM patients have marked defects in renal handling of endogenous Cp, regarding both the amount metabolized by renal tissue and that reabsorbed by tubular cells.

In healthy humans, hyperinsulinemia increases methionine transmethylation, homocysteine transsulfuration, and clearance. No such data exist in type 2 diabetes either in the fasting state or in response to hyperinsulinemia. To this purpose, seven male type 2 diabetic patients with albuminuria (1. 2 +/- 0. 4 g/day, three with mild to moderate renal insufficiency) and seven matched control subjects were infused for 6 h with L-[methyl-(2) H(3), 1 -(13) C]methionine. Methionine flux, transmethylation, and disposal into proteins as well as homocysteine remethylation, transsulfuration, and clearance were determined before and after euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (approximately 1, 000 pmol/l). In type 2 diabetic subjects, homocysteine concentration was twofold greater (P 50 % and from approximately 40 to > 100 %, respectively; P < 0. 05) than in control subjects. The insulin-induced increments of methionine transmethylation, homocysteine transsulfuration, and clearance were markedly reduced in type 2 diabetic subjects (by more than threefold, P < 0. 05 or less vs. control subjects). In contrast, methionine methyl and carbon flux were not increased in the patients.

In summary, in compensated liver cirrhosis studied under fasted and fed states, 1) Tyr Ra is increased; 2) Phe Hy and Phe Ra (plasma model) are increased; 3) Tyr clearance is normal; and 4) Phe clearance is slightly decreased. In conclusion, in cirrhosis increased total tyrosine Ra and hydroxylation contribute to fasting and postmeal hypertyrosinemia, whereas the mechanism(s) responsible for the hyperphenylalaninemia may include both increased production and decreased disposal...|$|R

Release of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) from adipose tissue and splanchnic NEFA extraction followed a similar time-course after oral glucose, {{and there was a}} highly significant relationship between adipose tissue NEFA release and splanchnic NEFA uptake. There was no immediate inhibition of splanchnic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) -triacylglycerol (TAG) output when plasma insulin levels increased after glucose. Adipose tissue extraction of VLDL-TAG tended to vary in time {{in a manner similar to}} splanchnic VLDL-TAG output and the two were significantly related. The area-under-curves (AUC) for splanchnic extraction of NEFA was significantly lower than that for output of VLDL, implying depletion of hepatic TAG stores during the experiment. In the hyperinsulinemic clamp experiments, there was on average suppression of splanchnic VLDL-TAG output although between-person variability was marked. This suppression could be explained by a very low supply of NEFA during the clamp. We conclude that there is an integrated pattern of metabolism in splanchnic and adipose tissues in the <b>postabsorptive</b> and post-glucose <b>states.</b> Flux of NEFA from adipose tissue drives splanchnic NEFA uptake. Splanchnic VLDL-TAG secretion appears to be regulated by a number of factors and in turn controls TAG extraction in adipose tissue.

In CRF, arterial blood levels of valine are significantly reduced, whereas leucine and isoleucine levels are not different from controls; valine and leucine levels {{are directly related to}} GFR. In CRF, a significant decrease in the release of valine by the leg is observed; the leucine release tends to be lower; for both these amino acids, leg release is directly related to their arterial levels. Both ratios of valine and leucine release to total amino acid release by the leg are significantly reduced in CRF. Furthermore, in CRF cerebral uptake and fractional extraction of valine and isoleucine are decreased. In normal subjects, valine and leucine are significantly extracted by the HS bed, whereas in CRF the HS uptake of valine and its fractional extraction fall significantly and leucine uptake is unchanged. The kidney releases significant amounts of leucine both in CRF and in controls. In conclusion, in CRF in the <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state</b> the {{exchange of}} BCAAs, mainly valine, is altered rather early at the major sites of production and utilization, and the flux of these amino acids among the organs is decreased.

To investigate {{the interaction between}} bed rest and moderate energy restriction on whole body glutamine kinetics in healthy volunteers, we performed a four-period study in which each subject randomly underwent a bed rest or ambulatory 14 day period both in eucaloric or hypocaloric (− 20 % of energy requirement) conditions. Glutamine kinetics were measured by l-[5 - 15 N]glutamine and l-[1 - 13 C]leucine primed continuous infusions in the <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state</b> and during a 3 h infusion of a glutamine-free amino acid mixture (0. 13 g amino acids (kg lean body mass (LBM)) − 1 h− 1). Bed rest decreased glutamine de novo synthesis in the <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state</b> both in eucaloric (from 4. 17 ± 0. 14 to 3. 56 ± 0. 13 μmol (kg LBM) − 1 min− 1; P < 0. 001) and in hypocaloric (from 3. 79 ± 0. 19 to 3. 49 ± 0. 14 μmol (kg LBM) − 1 min− 1; P < 0. 001) conditions, independently of changes in whole body proteolysis. Bed rest did not affect glutamine clearance. We failed to detect either significant effects of energy intake or energy × activity interactions on glutamine kinetics. Bed rest significantly decreased postabsorptive plasma glutamine concentrations (P < 0. 05). Amino acid infusion increased glutamine de novo synthesis rate and plasma glutamine concentrations in all conditions, without significant effects of bed rest or energy levels. We conclude that inactivity is associated with decreased whole body glutamine availability due to down-regulated de novo synthesis...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} the regional subcutaneous glycerol production rate in normal and obese humans, the venous arterialized plasma glycerol, interstitial glycerol in the subcutaneous adipose tissue together with adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF, ml/ 100 g. min) were {{measured in the}} <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state</b> and for 2 h after ingestion of 100 g of oral glucose. Eight lean and eight obese men with normal oral glucose tolerance tests were investigated with the subcutaneous microdialysis technique and 133 Xe clearance. In the <b>postabsorptive</b> <b>state,</b> the interstitial glycerol concentrations in lean and obese subjects were 170 +/- 21 vs. 282 +/- 28 microM (P less than 0. 01) and 156 +/- 23 vs. 225 +/- 12 microM (P less than 0. 05) in the abdominal and femoral subcutaneous adipose tissue, respectively. The corresponding arterial glycerol levels were 54 +/- 4 vs. 75 +/- 14 microM (NS). Abdominal ATBF was greater in lean subjects (3. 2 +/- 0. 6 vs. 1. 6 +/- 0. 3; P less than 0. 05), whereas femoral ATBF was similar in both groups (2. 7 +/- 0. 4 vs. 2. 4 +/- 0. 7). Estimated mean local glycerol release (mumol/ 100 g. min) was similar in the lean and obese group (0. 16 +/- 0. 03 vs. 0. 20 +/- 0. 05 and 0. 18 +/- 0. 02 vs. 0. 17 +/- 0. 04) in the abdominal and femoral site, respectively. We conclude that glycerol production from the subcutaneous tissue is increased in obesity, irrespective of adipose tissue distribution. This enhancement {{is due to the}} increased adipose tissue mass...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of insulin}} in the {{regulation}} of human adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase was evaluated. Adipose tissue heparin-releasable lipoprotein lipase (thought {{to be related to}} peripheral clearance of plasma triglycerides) was low in insulin-deficient, untreated hyperglycemic diabetic subjects (P less than 0. 001) and treatment of hyperglycemia returned the activity to normal. In chronic hyperinsulinism, represented by obesity, heparin-releasable activity among control subjects was correlated to percent of ideal body weight (r= 0. 53, P less than 0. 05) and to fat cell size (r= 0. 61, P less than 0. 02). Acetone-ether powder lipoprotein lipase activity (presumed to reflect total tissue enzyme) was also related to percent of ideal body weight (r= 0. 76, P less than 0. 001 for controls; r= 0. 67, P less than 0. 05 for diabetics) and to fat cell size (r= 0. 71, P less than 0. 01 for controls; r= 0. 85, P less than 0. 01 for diabetics. Postprandial-stimulated insulin secretion was related to diet-induced changes in lipoprotein lipase in control subjects; both were dependent upon the amount of dietary carbohydrate. In contrast, the diabetic patients with low insulin responses, failed to increase lipoprotein lipase activity with feeding. The changes in heparin-releasable (r= 0. 66, P less than 0. 01) and acetone-ether powder (r= 0. 69, P less than 0. 01) activity during feeding were related to the percent increase in plasma insulin. Thus, insulin appears to be important {{in the regulation}} of human adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity. Elevated insulin levels in obesity and increased insulin secretion after eating were associated with increased lipoprotein lipase activity. Defects in insulin secretion, both in <b>postabsorptive</b> and postprandial <b>states,</b> are associated with low adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase and may lead to hypertriglyceridemia in diabetic man...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dietary protein {{digestion}} and absorption is {{an important}} factor modulating muscle protein accretion. However, there are few data available on the effects of coingesting other macronutrients with protein on digestion and absorption kinetics and the subsequent muscle protein synthetic response. Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the impact of carbohydrate coingestion with protein on dietary protein digestion and absorption and muscle protein accretion in healthy young and older men. Design: Twenty-four healthy young (aged 21 ± 1 y, body mass index 21. 8 ± 0. 5 kg/m 2) and 25 older (aged 75 ± 1 y, body mass index 25. 4 ± 0. 6 kg/m 2) men received a primed continuous L-[ring- 2 H 5]-phenylalanine and L-[ring- 3, 5 - 2 H 2]-tyrosine infusion and ingested 20 g intrinsically L-[1 - 13 C]-phenylalanine-labeled protein with (Pro+CHO) or without (Pro) 60 g carbohydrate. Plasma samples and muscle biopsies were collected in a <b>postabsorptive</b> and postprandial <b>state.</b> Results: Carbohydrate coingestion delayed the appearance of exogenous phenylalanine in the circulation (P =. 001). Dietary protein-derived phenylalanine availability over the 5 -hour postprandial period was lower in the older (62 ± 2 %) when compared with the young subjects (74 ± 2 %; P =. 007), with no differences between conditions (P =. 20). Carbohydrate coingestion did not modulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates (0. 035 ± 0. 003 vs 0. 043 ± 0. 004 and 0. 033 ± 0. 002 vs 0. 035 ± 0. 003 %/h after Pro vs Pro+CHO in the young and older group, respectively). In accordance, no differences in muscle protein-bound L-[1 - 13 C]-phenylalanine enrichments were observed between conditions (0. 020 ± 0. 002 vs 0. 020 ± 0. 002 and 0. 019 ± 0. 003 vs 0. 022 ± 0. 004 mole percent excess after Pro vs Pro+CHO in the young and older subjects, respectively). Conclusion: Carbohydrate coingestion with protein delays dietary protein digestion and absorption but does not modulate postprandial muscle protein accretion in healthy young or older men...|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{progressive}} loss {{of muscle}} mass with aging is accelerated in {{type 2 diabetes}} patients. It {{has been suggested that}} this is attributed to a blunted muscle protein synthetic response to food intake. Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} test the hypothesis that the muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestion is impaired in older type 2 diabetes patients when compared with healthy, normoglycemic controls. Design: A clinical intervention study with two parallel groups was conducted between August 2011 and July 2012. Setting: The study was conducted at the research unit of Maastricht University, The Netherlands. Intervention, Participants, and Main Outcome Measures: Eleven older type 2 diabetes males [diabetes; age 71 ± 1 y, body mass index (BMI) 26. 2 ± 0. 5 kg/m 2] and 12 age- and BMI-matched normoglycemic controls (control; age 74 ± 1 y, BMI 24. 8 ± 1. 1 kg/m 2) participated in an experiment in which they ingested 20 g intrinsically L-[1 - 13 C]phenylalanine-labeled protein. Continuous iv L-[ring- 2 H 5]phenylalanine infusion was applied, and blood and muscle samples were obtained to assess amino acid kinetics and muscle protein synthesis rates in the <b>postabsorptive</b> and postprandial <b>state.</b> Results: Plasma insulin concentrations increased after protein ingestion in both groups, with a greater rise in the diabetes group. Postabsorptive and postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates did not differ between groups and averaged 0. 029 ± 0. 003 vs 0. 029 ± 0. 003 %/h 1 and 0. 031 ± 0. 002 vs 0. 033 ± 0. 002 %/h 1 in the diabetes versus control group, respectively. Postprandial L-[1 - 13 C]phenylalanine incorporation into muscle protein did not differ between groups (0. 018 ± 0. 001 vs 0. 019 ± 0. 002 mole percent excess, respectively). Conclusions: Postabsorptive muscle protein synthesis and postprandial protein handling is not impaired in older individuals with type 2 diabetes when compared with age-matched, normoglycemic controls...|$|R
