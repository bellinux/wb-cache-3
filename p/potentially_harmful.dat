5|$|Salts of {{germanium}} are <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> {{to humans}} and animals if ingested on a prolonged basis. There is interest in the pharmacological actions of germanium compounds but no licensed medicine as yet.|$|E
5|$|Due to its <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> {{effects on}} ecosystems, various {{efforts have been}} made to control {{introduced}} populations of C.maenas around the world. In Edgartown, Massachusetts, a bounty was levied in 1995 for catching C.maenas, to protect local shellfish, and 10tons were caught.|$|E
5|$|Although {{unpalatable}} when consumed raw, when boiled {{the leaves}} of Tephrosia apollinea and numerous other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev. But herbal doctors in Oman warn that Tephrosia apollinea can be <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> to humans, and as of 1993 {{it had not been}} fully analyzed chemically to assess the wider impact it could have on health.|$|E

50|$|Abnormal {{behavior}} is broken {{up to two}} types: atypical and maladaptive. Atypical {{behavior is}} not necessarily harmful, but maladaptive behavior could <b>potentially</b> be <b>harmful.</b>|$|R
5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} electron acceptor {{because it is a}} strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer of one or two electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> lactate within its cells.|$|E
50|$|Salt {{water and}} mustard water {{have been used}} since ancient times as emetics. Care must be taken with salt, as {{excessive}} intake can <b>potentially</b> be <b>harmful.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{used for}} high blood pressure, other better studied {{medications}} are typically recommended. Prescrire {{has stated that}} aliskiren is <b>potentially</b> more <b>harmful</b> than beneficial and thus list it as of 2014 as a drug to avoid.|$|R

5|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{named for}} the German naturalist Fritz Müller, {{describes}} a situation where two or more species have similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable). At first, Bates could not explain why this should be so—if both were harmful why did one need to mimic another? Müller put forward the first explanation for this phenomenon: if a common predator confuses two species, individuals in both those species {{are more likely to}} survive. This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic and the model benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as mutualism in this respect. The signal receiver is also advantaged by this system, despite being deceived about species identity, as it avoids <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> encounters. The usually clear distinction between mimic and model is also blurred. Where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species can be said to be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers, however, it is more realistic to speak of each as a co-mimic than of distinct 'mimic' and 'model' species, as their warning signals tend to converge. Also, the two species may exist on a continuum from harmless to highly noxious, so Batesian mimicry grades smoothly into Müllerian convergence.|$|E
25|$|MRI's produce {{detailed}} images {{created by}} generating strong magnetic fields that may induce <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> displacement force and torque. These fields produce <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> {{radio frequency heating}} and create image artifacts rendering images useless. Due to these potential risks, only certain medical devices {{can be used in}} an MR environment.|$|E
25|$|When {{people are}} confronted with {{unpleasant}} and <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, PET-scans show increased bloodflow in the amygdala. In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety. This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Some storing {{materials}} can {{be harmful to}} ceramic objects. Wool felt attracts and harbors insects including moths and silverfish which can be <b>potentially</b> very <b>harmful</b> to other collection material types. Polyurethane foam deteriorates over time which leaves a by-product that are sticky and acidic.|$|R
50|$|Since 2000, South Africa {{does not}} license orphanages any more but they {{continue}} to be set up unregulated and <b>potentially</b> more <b>harmful.</b> Theoretically the policy supports community-based family homes but this is not always the case. One example is the homes operated by Thokomala.|$|R

25|$|Given the {{emphasis}} that Islamic law stipulates {{on the welfare}} of children and nurturing children with permitted means of income, Imam Shaafi’i opined that it was legislated {{for a man to}} marry just once as an increase in the population of a family due to multiple marriages could <b>potentially</b> harbour <b>harmful</b> monetary consequences for the man who marries more than once.|$|R
40|$|The Loveday Basin is an {{evaporative}} disposal basin {{that has}} received saline groundwater and irrigation discharge for the last 30 years. Continual evaporation has concentrated sulfur which, combined with a permanent water cover, {{has led to the}} formation of sulfidic material, which can <b>potentially</b> be <b>harmful</b> to the environment (LAMONTAGNE et al., 2004).

50|$|An {{investigation}} of the heavy metal content of mushroom samples found cadmium levels in A. caesarea four times greater than allowed in cultivated mushrooms by EU standards. The amount of lead in A. caesarea also exceeded allowed levels.
