500|$|After an {{analysis}} of the observed data and the damage in Tonga, the FMS estimated that Hina's landfall intensity was underestimated. The observed wind data suggested that the system had storm force sustained winds but had peak gusts comparable to hurricane force. Furthermore, the lowest <b>pressure</b> <b>values</b> also indicated that the winds had to be stronger than estimated for it to fit known wind pressure relationships. It was subsequently deduced by the FMS that Hina was a minimal category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of [...] when it crossed the Tonga island of Tongatapu at around 08:30UTC (21:30UTC+13). The NPMOC also revised their estimate of Hina's peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds from [...] to [...] during post analysis, which made the system equivalent to a category one hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E

50|$|Copper {{units of}} {{pressure}} or CUP, {{and the related}} lead units of pressure or LUP, are terms applied to pressure measurements used {{in the field of}} internal ballistics for the estimation of chamber pressures in firearms. These terms were adopted by convention to indicate that the <b>pressure</b> <b>values</b> were measured by copper crusher and lead crusher gauges respectively. In recent years, they have been replaced by the adoption of more modern piezoelectric pressure gauges that more accurately measure chamber pressures and generally give significantly higher <b>pressure</b> <b>values.</b> This nomenclature was adopted to avoid confusion and the potentially dangerous interchange of <b>pressure</b> <b>values</b> and standards made by different types of pressure gauges. Pressure is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that is expressed in units of force divided by area. In the avoirdupois system, the units of pressure are pounds per square inch and in the metric system, the units or pressure are newtons per square meter (pascals). A chamber pressure measured with a copper crusher gauge would be expressed as psi (CUP) in the English system or MPa (CUP) in the metric system.|$|E

30|$|Pressure sensor {{units for}} oceanographic {{applications}} have been employed {{since the late}} 1960 ’s (e.g., Munk and Zetler, 1967). Various types of pressure transducers have been investigated for obtaining high-quality ocean bottom pressure (OBP) records. These include vibrating wires, strain gauges, capacitance plates, and quartz-crystal resonators. The quartz-crystal resonator transducer is most commonly used at present because of its high sensitivity to pressure, high resolution, and long-term stability (Eble et al., 1989; Joseph, 2011). Devices incorporating the quartz resonator manufactured by Paroscientific, Inc. (hereafter Paros), and by Hewlett-Packard, Inc. (hereafter HP), are currently used as water-depth sensors. In general, the physical pressure measurement is obtained from the vibrational frequency of the transducer, which changes with ambient pressure and temperature. Therefore, thermal effects must be accurately corrected to obtain a meaningful physical <b>pressure</b> <b>value.</b> A built-in thermometer is needed to accurately measure {{the temperature of the}} transducer. The manufacturers provide conversion equations, and tables of calibration coefficients, to calculate an accurate physical <b>pressure</b> <b>value,</b> with a thermal correction, from the vibrational frequency, for the respective sensors. The procedures to obtain the physical <b>pressure</b> <b>value</b> with a pressure-measurement system were introduced by Eble et al. (1989) for the Paros sensors, and by Takahashi (1981 a) for the HP sensors.|$|R
