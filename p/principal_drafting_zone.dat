The process parameters were optimized in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar of the INA-V spinning frame, the drafting principle in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar of INA-V spinning frame was analyzed, and the sliver configuration was observed in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar. The result revealed that installed the pressure bar in break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> after, when the roving twist factor was small, CV%, thinness, thickness and neps of the yarn spun decrease as the break drafting ratio increase; when the twist factor of roving was larger, the break draft ratio as 1. 3 time was optimum drafting conditions. The yarn quality was improved as roving twist increased...|$|R

40|$|A peloton may {{be defined}} as two or more cyclists riding in {{sufficiently}} close proximity to be located either {{in one of two}} basic positions: 1) behind cyclists in zones of reduced air pressure, referred to as 'drafting', or 2) in zones of highest air pressure, described here alternately as 'riding at the front', 'in the wind', or in 'non-drafting positions'. Cyclists in <b>drafting</b> <b>zones</b> expend less energy than in front positions. Two broad models of peloton dynamics are explored. The first is an energetic model that describes peloton dynamics that oscillate through observable phase states as they emerge from collision avoidance and riders' coupled energy outputs. These phases exhibit behavioural characteristics such as convection patterns and synchronization, among others. Under the second, economic model, we discuss some basic parameters of the peloton as a system of economic exchange, and identify the resources within a peloton for which riders compete and cooperate. These include the energy savings of drafting, a near-front positional resource, and an information resource. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 1 Appendi...|$|R

40|$|Conventional ring {{spinning}} {{is known as}} traditional spinning system and it is most widely used system in textile industry. Despite being the most prevalent system and supplying approximately 60 % of short-staple yarn production, {{there are still some}} limitations as lower production rate, longer production flow and higher production costs. That is why, researches in textiles started to accelerate to develop alternative spinning systems. Siro-spun spinning system which is an important type of twist spinning, had been developed with the aim of reducing yarn manufacturing costs by eliminating plying and twisting processes in the production flow. The main principle of Siro-spun spinning is to feed two parallel fibre strands in <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> and allow these two fibre strands twist together on each other when they leave the front roller. In this study, it was aimed to compare the properties of two ply yarns produced by {{ring spinning}} system and Siro-spun spinning system. For this purpose, properties of Ne 40 / 2 yarns made of cotton, Tencel, polyester and micro Modal were analysed. Results showed that Siro-spun yarns have lower hairiness and unevenness than ring-spun yarns, besides mechanical properties of both spinning systems are approximate. Besides the advantages in terms of production costs, it can be also concluded that Siro-spun spinning system is a strong alternative of conventional system in terms of many yarn characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Object-oriented {{software}} {{may show}} signs of procedural thinking {{because of lack of}} design or due to design erosion over a period of time. We refer to such a software as proce-dural object-oriented code. Huge classes, scarce class hier-archies and absence of classes for domain entities are hall-marks of procedural object-oriented code. Due to huge in-vestments in such systems, software restructuring becomes necessary. To support code modularization, it is important to identify useful domain abstractions. In this paper, we present a tool-assisted technique to identify useful abstrac-tions and class hierarchies in procedural object-oriented code. During this task, <b>principal</b> classes (<b>draft</b> classes) are identified. Afterwards, composition and association rela-tionships are inferred for principal classes.
