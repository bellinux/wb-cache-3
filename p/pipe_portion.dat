40|$|In {{order to}} study the rupture {{phenomena}} of welded structures made of P 92 steel, a weldment was obtained in a P 92 seamless <b>pipe</b> <b>portion.</b> Cylindrical smooth and notched cross-weld specimens (CWS) were cut from the weld and submitted to tensile and creep uniaxial tests at 575 °C. The results of these tests are presented and discussed. A continuum model is proposed in order to simulate the deformation and damage mechanisms of the base metal, heat affected zone and weld metal within welded structures. The material parameters for the model at 575 °C were obtained for the different microstructural regions {{on the basis of}} literature data and on the current results on smooth CWS creep tests. It is then shown that the model accounts for both tensile and creep behaviours of CWS...|$|E

50|$|Traces {{of early}} and late Bronze Age {{settlements}} {{have been found in}} the Hagneck marshland, {{which is part of the}} Grand Marais. Construction on a hill that separated the marshes from the lake resulted in the destruction of what appeared to be a 200 m Roman era drainage <b>pipe.</b> A <b>portion</b> of the Roman road between Vinelz and Täuffelen is still visible near village. Scattered medieval artifacts have been found near the marsh and the remains of a medieval castle were destroyed during construction of the Hagnek channel.|$|R
50|$|Drill pipe {{makes up}} the {{majority}} of the drill string back up to the surface. Each drill pipe comprises a long tubular section with a specified outside diameter (e.g. 3 1/2 inch, 4 inch, 5 inch, 5 1/2 inch, 5 7/8 inch, 6 5/8 inch). At each end of the drill <b>pipe</b> tubular, larger-diameter <b>portions</b> called the tool joints are located. One end of the drill pipe has a male ("pin") connection whilst the other has a female ("box") connection. The tool joint connections are threaded which allows for the make of each drill pipe segment to the next segment.|$|R
40|$|The caliper log run in semi-indurated sediments {{and rocks}} in Hole 459 B {{revealed}} variations in hole diameter {{that can be}} used to reconstruct the effects of drill string movement on the shape of the hole. The hole drilled was not a perfect cylinder, but was generally funnel-shaped with sides sloping inward at about 0. 004 °. Lateral oscillations of the bit dur-ing drilling produced an enlarged hole whose diameter exceeded that of the bit by a couple of inches (ca. 5 cm). By and large, the hole diameter was greatest in the softest rock. In places, further enlargement of the hole occurred repeatedly every 9. 5 meters (the length of a core), caused primarily by sea-water erosion during the pumping of fresh core barrels down the <b>pipe.</b> Other <b>portions</b> of the hole were reamed smooth by the top edge of the bottom-hole assembly. Some recovered rocks show helical exterior grooves indicating that the drill bit not only rotated, but also moved in a small cir-cle as the cores were cut...|$|R
50|$|Drill <b>pipe</b> is a <b>portion</b> of {{the overall}} drill string. The drill string {{consists}} of both drill pipe and the bottom hole assembly (BHA), which is the tubular portion closest to the bit. The BHA will be made of thicker walled heavy weight drill pipe (HWDP) and drill collars, which have a larger outside diameter and provide weight to the drill bit and stiffness to the drilling assembly. Other BHA components can include a mud motor, measurement while drilling (MWD) apparatus, stabilizers, and various specialty downhole tools. The drill stem includes the entire drill string, plus the kelly that imparts rotation and torque to the drill pipe at the top.|$|R
5000|$|A {{traditional}} {{hydraulic ram}} {{has only two}} moving parts, a spring or weight loaded [...] "waste" [...] valve sometimes known as the [...] "clack" [...] valve and a [...] "delivery" [...] check valve, making it cheap to build, easy to maintain, and very reliable. The Papa hydraulic ram pump also has only two moving parts. However, these are not mechanical but instead rely on the elastomeric properties of the main valve and non-return valve which are low-cost, reliable and easy to replace. In addition, there is a drive pipe supplying water from an elevated source and a delivery <b>pipe,</b> taking a <b>portion</b> of the water that comes through the drive pipe to an elevation higher than the source.|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{performances}} of three numerical approaches (Lagrangian, ALE and control volume) for modelling the response of a short cylindrical <b>pipe</b> representing a <b>portion</b> of the intestines subjected to large and rapid compressions. While {{not being able to}} simulate sustained fluid flow, the Lagrangian approach provided similar results as the ALE for moderate levels of compression. However, it was the stiffest approach for larger levels, and had numerical issues for extreme compressions. While the ALE did not have these issues, its computing cost was very high, which would be problematic for large models. The control volume approach had the lowest computing cost and seemed promising for larger compressions. However, its response was the softest and further investigations are needed to define its dependency to modelling parameters...|$|R
40|$|A leading-edge-shaped {{heat pipe}} was {{successfully}} fabricated and tested. The heat pipe had a "D-shaped" cross section and was fabricated from arc cast molybdenumrhenium. An artery {{was included in}} the wick. Several issues were resolved during the fabrication of the heat-pipe container and wick with a sharp-leading-edge radius. The heat pipe was tested in a vacuum chamber using induction heating and was started up from the frozen state several times. The heat pipe did operate as a heat <b>pipe</b> over a <b>portion</b> of its length. However, design temperatures and heat fluxes were not obtained due to premature failure of the heat pipe resulting from electrical discharge between the induction heating apparatus and the heat pipe. Introduction Stagnation regions, such as wing and tail leading edges and nose caps, are critical design areas of hypersonic aerospace vehicles because of the hostile thermal environment those regions experience during flight. As a hypersonic vehicle travels through the earth [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Surface cracks {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as a major cause for potential failures of metal pipes. In fracture analysis, the widely used method is based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. However, for ductile metal pipes, it has been known {{that the existence of}} plasticity results in easing of stress concentration at the crack front. This will ultimately increase the total fracture toughness. Therefore, when using linear elastic fracture mechanics to predict fracture failure of ductile metal <b>pipes,</b> the plastic <b>portion</b> of fracture toughness should be excluded. Otherwise, the value of fracture toughness will be overestimated, resulting in an under-estimated probability of failure. This paper intends to derive a model of elastic fracture toughness for steel pipes with a circumferential crack. The derived elastic fracture toughness is a function of crack geometry and material properties of the cracked pipe. The significance of the derived model is that the well-established linear elastic fracture mechanics can be used for ductile materials in predicting the fracture failur...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} of a project in 1997 which rescued stony corals that would have {{otherwise}} been killed during underwater construction activities related to the north Dade County outfall <b>pipe</b> repairs. Significant <b>portions</b> of the crown of this outfall pipe had been exposed during Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and were slated to be covered again with ambient material, geofabric and armor matting in 1997. 271 reef-building stony corals (primarily Solenastrea bournoni and Siderastrea siderea) growing on the pipe were collected prior to repair work and subsequently transplanted back onto the concrete tiles of armor matting. Corals were typically transplanted to the upper 4 rows of cement tiles of the armor matting. One coral specimen was usually attached per tile, {{but in the case}} of the smallest corals, as many as three were placed on a tile. Equal portions of Portland type II cement and molding plaster was used for colony attachment. All corals were catalogued and macrophotographed with a scale for monitoring. There was a 97 % survival rate 3 months following transplantation. Survival rate after one year will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Linear elastic {{fracture}} mechanics {{has been widely}} employed for fracture analysis of cracked pipes. For ductile metal pipes, the existence of plasticity eases the stress concentration at the crack front, which increases the fracture toughness of the pipe. Therefore, when using linear elastic {{fracture mechanics}} to predict the fracture failure of ductile <b>pipes,</b> the plastic <b>portion</b> of the fracture toughness should be excluded. This paper intends to derive an analytical model of elastic fracture toughness for ductile metal pipes with circumferential external surface cracks under combined axial tension and bending. The derived elastic fracture toughness {{is a function of}} crack geometry, material properties and loading conditions of the cracked pipe. The significance of the derived model is that the well established linear elastic fracture mechanics can be used for ductile materials in predicting the fracture failure. It is found in the paper that, the elastic fracture toughness increases with the increase of the internal pressure of the pipe and that an increase in fracture toughness and yield strength of the pipe materials will result in a more ductile and brittle pipe failure respectively. The derived analytical model enables more accurate prediction of fracture failure of ductile metal pipes with circumferential external cracks...|$|R
50|$|The theorem of Torricelli was {{employed}} by many succeeding writers, but particularly by Edme Mariotte (1620-1684), whose Traité du mouvement des eaux, published {{after his death}} in the year 1686, is founded on a great variety of well-conducted experiments on the motion of fluids, performed at Versailles and Chantilly. In the discussion of some points he committed considerable mistakes. Others he treated very superficially, and in none of his experiments apparently did he attend to the diminution of efflux arising from the contraction of the liquid vein, when the orifice is merely a perforation in a thin plate; but he appears to have been the first who attempted to ascribe the discrepancy between theory and experiment to the retardation of the water's velocity through friction. His contemporary Domenico Guglielmini (1655-1710), who was inspector of the rivers and canals at Bologna, had ascribed this diminution of velocity in rivers to transverse motions arising from inequalities in their bottom. But as Mariotte observed similar obstructions even in glass pipes where no transverse currents could exist, the cause assigned by Guglielmini seemed destitute of foundation. The French philosopher, therefore, regarded these obstructions as the effects of friction. He supposed that the filaments of water which graze along the sides of the <b>pipe</b> lose a <b>portion</b> of their velocity; that the contiguous filaments, having on this account a greater velocity, rub upon the former, and suffer a diminution of their celerity; and that the other filaments are affected with similar retardations proportional to their distance from the axis of the pipe. In this way the medium velocity of the current may be diminished, and consequently the quantity of water discharged in a given time must, from the effects of friction, be considerably less than that which is computed from theory.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method has}} been developed to solve steady laminar flow through a tube with multiple constrictions and pulsatile flow through tubes with moving boundaries. The governing equations were formulated in body fitted curvilinear coordinates so that arbitrary domains and moving boundaries could be handled. A finite volume discretization procedure was used to solve the governing equations. Four practical flow problems were numerically simulated in this work. In the first case, tubes with one, two, three, four and seven constrictions were considered. For the second case, the flow through a tube with multiple constrictions was solved by considering a single module where the flow field {{was assumed to be}} periodic. By comparing the results of these two cases, the effects of the number of constrictions on wall shear stress, pressure drop, vorticity, streamlines and velocity distributions as the flow passed through the tube were studied and the development of periodicity characteristics was investigated. The computations were carried out for a range of Reynolds numbers between 50 and 250. The third case studied had a pulsatile flow at the inlet of a tube having a constriction which changed in shape periodically with time at a prescribed frequency. The fourth case also had a pulsatile flow at the inlet with a portion of the wall that changes shape periodically with time. In this case, however, the variation caused contraction of the <b>pipe</b> at one <b>portion</b> of the cycle and distention at another portion alternatively. The presence of moving boundaries in the above mentioned cases caused additional unsteadiness to occur in the flow. This unsteady behaviour in the flow was investigated over a range of frequencies.
