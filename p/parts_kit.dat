50|$|Switchblade knives {{continued}} to be sold and collected in those states in which possession remained legal. In the 1980s, automatic knife imports to the U.S. resumed {{with the concept of}} kit knives, allowing the user to assemble a working switchblade from a <b>parts</b> <b>kit</b> {{with the addition of a}} mainspring or other key part (often sold separately). Since no law prohibited importation of switchblade parts or unassembled kits, all risk of prosecution was assumed by the assembling purchaser, not the importer. This loophole was eventually closed by new federal regulations.|$|E

50|$|The {{rinderpest}} {{swept into}} Zululand in 1896 from the north, decimating cattle farming, {{and in the}} same year, the region experienced a bad drought, knocking agriculture. The Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) heralded in the new century and on the back of this, as the British had to maintain long lines of supply and communication, industrialization had come into its own, especially the prefabrication of <b>parts.</b> <b>Kit</b> wood-and-iron utility buildings, which were popular in the diamond rush to Kimberley and the gold rush to the Witwatersrand, came back into their own for military use. Church organisations also made use of this trend to fast track the building of churches in the colonies.|$|E
5000|$|All {{three members}} of Danny Wilson played a variety of {{instruments}} and had a good grounding in production skills, resulting in a degree of skill and practical independence which stood them in good stead for future development. The band would later summarise their approach as follows: [...] "Whoever has an idea can play it and well record it. However that means that its pretty impossible to document who played what on what track. Sometimes Ged might be playing an instrument (usually a rented ethnic one) and Kit would jump in for the middle eight." [...] Generally speaking, Gary Clark played most of the guitar and piano parts on album while Grimes played all of the bass <b>parts.</b> <b>Kit</b> Clark functioned as a multi-instrumental wild card (including accordion, guitar and found percussion) and provided unorthodox musical ideas. The band once summarised his contribution as [...] "if you hear something mental and think to yourself [...] "What the f**k was that?" [...] then its probably Kit." ...|$|E

Any of the available engines could be equipped at the dealer with Chrysler's Hyper Pak <b>parts</b> <b>kit</b> for a significant power upgrade: the 170 Hyper Pak's published output was , while the 225 Hyper Pak's was [...] The Hyper-Pak shaved more than four seconds off the 0 to 60 mi/h km/h time versus the standard 225, and was over a second quicker and seven miles per hour faster in the quarter mile. With the Hyper Pak, a 225 Lancer could go from 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in 8.6 seconds and turn in a standing quarter mile time of 16.4 seconds. 1962 cars had the engine and transmission moved for a flatter front floor.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>parts</b> <b>kits</b> were {{imported}} into the U.S. {{in the early}} 2000s with the receivers demilled incorrectly (they had been saw cut instead of torch cut). This prompted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives {{to send a letter}} in 2007 to distributors asking for the receiver pieces back which was then forwarded to many of the final purchasers. The letter only asked for the receiver pieces back, but as these had key parts welded onto them (such as the magazine well) it is likely some receiver pieces were returned with vital portions of the firearm still attached. <b>Parts</b> <b>kits</b> available on the secondary market have since risen in value and many of the ones that are available are incomplete.|$|R

50|$|With the {{cessation}} of WWI hostilities, Colt Arms Co. received the Browning patents to produce the BAR that had been withheld from issue during the war. This allowed Colt to make the BAR available for commercial sale, including sale to civilian owners. The Colt Automatic Machine Rifle Model 1919, initially made up of overruns from the M1918 military production contract, {{was the first of}} several commercial Colt BARs that would follow. However, the high price of the weapon and its limited utility for most civilian owners resulted in few sales. Ad Topperwien, a famous trick shooter of the early 1920s, purchased one of the first Colt-produced BARs to perform aerial target shooting exhibitions. Occasional BAR sales were made to civilian owners through distributors such as the Ott-Heiskell Hardware Co. In 1931, the new Colt Monitor was made available to civilians during the Depression at $300 each, including a spare <b>parts</b> <b>kit,</b> sling, cleaning accessories, and six magazines, but Colt records indicate no domestic sales to individuals. After passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, civilian BAR ownership was restricted even further. Importation of machine guns for U.S. civilian transfer was banned in 1968, and U.S. production of machine guns for civilian transfer was banned in 1986. However, some transferable civilian-owned BAR models exist in the United States, and occasionally come up for sale to qualified buyers. Some companies are manufacturing semi-automatic copies for sale to civilians. Ohio Ordnance Works, Inc, in Chardon, Ohio holds an exclusive patent for the 1918A3-SLR (Self-Loading Rifle), which is a contemporary semi-automatic variant of the M1918 and is legal for civilians to own.|$|E
40|$|Most office {{equipment}} is maintained by service organizations consisting of teams of service representatives. An important {{problem for the}} service organizations is {{the determination of the}} spare parts inventory to be carried by each service representative. This note presents a model for finding the spare <b>parts</b> <b>kit</b> that has the minimum inventory investment for a specified job completion criterion. The model is shown to be equivalent to a binary knapsack problem.

40|$|I {{built this}} little {{receiver}} to illustratean idea that I’ve been exploring for anumber of years. It replaces the narrow filters and inteference-fight-ing {{hardware and software}} of a conventional radio with a wide-open binaural I-Q detec-tor. If you liken a conventional receiver to a high-powered telescope, this receiver {{is a pair of}} bright, wide-field binoculars. The receiver’s classic junk-box-available-parts construction approach achieves better RF integrity than that of commercial ham gear. A PC board and <b>parts</b> <b>kit</b> is available for those who prefer to duplicate a proven design. 1 My goal was a project that could be con-structed in one weekend. With two working parents and three teenagers in the house, that “one weekend ” wound up being spread over a period of about two months! Nevertheless, the total construction time was only 17 hours. There are a number of toroids to wind, and performance was not compromised to sim-plify construction or reduce parts count...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} fully {{automated}} analysis of failure event {{data in the}} concept and early development stage of a semiconductor-manufacturing tool. In addition to presenting {{a wide range of}} statistical and machine-specific performance information, algorithms have been developed to examine reliability growth and to identify major contributors to unreliability. These capabilities are being implemented in a new software package called Reliadigm. When coupled with additional input regarding repair times and parts availability, the analysis software also provides spare parts inventory optimization based on genetic optimization methods. The type of question to be answered is: If this tool were placed with a customer for beta testing, what would be the optimal spares kit to meet equipment reliability goals for the lowest cost? The new algorithms are implemented in Windows{reg_sign} software and are easy to apply. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of failure event data from three IDEA machines currently in development. The paper also includes an optimal spare <b>parts</b> <b>kit</b> analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech has instituted several nontraditional on-campus {{laboratory}} courses {{during the}} last decade, including the two required circuits labs in the BSEE and BSCpE curricula 1. The labs utilize a set of equipment known as Lab-in-a-Box (LiaB), which consists of a digital multimeter and a USB-powered oscilloscope with arbitrary function generator {{as well as a}} powered breadboard and <b>parts</b> <b>kit.</b> The portable LiaB kit allows the students to perform the labs outside of the classroom. The experiments are designed to reinforce student learning of fundamental concepts and demonstrate complex theorems that are covered in a companion lecture course. The experiments are scheduled so that the students can effectively build upon their theoretical knowledge of circuit analysis, circuit simulation, measurement techniques, and data interpretation as the semester progresses. In addition, the LiaB experiments require the students to perform statistical analysis, program in MATLAB, interpret datasheets, learn/apply debugging techniques, and work on open-ended design projects...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} of Kit-Build Concept Map (we call it as KB map) where a concept map made by a learner can be diagnosed automatically. In this research, we have divided the task to make a concept map into two sub-tasks: (1) “segmentation task” where parts of the concept map (nodes and links) are extracted from learning resources and (2) “structuring task” where the extracted parts are integrated into a map. In the framework of kit-build concept map, a learner is given a set of parts of a concept map and then re-builds the concept map by combining the given parts. In this process, the segmentation task becomes a task of recognition of the given parts and the structuring task remains as it is. The concept map should be prepared beforehand by a teacher or domain expert. We call this map “goal map.” The necessary and sufficient <b>parts</b> (<b>kit)</b> are generated by decomposing the goal map. The parts are provided to learners, and then the learners are required to build concept maps (learner maps) by connecting the parts. Since the same parts are used both in the goal map and a learner map, {{it is possible to}} find defects in the learner map as the differences from the goal map. By overlaying several learners’ maps, then, a group map can be generated. By comparing the group map with the goal map, differences between the goal map and the group of the learners are detected. We have also realized procedure to re-examine the goal map based on the differences between the group map and the goal map. We have already developed a system that realized the framework of the KB map. Through a preliminary use of the system, we have confirmed that the system works along with the framework of KB map. Evaluation of learning effect is our future work.|$|E
