50|$|After the German reunification {{the museum}} would {{continue}} to exist with the financial support of the municipality Wandlitz and a newly founded booster club. In 1990 the state Brandenburg changed the museum’s name to “Agrarmuseum Wandlitz” (Agricultural Museum Wandlitz). Throughout the following years its collection has become the biggest, historic agricultural collection in Brandenburg. Until spring 2013 the total exhibition space was about 21,571 square foot (2000m²) large. One of the most noticeable exhibits is the historic “Dampfpflug” (a <b>plough</b> <b>working</b> with a steam engine), which was situated outside the museum under a separate roof. Many functional tractors and other agricultural machinery from different eras {{can be seen at}} the museum. In other areas of the exhibition, traditional craft and the historic rural household are portrayed. The exhibits of the “Heimatstube” give special insight into the history of the village and its residents.|$|E
50|$|An {{aerial view}} of Pettaugh shows a few houses {{surrounded}} {{on all sides}} by a patchwork of farm fields. Years ago the fields may have been smaller, with lots more hedges, but farm fields surrounding the village is probably the way it's been {{for a very long}} time.The village sign reflects this—it features a farmer with his horse-drawn <b>plough,</b> <b>working</b> the farmland around Pettaugh, an Anvil, indicating the existence of a blacksmith in the village, essential to farming in the days of horse-drawn ploughs, and the wind mill which stood at the centre of the village. Thus are the main occupations of Pettaugh residents of 'yesteryear' represented—farming, smithing and milling the grain, mostly working very close to home. Today, residents of Pettaugh commute to nearby towns to work—to Debenham, Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds—even by train to London; very few earn a living in or near to the village. Even the children catch buses or are driven by parents to schools in Stonham Aspal, Debenham, Helmingham, etc. Occupations may have changed but Pettaugh thrives, at the heart of beautiful Suffolk countryside.|$|E

The matrix mathematical simulator of productivity of drainage machines at the diverse characteristics of drainage {{network in the}} discrete mode of operation as the matrix of unit impulse functions of productivity has been offered. The formula to determine the productivity of drainage machines as the unit impulse function in the discrete mode, the amplitude and phase spectra of working speeds and productivity of machine have been determined. The definition manner of drain grade during the operation of drainage machines by means of reflected beams, the technical facilities as the laser reflectors have been developed. The specific energy consumption, the specific metal consumption, the labour expenditures have been decreased. The life-saving operation of drainage machines with the application of laser reflectors has been introduced at the installations of Tverinzhselstroi, of Land-Reclamation Construction-and-Mounting Organization (Radvilishkis, Lithuania).

25|$|Despite the {{multitude}} of slaves, hired labour was often needed, especially at harvest. This {{was a matter of}} contract, and the employer, who usually paid in advance, might demand a collateral against fulfillment of the work. Cattle were hired for <b>ploughing,</b> <b>working</b> the watering machines, carting, threshing, etc. The Code fixed a statutory wage for sowers, ox-drivers, field-labourers, and hire for oxen, asses, etc.|$|R
40|$|The Domesday Survey {{provides}} {{the first comprehensive}} national survey of any economy. The availability of two complementary data sources allows a direct estimate of Tenant-in-Chief’s lands from the Survey. By providing a means to identifying the extent of arable activity outside the demesne, {{as well as the}} extent that <b>ploughs</b> <b>working</b> on the lords estates were active in the peasant economy, we provide a transparent method of estimating the extent of non-seigniorial production. After incorporating a series of other elements valued in the Survey, and adding these to the seigniorial and non-seigniorial agricultural production estimates, we derive an estimate for the income of Domesday England in 1086. The findings are consistent with an important interpretation of the Domesday text proposed by Bridbury that is further developed conceptually. Furthermore, a ‘full capacity’ 1086 estimate, determined under differing assumptions concerning population, price, and climatic conditions, is compared against recent estimates for the earliest benchmark period circa 1300.

40|$|This Ph. D. {{thesis is}} focused on tensile forces {{measurement}} process of modern tillage machines for bigger working width. There is a limited amount of measuring devices for tensile forces higher than 100 kN. To eliminate tensile rod disadvantages (need of use of two tractors is complicated for measuring operation during the headlands turns) the new measuring frame was developed to measure the tensile forces. To characterize the physical attributes of the soil, before the new developed measurement, the samples of unbroken soil where taken (Kopecky cylinders. The penetration resistance of soil was measured in a horizontal and vertical profile by use of penetrometer. The measuring made on specific lands proven the new developed measuring device {{to be able to}} measure the tensile force up to 200 kN and more. The practical use of the measuring device was comparable to the measuring by a tensile rod during the measuring process. The considerable influence of the soil moisture was proven by the penetration measurements of the soil. The vertical and horizontal penetrometer measurements showed a similarity of the measuring method. The horizontal penetrometer might be a useful measuring method for a quick analysis of soil physical character considering accurate soil moisture measuring. Accurate instant soil moisture measuring and precise measurement of chisel <b>plough</b> <b>working</b> depth is a current theme for a future research...|$|E
50|$|Convicts {{worked from}} sunrise to sunset. Agricultural {{work was done}} with hoes and spades, and no <b>ploughs</b> or <b>working</b> cattle were used. Convict {{accommodation}} was cramped and unsanitary and this, combined with their poor diet of one meal every 48 hours, resulted in poor health and many deaths. The harshness and degradation of the treatment metered out to the convicts was intended to break them. Floggings were common, even for trivial offences, and sentences could be extended.|$|R
25|$|The metayer {{system was}} common, {{especially}} on temple lands. The landlord found land, labour, oxen for <b>ploughing</b> and <b>working</b> the watering machines, carting, threshing or other implements, grain seed, rations for the workmen and fodder for the cattle. The tenant, or steward, usually had other land of his own. If he stole the seed, rations or fodder, the Code stipulated that his fingers be cut off. If he appropriated or sold the implements, or impoverished or sublet the cattle, he was heavily fined and in default of payment, might be condemned {{to be torn}} to pieces by the cattle on the field. Rent was determined by contract.|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{resistance of the}} plough body (a quotient of its working resistance and furrow cross section) depends on three factors: soil conditions, <b>working</b> speed and <b>plough</b> body shape. The last dependence has not been previously defined ana-lytically. A novel method is being presented in this publication, which allows us to define and calculate the parameters of a plough body influencing its {{specific resistance}}, {{as well as the}} relationship between these parameters and specific resistance of different plough bodies. The proposed equation includes also soil conditions and working speed. The calculated parame-ters are based on the dimensions taken from drawing of a <b>plough</b> body <b>working</b> surface through the soil. The knowledge of such a relationship should be very useful in the design of new plough bodies and improvement of existing ones. The depend-ence between defined parameters and specific resistance has been calculated with statistical methods on the basis of field-and laboratory investigations of plough bodies with different working surface shapes. The scope of this investigation covers the cylindroidal, semihelicoidal and helicoidal <b>plough</b> bodies, their <b>working</b> speeds in the range of 0. 81 – 2. 5 m/s, and soil compactness measured with a cone penetrometer in the range of 1. 35 – 1. 93 MPa (in field investigations). The introduced relationship has been verified for another 10 ploughs during field investigations, conducted in different soil conditions, at different working speeds...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} a {{numerical}} simulation {{of the interaction}} between soil and plough mouldboard has been performed by utilising "finite volumes" numerical approach. Simulation has been carried out by utilising a 3 D-free-surface model as well as a medium soil with constitutive relationship of no- Newtonian pseudo-plastic material. As a matter of fact that "virtual" material could properly simulate either the effects of the adhesive and internal friction of the examined soil (sandy soil). Full field tests have been performed to actually validate the aforementioned experimental model. Piezo-resistive transducers have been used to detect the pressure values on 14 points located on <b>plough</b> mouldboard <b>working</b> surface. Besides, obtained pressure distribution deriving by spatial interpolation on working surface has been compared with numerical simulation data results. The maximum error detected while comparing numerical results and experimental data set has been less than 10...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} a methodology that allowed {{to optimize the}} working surface of a mouldboard plough was performed. The purpose was to obtain a working surface that during the soil workmanship requires the minimum values of draught force and of input energy costs. For this, it has been necessary to perform {{the study of the}} interaction soil-plough by a numerical simulation with the mathematical model of a plough mouldboard. To perform the validation of the used mathematical model, the <b>plough</b> mouldboard <b>working</b> surface was sensitized with pressure transducers to evaluate the pressure distribution during the soil workmanship and then the pressure distribution values evaluated on the working surface with the numerical simulations and those experimentally detected in full field were compared. This allowed to determine the mathematical model of the considered soil. Successively by geometry changes of the working surface considered and performing some numerical simulations, it was numerically determined a working surface that required the smaller values of energy expense and draught force. Such surface was realized and tested in full field noticing a 20 % reduction of the draught force necessary, in comparison to a not optimized plough. Further it was noticed that the productive agronomic results were the same for both soil parts ploughed with optimized and not optimized ploug...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to compare and unveil efficiency of electro-hydraulic control (EHR) system to mechanical three point hitch regulation in mouldboard <b>ploughing.</b> Increase of <b>working</b> velocity and three point hitch automatic regulation activity decreased depth of ploughing at both regulation systems but electro-hydraulic system done it more accurately since deviation from default value was 10 % less than at mechanical regulation system. Electro-hydraulic three point hitch control system decreased wheel slip up to 30 % in comparison to mechanical regulation system. Net energy requirement at mechanical three point hitch regulation system spent 3 % more energy than electro-hydraulic control system. If wheel slip reduction influenced by electro-hydraulic control system would be added one could account on greater energy savings than previously mentioned value. The greatest working rates were achieved at the greatest working velocity (8, 0 km h- 1), while exactly at that velocity the greatest working rate increase of 3, 8 % influenced by electro-hydraulic three point hitch control was noticed...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a reversible animal-drawn plough and a ridger is presented. The plough was developed {{on the basis of}} laboratory experiments reported earlier to determine optimum parameters for acurved implement. The basic design principles of conventional mouldboard ploughs and an ard were taken into consideration. A safety mechanism was developed which was a shear bolt. Apart from the share point, all components of the plough were made from wood, and the total mass was about 10 kg. The orientational parameters of the developed implement such as the tail angle, rake angle and the side-rake angle can be varied to suit the required soil operations and the pulling capability of the draught animals. The developed plough can also be used as a ridger by mounting an extra wing on the plough. Comparative field experiments were conducted in cooperation with the International Livestock Research Institute. ILRI, using the developed and traditional ard-type plough in Ethiopia. Tests were carried out in fields under various soil conditions using oxen and cows. The results showed that the draught required by the developed plough was about 30 percent less than the draught of the traditional Ethiopian ard. A frequency analysis was made to determine the dominant frequencies of the reversible <b>plough</b> under <b>working</b> conditions. The identified frequencies were 0. 5, 1. 3 and 3. 3 Hz. Preliminary assessments were made to compare the performances of a pair of cows with a pair of oxen in relation to speed and forces when pulling the developed plough. A pair of cows moved faster (an average of 0. 84 m/s) than the pair of oxen (an average of 0. 63 m/s) and exerted proportionally greater pulling forces when operating in the same field. The difference in speed is explained by the greater body weight of the cows and the correspondingly greater pull that could be exerted...|$|R
50|$|The {{major part}} of the village is paddy fields and farm lands. Main {{plantations}} include rice, coconut, areca nut, banana, pepper, mango and vegetables. Once the rice harvest is done the paddy fields are given to school going youths and home makers to cultivate fast growing vegetables like lady finger, (okra), drum stick, bitter melon, and peas. This is to impart the culture of farming to the new generation. A part of the fields will become play grounds for young men. Most of the time agri-products are taken to far away Kozhikode city for selling. Men with a white turban and a white lungi carrying agri tools are still a common scene here in this village. People used to make coconut oil at their home for own use. Dairy farming is one of the important among the agribusiness here. Even though not on a large scale, most of the farmers own few number of cows and they make a small living out of this. There is no Krishi Bhavan or a fertilizer depot in the village. Large sections of people lead their life as farm workers by <b>ploughing,</b> harvesting and <b>working</b> in the fields.|$|R
