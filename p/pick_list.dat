40|$|Background Routinely {{collected}} {{general practice}} computer data {{are used for}} quality improvement; poor data quality including inconsistent coding can reduce their usefulness. Objective To document the diversity of data entry systems currently in use in UK general practice and highlight possible implications for data quality. Method General practice volunteers provided screen shots of the clinical coding screen they would use to code a diagnosis or problem title in the clinical consultation. The six clinical conditions examined were: depression, cystitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sore throat, tired all the time, and myocardial infarction. We looked at the <b>picking</b> <b>lists</b> generated for these problem titles in EMIS, IPS, GPASS and iSOFT general practice clinical computer systems, using the Triset browser as a gold standard for comparison. Results A mean of 19. 3 codes is offered in the <b>picking</b> <b>list</b> after entering a diagnosis or problem title. EMIS produced the longest <b>picking</b> <b>lists</b> and GPASS the shortest, with a mean number of choices of 35. 2 and 12. 7, respectively. Approximately three-quarters (73. 5 %) of codes are diagnoses, one-eighth (12. 5 %) symptom codes, and the remainder come {{from a range of}} Read chapters. There was no readily detectable consistent order in which codes were displayed. Velocity coding, whereby commonly-used codes are placed higher in the <b>picking</b> <b>list,</b> results in variation between practices even where they have the same brand of computer system. Conclusions Current systems for clinical coding promote diversity rather than consistency of clinical coding. As the UK moves towards an integrated health IT system consistency of coding will become more important. A standardised, limited list of codes for primary care might help address this need...|$|R
50|$|After {{being drafted}} by the Atlanta Falcons in 1978, Pridemore saw his first start in the third game of his rookie year and never looked back. Pridemore was Atlanta's {{starting}} free safety for the next eight years, and earned the {{reputation as one of}} the meanest, hardest-hitting safeties in the game. With 21 career interceptions (returned for 368 total yards), Pridemore ranks sixth on Atlanta's all-time <b>pick</b> <b>list</b> behind Deion Sanders. He ranks fourth on the all-time list for most interceptions in a season at 7, and holds the Falcon's club record for most interception return yards in a single season (271). In 1981 Pridemore picked off a Joe Montana pass from a yard deep in Atlanta's own end-zone and returned it 101 yards for a touchdown, which is a team record. This duplication of Pridemore's previous college and NCAA record will probably also stand for quite some time, if not forever in Atlanta. While playing for the Falcons, Pridemore served one term in the West Virginia House of Delegates, between 1980 and 1982 as a Democrat. He is the only NFL player to hold this legislative office while playing professional football.|$|E

30|$|When {{considering}} e-commerce supply chains, the warehousing {{and delivery}} operations {{need to be}} optimised. After (e-commerce) orders are picked in a warehouse, the goods need to be delivered to the preferred delivery location of the customer. Accordingly, order picking and distribution are interrelated. Disruptions in the order picking operations will impact the deliveries. Extensive research {{has already been done}} on the optimization of warehouse operations [8]. However, to obtain more efficient schedules, the order picking and delivery decisions need to be taken at the same time. Such an integrated planning approach leads lower operational costs and/or faster deliveries in comparison with solving both problems separately and sequentially [9]. In the integrated order picking-vehicle routing problem(I-OP-VRP), <b>picking</b> <b>lists</b> and vehicle routes are determined simultaneously. Requirements and constraints of both the order picking problem and the vehicle routing problem are considered at the same time. For example, delivery time windows are taken into account when <b>picking</b> <b>lists</b> are established.|$|R

40|$|Order picking {{has long}} been {{identified}} as the most labour-intensive and costly activity for almost every warehouse; the cost of order picking {{is estimated to be}} as much as 50 % of the total warehouse operating expense. Any underperformance in order picking can lead to unsatisfactory service and high operational cost for its warehouse, and consequently for the whole supply chain. In order to operate efficiently, the order picking process needs to be robustly designed and optimally controlled. This thesis focus on routing policies. The objective of routing policies is to sequence the items on the <b>pick</b> <b>list</b> to ensure a good route through the warehouse. These policies could include simple heuristics or optimal procedures. Developed order picking system supports heuristics and enables to create individual picking routes.

40|$|The {{cost and}} service {{performance}} of an order fulfillment center are determined partly by how workers are organized into an order picking system. One common approach is batch picking, in which workers circumnavigate a picking area with other workers, gathering {{items on a}} <b>pick</b> <b>list.</b> In some systems with high space utilization, narrow aisles prohibit workers from passing one another when in the same aisle, and this leads to congestion.

40|$|Background: A {{key element}} of the {{evaluation}} of warehouse operation is the average order-picking time. In warehouses where the order-picking process is carried out according to the "picker-to-part" rule the order-picking time is usually proportional to the distance covered by the picker while picking items. This distance can by estimated by simulations or using mathematical equations. In the paper only the best described in the literature one-block rectangular warehouses are considered. 	Material and methods: For the one-block rectangular warehouses there are well known five routing heuristics. In the paper the author considers the return heuristic in two variants. The paper presents well known Hall&# 39;s and De Koster&# 39;s equations for the average distance traveled by the picker while completing items from one <b>pick</b> <b>list.</b> The author presents own proposals for calculating the expected distance.

30|$|This {{category}} {{is among the}} highlighted aspects in the literature but only {{a small group of}} practitioners mentioned any related concern. One reason can be the possibility of different perspectives on warehouse problems. According to one of the interviewees, if storage and picking are not done efficiently, the problem might be perceived as a space problem. Various picking methods, e.g., single order picking, batch picking and zone picking, are suggested in the literature, but their performance for different warehouse designs is a matter of debate. In addition to traditional evaluation of picking performance in terms of travel/picking time, other criteria need to be investigated such as lead time, earliness and tardiness, which are important factors specifically when the warehouse is feeding a JIT system. Warehouse aisles are not usually very wide to let multiple pickers work together without interference. So, in case of planning picking operations for multiple pickers, one objective can be to minimize the congestion. One of the research streams in this {{category is}} to develop mathematical models for optimal picking path. The benefits of using optimized picking path for each <b>pick</b> <b>list,</b> versus having a generic route, can be investigated to understand when it is suitable to choose either of these two approaches. Considering the picking operations, one important task is to plan the sorting process, which is when items of different wave picks are traveling on conveyors and need to be sorted when coming to the accumulation point, so goods of each order list need to be sent to the assigned lane. Two decision problems should be investigated more: order of releasing picking waves and order-lane assignment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Medication errors, adverse drug {{events and}} {{potential}} adverse drug events are common and serious {{in terms of}} the harms and costs that they impose on the health system and those who use it. Errors resulting in preventable adverse drug events have been shown to occur most often at the stages of ordering and administration. This paper describes the protocol for a pragmatic trial of electronic prescribing to reduce prescription error. The trial was designed to overcome the limitations associated with traditional study design. Design This study was designed as a 65 -week, cluster randomized, parallel study. Methods The trial was conducted within ambulatory outpatient clinics in an academic tertiary care centre in Ontario, Canada. The electronic prescribing software for the study is a Canadian electronic prescribing software package which provides physician prescription entry with decision support at the point of care. Using a handheld computer (PDA) the physician selects medications using an error minimising menu-based <b>pick</b> <b>list</b> from a comprehensive drug database, create specific prescription instructions and then transmit the prescription directly and electronically to a participating pharmacy via facsimile or to the physician's printer using local area wireless technology. The unit of allocation and randomization is by 'week', i. e. the system is "on" or "off" according to the randomization scheme and the unit of analysis is the prescription, with adjustment for clustering of patients within practitioners.

Each PMS used a single data field with a <b>pick</b> <b>list</b> that combined ethnicity and race. Race/ethnicity on registration forms completed by patients was abstracted from medical charts. Race/ethnicity classifications were aggregated into seven major categories: Asian/Pacific Islander, Black/African-American, Native American, White, Hispanic/Latino, Other, Missing/Unknown. Outcome Measures: The sensitivity, positive predictive value, and proportion of agreement were outcome measures of agreement between information in the medical chart and PMS. Results: The overall proportion of agreement (PA) between the medical chart (reference) and PMS was 87 %. The PA varied significantly by health center (95 %â 74 %). Hispanic/Latino had the highest sensitivity (91 %) and positive predictive value (95 %) and White the lowest (84 % and 80 %, respectively). Conclusions: In broad categories, correspondence of race/ethnicity classifications in medical charts and PMS was good, although health centers varied.
