The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate <b>pastime.</b> According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games in the Greek manner.|$|E

5|$|Rowing {{is popular}} on the River Weaver, with {{competitive}} clubs in Runcorn, Northwich, and Acton Bridge (The Grange School). Fishing is another <b>pastime</b> {{which takes place}} along the river. Several clubs lease fishing rights for {{different parts of the}} river from British Waterways, as it holds populations of bream, three types of carp, chub, dace, eels, perch, pike, roach, rudd and tench.

5|$|After {{moving from}} Perthshire to Birmingham {{to set up}} {{business}} as a draper, McGregor became involved with local football club Aston Villa, which he helped to establish {{as one of the}} leading teams in England. He served the club for over 20 years in various capacities, including president, director and chairman. In 1888, frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa's matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England's leading clubs, which {{led to the formation of}} the Football League, giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season. This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur <b>pastime</b> to a professional business.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and <b>pastime</b> in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{mainland}} European countries to play association football. Its practice in Belgium began on 26 October 1863, after an Irish student walked into the Josephites College of Melle with a leather ball.

On 1 September 1895, ten clubs for football, athletics, cricket and cycling founded the Belgian sports board Union Belge des Sociétés de Sports Athlétiques (UBSSA); a year later UBSSA organised the first annual league in Belgian football.|$|E

5000|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} of such <b>pastimes</b> appears in the 1878 book, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which Robert Brough Smyth relates that William Thomas, a Protector of Aborigines in Victoria, had witnessed Wurundjeri Aborigines east of Melbourne playing a [...] "foot ball" [...] game in 1841. The account appears to fit the general description of the traditional game of Marn Grook. This {{appears to be the}} earliest record of Europeans observing such <b>pastimes.</b> William Blandowski's 1857 sketch of indigenous Australians in Merbein clearly depicts children playing a form of [...] "foot ball". Further research has established that this may have been a separate game (possibly Woggabaliri). Written record of such traditional <b>pastimes</b> is otherwise scant and as there is no known record of these <b>pastimes</b> in traditional Indigenous Australian art {{it is not possible to}} trace its history further.|$|R
5|$|Camping is {{a popular}} <b>pastime</b> at Colton Point State Park; 1,989persons have used the camping {{facilities}} in 2003.

5|$|In {{his years}} as the Bengals' head coach, Brown took the team to the playoffs three times, {{including}} in 1970. Yet despite finding a franchise quarterback in Ken Anderson, Brown's team never got past {{the first round of}} the postseason tournament. Four days after the Bengals were eliminated from the playoffs in 1975, Brown announced he was retiring after 45 years of coaching. The game had changed dramatically during his time in the NFL, growing from America's second sport to the country's biggest and most lucrative <b>pastime.</b> Brown was 67 years old.|$|E
