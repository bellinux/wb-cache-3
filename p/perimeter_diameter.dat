40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the probable mechanism of the volume increase of laparoscopically harvested omentum flaps used to treat breast deformities. METHODS: A histological analysis of omentum samples was performed to study the volume increase of laparoscopically harvested omentum flaps. Samples were harvested immediately after the transposition of the omentum from the abdominal cavity to the breast region and during the second surgical procedure for breast symmetrization of eight patients submitted to the transposition of the omentum flap. Changes in the morphometric measurements of the adipocytes (<b>perimeter,</b> <b>diameter,</b> and area), microvascular density (as measured by the CD 31 endothelial marker), and immunohistochemical expression of VEGF were documented. RESULTS: The increases in adipocyte size and microvascular density were statistically significant (P # 0. 012). The expression levels of VEGF were lower in the second set of samples when compared to the first set, but the differences were not statistically significant (P, 0. 093). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate an increase in cellular volume as measured by adipocyte <b>perimeter,</b> <b>diameter,</b> and area. Moreover, the increase in the number of vessels in the second set of samples suggests that neoangiogenesis was stimulated by the initial increase in VEGF expression levels observed in the first set of samples. The increase in VEGF expression in the flap may have been caused by adipocyte hypertrophy resulting from neoangiogenesis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractX-ray tomography, mercury {{intrusion}} porosimetry, and gas adsorption {{are used to}} characterize the nano-scale pore structure of geopolymers with little success. This is because X-ray tomography still lacks high resolution for nanometer-sized pores and the other techniques use the incorrect assumptions of regular pore geometry and interconnected pore systems. To reveal the three-dimensional structure of nanometer-sized pores in coal ash-based geopolymer, conventional bright field electron tomography is {{used in this study}} for the first time. Because artifacts resulting from diffraction effects of newly-formed zeolite-like phases are introduced only in the matrix surrounding the pores, the pore size distribution has been investigated successfully. Most of the pores had irregular geometry and were found to range from 20 to 60 nm in equivalent <b>perimeter</b> <b>diameter.</b> The porosity was determined to be 7. 15 % for the volume of interest, 0. 00748 μm 3.

An experimental exposure of sea bass to commercial PCB mixtures {{has been designed to}} understand underlying toxicity mechanisms and effects on the thyroid system. After 120 days of exposure histological appearance of thyroid tissue was assessed by light and electron microscopy. The follicle area, <b>perimeter,</b> <b>diameter,</b> length and with of every follicle cross section were interactively measured. The shape of the follicles was described with three dimensionless shape descriptors: roundness, form factor and aspect ratio. The histomorphometrical analysis showed a greater heterogeneity of thyroid follicle diameter and especially higher epithelial cell heights in sea bass exposed to environmental relevant doses of PCB (from 0. 3 to 0. 9 μg g- 1 [7 ICES PCB]). Ultrastructural histological investigations showed that the epithelial cells surrounding the bigger follicles present an higher accumulation of colloid droplets.

40|$|The {{presence}} and topographical localization of the serotoninergic {{system in the}} brain of the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) have been studied by means of peroxidase-anti-peroxidase immunocytochemistry. The <b>perimeter,</b> <b>diameter,</b> area, and shape factor of immunoreactive cells have been recorded and analyzed morphometrically for intra- and interspecies comparison. The data reported here confirm and extend results previously obtained in the brain of other avian species. Serotonin-immunoreactive neurons of the quail are mainly located in the hypothalamic paraventricular organ and adjacent areas, and in the brainstem where they form three separate groups. The first of these groups consists of small-sized neurons located in the ventro-rostral mesencephalon. The second group is composed of medium-sized neurons located in the dorsal mesencephalo-pontine region. The third group is also formed by medium-sized neurons, and is located ventrally in the ponto-medullary region. In the quail brain, serotoninergic neurons are not restricted to nuclei located {{in the vicinity of}} the midsagittal plane, but show some lateralization, especially in the brainstem. The organization of the different groups of immunoreactive neurons based on this topographical distribution and morphometric analysis has been compared with descriptions of the serotoninergic system in other birds. Serotonin-immunoreactive nerve fibers are widely distributed throughout the brain, but appear to be particularly abundant in regions involved in the control of reproductive activities, such as the septal region, the medial preoptic nucleus, the nucleus intercollicularis, and the external zone of the median eminence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the characteristics of lymphatic vasculature in normal and (peri) tumoral prostate tissue, applying accurate and objective quantification techniques based on digital image analysis. METHODS: Radical prostatectomy specimens of 27 patients were selected containing organ confined peripheral zone tumors, which were restricted to one side of the prostate (pT 2 a). Lymph vessels were visualized by immunohistochemistry against D 2 - 40. Lymphatic vessel density, perimeter, and area were assessed over the entire tumor and corresponding contralateral normal tissue. Also, morphology (area, <b>perimeter,</b> and <b>diameter)</b> of individual lymph vessels were measured in (peri) tumoral and normal tissue. RESULTS: No differences were found in the overall lymph vasculature between tumor and normal peripheral zone. However, the area, <b>perimeter,</b> and <b>diameter</b> of individual lymph vessel profiles were significantly decreased in (peri) tumoral as compared to normal tissue. No differences were seen for these parameters between peritumoral and tumoral area. Comparing the coefficient of variation between compartments (normal, (peri) tumoral), no differences were observed for any parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Although differences exist between the morphology of individual lymph vessels in tumor versus normal tissue, the overall vascular bed (number and summed area and perimeter of lymphatics per area unit tissue) is unaffected in tumor.

40|$|Fluctuating {{asymmetry}} (FA) {{is assumed}} to reflect the developmental instability caused by environmental or genetic stress. Fish otoliths represent a very good tool for investigating the consequence of different effects on FA. Otolith FA analysis, coupled with genetic analysis, has been undertaken on two common West African estuarine species, Ethmalosa fimbriata (EFI) and Sarotherodon melanotheron (SME), in two neighbouring estuaries, in order to highlight the impact of salinity on developmental stability. The Gambia estuary has a normal functioning and the Saloum estuary is inverse (saltier waters in the upper river), reaching extremely high salinities (> 100 psu) and constituting severe environmental stress. Five sub-populations of EFI and six of SME were studied along a salinity gradient. The differences between right and left otoliths were estimated with image processing by measuring five dimensions (area, <b>perimeter,</b> <b>diameter,</b> rostrum and posterior radii). Analyses of genetic differentiation at three EPIC and one anonymous nuclear gene loci for EFI and six polymorphic enzymatic loci for SME were carried out to measure the level of heterozygosity. Absolute FA in all otolith traits examined was unaffected by gender but increased significantly with fish size. Size-corrected absolute FA did not show any significant difference among sites differing largely in salinity, although a higher asymmetry in otolith area was recorded in the saltiest site. These findings suggest that otolith asymmetry is a poor indicator of osmotic stress. The individual heterozygosity level {{did not seem to}} have an effect on otolith FA for either species, even though a slight correlation appeared with otolith area or perimeter. Otolith FA cannot be considered to be a useful indicator for estimating changes linked with environmental or genetic stress in these estuaries...|$|E

Inequalities for Perimeter Let P denote the perimeter of the lattice polygon. Proposition 1. 1 (P unbounded). Forany positive integer, g, there are convex lattice polygons with g interior lattice points and arbitrarily large perimeter. Proof. Consider the lattice triangle OAB where O =(0, 0), A =(2 g+ 2, 0), and B =(0, 2). Applying a shear of magnitude k, leaving the x-axis fixed, namely, x ′ = x + ky y ′ = y where k ∈ Z, wefind that O and A remain fixed, and B moves to (2 k, 2). This triangle has g interior lattice points and has a perimeter larger than OB = √ 4 k 2 + 4. But we can make √ 4 k 2 + 4 arbitrarily large by making k arbitrarily large. Thus, P is unbounded. Two polygons are said to be lattice congruent if they are congruent and each is a lattice polygon. The author investigated by computer the relationship between P and g for all convex lattice polygons with D ≤ 10 and g ≤ 10. In each case, the minimum value of P was found, which was always less than 14. For details of the computer search, see [4]...|$|E
