50|$|In the {{production}} process, {{a solution of}} Saran dissolved in an organic solvent and containing {{a small amount of}} a diazo compound was coated onto a substrate of Mylar. The film was then run through a drying oven to drive off the solvents. The film at this point was clear with a yellow cast from the diazo. In a second process called “cycling,” it was run through a tank of very hot water which created a fog of small holes in the Saran layer. This very greatly increased the photographic speed (light sensitivity) of the film. Several different formulations were in commercial use designed to optimize different <b>photographic</b> <b>parameters</b> for various customers.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the Skylab environments on the 22 types of film used for data {{recording}} on Skylab were evaluated. Environmental histories and sensitometric curves for 114 rolls of film used for this evaluation are presented. <b>Photographic</b> <b>parameters</b> evaluated in detail were film fogging {{of black and white}} films, changes in maximum density of color film, latent image fading, and changes in film sensitivity. Other photographic and film physical anomalies such as electrostatic exposure, emulsion cracking, and reciprocity failure were also documented. Results based upon comparison of film sensitometric data for flight film with ground control film and ground test film are presented independently for each film type. The study showed that photographic film fulfilled the requirements of the Skylab applications in which it was used. Environmental film degradation, although present on almost every roll, did not preclude recording sufficient data to meet experiment requirements for all film, except film type SC- 5. Specific conclusions are provided in the areas of further analyses, tests, and developments...|$|R
40|$|The {{superimposition}} {{of a face}} photograph {{with that}} of a skull for identification purposes necessitates the use of comparable <b>photographic</b> <b>parameters</b> between the two image acquisition sessions, so that differences in optics and consequent recording of images does not thwart the morphological analysis. Widely divergent, but published, speculations about the thresholds at which perspective distortion becomes negligible (0. 5 to > 13. 5 m) must be resolved and perspective distortion (PD) relationships quantified across their full range to judge tolerance levels, and the suitability of commonly employed contemporary equipment (e. g., 1 m photographic copy-stands). Herein, basic trigonometry is employed to map PD for two same sized 179 mm linear lengths - separated anteroposteriorly by 127 mm - as a function of subject-to-camera distance (SCD; 0. 2 - 20 m). These lengths approximate basic craniofacial heights (e. g., tr-n) and widths (e. g., zy-zy), while the latter approximates facial depth (e. g., n-t). As anticipated, PD decayed in logarithmic and continuous manner with increasing SCD. At SCD of 12 m, the within-image PD was negligible...|$|R

Several <b>parameters</b> were considered, including the feed composition {{and the inner}} cylinder rotation rate. For certain feed compositions and sufficiently large rotation rates a translating banded structure, which consisted of alternating aqueous and organic-rich vortices, persisted indefinitely. At lower rotation rates, either a spatially homogeneous emulsion evolved or sustained oscillations between the banded and homogeneous structures developed...|$|R
40|$|Throw Like A Girl: The Tomboy Project is {{the result}} of a {{practice}} led research project 2011 - 2013, investigating the concept of ‘the tomboy’ beyond the childhood stage, with the object of increasing visibility of the post- childhood tomboy in contemporary art photography. This body of work –eleven large-scale photographs and text-based works – responds to both the actual experience of the tomboy during adolescence and through differing stages of adulthood, whilst mapping the landscape of the metaphorical and poetic associations of this aspect of the female experience. My research into historical and contemporary delineations of the tomboy through the filter of western literature, popular culture and photography, seeks to contribute toward the reconfiguration of cultural conceptions of the archetypal tomboy; idealised during childhood, marginalised during adolescence, and disappearing in adulthood. In redressing the low visibility of the tomboy beyond childhood I am drawing on a rich and largely ignored history that seeks representation. To make the work I enlisted willing participants who identified themselves as tomboys, either currently or in the past [...] It was paramount to my project that all participants self-identify. The project includes audio tape recordings with those who proffered stories about themselves in relation to their ‘tomboynesss’. <b>Photographic</b> <b>parameters</b> I set myself where placed to avoid the possibility of stereotyping. Drawing on photographic works of Roni Horn and Bernd and Hilla Becher, among others, I employed repetition in style, light, and composition. The minimal parameters of sameness paradoxically allow for difference. A tomboy fits both a mood and type that looks more at gender than sexuality, as opposed to images of androgyny (e. g. Marlene Dietrich, David Bowie, Grace Jones) that convey sexualised interpretations of gender. Both androgyny and the tomboy are open to exploitation via fashion (because fashion constructs and exploits an image); my project, however, comes from a fine art perspective that seeks to avoid exploitation in favour of exploring new possibilities for representation.

40|$|In {{adolescent}} idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) {{there has}} been a shift towards increasing the number of implants and pedicle screws, which has not been proven to improve cosmetic correction. To evaluate if increasing cost of instrumentation correlates with cosmetic correction using clinical photographs. 58 Lenke 1 A and B cases from a multicenter AIS database with at least 3  months follow-up of clinical photographs were used for analysis. Cosmetic parameters on PA and forward bending photographs included angular measurements of trunk shift, shoulder balance, rib hump, and ratio measurements of waist line asymmetry. Pre-op and follow-up X-rays were measured for coronal and sagittal deformity parameters. Cost density was calculated by dividing the total cost of instrumentation by the number of vertebrae being fused. Linear regression and spearman’s correlation were used to correlate cost density to X-ray and photo outcomes. Three independent observers verified radiographic and cosmetic parameters for inter/interobserver variability analysis. Average pre-op Cobb angle and instrumented correction were 54 ° (SD 12. 5) and 59 % (SD 25) respectively. The average number of vertebrae fused was 10 (SD 1. 9). The total cost of spinal instrumentation ranged from $ 6, 769 to $ 21, 274 (Mean $ 12, 662, SD $ 3, 858). There was a weak positive and statistically significant correlation between Cobb angle correction and cost density (r =  0. 33, p =  0. 01), and no correlation between Cobb angle correction of the uninstrumented lumbar spine and cost density (r =  0. 15, p =  0. 26). There was no significant correlation between all sagittal X-ray measurements or any of the photo parameters and cost density. There was good to excellent inter/intraobserver variability of all <b>photographic</b> <b>parameters</b> based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 0. 74 – 0. 98). Our method used to measure cosmesis had good to excellent inter/intraobserver variability, and may be an effective tool to objectively assess cosmesis from photographs. Since increasing cost density only improves mildly the Cobb angle correction of the main thoracic curve and not the correction of the uninstrumented spine or any of the cosmetic parameters, one should consider the cost of increasing implant density in Lenke 1 A and B curves. In the area of rationalization of health care expenses, this study demonstrates that increasing the number of implants does not improve any relevant cosmetic or radiographic outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to visualise {{heterogeneous}} deformation in snow under controlled laboratory conditions. Heterogeneous deformation was observed for both homogenous and heterogeneous loading conditions. Understanding deformation of snow is important in many scientific fields including vehicle traction, avalanche forecasting, and winter sports. This thesis investigates the deformation behaviour {{of snow on the}} centimetre scale under moderate strain rates (0. 005 to 0. 1 s- 1) when subject to one-dimensional compression or to indentation. In order to allow controlled and repeatable snow deformation experiments, a new type of artificial snow was developed. This snow type was examined by low temperature scanning electron microscopy and by traditional avalanche observer’s methodology. Penetrometer experiments were conducted on the artificial snow and on natural seasonal snow in Scotland. The two snow types were found to be similar: results obtained on artificial snow are thus applicable to natural snow. A reproducible technique of manufacture and a thorough characterisation of the artificial snow are presented. One-dimensional compression experiments were conducted on the artificial snow. The experiments were in confined compression in a specially constructed apparatus, designed to provide for back-lit photography. Images were taken at 0. 25 second intervals and analysed using digital image correlation, thus providing 2 D strain fields. With careful control of <b>photographic</b> <b>parameters,</b> it is demonstrated that process of applying tracer substances to the snow is not necessary, thus allowing an unprecedented resolution. Spontaneously-forming strain localisations were observed for the first time, indicating strain softening behaviour. Damage was observed to propagate through the specimen as a moving front, resembling a wave. The force required to propagate the front remained nearly constant until the whole specimen was compacted, at which point a new front formed and the process repeated. The experimental method was extended to 2 D indention experiments with a range of sizes and shapes of indenter. Complex deformation fields were observed, extending up to 6 times the width of the indenter on each side. Observed deformation included tensile tearing as well as compression and shear. The maximum local strain achieved in the indentation experiments was similar to that achieved by the first compaction front in one-dimensional compression. The work here presented has implications for snow deformation generally: strain localisation introduces a characteristic length, which may prevent scaling of models or results. The indentation results are particularly relevant to snow penetrometry, where indentation experiments are used to try and extract microstructural information from buried snow layers for the purpose of avalanche prediction. The common assumption that the penetrometer interacts only with snow very close to its tip may need to be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for an investigation of free convection film boiling heat transfer to saturated ethanol, saturated Freon 113, and saturated distilled water from a vertical cylinder. High speed motion pictures of the vapor-liquid interface in film boiling have been obtained. All tests have been conducted at atmospheric pressure over a range of heat flux between 9000 and 37000 BTU/hr ft(2). A study of {{the stability of the}} vapor-liquid interface is performed and the results are compared to the <b>photographic</b> data. <b>Parameters</b> influencing the heat transfer process are developed and the experimental data is used to determine their proper relationship. The heat transfer coefficient in natural convection film boiling of saturated liquids on moderately long vertical surfaces at constant heat flux is shown to be insensitive to vertical position, and to be dependent only on the temperature differential and the fluid properties. Large scale waves have been observed on the vapor-liquid interface: however, their effect on the heat transfer is minimal. It appears that intense vaporization at the interface {{plays an important role in}} the generation of these waves, while surface tension does not. A strong possibility of liquid droplet entrainment in the vapor flow is indicated by the presence of a rough, wavy interface, a relatively high speed vapor-flow, and by the unexpectedly strong dependence of the heat transfer on the latent heat of vaporization. ...|$|R
