The spacewalkers performed {{works with the}} experiment Test at two locations: they took away samples from the outer surface of the docking compartment Pirs hatch and {{in the area of}} the cover window #8 at the service module Zvezda. The goal of the experiments was to develop methods for detecting leaks and control of elements of the exterior surface of the ISS.The cosmonauts also dismantled a monoblock responsible for exposing samples of organic and biological materials in open space (experiment Expose-R) and set the unit samples #2 from an experiment for the study of space influence on the mechanical properties of materials. At the same module, they had to replace a removable cassette container, where the samples are placed on the exterior of stations in conditions of prolonged exposure, change the orientation of the <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> on the module Poisk.One of the important tasks were works on an experiment with the goal to develop technologies for sticking film thermal control coating, secure package screen-vacuum thermal insulation on the surface to be repaired and transactions that require bonding film materials in space flight.For more convenient travel on the outer surface of the ISS the spacewalkers installed handrails on the soft part of the conical device of the Functional Cargo Block Zarya. Upon completion of the main tasks, the cosmonauts started a photo documentation of the external surface of the ISS Russian segment. The spacewalk concluded after 4 hours 45 minutes.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms often requires flexibly controlled and precisely timed changes in arterial blood pressure (ABP) and/or inspired CO 2. In this study, {{a new system}} for inducing variations in mean ABP was designed, implemented and tested using programmable sequences and programmable controls to induce pressure changes through bilateral thigh cuffs. The system is also integrated with a computer-controlled switch to select air or a CO 2 /air mixture to be provided via a face mask.

40|$|In mixed-mode braking applications, the {{electric}} motor / generator (M/G) and hydraulic pressure valve are controlled {{to meet the}} driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking demand. Controlling these braking elements is achieved by modulating the current generated by the M/G and adjusting the fluid pressure to the wheel brake cylinders. This paper aims to model and design combined regenerative and hydraulic braking systems which, comprise an induction electric machine, inverter, NiMH battery, controller, a pressure source, <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> and brake calipers. A 15 kW 1500 rpm induction machine equipped with a reduction gear having a gear ratio of 4 is used. A hydraulic brake capable to produce fluid pressure up to 40 bar is used.

The braking demands for the system are derived from the Federal Testing Procedure (FTP) drive cycle.

It is concluded that the control system does introduce torque ripple and pressure oscillation in the braking system, but these effects do not affect vehicle braking performance due to the high frequency nature of pressure fluctuation and the damping effect of the vehicle inertia.

40|$|Diabetic {{mellitus}} {{patients have}} foot {{problems such as}} loss of sensation, insufficient blood flow to lower extremities and alterations in shape of their pressure patterns causing concentrated high pressure regions. These peaks are due to the disfunctional feed back system from their mechanoreceptors and may lead to complex problems such as amputation if not identified and treated in timely manner. Our main objective {{is to protect the}} foot by sensing the abnormal peaks and redistribute the pressure from excessive pressure regions. Therefore, we are developing a design layout for an adaptable shoe insert useful for diabetic foot care. In this paper, the design of adaptive footwear using multi airbag measurement system is presented as a part of our design phase I. The human foot anatomy and anthropometry is studied and insole footwear is designed to auto sense the pressure distribution of the diabetic foot. The biomechanical foot design using a spring-mass-damper mathematical model is used to analyze the mechanical energy distribution and the patterns of stress and strain affecting the foot. The proposed multi airbag shoe insert has a sensing grid that measures the actual pressure of the diabetic patient. The optimal pressure distribution pattern is calculated using foot and insert models and the contact foot pressures are adjusted accordingly reducing the error between the normal and abnormal distribution.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{computational}} model of industrial-purpose hydraulic drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines (pump and motor). Adjustable pump {{equipped with the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> can be run together with several adjustable hydraulic motors {{on the principle of}} three-phase hydraulic socket-outlet with high-pressure lines, drain, and drainage system. The paper considers the pressure-controlled hydrostatic transmission with hydraulic motor as an output link. It shows a possibility to create a saving hydraulic drive using a functional tie between the adjusting parameters of the pump and hydraulic motor through the pressure difference, torque, and angular rate of the hydraulic motor shaft rotation. The programmable logic controller can implement such tie. The Coulomb and viscous frictions are taken into consideration when developing a computational model of the hydraulic volume displacement drive. Discharge balance considers external and internal leakages in equivalent clearances of hydraulic machines, as well as compression loss volume caused by hydraulic fluid compressibility and deformation of pipe walls. To correct dynamic properties of hydraulic drive, the paper offers that in discharge balance are included the additional regulated external leakages in the open circuit of hydraulic drive and regulated internal leakages in the closed-loop circuit. Generalized differential equations having functional multipliers and multilinked nature have been obtained to describe the operation of hydraulic positioning and speed drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines. It is shown that a proposed computational model of hydraulic drive can be taken into consideration in development of LS («Load-Sensing») drives, in which the pumping pressure is tuned to the value required for the most loaded slave motor to overcome the load. Results attained can be used both in designing the industrial-purpose heavy-duty hydraulic drives with improved adjusting characteristics and in creating the multilink hydraulic drives to work with the centralized powers sources of restricted power...|$|E
