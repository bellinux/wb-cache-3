Author Profiling can be applied in various fields like marketing, security and forensics. Twitter already uses similar techniques to deliver personalized advertisement for their users. <b>PAN</b> <b>2017</b> provided a corpus for this purpose in the languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. To solve the problem we used a deep learning approach, which has shown recent success in Natural Language Processing. Our submitted model consists of a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network implemented with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) combined with an Attention Mechanism. We achieved an average accuracy over all languages of 75, 31 % in gender classification and 85, 22 % in language variety classification...|$|R

Our best-performing system (on cross-validated results) is a linear support vector machine (SVM) with word unigrams and character 3 - to 5 -grams as features. A set of additional features, including POS tags, additional datasets, geographic entities, and Twitter handles, hurt, rather than improve, performance. Results from cross-validation indicated high performance overall and results on the test set confirmed them, at 0. 86 averaged accuracy, with performance on sub-tasks ranging from 0. 68 to 0. 98...|$|R

40|$|The pulsed {{radiation}} from PSR B 0833 - 45 (Vela) has a phased-averaged spectral energy distribution (SED) of an apparently simple structure {{across a wide}} energy range, from optical light to hard gamma-rays. However, the Vela pulses in narrow energy bands reveal astonishing complexity of the directional pattern of the radiation. These pulses are, therefore, a unique clue to the underlying radiative processes. We present {{the results of a}} 3 D modeling of the Vela radiation properties within an outer-gap scenario. We show how the inverse Compton scattering of photons by primary and secondary particles in its magnetic and non-magnetic regimes reproduces qualitatively, and in some cases quantitatively, the observed energy-dependent pulses of Vela.
