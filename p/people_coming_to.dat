5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up {{a large majority of}} <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> Australia, meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, was part of the eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the railways in the early 1840s introduced new employment opportunities for people {{in places such as}} Stockport and Manchester, as well as an influx of <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> live in the area. In the mid-19th century, one of the earliest shops was opened in the Smithy Green area, selling groceries, sweets and other provisions. As people settled in the area, more shops were opened and new houses were built, many of which still stand. During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population, mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to live in the area, and it gradually became more suburban. In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, Gill Bent Road, Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas, and new roads replaced old farms. In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm. By 2009 the only farm remaining was Leather's Farm on Ladybridge Road.|$|E
5|$|With {{more and}} more <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> Aspen, a better road from the east was needed. An early {{investor}} in the city, B. Clark Wheeler, put up the money needed to improve the path over the pass to a stage road. It opened in November 1881, just as winter was beginning. The tolls, 25 cents for saddle horses and twice that for stages ($ and $ in modern dollars respectively) were primarily spent hiring a large crew of men who kept the pass clear in winter with snowshovels. They were {{able to keep the}} road through the pass open during its first five winters. In deep enough snow passengers switched to sleighs; in summer, dogs ran in advance to warn oncoming traffic through the pass itself as the stages took the switchbacks at full speed. It usually took a stage 10–25 hours and five changes of horses to reach Aspen from Twin Lakes.|$|E

25|$|The {{large number}} of adventurers coming to the Minas Gerais led to the {{foundation}} of several settlements, {{the first of which}} were created in 1711: Vila Rica de Ouro Preto, Sabará and Mariana, followed by São João del Rei (1713), Serro, Caeté (1714), Pitangui (1715) and São José do Rio das Mortes (1717, now Tiradentes).

25|$|As a {{seaside town}} Southport {{has a long}} history of leisure and {{recreation}} and is still heavily dependent on tourism. The town went into decline when cheap air travel arrived in the 1960s and people chose to holiday abroad due to competitive prices and more reliable weather. However, the town kept afloat with <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> spend the day by the seaside on bank holidays and weekends. The town has diversified with annual events, shopping and conferences. In 2011 Southport was named the 14th most popular coastal resort in the country, benefiting from a 23% rise in money spent in the resort in that year. Part of the resort's progress is a result of the money invested in Southport over recent years.|$|E

25|$|In the Magic Land {{stories of}} Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the {{prehistory}} is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000years {{ago by a}} wizard named Hurricap, who was tired of <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> him with requests, {{so he decided to}} find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it {{from the rest of the}} world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from nearsightedness in his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to an underground cave and became the Magic Land's main source of metal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500years ago in this continuity).|$|E

500|$|Jordan {{is named}} after the Jordan River, where Jesus {{is said to have}} been baptised. The origin of the river's name is debated, but the most common {{explanation}} is that it derives from the word [...] "yarad" [...] (the descender, [...] "Yarden" [...] is the Hebrew name for the river), found in Hebrew, Aramaic, and other Semitic languages. Others regard the name as having an Indo-Aryan origin, combining the words [...] "yor" [...] (year) and [...] "don" [...] (river), reflecting the river's perennial nature. Another theory is that it is from the Arabic root word [...] "wrd" [...] (to come to), as in <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a major source of water.|$|E

Leto told Interview magazine, [...] "the song is about <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the City of Angels to live their dreams and to make their dreams their reality. It's about how the other people they've met in the city have helped them—you know, a group of people all kind of joining together into a community of outsiders, of mavericks, of freaks, of artists. It's about coming to a place to do something different and something special." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{unforeseen}} {{aspect of}} more <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> Florida {{proved to be}} an overwhelming problem. A woman living in a winter home near Palatka introduced water hyacinths (Eichhornia crassipes) to the St. Johns in an attempt to beautify her backyard. Ten years later, the purple-flowered hyacinths had grown to reside in [...] of the river and its arteries, becoming a serious invasive species. Hyacinths grow so densely that they prevent the navigation of watercraft, fishing, and sunlight from reaching the depths of the river, affecting both plant and animal life. The government of Florida found the plants to be so vexing that it spent almost $600,000 between 1890 and 1930 in an unsuccessful bid to rid the creeks and rivers of north Florida of them.|$|E

[...] In addition to this, while [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] is religious, [...] "Someday" [...] is, according to The Musical Theater of Stephen Schwartz: From Godspell to Wicked and Beyond, [...] "more of an anthem of hope than a prayer." ...|$|E

500|$|His {{notion of}} the unity of all mankind that appealed to {{everyone}} was very congruous with Sufi Islam. [...] "God being one and the master of all also meant that all his creatures were part of one big family," [...] writes Sikand. [...] "This belief was entirely in keeping with ... the teachings of Sufis, who believed that the light of God exists in every creature, indeed in every particle of His creation."

In the aftermath, images of skyscrapers flourished across American culture, commencing what historian Merrill Schleier dubbed a [...] "skyscraper mania". The [...] "Titan City" [...] exhibition in 1925 celebrated existing skyscraper and featured futuristic murals by Harvey Corbett and Hugh Ferriss, depicting the skyscraper {{at the heart of}} the [...] "City of the Future". Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's 1921 short film Manhatta explored the form, ending with a sunset shot from the top of a skyscraper. Authors such as Janet Flanner, John Dos Passos and Mary Borden wrote novels with skyscrapers as important motifs or settings. John Carpenter produced a ballet on the theme.
