Mutations in the SFTPA2 gene are found in patients with interstitial lung disease and lung cancer. SFTPA2 mutations also associated with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> via mechanisms that involve protein instability and endoplasmic reticulum stress.|$|E

He was survived by his wife, his son, and his sister Frances Flournoy Preston. Flournoy's funeral services were held at the Barlow-Bonsall Funeral Home and his family requested that memorial donations be made to Marmet Hospital in his honor. He was interred at Spring Hill Cemetery in Charleston on May 19, 1961.|$|E
40|$|Adenosine {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In vitro studies suggest that activation of the A 2 B adenosine receptor (A 2 BAR) results in proinflammatory and profibrotic effects relevant to the progression of lung diseases; however, in vivo data supporting these observations are lacking. Adenosine deaminase-deficient (ADA-deficient) mice develop pulmonary inflammation and injury that are dependent on increased lung adenosine levels. To investigate {{the role of the}} A 2 BAR in vivo, ADA-deficient mice were treated with the selective A 2 BAR antagonist CVT- 6883, and <b>pulmonary</b> inflammation, <b>fibrosis,</b> and airspace integrity were assessed. Untreated and vehicle-treated ADA-deficient mice developed <b>pulmonary</b> inflammation, <b>fibrosis,</b> and enlargement of alveolar airspaces; conversely, CVT- 6883 -treated ADA-deficient mice showed less <b>pulmonary</b> inflammation, <b>fibrosis,</b> and alveolar airspace enlargement. A 2 BAR antagonism significantly reduced elevations in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as mediators of fibrosis and airway destruction. In addition, treatment with CVT- 6883 attenuated <b>pulmonary</b> inflammation and <b>fibrosis</b> in wild-type mice subjected to bleomycin-induced lung injury. These findings suggest that A 2 BAR signaling influences pathways critical for pulmonary inflammation and injury in vivo. Thus in chronic lung diseases associated with increased adenosine, antagonism of A 2 BAR-mediated responses may prove to be a beneficial therapy...|$|R

5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> which can occur when the lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|Welders {{are often}} exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded {{metal arc welding}} produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. This is because smaller particles {{have the ability to}} cross the blood–brain barrier. Fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, ozone, and fumes containing heavy metals, can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training. Exposure to manganese welding fumes, for example, even at low levels (<0.2 mg/m3), may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system. Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and fire risk. Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air, and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Asbestosis resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis. The differential diagnosis includes idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy {{is usually not}} necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E
30|$|Radiological scoring {{systems for}} <b>pulmonary</b> cystic <b>fibrosis</b> have been {{introduced}} {{to allow for a}} standardised and robust comparison of radiological scoring to clinical scoring and for comparison of outcomes within patient groups in different studies. The evaluation of radiological studies is more objective when using a scoring system than simply describing the abnormal imaging findings.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{design and}} {{validate}} a scoring system for tomosynthesis (digital tomography) in <b>pulmonary</b> cystic <b>fibrosis.</b> METHODS: A scoring system dedicated to tomosynthesis in <b>pulmonary</b> cystic <b>fibrosis</b> was designed. Three radiologists independently scored 88 pairs of radiographs and tomosynthesis examinations {{of the chest}} in 60 patients with cystic fibrosis and 7 oncology patients. Radiographs were scored according to the Brasfield scoring system and tomosynthesis examinations were scored using the new scoring system. RESULTS: Observer agreements for the tomosynthesis score were almost perfect for the total score with square-weighted kappa > 0. 90, and generally substantial to almost perfect for subscores. Correlation between the tomosynthesis score and the Brasfield score {{was good for the}} three observers (Kendall's rank correlation tau 0. 68, 0. 77 and 0. 78). Tomosynthesis was generally scored higher {{as a percentage of the}} maximum score. Observer agreements for the total score for Brasfield score were almost perfect (square-weighted kappa 0. 80, 0. 81 and 0. 85). CONCLUSIONS: The tomosynthesis scoring system seems robust and correlates well with the Brasfield score. Compared with radiography, tomosynthesis is more sensitive to cystic fibrosis changes, especially bronchiectasis and mucus plugging, and the new tomosynthesis scoring system offers the possibility of more detailed and accurate scoring of disease severity. KEY POINTS : • Tomosynthesis is more sensitive than conventional radiography for <b>pulmonary</b> cystic <b>fibrosis</b> changes. • The radiation dose from chest tomosynthesis is low compared with computed tomography. • Tomosynthesis may become useful in the regular follow-up of patients with cystic fibrosis...|$|R

Terguride showed no vasoconstrictor effect in porcine coronary arteries (5 -HT 2 A re-ceptor bioassay) and no relaxant effect in porcine pulmonary arteries (5 -HT 2 B receptor bioassay). Terguride behaved as a potent antagonist at 5 -HT 2 A receptors (noncompetitive antag-onist parameter pD 2 9. 43) and 5 -HT 2 B receptors (apparent pA 2 8. 87).

40|$|KEY WORDS peroxynitrous acid; bleomycin; toxicity; {{pulmonary}} fibrosis; guanidines AIM: To {{observe the}} role of endogenous peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in <b>pulmonary</b> injury and <b>fibrosis</b> induced by bleomycin A 5 (BLM-A 5) in rats. METHODS: <b>Pulmonary</b> injury and <b>fibrosis</b> of rats were evaluated by testing the level of lipid peroxides (LPO) in out-going pulmonary blood (OPB), and by observing histological changes, includ-ing type III and type I collagen changes in lung which were examined with Sirius red staining under polarized light. The peroxynitrite expression was detected by immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine (NT), a marker of the peroxynitrite production. RESULTS: (1) The level of LPO was elevated in OPB of rats on d 14 after intratracheal administration of BLM-A 5. Thickened alveolar wall and macrophage infiltration were seen, and fibroblasts were near by the interstitial macrophages. Increased amounts of type III collagen and type I collagen were deposited in disoriented fashion. (2) High expression of ONOO- was detected in alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary intersti-tial macrophages. (3) The above changes were reduced by aminoguanidine (AG), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). CONCLUSION: Endogenous ONOO- mediated BLM-A 5 -induced pulmonary toxicity.
