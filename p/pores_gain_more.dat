Under fixed-fee licensing, the follower <b>gains</b> <b>more</b> from small innovations while the leader <b>gains</b> <b>more</b> from large non-drastic innovations. Under royalty licensing, the follower always <b>gains</b> <b>more</b> than the leader from an innovation.

If the time allocation is optimized for an equal rate allocation, network coding <b>gains</b> <b>more</b> than 3.4 dB for R = 3.0 bits per symbol. For an equal time and rate allocation, network coding <b>gains</b> <b>more</b> than 6.9 dB for R = 2.0 bits per symbol.

40|$|In this {{comprehensive}} study of all shipping mergers and acquisitions from 1984 to 2011 we document that the shareholders of both acquirers and targets realise average abnormal gains of 1. 2 % and 3. 3 % respectively and both parties <b>gain</b> <b>more</b> from diversifying than focus-increasing deals. Acquirers <b>gain</b> <b>more</b> when paying with stock, in cross-border deals and from taking over public targets. Targets <b>gain</b> <b>more</b> from cross-border and focus-increasing deals. Regulatory interventions, like the EU repeal of exemption from competition and the US Ocean Shipping Reform Act, affect the marginal merger propensity and this propensity differs significantly across regions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
