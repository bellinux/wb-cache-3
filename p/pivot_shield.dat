5000|$|Often, bosses are {{not present}} on non-circular shields {{due to the}} {{differences}} in technique; with a round shield, one makes a punching motion towards an oncoming blow, while with a heater or kite shield, attacks are blocked by <b>pivoting</b> the <b>shield</b> about the body. A boss provides a significant advantage for deflecting blows when using a punching motion, but is not very effective when using a pivot to block an attack.|$|R
500|$|The ships {{also carried}} twelve 8.8cm SK L/35 guns for close in defense; these were {{arranged}} {{in groups of}} four in <b>shielded</b> <b>pivot</b> mounts. Four guns were mounted around the forward conning tower, four were emplaced around the rear two funnels amidships, with the last four guns placed {{on top of the}} rear superstructure. These guns fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] per second. They could elevate to 25° and could engage targets out to [...] The vessels' armament system was rounded out by four [...] submerged torpedo tubes. They were mounted in the bow, stern, and on each broadside, and supplied with eleven torpedoes.|$|R
500|$|The {{ships were}} armed with four [...] 40-caliber guns {{manufactured}} by Armstrong Whitworth. The guns {{were placed in}} two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The ships were also equipped with eight [...] 40-cal. guns in individual casemates amidships. These guns were export derivatives of the British QF 6-inch /40 gun. Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was also equipped with eight [...] 40-cal. guns in <b>shielded</b> <b>pivot</b> mounts directly above the casemate battery and eight [...] guns and two [...] guns. Emanuele Filiberto carried six [...] guns and eight [...] guns instead. Both ships also carried four [...] torpedo tubes in deck-mounted launchers.|$|R

40|$|Description of {{the concept}} of {{splitting}} a heat-pipe reactor for out-of-core thermionics into two identical halves and using the resulting center gap for reactivity control. Short Li-W reactor heat pipes penetrate the axial reflectors and form a heat exchanger with long heat pipes which wind through the shield to the thermionic diodes. With one reactor half anchored to the shield, the other is attached to a long arm with a <b>pivot</b> behind the <b>shield</b> and swings through a small arc for reactivity control. A safety shim prevents large reactivity inputs, and a fueled control arm drive shaft acts as a power stabilizer. Reactors fueled with U- 235 C and with U- 233 C have been studied. ...|$|R

Four guns were mounted around the forward conning tower, four were emplaced around the rear two funnels amidships, with the last four guns placed {{on top of the}} rear superstructure.

40|$|Apparatus is {{described}} for automatically mating {{a pair of}} connectors and protecting them prior to mating, which minimizes weight and uses relatively simple and reliable mechanisms. Lower and upper connectors (24, 26) are held in lower and upper parts (14, 16) of a housing, with the upper connector mounted on a carrier (32) that is motor driven to move down and mate the connectors. A pair of movable members (36, 38) serve as shields, as coarse alignment aids, and as force transmitters. The movable members are pivotally mounted {{at the bottom of}} the upper housing, and as the carrier moves down it pivots the members out of the way. The movable members have socket elements (116) that closely receive pin elements (120) on the lower housing part, to coarsely align the connectors and to react mating and unmating forces between the housings. The carrier has a pair of plate portions (60, 62) with slots (64), and the movable members have cam followers engaged with the slot walls, to move the members with precision. The carrier plate-like portions engage follower members (82) that <b>pivot</b> open lower <b>shield</b> parts (44, 46) covering the lower connector, which is mounted on four stacks of Belleville washers (142) ...|$|R
