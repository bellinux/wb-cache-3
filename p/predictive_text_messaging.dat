The name of the band was derived from an observation made by Emerson who, when using <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> to <b>message</b> a friend, noticed that the three words are all entered using the same numerical combination and, according to Page, [...] "it just seemed a perfect fit". In the summer of 2007, the band appeared on the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury Festival and released their début single [...] "Punches, Kicks, Trenches & Swords" [...] through their own Life In The Big City label the following October.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the impact of <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> use upon the literacy skills of primary school, secondary school and university cohorts was conducted {{over the course of}} a year. No differences in use of text abbreviations (‘textisms’) were found between <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> users and non-users. However, secondary school children who used <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> made more genuine spelling errors than non-users. <b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> was related to use of some specific grammatical violations in school-age children’s <b>text</b> <b>messages,</b> but was not related overall to the tendency to make grammatical errors when texting. University students, however, made significantly fewer grammatical errors in their <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> when they used <b>predictive</b> <b>text.</b> Over the course of a year, <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> use was variable for all age groups.

5000|$|<b>Predictive</b> {{entry of}} <b>text</b> from a {{telephone}} keypad {{has been known}} {{at least since the}} 1970s (Smith and Goodwin, 1971). Aspects of <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> have been patented for instance by Kondraske (1985), while a fully functional keypad to text system for communicating with deaf people via phone was patented in 1988 by Roy Feinson (...) that included most of the features of modern <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> systems including disambiguation and local dictionary storage. <b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> was mainly used to look up names in directories over the phone, until mobile phone <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> came into widespread use. Sinclair's ZX80/81 also possessed a form of <b>predictive</b> <b>text.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> is {{an input}} {{technology}} used where one key or button represents many letters, such {{as on the}} numeric keypads of mobile phones and in accessibility technologies. Each key press results in a prediction rather than repeatedly sequencing through {{the same group of}} [...] "letters" [...] it represents, in the same, invariable order. <b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> could allow for an entire word to be input by single keypress. <b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> makes efficient use of fewer device keys to input writing into a <b>text</b> <b>message,</b> an e-mail, an address book, a calendar, and the like.|$|R
50|$|On modern {{mobile phones}} and smartphones, the {{letters on the}} keys are needed for {{entering}} <b>text</b> for <b>text</b> <b>messaging,</b> entering names in the phone book, mobile apps, mobile browser, etc. To compensate for the smaller keys, mobile phones use systems like multi-tap and <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> processing.|$|R

50|$|With the {{popularity}} of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> , <b>text</b> entry with mobile phones has gained use.

The Panini keyboard can also be used on laptops, tablets and desktop computers.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} <b>texting</b> behaviours, <b>text</b> <b>message</b> characteristics (textese) of actual sent <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> and {{the relationships between}} texting, textese and literacy abilities {{in a sample of}} 183 American undergraduates. As compared to previous naturalistic and experimental studies with English-speaking adults, both texting frequency and textism density (proportion of textese) were greater, but category density analyses were similar to a recent experimental study with undergraduates. Interestingly, whilst overall textism density was negatively related to reading and spelling, some textism categories (e. g., omitted apostrophes) were negatively related to literacy skills, while others (e. g., accent stylisation) were positively related to literacy skills. The use of <b>predictive</b> <b>texting</b> was a moderator in this relationship. Our results may help explain the discordant fi ndings between children and adults with regard to textese use and literacy skills, and also highlight the importance of conducting analyses of category density and <b>predictive</b> <b>texting</b> in studies of texting and literacy...|$|R

40|$|U. S. {{courts have}} been slow to embrace new technologies. This is {{especially}} true when it comes to service of process. With people in the United States relying heavily on cell phones and <b>text</b> <b>message</b> technology, <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> offer a unique method for serving process. <b>Text</b> <b>messages</b> would be useful for serving a defendant when the defendant cannot be located.

40|$|Background: Reading and typing <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> {{while driving}} seriously impairs driving {{performance}} and are prohibited activities in many jurisdictions. Hong Kong is a bilingual society {{and many people}} write in both Chinese and English. As the input methods for <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> in Chinese and English are considerably different, this study used a driving simulator approach to compare the effects of reading and typing Chinese and English <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> on driving performance. Method: The driving performances of 26 participants were monitored under the following conditions: (1) no distraction, (2) reading and typing Chinese <b>text</b> <b>messages,</b> and (3) reading and typing English <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> The following measures of driving performance were collected under all of the conditions: reaction time (RT), driving lane undulation (DLU), driving speed fluctuation (DSF), and car-following distance (CFD) between test and leading cars. Results: RT, DLU, and DSF were significantly impaired by reading and typing both Chinese and English <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> Moreover, typing <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> distracted drivers more than reading them. Although the Chinese <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> input system {{is more complicated than}} the English system, the use of Chinese did not cause a significantly different degree of distraction.
