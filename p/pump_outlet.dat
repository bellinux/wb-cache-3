5000|$|Hydraulic {{pumps are}} used in {{hydraulic}} drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the <b>pump</b> <b>outlet.</b> When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the pump inlet, which forces liquid from the reservoir into the inlet line to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the <b>pump</b> <b>outlet</b> and forces it into the hydraulic system.Hydrostatic pumps are positive displacement pumps while hydrodynamic pumps can be fixed displacement pumps, in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable displacement pumps, which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted. Although, hydrodynamic pumps are more frequent in day-to-day life. Hydrostatics pump which are of various types works {{on the principle of}} Pascal's law. It states that the increase in pressure at one point of the enclosed liquid in equilibrium of rest is transmitted equally to all other points of the liquid, unless the effect of gravity is neglected.(in case of statics) ...|$|E
50|$|This {{geometry}} ensures that, per rotation, {{a constant}} flow volume proportional to rotary angle is always produced. The flow direction is reversed {{by changing the}} direction of rotation. Volume is therefore clearly determined by degree angle. A further advantage of this technology is that a pressure-stable, linear pump characteristic curve is obtained. From these facts we can conclude {{that there is a}} definable ratio between rotation, time and flow volume. Therefore, these pumps can produce a constant dosing volume via the parameters of time or rotation, when used in an application. This results in a guaranteed dosing accuracy of 1% at the <b>pump</b> <b>outlet</b> (depending on the medium). This figure is often even better in practice.|$|E

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} brake system {{consists of a}} hydraulic pump (usually a gear-type pump), a fluid reservoir, and piping between the two parts. Inserted in the piping is an adjustable valve, and between the pump and the valve is a gauge or other means of measuring hydraulic pressure. In simplest terms, the engine is brought up to the desired RPM and the valve is incrementally closed. As the <b>pumps</b> <b>outlet</b> is restricted, the load increases and the throttle is simply opened until at the desired throttle opening. Unlike most other systems, power is calculated by factoring flow volume (calculated from pump design specifications), hydraulic pressure, and RPM. Brake HP, whether figured with pressure, volume, and RPM, or with a different load cell-type brake dyno, should produce essentially identical power figures. Hydraulic dynos are renowned for having the quickest load change ability, just slightly surpassing eddy current absorbers. The downside is that they require large quantities of hot oil under high pressure and an oil reservoir.|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} the general {{topic of the}} gas entrainment from a free surface by a swirl issued from the pumping of fluids below the free surface. This phenomenon is investigated through an analytical experiment in water. A shear flow is generated between a horizontal flow and a stagnant flow. At {{the bottom of the}} test section, a vertical pumping is added to produce gas entrainment. One particularity of these experiments is the possibility to change the shape of the channel generating the inlet conditions by adding obstacles so as to trigger different conditions for the turbulent shear flow. Depending on the flow conditions, a surface swirl can be created with a sufficient strength to entrain gas below the free surface to the vertical <b>pumping</b> <b>outlet.</b> The frequency of gas entrainment occurrence is measured using visualizations of the flow. Two entrained regimes are identified for low and high Reynolds number flows: the surface swirl induced gas entrainment in its core reaching the suction nozzle and bubbles issued from the breaking of the gas core are pumped...|$|R
50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters the <b>pump</b> and an <b>outlet</b> where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to}} be at the suction side of the <b>pump.</b> The <b>outlet</b> location {{is said to be}} at the discharge side of the pump. Operation of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a centrifugal pump is too low, a device may trigger the pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.|$|R
50|$|The above steps {{will often}} still fail {{to prevent an}} alarm flood in an {{operational}} upset, so advanced methods such as alarm suppression under certain circumstances are then necessary. As an example, shutting down a pump will always cause a low flow alarm on the <b>pump</b> <b>outlet</b> flow, so the low flow alarm may be suppressed if the pump was shut down since it adds no value for the operator, {{because he or she}} already knows it was caused by the pump being shut down. This technique can of course get very complicated and requires considerable care in design. In the above case for instance, {{it can be argued that}} the low flow alarm does add value as it confirms to the operator that the pump has indeed stopped. Process boundaries (Boundary Management) must also be taken into account.|$|E
5000|$|The oil {{diffusion}} pump is operated with an oil of low vapor pressure. The high speed jet {{is generated by}} boiling the fluid and directing the vapor through a jet assembly. Note that the oil is gaseous when entering the nozzles. Within the nozzles, the flow changes from laminar, to supersonic and molecular. Often, several jets are used in series to enhance the pumping action. The outside of the {{diffusion pump}} is cooled using either air flow or a water line. As the vapor jet hits the outer cooled shell of the diffusion pump, the working fluid condenses and is recovered and directed back to the boiler. The pumped gases continue flowing {{to the base of}} the pump at increased pressure, flowing out through the diffusion <b>pump</b> <b>outlet,</b> where they are compressed to ambient pressure by the secondary mechanical forepump and exhausted.|$|E
50|$|In the APU, a {{fuel pump}} boosted the {{hydrazine}} pressure and fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox. The waste gas, now cooler and at low pressure, was passed {{back over the}} gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard. The gearbox drove the fuel pump, its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since the fuel pump was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the fuel <b>pump</b> <b>outlet</b> pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the fuel pump.|$|E

5000|$|A {{peristaltic}} pump {{is a type}} of positive displacement pump used for pumping a variety of fluids. The fluid is contained within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing (though linear {{peristaltic pump}}s have been made). A rotor with a number of [...] "rollers", [...] "shoes", [...] "wipers", or [...] "lobes" [...] attached to the external circumference of the rotor compresses the flexible tube. As the rotor turns, the part of the tube under compression is pinched closed (or [...] "occludes") thus forcing the fluid to be pumped to move through the tube. Additionally, as the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam ("restitution" [...] or [...] "resilience") fluid flow is induced to the pump. This process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, there will be two or more rollers, or wipers, occluding the tube, trapping between them a body of fluid. The body of fluid is then transported, at ambient pressure, toward the <b>pump</b> <b>outlet.</b> Peristaltic pumps may run continuously, or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid.|$|E
5000|$|Spring-piston air guns (or simply [...] "spring guns" [...] or [...] "springers") operate {{by means}} of a coil {{spring-loaded}} piston pump assembly contained within a compression chamber separate from the gun barrel. Before shooting, the user need to manually cock the gun by flexing a lever connected to the pump assembly. The cocking causes the pump piston to move backwards and compress the spring until its rear engages the sear. The act of pulling the trigger disengages the sear, allows the spring to decompress and release the elastic potential energy stored within it, and pushes the piston forward thereby compressing the air in the pump cylinder. Because the <b>pump</b> <b>outlet</b> (located {{to the front of the}} pump) is directly behind the pellet sitting in the barrel chamber, once the air pressure has risen enough to overcome any static friction and/or barrel restriction holding back the pellet, the pellet is propelled forward by an expanding column of pressurized air. All this takes place in a fraction of a second, during which the air undergoes adiabatic heating to several hundred degrees and then cools as the air expands. This can also cause a phenomenon referred as [...] "dieseling", where flammable substances in the compression chamber (e.g. petroleum-based lubricant) can be ignited by the heat generated, and lead to combustion smoke coming out of the muzzle upon firing.|$|E

An annular compression ring with a tapered internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with the tapered internal surface in a facing relationship to the external tapered surface. The angle of inclination of the tapered surfaces is converging such that the spacing between the tapered surfaces decreases {{from one end of the}} external tapered surface to the other end thereby providing a clamping action of the tapered surface on a cannula which increases as a function of the length of cannula segment between the tapered surfaces.

40|$|Variable {{displacement}} {{vane pumps}} (VDVP) are {{one type of}} positive displacement pumps used in automatic transmission vehicles for lubricating the gears, cooling the transmission and actuating the clutches. Though fixed displacement pumps are widely used, they output a constant effective flow at a given speed. Depending on pump sizing considerations, the pump can be oversized at high speeds because flow demand of the transmission is independent of engine speed. The excess flow returns to the tank through an orifice that causes the oil to heat up, increasing the energy required for cooling and reducing {{the efficiency of the}} transmission. A VDVP is used because the effective flow is adjustable to meet transmission demands any speed. The VDVP studied in this paper is unstable because of a feedback loop between pressure fluctuations at the <b>pump’s</b> <b>outlet</b> and the control system.
