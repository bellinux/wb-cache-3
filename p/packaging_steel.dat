40|$|Abstract <b>Packaging</b> <b>steel</b> is {{used for}} the safe and {{efficient}} distribution of different products worldwide. In the long line of improvement of steel packaging the total volume of canned products per tonne of <b>packaging</b> <b>steel</b> has increased dramatically in the last 50 years. This result is directly linked to a better use of the resources necessary for making <b>packaging</b> <b>steel.</b> The recycling rate for <b>packaging</b> <b>steel</b> in the EU is now over 70 per cent. Efficient recycling {{can be seen as a}} multi-use system from the material point of view. The recycling of the core material enables the industry to avoid a CO 2 burden in the production route. These above mentioned characteristics have to be taken into account when studying the life cycle of <b>packaging</b> <b>steel.</b> Resource efficiency has direct effects on other life cycle parameters such as green house gas emissions or energy use. This will be shown in some examples. An outlook for future developments will be given as well. ...|$|E

A reusable package or container is “designed for reuse without impairment of its protective function.” [...] The term returnable is sometimes used interchangeably {{but it can also}} include returning packages or components for other than reuse: recycling, disposal, incineration, etc. Typically, the materials used to make returnable <b>packaging</b> include <b>steel,</b> wood, polypropylene sheets or other plastic materials.|$|R
50|$|Illy coffees are blended from arabica beans from {{multiple}} sources. The grounds are <b>packaged</b> in <b>steel</b> canisters and pressurized with an inert gas rather than air. For {{the production of}} decaffeinated coffee, the illy method involves the coffee beans being first steamed for 30 minutes and then repeatedly rinsed with either methylene chloride (dichloromethane or DCM) or ethyl acetate for about 10 hours. The solvent is then drained away and the beans steamed for an additional 10 hours to remove any residual solvent.|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of <b>packaging</b> <b>steel</b> from {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) {{plays an important role}} in scrap recycling. Post-consumer <b>packaging</b> <b>steel</b> quality depends strongly on the procedure and the technology employed for its collection and recovery. Household refuse management systems include classification, compost and incineration plants. In Spain, MSW incineration is carried out by nine incinerators that generate a total of around 40 000 t of ferrous scrap every year. Two types of furnace are used for the incineration process, namely mobile grate furnaces (MGF) and fluidised bed furnaces (FBF). Slag from the process is comprised by the incombustible materials ofMSW(vitreous materials, ceramic materials, ferrous and nonferrous metals). Slag accounts for 85 – 95...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in various countries {{have led to}} the development of new types of polymer coated <b>packaging</b> <b>steel.</b> These materials behave differently in production and end use and are therefore subject of extensive studies. The aim of this research is to understand the influence of deformation of pre-coated <b>packaging</b> <b>steel</b> sheet on real can product behaviour. The following issues and their mutual relations were addressed: deformation in the substrate and coating and its influence on interaction at the interface, the morphology of the coating, failure mechanisms of the product, and ionic transport through the coating. The research showed that the interface between substrate and coating undergoes large changes during the can making process. The initial very strong coating adhesion is reduced significantly after deformation. The reduction of the coating adhesion can be explained by change in surface morphology of the outer substrate layer as a result of tilting of the steel grains causing stress build-up in the coating. The effects of substrate and coating changes of deformed polymer coated <b>packaging</b> <b>steel</b> on the performance were studied in detail. A relation was found between product performance and the change in surface morphology of the outer substrate layer due to deformation. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

The steel used for packaging is of high quality, and post-consumer waste therefore produces high-grade ferrous scrap.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the fiber}} Bragg grating sensing principle, and {{according}} to the characteristics of asphalt pavements, two types of FBG sensors are designed. One type is rigid sensor <b>packaged</b> by <b>steel</b> casing which labeled as R-type, and the other one is flexible sensor packaged by rubber which labeled as F-type. Through the tests of sensing performance, high-temperature stability performance and low-temperature stability performance, a comprehensive analysis of the long-term service performance is obtained. Analysis show that both rigid and flexible packaing have sensitizing effect while flexible packaging is better. Both types of sensors have good high temperature stability and low temperature stability, while R-tpe is better than F-type...|$|R

40|$|The {{corrosion}} of spent {{nuclear fuel}} and subsequent mobilization of radionuclides is of great concern in a geologic repository, particularly if conditions are oxidizing. Corroding A 516 steel may offset these transport processes within the proposed waste packages at the Yucca Mountain Repository (YMR) by retaining radionuclides, creating locally reducing conditions, and reducing porosity. Ferrous iron, Fe{sup 2 +}, {{has been shown to}} reduce UO{sub 2 }{sup 2 +} to UO{sub 2 (s) } [1], and some ferrous iron-bearing ion-exchange materials adsorb radionuclides and heavy metals [2]. Of particular interest is magnetite, a potential corrosion product that has been shown to remove TcO{sub 4 }{sup -} from solution [3]. Furthermore, if Fe{sup 2 +} minerals, rather than fully oxidized minerals such as goethite, are produced during corrosion, then locally reducing conditions may be present. High electron availability leads to the reduction and subsequent immobilization of problematic dissolved species such as TcO{sub 4 }{sup -}, NpO{sub 2 }{sup +}, and UO{sub 2 }{sup 2 +} and can also inhibit corrosion of {{spent nuclear fuel}}. Finally, because the molar volume of iron material increases during corrosion due to oxygen and water incorporation, pore space may be significantly reduced over long time periods. The more water is occluded, the bulkier the corrosion products, and the less porosity is available for water and radionuclide transport. The focus of this paper is on the nature of Yucca Mountain waste <b>package</b> <b>steel</b> corrosion products and their effects on local redox state, radionuclide transport, and porosity...|$|R
