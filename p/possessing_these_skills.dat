She needs intelligence {{to collect and}} digest information about business opportunities. She needs foresight about the possibilities new technologies and other developments create. She needs judgment and leadership skills to found a company and guide its growth. She needs communication skills to enthuse financiers to back her vision. The number of active entrepreneurs therefore depends on how many individuals <b>possess</b> <b>these</b> <b>skills.</b> But skills are not endowments. Individuals decide to develop those skills that advance their well being and to forego developing those that do not. The prospects of a career as an entrepreneur depend on the economic environment, which can be facilitative or detrimental. A multitude of factors determine this environment: rules and regulations, the quality of government, the availability of education, and the ambient culture. Many of these factors fall {{under the heading of}} institutions, by which we mean the constraints on behavior imposed by the state or societal norms that shape economic interactions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to explore a contextual intervention of effective college advising programs for ethnic minority students that helps them acquire the skills and personal dispositions necessary to apply to, get into, and stay at selective colleges and universities. Utilizing a regression analysis, this analytical study examined 199 low-income minority high school students in a contextual college intervention program from 2014 to 2015. The central hypothesis being tested was that intervention programs that were successful at getting lower income ethnic minority youth to apply to, get into, and stay at selective colleges and universities attract and maintain students with higher levels of personal factors, especially factors of resilience such as motivation, grit, and perseverance. The research questions sought {{to examine the relationship between}} effective college advising programs for minority, low-income students (contextual intervention) and what social and emotional or resilient skills (personal factors) their students possess to become college and career ready, and whether <b>possessing</b> <b>these</b> <b>skills</b> differentiates those students who are accepted into highly selective colleges from those who are accepted to less selective colleges. A growing body of research demonstrates that admittance to selective colleges often leads to increased social status, higher income, and improved job opportunities. It has been demonstrated that getting into a highly selective college matters. Caucasian and minority students alike who graduate from highly selective colleges experience increased lifetime earnings and prestige (Bowen, 1998, Avery, 2003). A total of 199 minority high school student participants were surveyed during their senior year in high school. Survey items were drawn from Solberg’s Success Model Survey (2007) and Duckworth’s Grit Model (2007). Duckworth validated a self-report questionnaire called the Grit Scale where “Grit” is defined as trait-level perseverance and passion for long-term goals. Solberg’s Success Model Survey is a composite of several scales: Career Search Self-Efficacy, Goal-Setting, and Motivation to Attend School; Academic Self-Efficacy; and Social Connections. (Sample survey questions in Table section.) The dataset also included participant demographic data, program participation information, and college admit results.

Worldwide, the number of investors investing in unit trusts {{is on the rise}} and increasingly {{they want to be able}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of the managers managing their funds so as to make better investment decisions. This increase in the asset size and number of unit trusts funds could be attributed but not limited to the low capital required for investment by small investors who before could not afford to invest in portfolios requiring large capital (Prather, Bertin, and Henker, 2004). In addition, the fund managers of these units are believed to have special skills such as market timing and stock selectivity which contribute to the performances they achieve. The evaluation of the performance of unit trust fund managers is a largely unexplored area in South Africa. As a result, the study focuses on South Africa fund managers and has as aim to evaluate the performance of two groups of fund managers (independent and dependent) who were classified based on their client affiliation structure. The client affiliation classification is as a result of the fund manager's clientele base. The dependent group are those who formed part of a group structure and offer other wealth management services for which their clients or investors in the unit trust services originate from within the group while the independent group are those whose clients are pulled together from diverse individuals or institutions and does not form part of a group or render other services other than fund management. Two fund types were selected namely; general equity funds and balanced funds. It has also examined the underlying skills the different groups of fund managers possess. The performance of unit trust has an effect on many parties who are related in one way or the other to the unit trust funds. The results of this study will inform individual investors, trustees and asset consultants in their decision making process of selecting a fund manager. The results of the study will be of value to the asset management industry in terms of assessing their structures and restructuring the investment service business to meet the expectations of their clients; the investors. It could also be used as a marketing tool. Publicly available historical data on the returns generated by fund managers for a five year period from 2005 to 2009 was obtained. Analyses were done using the independent sampled t-test and the Treynor Mazel model respectively for the different research questions posed. The results obtained indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the performances of independent fund managers with those of dependent fund managers. However, dependent fund managers of equity funds performed better than their counterparts the independent fund managers. In the case of balanced funds, the independent fund managers performed better than their dependent counterparts. On average, both fund manager types possessed selectivity skills for equity funds and none for balanced funds. However for both fund types, the dependent fund manager demonstrated more selectivity skills than their independent counterparts. The results for market timing skills demonstrated that on average, both fund managers did not possess market timing skills for balanced funds while <b>possessing</b> <b>these</b> <b>skills</b> for equity funds. The dependent fund managers demonstrated more market timing skills for balanced funds though negative when compared to that of their counterparts.

Given the link that higher levels of ICT skills has with higher wages (Falck, Wiederhold, & Heimisch, 2016), and the risk of job losses in the future due to computerisation and automation (Hajkowicz et al., 2016), an onus is on HE institutions to implement digitalization strategies that will foster a range of twenty-first century skills, enabling students to use technology in flexible, adaptive and innovative ways (Claro & Ananiadou, 2009; Oliver & Jorre de St Jorre, 2018; Redecker, 2017).

The second myth is that women should avoid negotiations because of potential backlash. Although women in leadership do face an ongoing challenge to be likeable, it is clear that not negotiating has long-term detrimental effects.

40|$|Sport can be {{the source}} of fitter, {{healthier}} and better lifestyles. However, sport can also be a vehicle for the reproduction of problematic notions of gender, race, nationality, industry, et cetera. If people who consume and participate in sport are unequipped to identify and question these issues, they will continue reproducing these conceptions uncritically. As a proponent of Critical Media Literacy (CML), through this dissertation I encourage educators to teach students the skills and knowledge to recognize and critically assess these and other problematic discourses in sports media. In this dissertation, I set out to discover if adolescents <b>possess</b> <b>these</b> <b>skills</b> and knowledge. Two main questions drive this research: First, what type of knowledge do the participants have about the socio-cultural, political and economic implications of sport in our societies? And second, can the participants identify socio-political issues (e. g. gender, race, nationality, political economy) in sports media texts as they consume them? To answer these questions, I first attempted a study with youth and later I recruited 20 first year university students to participate in a 90 minute session where I showed them three sports clips and asked them to complete a short qualitative questionnaire and partake in a focus group discussion. Using Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA), I examined both the questionnaires and the transcripts from the discussions leading to a critical analysis. I found that the participants had a limited knowledge of the general and critical media issues we discussed. Though the students demonstrated some understanding of the way the sports media operates, they consistently drew from stereotypes and common sense tropes when analyzing issues of race, nationality and gender in sports. I also found that students were generally unable to identify and/or critique problematic representations present in the videos. There were only 5. 6 % of instances where the participants questioned these problems in the clips. Most of the time (86. 23 %) the participants were either unaware of the issues or saw them as normal and saw no need to resist or critique. These findings support the idea that students would benefit from receiving a critical media literacy education that teaches them to identify and question hegemonic discourses in sports media...|$|R

In particular new entrants such as graduates need to <b>possess</b> <b>these</b> <b>skills</b> to function effectively in the working environment. However, employers are concerned with graduates’ employability level, due to their inability to find graduates with the required skills to effectively contribute and adapt to the working environment. The employability skills of graduates depend largely {{on the role of}} universities in the development of <b>these</b> <b>skills.</b> Therefore, more national and international universities are focusing on enhancing the employability of graduates by collating job-market and economic information. Although this input by universities suggests a signal of change, these initiatives are still not enough to ensure the employability of graduates or their effective functioning in the working environment. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} investigate final-year undergraduate business management students’ ability to perform the pertinent employability skills which are deemed essential in the business environment. In this study the participants’ ability to demonstrate four employability skills on specific levels were measured. <b>These</b> <b>skills</b> include problem solving, communication, teamwork and self-management. In this study a multi-methods approach was used to collect, analyse and report data. Multimethods include both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative method was used for analysing aspects of problem solving, communication (written and oral) and teamwork by using different tests to determine the participants’ skill levels. The qualitative method was used for collecting and report on other aspects of problem solving and selfmanagement. A total of 45 final-year undergraduate business management students took part in this study. Data entry, tabulation and statistical analysis of quantitative data were done by the Statistical Consultation Services of the North-West University (Potchefstroom Campus) whereas qualitative data were analysed by an external expert as well as the researcher. The results of this study indicate that students are not yet fully competent to demonstrate <b>these</b> employability <b>skills</b> at the end of their studies, which places considerable pressure on universities and lecturers to empower students with employability skills. Although it might seem that employers have high expectations for graduates, employers do not expect candidates to be completely competent when they enter the work environment. The candidates are expected to be able to learn, adapt in the work environment and develop the skills needed for their specific work. It is recommended that universities must implement skills development strategies and develop close relationships with the private sector in order to establish work-integrated learning initiatives. Students are also expected to develop their own skills by taking initiative and taking responsibility for their own learning and development. Henceforth, it is recommended that lecturers develop their own educational abilities to be able to develop students’ employability skills. The most essential limitations of this study include time constraints and limited funding. The magnitude of data collection also limited the study to focus only on four employability skills namely problem solving, communication (written and oral), teamwork and self-management, pertaining to the employability skills of graduates.

40|$|A {{difference}} between the beliefs and practices about mathematics learning and teaching held by teachers in kindergartens and teachers in new entrant classrooms may lead to problems as teachers and children manage the transition from kindergarten to school. The New Zealand education system is governed by various curriculum documents underpinned by similar philosophies to support teacher practice. These documents are based on an expectation that teachers build from children’s existing knowledge and experiences. The system is based on expectations relating to knowledge that are loosely linked to the year level and age of children. Evidence about teachers’ practices and beliefs was gathered using a case study approach. Five primary schools and their neighbouring kindergartens were purposively selected for this study. Fourteen kindergarten and five new entrant teachers were observed and interviewed and completed questionnaires about their beliefs and practices in mathematics teaching and learning over a two year period. Mathematical events were analysed to document teachers’ practices. Kindergarten teachers’ practice most commonly mirrored their stated beliefs about how children best learned mathematics. New entrant teachers, although possessing similar stated beliefs to kindergarten teachers, did not necessarily follow these beliefs in their classroom practice. The beliefs of kindergarten and new entrant teachers in mathematics teaching and learning were similar, but their practices differed in several dimensions. Kindergarten teachers believed children best learned mathematics through free play and exploration {{of the world around}} them. These teachers encouraged children to follow their own interests and supported children as they developed their ideas and became active problem solvers. These beliefs arose from teachers’ personal experiences combined with the primarily sociocultural focus of the early childhood curriculum, Te Whariki. New entrant teachers’ beliefs about mathematics learning and teaching were similar to those of kindergarten teachers – children learned through having fun, solving problems, and doing things in a real-life context. However, new entrant teachers also had clear expectations of the skills five-year-olds needed to know on their entry to school. When children did not appear to <b>possess</b> <b>these</b> <b>skills,</b> teachers focused on remediation of the perceived deficits. In practice, new entrant teachers directed children’s learning based on their beliefs about what children needed to know to be successful at school. This approach lead to structured and managed environments with little regard for children’s prior-to-school knowledge and experiences. These inconsistencies in mathematics teaching and learning between schools and kindergartens could be minimised with professional development for teachers that focused on developing the relationships between teachers in both settings...|$|R
40|$|More {{than one}} million {{students}} earned a bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree in psychology {{over the course of}} the past 13 years, and the popularity of psychology as an undergraduate degree continues to grow. If the number of students majoring in psychology continues to increase at comparable rates, an additional one million psychology majors will graduate {{over the course of the}} next decade (National Center for Education Statistics, 2011). In other words, our graduates, armed with scientific reasoning skills (Halonen, Bosack, Clay, 2 ̆ 6 McCarthy, 2003) will be psychologically literate citizens positioned to convey the core elements of the discipline to the larger population. Psychological literacy is the capacity to apply psychology using critical thinking with sufficient depth to examine complex problems. Achieving psychological literacy requires a multi-layered developmental model in order to educate students to a level that allows them to <b>possess</b> and demonstrate <b>these</b> <b>skills.</b> A student graduating with an undergraduate degree in psychology should have the full set of scientific reasoning skills that are central to the discipline of psychology.

The palpable truth, that changes are the additional burden on the manager’s shoulders. The assumption is that not all managers have the capability to carry the burden successfully to attain the targets. The Coffee Chain is one of the identifiable hospitality industry has high sensitivity to the external environmental changes. To survive in the competitive environment, coffee chains must have a vision to react quickly to the changing business models. To be successful in the industry, there are winning techniques proposed in the competency of people management. This study investigated the skill set of the managers to the competency in people management while implementing change in the organization. The questionnaire was constructed, tested and managed to a total of 447 individuals in the coffee chain organizations in China. Total 447 usable surveys were analyzed using Microsoft excel and Chi-Square analysis to test the study hypotheses. The result showed that managers motivating, communication, trust, empowerment and delegating skills for implementing change have a positive and significant impact on the employee's in the coffee organizations in China. This study suggests the value of interpersonal skills in successfully implementing change, specifically the abilities to motivate, communicate, and create supportive environments for teams.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the following expatriate issues as related to the hospitality industry, from the perspective of practitioners: the most important management skills hotel expatriates should <b>possess,</b> whether <b>these</b> <b>skills</b> vary by the country of origin of the expatriate and parent company, and the most effective cross‐cultural training activities provided by hotel companies. Design/methodology/approach – Data for this exploratory study was obtained from a sample of 66 respondents from lodging organizations with membership in the International Hotel and Restaurant Association (IH 2 ̆ 6 RA). Data was collected by means of self‐administered, web‐based surveys. Findings – Participants in this study indicate that expatriate management skills vary in importance for hotel expatriates. The results of the analysis of variance demonstrate that the importance placed on the different expatriate management skills varies based on country of origin of both the expatriate and the parent company. Respondents and companies originating in different countries place more importance on certain expatriate management skills than others. Analyses also indicate that seven of nine cross‐cultural training activities provided by the parent company are perceived to be effective for the success of an expatriate assignment. Practical implications – This study suggests that opportunities do exist for international hotel companies to better prepare hotel expatriates for foreign assignments by integrating more effectively issues of cultural awareness into their preparation programs. Additionally, although it may appear counter‐intuitive for a future expatriate to focus on the structure and processes of the home company before embarking on a foreign assignment, the results of this study suggest that such knowledge is very valuable. Originality/value – While studies investigating expatriation management in the mainstream literature have been growing recently, only a handful of published studies have explored the issue in the hotel industry. Answers to the research questions that guided this study add to our knowledge and enhance our understanding of the issues related to expatriation management within the context of the hotel industry. The present study generated fruitful avenues, especially with regard to the issues related to the variation of management skills according to the country of origin of participants and parent company...|$|R
