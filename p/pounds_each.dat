5|$|The gongs weigh roughly {{from two}} pounds to three <b>pounds</b> <b>each,</b> and have {{dimensions}} of 6 to 10inches for their diameters and 3 to 5inches for their height. Traditionally {{they were made}} from bronze but due to the disruption and loss of trade routes between the islands of Borneo and Mindanao during World War II, resulting in loss of access to necessary metal ores, and the subsequent post-war use of scrap metal, brass gongs with shorter decaying tones are now commonplace.|$|E

5|$|In article {{published}} by the Guardian newspaper, the community importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae a young girl {{at the age of}} 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare lung tissue disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the US to have a life or death operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Power Jam FM raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM joined forces to help; both of which helped raise thousands of <b>pounds</b> <b>each.</b> With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that {{had it not been for}} Power Jam FM, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, Sanjae would have died.|$|E
25|$|During Richardson's life, his {{printing}} press produced about 10,000 pieces, including novels, historical texts, Acts of Parliament, and newspapers, making his print house {{one of the}} most productive and diverse in the eighteenth century. He wanted to keep the press in his family, but {{after the death of his}} four sons and a nephew, his {{printing press}} would be left in his will to his only surviving male heir, a second nephew. This happened to be a nephew whom Richardson did not trust; he doubted the younger man's abilities as a printer. Richardson's fears proved well-founded, for after his death the press stopped producing quality works and eventually stopped printing altogether. Richardson owned copyrights to most of his works, and these were sold after his death. They were sold in twenty-fourth shares, with shares in Clarissa bringing in 25 <b>pounds</b> <b>each</b> and those for Grandison bringing in 20 <b>pounds</b> <b>each.</b> Shares in Pamela, sold in sixteenths, went for 18 <b>pounds</b> <b>each.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} definite recorded {{performance of}} Titus was on 24 January 1594, when Philip Henslowe noted {{a performance by}} Sussex's Men of Titus & ondronicus. Although Henslowe doesn't specify a theatre, it was most likely The Rose. Repeated performances were staged on 28 January and 6 February. On 5 and 12 June, Henslowe recorded two further performances of the play, at the Newington Butts Theatre by the combined Admiral's Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men. The 24 January show earned three pounds eight shillings, and the performances on 29 January and 6 February earned two <b>pounds</b> <b>each,</b> making it the most profitable play of the season. The next recorded performance was on 1 January 1596, when a troupe of London actors, possibly Chamberlain's Men, performed the play during the Christmas festivities at Burley-on-the-Hill in the manor of Sir John Harington, Baron of Exton.|$|E
25|$|The keel {{consisted}} of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. In stormy weather, {{holes in the}} prow would partially fill with water when the ship pitched forward, thus lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Treasure ships also used floating anchors cast off {{the sides of the}} ship in order to increase stability. The stern had two 2.5 m (8 foot) iron anchors weighing over a thousand <b>pounds</b> <b>each,</b> used for mooring offshore. Like many Chinese anchors, these had four flukes set at a sharp angle against the main shaft. Watertight compartments were also used to add strength to the treasure ships. The ships also had a balanced rudder which could be raised and lowered, creating additional stability like an extra keel. The balanced rudder placed as much of the rudder forward of the stern post as behind it, making such large ships easier to steer. Unlike a typical fuchuan warship, the treasure ships had nine staggered masts and twelve square sails, increasing its speed. Treasure ships also had 24 cast-bronze cannons with a maximum range of 240 to 275 m (800–900feet). However, treasure ships were considered luxury ships rather than warships. As such, they lacked the fuchuan's raised platforms or extended planks used for battle.|$|E
50|$|At about 13:25, {{and again}} at a range of over 8 mi, Tōgō's battleships opened fire on Vitgeft's {{flagship}} and Retvizan, hitting the latter 12 times. By about 13:30 the Russian flagship had returned fire, knocking out Tōgō's wireless communications with two 305 mm shell direct hits at this extreme range. For nearly half an hour the two battleship fleets <b>pounded</b> <b>each</b> other, slowly closing their range, until by 14:05 they reached about 3.5 mi, at which time both fleets let loose with their secondary 155 mm guns. As the fleets continued to <b>pound</b> <b>each</b> other with all available guns, Tōgō's flagship {{was beginning to feel}} its wounds, and he tried to turn his vessel a bit, due to the hits she was taking (she ended up being hit 20 times), and urgently tried to have his cruisers engage the Russian battleline. But with his radio shot out, he had to rely on flag signals and radio relays from accompanying warships.|$|R

25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower <b>pounds.</b> <b>Each</b> end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E
