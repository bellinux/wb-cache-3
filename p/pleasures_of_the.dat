5|$|On 31 March 1731, The Author's Farce was {{paired with}} the Tom Thumb remake, The Tragedy of Tragedies, as a {{replacement}} for The Letter Writers, the original companion piece. Although both Tragedy of Tragedies and The Author's Farce were main shows, they alternated on the billing until the 18 June 1731 performance, the final showing of any Fielding play in the Little Theatre except for a 12 May 1732 benefit show of The Author's Farce. The last documented non-puppet version was performed on 28 March 1748 by Theophilus Cibber as a two-act companion piece for a benefit show. The <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town act was performed as a one-act play outside London throughout the century, including a 15-show run at Norwich in 1749 and during the 1750s, and a production at York during the 1751–52 theatre season. Additionally, there were benefit shows that included the third act at a variety of locations, including Dublin, on 19 December 1763 and Edinburgh in 1763. There were also many performances of the puppet theatre versions, including a travelling show by Thomas Yeates, titled Punch's Oratory, or The <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, which started in 1734.|$|E
5|$|The Author's Farce and the <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town is a {{play by the}} English {{playwright and}} novelist Henry Fielding, first {{performed}} on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket. Written {{in response to the}} Theatre Royal's rejection of his earlier plays, The Author's Farce was Fielding's first theatrical success. The Little Theatre allowed Fielding the freedom to experiment, and to alter the traditional comedy genre. The play ran during the early 1730s and was altered for its run starting 21 April 1730 and again in response to the Actor Rebellion of 1733. Throughout its life, the play was coupled with several different plays, including The Cheats of Scapin and Fielding's Tom Thumb.|$|E
5|$|The Author's Farce and the <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town {{was written}} during 1729. The first press {{announcement}} of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the Daily Post, stating {{that it was in}} rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play was expected to be a popular entertainment. It opened on Easter Monday, 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside The Cheats of Scapin. The last act was later made into the companion piece to Hurlothrumbo for one show.|$|E

5|$|The {{first and}} second acts deal with the {{attempts}} of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled The <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's choice of a husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which {{the characters in the}} puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities.|$|E
5|$|Most of Fielding's plays {{were written}} in five acts, but The Author's Farce was written in three. The opening {{introduces}} the main character, Harry Luckless, and his attempts to woo Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood. The play begins {{in much the same}} way as Fielding's earlier romance-themed comedies, but quickly becomes a different type of play, mocking the literary and theatrical establishment. Luckless is trying to become a successful writer, but lacks the income that would allow him to concentrate on his writing. Although others try to support him financially, Luckless refuses their help; when his friend, Witmore, pays his rent behind his back, Luckless steals the money from Mrs. Moneywood. In the second act, Luckless seeks assistance to help finish his play, The <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, but is poorly advised, and the work is rejected by his local theatre. Luckless revises his play and succeeds in finding an alternative venue, leading to the third act, in which the work is performed as a puppet show, with actors taking the place of the puppets.|$|E
25|$|Also the Buddha preached a Kama Sutra, {{which is}} located in the Atthakavagga (sutra number 1). This Kama Sutra, however, is of a very {{different}} nature as it warns against the dangers that come with the search for <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senses.|$|E

25|$|Simple hedonism is {{the view}} that {{physical}} pleasure is the ultimate good. However, the ancient philosopher Epicurus used the word 'pleasure' in {{a more general sense}} that encompassed a range of states from bliss to contentment to relief.

25|$|R. Albert Mohler, Jr., {{the ninth}} {{president}} of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky states,Evangelical couples may, at times, choose to use contraceptives in order to plan their families and enjoy the <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marital bed. The couple must consider all these issues with care, and must be truly open to the gift of children. The moral justification for using contraceptives must be clear in the couple's mind, and fully consistent with the couple's Christian commitments.|$|E

Tom incurs large debts, forcing Sir Thomas to sell the church position that {{would have gone to}} Tom's younger brother, Edmund. Eventually, Tom becomes gravely ill due to his dissolute lifestyle, helping to teach him the error of his ways.|$|E

25|$|Ajaan Mun {{asserted}} {{that the practice of}} jhana was still possible even in modern times, and that meditative concentration was necessary on the Buddhist path. Ajaan Mun stated that one's meditation topic must be keeping in line with one's temperament — everyone is different, so the meditation method used should be different for everybody. Ajaan Mun said the meditation topic one chooses should be congenial and enthralling, but also give one a sense of unease and dispassion for ordinary living and the sensual <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
25|$|Denis de Rougemont {{said that}} the troubadours were {{influenced}} by Cathar doctrines which rejected the <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flesh {{and that they were}} metaphorically addressing the spirit and soul of their ladies. Rougemont also said that courtly love subscribed to the code of chivalry, and therefore a knight's loyalty was always to his King before his mistress. Edmund Reiss claimed it was also a spiritual love, but a love that had more in common with Christian love, or caritas. On the other hand, scholars such as Mosché Lazar claim it was adulterous sexual love with physical possession of the lady the desired end.|$|E
25|$|In the jousting match Lancelot easily defeats {{all three}} knights. He wounds Sir Lionel, who fights him last, {{so badly that}} the crowd thinks he is dead. But the dismay of the crowd turns to awe as Lancelot's distraught cries for Sir Lionel to live {{seemingly}} resurrect a dead man. Reflecting the adoration of the crowd, Guinevere finds herself {{falling in love with}} Lancelot. She does not wish to violate her marriage vows, however, and wishes Lancelot would leave Camelot ("Before I Gaze at You Again"). By some unfortunate twist of fate, Lancelot, in spite of his boasts that he is immune to <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flesh, is also madly in love with Guinevere, and is similarly torn by the conflict between this love and his devotion to Arthur. Arthur makes Lancelot a Knight of the Round Table. As it happens, the shrewd King Arthur guesses that Lancelot and Guinevere have feelings for each other, but hopes it will blow over, as he does not wish to upset the tranquility of Camelot. He soliloquizes to his sword Excalibur, that they will rise to the challenges they will all face, together.|$|E

500|$|Robert Christgau, who {{had been}} so {{critical}} of <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Harbor and Ochs's guitar skills eight years earlier, wrote warmly of Ochs in his obituary in The Village Voice. [...] "I came around to liking Phil Ochs' music, guitar included," [...] Christgau wrote. [...] "My affection [...] no doubt prejudiced me, so it is worth [...] that many observers who care more for folk music than I do remember both his compositions and his vibrato tenor {{as close to the}} peak of the genre." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Ochs—now {{managed by}} his brother Michael—left Elektra for A Records and moved to Los Angeles, California.

For his A albums, Ochs moved away from simply produced solo acoustic guitar performances and experimented with ensemble and even orchestral instrumentation, [...] "baroque-folk", {{in the hopes of}} producing a pop-folk hybrid that would be a hit.|$|E

[...] French newspaper Le Figaro wrote, [...] "People were craving the simple <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea and the sun. For women, wearing a bikini signaled a kind of second liberation.

500|$|Nicolas Sammond {{argues that}} the film is [...] "an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child-rearing" [...] and that the film is [...] "ultimately an assimilationist fable".

500|$|Reflections further {{differs from}} The Eolian Harp {{by looking at}} {{problems}} within Coleridge's marriage, especially when the union distracts him from the world outside of his home. The poem expresses desire for solitude and confinement and emphasises {{the difference between the}} worlds within and outside of the cottage. Overall, there is focus on the relationship of the private to the public spheres. When engaged with the outside world the narrator is separate from mankind, yet his focus is devoted to helping mankind, which contains religious and political components. The image of [...] "One Life" [...] compels him to abandon the sensual <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cottage, to pursue a path of altruism.|$|E
