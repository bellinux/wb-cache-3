In the apartment, Bogart hides out while he heals from plastic surgery, and plots to clear his name. Bogart wearily ascends the nearby Filbert Steps in one scene, on his way to the Malloch Building. Modern-day residents have been known to put a cutout of Bogart in the street-facing window of Number 10.|$|E

5|$|A {{letter of}} Hadrian written from Egypt to his {{brother-in-law}} Servianus is quoted at length (and {{was accepted as}} genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century). Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. The letter {{is said to have}} been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage. A <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.|$|E
5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall behind the Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him.

5|$|Alan and Tequila {{discover}} a hidden <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital leading to Wong's arsenal. They are confronted by Mad Dog, who engages them. Wong {{arrives at the}} hospital and has all the patients, police officers and staff taken hostage. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and Tequila liberate the kidnapped patients and police officers. Pang evacuates the lobby while police detective Teresa Chang (Teresa Mo) goes to the maternity ward to organize evacuating the babies. Alan and Tequila continue fighting gangsters until they find Mad Dog. While Tequila goes to assist Chang with the babies, Alan and Mad Dog find themselves in a standoff with a group of patients caught in the middle. They slowly put their guns down and offer the patients safe passage, until Wong appears and shoots them all. An enraged Mad Dog shoots Wong's gun out of his hand. Wong shoots and kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} five years, Rambola {{was adopted}} by Narharidas, a Vaishnava ascetic of Ramananda's monastic order who is {{believed}} to be the fourth disciple of Ramananda, or alternately, the disciple of Anantacharya. Rambola was given the Virakta Diksha (Vairagi initiation) with the new name of Tulsidas. Tulsidas narrates the dialogue that took place during the first meeting with his guru in a <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vinayapatrika. When he was seven years old, his Upanayana ("sacred thread ceremony") was performed by Narharidas on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of Magha (January–February) at Ayodhya, a pilgrimage-site related to Rama. Tulsidas started his learning at Ayodhya. After some time, Narharidas took him to a particular Varaha Kshetra Soron (a holy place with temple dedicated to Varaha – the boar avatar of Vishnu), where he first narrated the Ramayana to Tulsidas. Tulsidas mentions this in the Ramcharitmanas.|$|E
5|$|Constructed by the Ruthvens {{after they}} {{acquired}} the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents {{the final stage}} of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children. The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes. The rectangular Lodging is immediately {{to the north of the}} de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.|$|E

5|$|Humiliated by the revolt, naval {{officers}} {{and the president of}} Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The officers believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. The rebels, believing an attack was imminent, sailed their ships out of Guanabara Bay and spent the night of 23–24 November at sea, only returning during daylight. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser , Bahias sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns.

5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} a <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced {{that all the}} actions of the Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized {{that he would have to}} go to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested {{power back}} in the state {{legislature}} from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes, followed by white primaries; these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans. In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote. As a result, the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy.

5|$|Manetho's Epitome {{states that}} Amenhotep I ruled Egypt {{for twenty years}} and seven months or twenty-one years, {{depending}} on the source. While Amenhotep I's highest attested regnal year is only his Year 10, Manetho's statement is confirmed by a <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tomb autobiography of a magician named Amenemhet. This explicitly states that he served under Amenhotep I for 21 Years. Thus, in the high chronology, Amenhotep I is given a reign from around 1546 to 1526 BC and, in the low chronology, from around 1526 to 1506 BC or 1525 to 1504 BC, though individual scholars may ascribe dates to his reign that vary from these by a few years.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} an indication of the peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being a threat to the Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as an indication of the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

5|$|When Maximinus {{received}} {{notice that}} Constantine {{had succeeded in}} his campaign against Maxentius, he issued a new letter restoring Christians their former liberties. The text of this letter, which is preserved in Eusebius's Historia Ecclesiastica, however, suggests that the initiative was Maximinus's alone, and not that of Constantine or Licinius. It is also the only <b>passage</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancient sources providing Maximinus's rationale for his actions, without the hostility of Lactantius and Eusebius. Maximinus states that he supported Diocletian and Galerius's early legislation but, upon being made Caesar, came to realize the drain such policies would have on his labor force, and began to employ persuasion without coercion. He goes on to assert that he resisted petitions from Nicomedians to forbid Christians from their city (an event Eusebius does not otherwise record), and that when he accepted the demands of deputations from other cities he was only following imperial custom. Maximinus concludes his letter by referencing the letter he wrote after Galerius's edict, asking that his subordinates be lenient. He does not refer to his early letters, which encouraged avid persecution.|$|E

Wandering in the hidden passages, Paul is attacked by the Cat and left for dead. He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle. The police arrive and arrest the Cat, who is Charlie Wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice.
