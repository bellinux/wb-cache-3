5|$|Like most of Southern California, the {{majority}} of San Diego's current area was originally occupied by chaparral, a <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. The endangered Torrey pine has the bulk of its population in San Diego in a stretch of protected chaparral along the coast. The steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create {{a number of different}} habitats within the city limits, including tidal marsh and canyons. The chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire, and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century, due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.|$|E
5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} lignotuber, which stores energy and {{nutrients}} {{as a resource for}} rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire {{as the rest of the}} plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of Alfred Wegener's (1880–1930) theory of continental drift 1912 gave additional impetus to comparative physiology {{and the study}} of biogeography while ecology in the 1930s contributed the important ideas of <b>plant</b> <b>community,</b> succession, community change, and energy flows. From 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as Eugene Odum (1913–2002) formulated many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, emphasising relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) as key factors in the field. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E

5|$|The genus is {{classified}} in the subtribe Embothriinae of the Proteaceae, along with the tree waratahs (Alloxylon) from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and the South American genera Oreocallis and Embothrium. Almost all of these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely pre-dated the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. Propylipollis ambiguus (formerly Triporopollenites ambiguus) is the oldest identifiable member of the Embothriinae. It is known only from pollen deposits, and was originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of T.truncata, Alloxylon pinnatum and Oreocallis grandiflora. Fossil remains of Telopea truncata have been recovered from early to middle Pleistocene strata at Regatta Point in western Tasmania. The leaves are small, and these beds housed a subalpine <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> {{in what is now}} lowland terrain. Leaves identical to (and classified as) Telopea truncata have been recovered from early Oligocene deposits around Lake Cethana near Sheffield.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of common mycelial networks {{is thought to}} have effects upon the <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> involved with them through their ectomycorrhizal connections. This can range from providing access to larger nutrient pools, mediating competition, and allowing resources and nutrients to be shared among individuals linked in this manner.|$|E
25|$|California shrubland, {{commonly}} known as chaparral, is a widespread <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> of low growing species, typically on arid sloping areas of the California Coast Ranges or western foothills of the Sierra Nevada.

25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that communities of EcM fungi differ across soil type gradients in a tropical system. However, the particular study notes that the mechanism driving this differentiation is not clear, and the variance could be in response to the soil physiochemical environment, <b>plant</b> <b>community,</b> or both (3.5.a). Other studies offer evidence to strengthen the idea that EcM communities are indeed affected by soil environment both in the field and in the lab.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the compositions, productivity, and nutritional values of <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> along a grazing gradient {{in order to test}} the pastoralists' TEK of grazing lands by the scientific approach. We studied <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> along a grazing gradient and compared the following characteristics: (1) compositions of the <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> according to growth form (Gimingham 1951);(2) productivity of these <b>plant</b> <b>communities,</b> which was measured by using the movable-cage method; and (3) protein content of the plants, because protein is important for livestock nutrition (Riney 1982).|$|R

25|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{may also}} affect the behaviour of natural enemies of herbivorous species in a multi-trophic defense/predation association. For instance, terpenoid production attracts natural enemies of herbivores to damaged plants. These enemies can reduce numbers of invertebrate herbivores substantially {{and may not}} be attracted in the absence of endophytic symbionts. Multi-trophic interactions can have cascading consequences for the entire <b>plant</b> <b>community,</b> with the potential to vary widely depending on the combination of fungal species infecting a given plant and the abiotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{their report}} on the status and {{potential}} impacts of alien invasive organisms in the fynbos biome, MacDonald & Jarman (1984) predicted that Theba pisana would have very little impact on ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, energy flow and sediment dynamics or on the germination and succession processes of the <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> itself. However, the snail could seriously impact directly on fynbos plants, by feeding on them, and also displace native herbivores by competing with them for resources, and these effects have not been studied.|$|E
25|$|The spores {{of these}} fungi are {{dispersed}} {{either by the}} actions of being unearthed and broken apart, or by ingestion and subsequent excretion. Some studies even suggest that passage through an animal's gut promotes the germination of these spores, although {{it is by no means}} necessary for a majority of fungal species. Regardless, the ability of these certain mammals to spread fungal spores is thus indirectly related to <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> structure, by way of the pivotal role that EcM fungi play in plant nutrition and productivity.|$|E

25|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} of resources can influence <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> composition, diversity and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated soil resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass prairie restoration project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which {{on its own}} was insufficient to insure species diversity in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings {{were consistent with the}} theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, best adapted to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining the community structure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>community</b> {{composition}} {{can change}} dramatically over a gradient of groundwater depth: plants {{that can only}} survive in wetland conditions can be replaced by plants that are tolerant of drier conditions as groundwater levels are reduced, causing habitat community shifts {{and in some cases}} complete loss of riparian species. Studies have also shown that decreases in groundwater levels may favor the invasion and persistence of certain exotic invasive species such as Saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis), which do not appear to show the same degree of physiologic water stress as native species when subjected to lower groundwater levels.|$|E
25|$|Cattle have a {{propensity}} to aggregate around water, {{which can be}} detrimental to riparian ecosystems. While native ungulates such as deer are commonly found in riparian zones, livestock may trample or graze down native plants, creating an unnatural amount and type of disturbance that riparian species have not evolved to tolerate. Livestock grazing {{has been shown to}} reduce areal cover of native plant species, create disturbance frequencies that favor exotic annual weeds, and alter <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> composition. For example, in an arid South African ecosystem, grazing was found to cause a reduction of grasses, sedges, and tree species and an increase in non-succulent shrubs.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the composition, structure and spatial distribution of <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> at Wilbur Wright Fish and Wildlife Area (WWFWA) in order to provide baseline information to which future conditions can be compared. The <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> of WWFWA were delineated, sampled, and subsequently classified using the framework of the National Vegetation Classification System. Data were collected for three strata of vegetation: overstory, understory and groundcover. Five permanent plots were established in the forested communities to monitor changes in vegetation over time. Eleven general habitat types were described for WWFWA. <b>Plant</b> <b>communities</b> varied from highly diverse mature woods to successional communities dominated by exotic vegetation. The composition and structure of <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> appears to be closely related to previous land-use.

25|$|The Nockamixon Cliffs are {{situated}} {{along the river}} {{in such a way}} that the north facing cliffs in Pennsylvania receive little to no direct sunlight, causing their temperatures to be cooler than normal. The cool habitat supports an alpine-Arctic <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> that is very unusual for the latitude of Delaware Canal State Park. The south facing cliffs in New Jersey at Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park have a nearly opposite habitat. They receive a high amount of sunshine, which makes the area near the cliffs warmer and drier than usual, creating a habitat for plants that normally thrive in much more arid areas.|$|E
25|$|Fire has {{important}} {{effects on the}} abiotic (non-living) components of an ecosystem, particularly the soil. Fire can affect the soil by direct contact with it and by its effects on the <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> associated with it. By removing overhead vegetation, fire can lead to increased solar radiation on the soil surface by day, resulting in greater warming, and to greater cooling through the loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves left to intercept rain will allow more moisture to reach the soil surface. In addition, plant transpiration (the process by which water travels through plants and evaporates through pores in the leaves) will be reduced following a fire, allowing the soil to retain more moisture.|$|E
25|$|In the Blyth estuary in Suffolk {{in eastern}} England, the mid-estuary reclamations (Angel and Bulcamp marshes) that were {{abandoned}} in the 1940s {{have been replaced by}} tidal flats with compacted soils from agricultural use overlain with a thin veneer of mud. Little vegetation colonisation has occurred in the last 60–75 years and has been attributed to a combination of surface elevations too low for pioneer species to develop, and poor drainage from the compacted agricultural soils acting as an aquaclude. Terrestrial soils of this nature need to adjust from fresh to saline interstitial water by a change in the chemistry and the structure of the soil, accompanied with fresh deposition of estuarine sediment, before salt marsh vegetation can establish. The vegetation structure, species richness, and <b>plant</b> <b>community</b> composition of salt marshes naturally regenerated on reclaimed agricultural land can be compared to adjacent reference salt marshes to assess the success of marsh regeneration.|$|E

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>communities</b> of the Kolah-Ghazi National Park {{have been}} studied. The park {{with a wide}} {{diversity}} of fauna and flora species is located 36 Km south of Isfahan. 214 plant species were collected {{for the purposes of}} this study. <b>Plant</b> <b>communities</b> of the park are of an aridland vegetation type. Minimal areas of the <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> were determined using nested plots technique. After studying the Species/Area curves, a l 00 -square-meter quadrat was employed to collect the cover and density data for each species. The cover data were analysed to determine <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> using the ordination method. Crown cover of the vegetation was found to be poor and varied from zero to a maximum of five percent in the park. The following species form the major <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> in the park: Artemisia sieberi, Anabasis aphylla, Acantholimon spp., Cousinia piptocephala, Ebenus stellata, Pteropyrum aucheri & Scariola orientalis. The combination of these species with others forms <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> and subcommunities. The overlapping of habitats makes mosaics which cause the formation of ecotones, thus increasing the diversity of the subcommunities in the park. Mesophytic <b>plant</b> <b>communities</b> are narrowly scattered along streams.
