40|$|With the {{projected}} increase in older adults, the older driver population {{is estimated to}} be the fastest growing cohort of drivers among many developed countries. The increased physical fragility associated with the aging process make older adults who drive private automobiles a vulnerable road user group. Much of the current research on older drivers’ behaviours and practices rely on self-report data. This paper explores the utility of in-vehicle devices (Global Positioning Systems and <b>recording</b> <b>accelerometers)</b> in assessing older drivers’ habitual driving behaviours. Seventy-eight older drivers (above 65 years of age), from the Australian Capital Territory, Australia, participated in the current study. The driving behaviours and practices of these participants were prospectively assessed over a two-week period. The use of combined GPS and <b>recording</b> <b>accelerometers</b> to improve understanding of older drivers’ driving behaviours show promise within the current study. The challenges of using multiple in-vehicle devices in assessing driving beahaviours and performances within this cohort will be discussed. Based on the current findings, recommendations for future research regarding the use of in-vehicle devices among the older driver cohort are proposed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{objective}} measurement of physical activity (PA), <b>recorded</b> by <b>accelerometers.</b> Chapter 2 describes the objective measurement of PA using accelerometers in contrast to subjective measurements like PA questionnaires. Chapter 3 presents the basic assumption on PA. Contrary to the cutpoint method, it is more realistic to assume that human activity behavior consists of a sequence of non-overlapping, distinguishable activities that can be represented by a mean intensity level. The <b>recorded</b> <b>accelerometer</b> counts scatter around this mean level. In Chapter 4, two novel approaches to better capture PA are developed and implemented. The Hidden Markov models are stochastic models that allow fitting a Markov chain with a predefined number of activities to the data. Expectile regression utilizing the Whittaker smoother with an L 0 -penalty is introduced as a second innovative approach. Expectile regression is compared to HMMs and the cutpoint method in a simulation study. Chapter 5 {{presents the results of}} four studies on PA. Chapter 6 summarizes and discusses the findings of the previous chapters and ends with an outlook on future research...|$|R

The proposed scheme is applied in a biomedical context for the analysis of <b>recorded</b> <b>accelerometer</b> data: the aim is to retrieve three types of periodic activities (walking, biking, and running) from a time-frequency representation of the data. The main interest of the use of the Wasserstein distance lies in the fact that it is less sensitive to the location of the frequency peaks than to the global structure of the frequency pattern, allowing us to detect activities almost independently of their speed or incline. Our system is tested on a 24 -subject corpus: results show that the use of Wasserstein distance combined with some supervised learning techniques allows us to compare with some more complex classification systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Sleep plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} life of every human. The prevalence of sleep disorders has increased significantly, now affecting up to 50 % of the general population. Sleep is usually analyzed by extracting a hypnogram containing sleep stages. The gold standard method polysomnography (PSG) requires subjects to stay overnight in a sleep laboratory and to wear a series of obtrusive devices. This work presents an easy to use method to perform somnography at home using unobtrusive motion sensors. Ten healthy male subjects were recorded during two con-secutive nights. Sensors from the Shimmer platform were placed in the bed to <b>record</b> <b>accelerometer</b> data, while reference hypnograms were collected using a SOMNOwatch system. A series of filters were used to extract a motion feature in 30 second epochs from the accelerometer signals. The feature was used together with the ground truth information to train a Naive Bayes classifiers that distinguished wakefulness, REM and non-REM sleep. Additionally the algorithm was implemented on an Android mobile phone. Averaged over all subjects, the classifier had a mean accuracy of 79. 0 % (SD 9. 2 %) for the three classes. The mobile phone implementation was able to run in realtime during all experiments. In future this will lead to a method for simple and unobtrusive somnography using mobile phones. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multi-sensor fetal movement (FetMov) detection {{system based on}} a time–frequency (TF) signal processing approach. Fetal motor activity is clinically useful as a core aspect of fetal screening for well-being to reduce the current high incidence of fetal deaths in the world. FetMov are present in early gestation but become more complex and sustained as the fetus progresses through gestation. A decrease in FetMov is an important element to consider {{for the detection of}} fetal compromise. Current methods of FetMov detection include maternal perception, which is known to be inaccurate, and ultrasound imaging which is intrusive and costly. An alternative passive method for the detection of FetMov uses solid-state accelerometers, which are safe and inexpensive. This paper {{describes a}} digital signal processing (DSP) based experimental approach to the detection of FetMov from <b>recorded</b> <b>accelerometer</b> signals. The paper provides an overview of the significant measurement and signal processing challenges, followed by an approach that uses quadratic time–frequency distributions (TFDs) to appropriately deal with the non-stationary nature of the signals.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} of a reduction in children’s physical activity in India in the last decade. Our objective was to assess whether size and body composition at birth are associated with physical activity in school-aged children. Children from a prospective observational cohort study born in Mysore, South India between 1997 and 1998 (n 5663) had neonatal anthropometric measurements made within 72 h of delivery [weight, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), chest, abdomen and head circumference, crown–heel, crown–buttock and leg length, triceps and subscapular skinfolds]. At 6 – 10 years, children (n 5449) were asked to wear AM 7164 or GT 1 M Actigraph accelerometers for 7 days. Body composition was measured within 6 months of activity monitoring. Arm muscle area at birth and time of activity monitoring was calculated from MUAC and skinfold measurements. Activity outcome measures were: mean accelerometer counts per minute (cpm); counts per day and proportion {{of time spent in}} moderate and vigorous activity. The mean (S.

Several studies lacking measures {{of physical activity}} level (PAL) assigned low active levels to obtain pERs. Objective: We applied objective physical activity measures to current methods to quantify dietary reporting errors and compared associations with anthropometric and dietary variables among plausible and implausible reporters. Design: This study included 2868 adolescents {{with an average age}} of 13 y. Three day dietary <b>records</b> <b>accelerometers</b> and dual energy X ray absorptiometry were used to assess diet activity and body composition respectively. Three variations of physical activity coefficients were used l) assigning low physical activity coefficients (PA(low)) 2) calculating PAL values (PA(PAL)) and 3) applying minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (PA(MVPA)). Results: Of the total participants 51. 5 % 51. 8 % and 37. 1 % of the PA(low), PA(PAL) and PA(MVPA) groups respectively were classified as underreporters and 40. 8 % 37. 9 % and 42. 4 % of the respective groups were classified as plausible reporters. Underreporters had a higher body mass index body fat and waist circumference than did plausible reporters (P < 0. 001 for all). Overreporters had a lower weight and body fat than did plausible reporters (P < 0. 001 for all). Underreporters reported lower dairy and calcium intakes than did plausible reporters the results were attenuated with adjustment for total energy.

40|$|While {{the use of}} accelerometers in {{the aquatic}} {{environment}} becomes an increasingly used tool in remotely observing animals; however, the data obtained from deploying accelerometers still needs better understanding. Observations gathered by studies using accelerometers are largely limited to the identification of simple behaviours such as resting and swimming, yet fine-scale movements such as feeding and escape responses are mostly undetected. In this experiment, we aim to establish a link between acceleration traces and fast-start movements in the Great Sculpin (M. polyacanthocephalus) by the analysis of acceleration data from accelerometers and a high-speed video camera. Feeding events, escape events and spontaneous movements were triggered and observed using a 100 Hz <b>recording</b> <b>accelerometer</b> (Little Leonardo Ltd, Japan) and a high-speed video camera for n = 7 great sculpin. Kinematic comparison between acceleration obtained from accelerometers and high-speed video camera were performed using vector transformation, yet prove to be difficult {{due to differences in}} reference frames and different sources of error. To establish a link between behaviour and acceleration, statistical analysis shows that the signature of spontaneous events can be described by the variation of the magnitude of acceleration which is significantly lower in spontaneous events compared to fast-start movements. Most of this information is lost (50 %) if the accelerometer sampling rate is lower than 30 Hz. Furthermore, two parameters (the value of Amax the variation of acceleration in lateral and forward direction) allow us to differentiate between escape events and feeding events. These results are a valuable contribution to understanding acceleration data in the field and the issues associated with low sampling rates. ...|$|R
