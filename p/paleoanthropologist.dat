5|$|Although stem lemuriforms like Djebelemur {{may have}} been {{contemporaneous}} with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40mya according to the French <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Marc Godinot. This would conflict with the molecular clock estimates by evolutionary anthropologist Anne Yoder and others, which predict lemur–lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8mya.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 20thcentury, {{there was only}} one {{recognized}} species of fork-marked lemur, although size and coloration differences had been noted previously. After comparing museum specimens, <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Ian Tattersall and physical anthropologist Colin Groves recognized three new subspecies in 1991: the Pale fork-marked lemur (P.f.pallescens), Pariente's fork-marked lemur (P.f.parienti), and the Amber Mountain fork-marked lemur (P.f.electromontis). In 2001, Groves elevated all four subspecies to species status based on noticeable color, size, and body proportion differences between the fragmented populations. Although Tattersall disagreed with this promotion, citing inadequate information for the decision, the arrangement is generally accepted.|$|E

25|$|In early December 2004, Indonesian <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Teuku Jacob removed most of {{the remains}} from their repository, Jakarta's National Research Centre of Archaeology, with the {{permission}} of only one of the project team's directors and kept them for three months. Some scientists expressed the fear that important scientific evidence would be sequestered by a small group of scientists who neither allowed access by other scientists nor published their own research.

25|$|In 2002, <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Francesco Mallegni {{conducted}} DNA {{testing on}} the recently excavated bodies of Ugolino and his children.

Additional comparison to DNA from modern day members of the Gherardesca family leave Mallegni about 98 percent sure that he has identified the remains correctly. However, the forensic analysis discredits the allegation of cannibalism. Analysis of the rib bones of the Ugolino skeleton reveals traces of magnesium, but no zinc, implying he had consumed no meat {{in the months before}} his death. Ugolino also had few remaining teeth and {{is believed to have been}} in his 70s when he was imprisoned, making it further unlikely that he could have outlived and eaten his descendants in captivity. Additionally, Mallegni notes that the putative Ugolino skull was damaged; perhaps he did not ultimately die of starvation, although malnourishment is evident.|$|E

500|$|Mesopropithecus {{was named}} in 1905 by Herbert F. Standing using four skulls found at Ampasambazimba. He {{noted that the}} animal had {{characteristics}} of both Palaeopropithecus and the living sifakas (Propithecus). In 1936, Charles Lamberton defined Neopropithecus globiceps (based on one skull from Tsirave) and N. platyfrons (based on two skulls from Anavoha). [...] He thought that Neopropithecus was a separate, intermediate genus between Mesopropithecus and Propithecus. [...] In 1971, <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Ian Tattersall merged N. platyfrons into N. globiceps and Neopropithecus into Mesopropithecus.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Tattersall spotted what {{he thought}} was a color variant of the silky sifaka north of Vohemar in {{northeast}} Madagascar. [...] Describing it as such eight years later in The Primates of Madagascar, he not only cited its mostly white fur, but also uncharacteristic traits such as a patch of orange on its crown and tufted ears. [...] It was not observed again until 1986, when a team led by <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Elwyn L. Simons captured specimens for captive breeding and identified it as a new species, named as the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) in 1988.|$|E

Elephant hunting had been banned in 1973, but the ivory trade remained legal. By the 1980s, elephant poaching had become widespread {{due to the}} increasing price of ivory. In a May 1989 article, The New York Times described Tsavo National Park as [...] "an elephant graveyard - piles of bleached white elephant bones - instead of an elephant habitat".

500|$|The genus Mirza was resurrected in 1982 by American <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Ian Tattersall to {{represent}} an intermediate branch between Microcebus and Cheirogaleus, citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest Microcebus and locomotor behavior more closely aligned with Cheirogaleus. Adoption of Mirza was slow, though in 1994 {{it was used}} in the first edition of Lemurs of Madagascar by Conservation International. In 1993, primatologist Colin Groves initially favored the Microcebus classification in the second edition of Mammal Species of the World, but began supporting the resurrection of Mirza in 2001. In 1991, prior to adopting Mirza, Groves was the first to use the common name [...] "giant mouse lemur". Prior to that, they were popularly referred to as [...] "Coquerel's mouse lemur".|$|E
500|$|The giant mouse lemurs (members of {{the genus}} Mirza) are a genus of strepsirrhine primates. Two species have been {{formally}} described; the northern giant mouse lemur (Mirza zaza) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli). Like all other lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, where they {{are found in the}} western dry deciduous forests and further to the north in the Sambirano valley and Sahamalaza Peninsula. [...] First described in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs. In 1870, British zoologist John Edward Gray assigned them to their own genus, Mirza. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival {{of the genus}} by American <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Ian Tattersall in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.|$|E
500|$|The human lineage that {{remained}} in Africa eventually evolved into anatomically modern humans with modern-sized brains by about 200,000 years ago, and became common about 100,000 years ago, {{but did not}} become behaviourally modern until about 50,000 years ago. Citing the <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Richard Klein, Wade posits that such a great change must have been because of a neurological change, and was therefore genetic. This [...] "genetic revolution", as Wade calls it, facilitated the emergence of language and thus the ability to share thoughts and innovations. Wade discusses the evolutionary origins of language in chapter three, First Words. He references Noam Chomsky's theory of [...] "universal grammar" [...] – a term that refers to both the hard-wiring {{of the brain that}} allows children to learn grammatical rules, and the underlying grammatical similarities of all human languages. Wade cites a number of evolutionary psychologists for an explanation, including Robin Dunbar, who argues that language evolved because it was a more efficient way of establishing social bonds than grooming; Geoffrey Miller, who suggests that speech was a signal of intelligence and thus evolved through sexual selection; and Steven Pinker, who thinks that the ecological niche of humans required the sharing of knowledge. Wade writes that the genetic basis of language is linked to the FOXP2 gene, as it shows signs of significant change in humans but not in chimpanzees, and that mutations of it cause severe speech disorders.|$|E
40|$|Biogeography figured {{prominently}} {{in the formation of}} the modern natural sciences and played a crucial role in Darwin’s theory of natural selection. However, as an avenue of investigation, biogeography remained underdeveloped until the last half of the twentieth century when the scientific community at large accepted the legitimacy of plate tectonics. The investigation of the spatial and temporal distribution of life on earth was finally conjoined with investigations of earth’s geological history. <b>Paleoanthropologists</b> have long been focused on the spatial and temporal distribution of hominin species on the African landscape and beyond.

2500|$|Independent {{experts have}} raised concern about {{publicity}} exaggerating {{the importance of}} the find before information was available for scrutiny. Chris Beard, curator of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, was [...] "awestruck" [...] by the publicity machine but concerned that if the hype was exaggerated, it could damage the popularisation of science if the creature was not all that it was hyped up to be. <b>Paleoanthropologist</b> Elwyn Simons of Duke University stated that it is a wonderful specimen but most of the information had been previously known, and <b>paleoanthropologist</b> Peter Brown of the University of New England said that the paper had insufficient evidence that Darwinius was ancestral to the simians. Others have also criticized claims that the fossil represents the [...] "missing link in human evolution", arguing {{that there is no such}} thing unless evolution is visualized as a chain as there are an enormous number of missing branches, and that while the fossil is a primate, there is no evidence to suggest that its species is a direct ancestor of humans. ScienceBlogger Brian Switek questioned the sensationalist coverage of claims of ancestral relationships made before a full cladistic analysis, and in a column in The Times he stated that a unique opportunity to communicate science had been lost, with press releases forestalling the necessary discovery and debate which should now proceed.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the earlier}} {{significant}} contributors {{to the study of}} hand grips was orthopedic primatologist and <b>paleoanthropologist</b> John Napier, who proposed organizing the movements of the hand by their anatomical basis as opposed to work done earlier that had only used arbitrary classification.

[...] Simons acknowledged that the taxonomic interpretation was complicated, though he initially decided to classify under superfamily Hominoidea (apes) due to its flat and broad lower molars. [...] Its bizarre and specialized traits made it difficult to classify until the discovery of its skull, reported in 1994, showed it had a postorbital bar, proving that it was a strepsirrhine primate. [...] Plesiopithecus was then placed within a new superfamily, Plesiopithecoidea tentatively under [...] "Infraorder cf. Lorisiformes". [...] The superfamily has also been grouped under the infraorder Lemuriformes.|$|E
