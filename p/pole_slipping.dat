40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the phenomenon of}} 'pole slipping' in magnetic gears and couplings {{as a result of}} torque overload. Specifically, previously reported work on optimized servo speed control and pole-slip detection in magnetic gears is extended through {{the development of a new}} control scheme to prevent <b>pole</b> <b>slipping</b> due to combined controller and load torque overload. By utilizing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy, the controller's principal objective is to prevent the magnetic gear from <b>pole</b> <b>slipping</b> by invoking hard constraints on the amount of controller torque that can be applied for a given steady-state load torque. A custom demonstrator drivetrain incorporating a magnetic coupling (1 : 1 magnetic gear) is used to experimentally verify pole-slip prevention using an implementation of explicit MPC via multiparametric quadratic programming (mp-QP). It is shown that while conventional MPC is restricted to systems with relatively low sample rates, due to the need to solve the constrained optimization problem in real time, an alternative explicit form of MPC can be readily utilized at sample rates more typically found in electrical drive applications. The underlying principles and benefits afforded by the proposed techniques are validated using simulation and experimental measurements from the drivetrain test facility, using only motor-side sensor measurements and load-side state estimates via a discrete-time observer.

30|$|The {{boundary}} is stability {{limited to}} around 2500  MW, requiring security under contingency {{of either the}} eastern or western interconnectors. The limit can be increased to approximately 3300  MW with the arming of an operational tripping scheme (OTS). At day-ahead timescales the maximum capacity of the boundary is required to be planned such that the system does not experience any instability, unacceptable voltage condition, or overloading of any network assets for any credible system fault. The Security and Quality of Supply Standard (SQSS) defines the limits for these conditions [11], specifically it defines system instability in terms of <b>pole</b> <b>slipping</b> and poor damping.|$|E
40|$|New {{adaptive}} {{scheme for}} signal parameter measurement for generator monitoring and protection is presented. The algorithm {{is based on}} the orthogonal components of currents and voltages obtained with adaptive orthogonal filters. The filter data window length and coefficients are adapted according to coarsely estimated signal frequency. As a result, the measurements can be performed with high accuracy in wide frequency band conditions, i. e. also for generator start-up, etc. The measured signals are further used for training of artificial neural networks with the aim to design a robust and effective classifier of generator operation mode. The main attention is paid to the phenomena accompanying <b>pole</b> <b>slipping</b> and out-of-step conditions. Copyright © 2002 IFA...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} out-of-step {{protection systems}} such as: generator <b>pole</b> <b>slip</b> protections, {{out of step}} tripping protections, distance protections of step-up transformer, distance protections of transmission lines and transformers, power swing blocking, and special out-of-step protection. It is shown that all these protections make up a protection system, to which a setting concept uniform for the entire power system has to be applied. If a power system is inappropriately equipped with these protections, or their settings are inappropriate, they may operate unselectively, thus contributing {{to the development of}} power system blackouts. In the paper the concepts for a real power system are given for the two stages: target stage fully compliant with selectivity criteria, and transitional stage between the current and target stages...|$|R

60|$|Getting their poles {{beneath it}} they forced it upward, little by little. When they got half-way, a <b>pole</b> <b>slipped,</b> {{and for a}} few anxious moments the men {{strained}} every muscle to prevent the mass from rolling back, while their companion found a fresh rest for his pole. The log must be held: they could not jump clear in time. Breathing hard, with the sweat dripping from them, they raised it a foot or two, until it seemed possible to lift it on to the lower logs by a strenuous effort. They made the attempt; and one of the skids broke. Laying their shoulders beneath the mass, they struggled with it for their lives. If it overpowered them, they would be borne backward and crushed. With one support gone, it seemed impossible that they could lift it into place. For a few moments they held it, but did no more, though Jimmy felt the veins swell on his forehead and heard a strange buzzing in his ears. His mouth was dry, his heart beat painfully, and he knew he could not stand the cruel strain much longer. But there was no help available. They must conquer or be maimed.|$|R

60|$|To prevent Tent-poles from slipping.--When {{the tent}} is pitched in the {{ordinary}} way on a smooth rocky surface, there is considerable danger that {{the foot of the}} <b>pole</b> may <b>slip</b> whenever a gust of wind or other sudden impulse sways the tent. This danger is to be obviated on precisely the same principle as that by which builders secure their scaffolding-poles upon the smooth footways of a street: they put the foot of each pole into a bucket, filled with sand. As the base of the bucket is broad, the scaffolding is much less liable to slip, than if the narrow bases of the poles had rested directly upon the pavement.|$|R

40|$|PhD (Electrical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 The {{rotor shaft}} of a {{synchronous}} machine can experience severe mechanical stress due to torque pulsations during a pole-slip condition. All pole-slip protection relays {{currently on the}} market use the impedance pole-slip protection method to detect a pole-slip. No commercial relay currently available can predict accurately when a generator is about to experience a damaging pole-slip. All the relays will only trip a generator after it has pole-slipped one or more times. Severe mechanical damage could be caused to a machine after only one pole-slip. It is therefore essential to enhance pole-slip protection relays {{to such an extent}} that it can trip a generator before it <b>pole</b> <b>slips.</b> The proposed pole-slip protection function must predict when a generator will become unstable during a network fault. As soon as instability is predicted, the generator must be tripped before the fault is cleared to avoid damaging post-fault torque effects. Conventional impedance pole-slip protection methods are are also discussed and the shortcomings of impedance pole-slip protection are investigated. The new pole-slip protection function was designed by using PSCAD. Detailed PSCAD simulations on different network configurations proved that the new pole-slip protection function will trip a generator before a damaging pole-slip occurs. The new pole-slip protection function was also implemented on an ABB REM 543 multifunctional protection relay and tested on a RTDS. The concept of the new pole-slip function was successfully demonstrated on the protection relay. The operation of conventional impedance scheme relays was compared with the proposed pole-slip function for different fault conditions. Although the new pole-slip protection function is more complex than the existing impedance functions, it was concluded that similar skills are required to test and commission the new protection function. The new pole-slip function outperforms the impedance protection methods, since the new protection function can trip the generator before it pole-slips. Doctora...|$|R
60|$|Alpine Tent.--Mr. Whymper {{contrived}} a tent for his alpine explorations, {{which he}} found eminently successful. It has a waterproof floor, continuous with the sides: it {{is supported by}} <b>poles,</b> that <b>slip</b> into hems of the cloth--two poles at either end. These tents have been used on various occasions by Mr. Whymper's brother in Alaska, and by Mr. Freshfield in the Caucasus, and were highly approved of, but I {{do not know whether}} these tents would be altogether suitable for more comfortable travel. I myself had a tent made on this principle some years ago, but disliked it, for I found the continuity of the floor with the sides to act unsatisfactorily; the tent retained the damp, and the weight of the body, acting {{on the floor of the}} tent, was apt to disturb its walls. Mr. Whymper's tent is procurable at Carter's, Alpine Outfitter, 295, Oxford Street, London.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} main tectonic {{features}} of the Eastern Mediterranean region combining the recent information obtained from GPS measurements, seismicity and neotectonic studies. GPS measurements reveal that the Arabian plate moves northward with respect to Eurasia {{at a rate of}} 23 ± 1 mm/yr, 10 mm/yr of this rate is taken up by shortening in the Caucasus. The internal deformation in Eastern Anatolia by conjugate strike-slip faulting and E-W trending thrusts, including the Bitlis frontal thrust, accommodates approximately a 15 mm/yr slip rate. The Northeast Anatolian fault, which extends from the Erzincan basin to Caucasus accommodates about 8 ± 5 mm/yr of left-lateral motion. The neotectonic fault pattern in Eastern Anatolia suggests that the NE Anatolian block moves in an E-ENE direction towards the South Caspian Sea. According to the same data, the Anatolian-Aegean block is undergoing a counter-clockwise rotation. However, from the residuals it appears that this solution can only be taken as a preliminary approximation. The Eulerian rotation <b>pole</b> indicates that <b>slip</b> rate along the North Anatolian fault is about 26 ± 3 mm/yr. This value is 10 mm/yr higher than slip rates obtained from geological data and historical earthquake records and it includes westward drift of the Pontides of a few millimetres/year or more. GPS measurements reveal that the East Anatolian fault accommodates an 11 ± 1 mm/yr relative motion. GPS data suggest that Central Anatolia behaves as a rigid block, but from neotectonic studies, it clearly appears that it is sliced by a number of conjugate strike-slip faults. The Isparta Angle area might be considered a major obstacle for the westward motion of the Anatolian block (Central and Eastern Anatolia). The western flank of this geological structure, the Fethiye-Burdur fault zone appears to be a major boundary with a slip rate of 15 - 20 mm/yr. The Western Anatolian grabens take up a total of 15 mm/yr NE-SW extension. The fact that motions in Central Anatolia relative to Eurasia, are 15 - 20 mm/yr while in Western Anatolia and Aegean Sea they are 30 - 40 mm/yr could suggest that Western Anatolia decouples from Central Anatolia and the Isparta Angle by the Fethiye-Burdur fault zone and Eski?ehir fault. It is also hypothesized that the differentiation of tectonic styles and velocities in the Anatolian-Aegean block are related to differences between the slabs lying under the Cyprus and Hellenic arcs...|$|R
