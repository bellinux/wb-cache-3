40|$|We report {{survey results}} on the {{currency}} choice of {{a random sample of}} Swedish exporters. We find that for an overwhelming share of exports, the <b>price,</b> <b>invoice</b> and settlement currency is the same. The currency of the customer is the most used, with Swedish kronor and vehicle currencies accounting for approximately equal shares. Currency choice is similar for intra-firm and between-firm trade. We also find that negotiations are important for both the price and for the currency choice. A minority of firms use posted prices for their main exports [...] the median price adjustment for those firms is once per year. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{invoicing}} currency for trade {{is crucial for}} the international transmission of macroeconomic policy. This paper develops a three-country model that endogenizes the choice of invoicing currency and that allows for a share of …rms’costs to be denominated in foreign currency, consistent with the empirical evidence on {{the high degree of}} pass-through to import <b>prices.</b> <b>Invoicing</b> decisions are driven by …rms’desire to hedge costs but also by exchange rate volatility and currency comovements.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model {{of international trade}} pricing in which individual exporters and importers bargain over the transaction price and exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. We find that the choice of <b>price</b> and <b>invoicing</b> currency reflects the full market structure, including the extent of fragmentation {{and the degree of}} heterogeneity across importers and across exporters. Our study shows that a party has a higher effective bargaining weight when it is large or more risk tolerant. A higher effective bargaining weight of importers relative to exporters in turn translates into lower import prices and greater exchange rate pass-through into import prices. We show the range of <b>price</b> and <b>invoicing</b> outcomes that arise under alternative market structures. Such structures matter not only for the outcome of specific exporter-importer transactions, but also for aggregate variables such as the average price, the average choice of invoicing currency, and the correlation between invoicing currency and th...|$|R
50|$|The net {{purchase}} {{cost of a}} product {{is the amount of}} the invoice plus any additional fees and taxes that are incurred. Business owners can negotiate the purchase price of a product if they know what the {{net purchase}} price is in comparison to the <b>invoice</b> <b>price.</b> This is not always easy to do, but it should be apparent, at least following the first purchase of a product. Any fees or taxes added to the <b>invoice</b> <b>price</b> indicate the additional fees that are being tacked on to the price. If purchasing a product in a large volume, it may be possible for the manufacturer to waive some of these costs for a large enough order. If a car dealer has additional incentives available for the purchase of a vehicle, he generally discounts the vehicle below the <b>invoice</b> <b>price.</b> This should be seen as a sign for the buyer that additional room for negotiation may exist.|$|R

40|$|Too often, {{organizations}} that contract for software development services {{are at the}} mercy of vendors for cost and schedule estimates. Once a program office releases a request for proposal (RFP) for software development, it must somehow evaluate the validity of cost and schedule estimates that come back with the proposals. Or, a program might have a limited budget or schedule but not a clear understanding of what amount of development is actually feasible within these limitations. This article proposes an approach that can help buyers of software take control of this situation by providing the ability to objectively evaluate software development proposals, select the best value for their needs, and effectively manage acquisition costs from kickoff to product delivery.

40|$|We {{document}} pricing-to-market by {{producers who}} sell the same product to buyers in two markets that are segmented by variable exchange rates. We can cleanly identify desired relative markup responses to exchange rate movements because we observe prices {{charged by the}} same plant for the same product to buyers from the two different markets at a monthly frequency. The matched price quotes allow us to use fixed effects to control for unobserved marginal cost changes. The high frequency allows us to focus only on episodes where prices change, hence separating out desired markup variation from the default behavior of relative markups due to price stickiness. For <b>prices</b> <b>invoiced</b> in destination currency, we find that desired relative markups move one-for-one with exchange rate changes. This implies that producers invoicing in destination currency engage in an extreme form of pricing-to-market, with relative markups inheriting the random walk behavior of exchange rates.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three essays {{that study}} three distinct derivative contracts. The first essay proves, in a model-free framework, that early exercise of futures-style options on futures, whether calls or puts, is suboptimal. The result is robust to transaction costs, liquidity constraints and collateral requirements. Assuming a frictionless market, three additional model-free results are obtained: (i) put-call parity, (ii) equality of time values of puts and calls {{with the same}} strike and expiration, and (iii) positivity of time value before expiration. The second essay develops a new <b>invoice</b> <b>price</b> formula for Treasury bond futures contracts as a more effective alternative to the current conversion factor system. The equilibrium "cheapest to deliver" and futures price at expiration are identified. The empirical part of the essay documents that the new function dramatically improves {{the ability of the}} futures <b>invoice</b> <b>price</b> to approximate the market prices of the corresponding deliverable bonds. The third essay offers a regression-based empirical study of the determinants of credit default swap premia. Leverage, volatility and interest rates are found to account for {{a large percentage of the}} variation of premia. A principal components analysis of the regression residuals finds no evidence of a missing factor. The results achieved for credit default premia more closely corroborate structural models of credit risk than those obtained by Collin-Dufresne et al. (2001) for corporate bond yield spreads...|$|R
