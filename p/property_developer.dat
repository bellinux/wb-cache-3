A sample of residential <b>property</b> <b>developers</b> in Lagos, Nigeria were asked to fill a questionnaire, which elicited their views on a five-point Likert scale.

5|$|Centre Point, {{just beyond}} {{the eastern end of}} Oxford Street next to Tottenham Court Road station, was {{designed}} by <b>property</b> <b>developer</b> Harry Hyams and opened in 1966. It failed to find a suitable tenant and sat empty for many years, eventually being occupied by squatters who used it as a centre of protest against the lack of suitable accommodation in Central London. In 2015, the building began to be converted into residential flats, with development expected to finish in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Marie Louise Gardens is a {{relatively}} small park {{to the west of}} the centre of Didsbury. The park was originally owned by the Silkenstadt family as part of the grounds of their house. The land was bequeathed to the people of Manchester by Mrs Silkenstadt in 1904 in memory of her daughter, Marie Louise. The park was at the centre of controversy in 2007 after Manchester City Council proposed to sell a portion of it to a private <b>property</b> <b>developer.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{animals in}} zoos were {{typically}} held in poor conditions in small, cramped cages, and the Zoological Gardens presented no exception. As a result, its animals were frequently afflicted by disease, and also {{suffered from the}} harsh easterly winds of the Edinburgh climate. Despite these setbacks, the menagerie attempted to maintain its popularity by putting on concerts, acrobatics shows and displays of fireworks and Montgolfier balloons. Children were carried around the park {{on the back of}} the zoo's elephant, giving it a rare opportunity for exercise. Even with these entertainments, the Zoological Gardens were eventually forced to admit defeat. The park was closed and the site sold to a <b>property</b> <b>developer</b> in 1857. Nothing now remains of the house or its gardens.|$|E
40|$|The {{climate is}} {{changing}} {{and the rising}} temperatures are causing the polar ice to melt, combined with more and intense rain low-lying waterfronts are becoming vulnerable for flooding. Two urban waterfronts have been selected for the study: Frihamnen in Gothenburg and Stadswerven in Dordrecht. The two waterfronts have to be adapted {{to be able to}} cope with the risk of flooding. This research investigates how <b>property</b> <b>developers</b> are engaged in the adaptation of the waterfronts and what features influences their behavior. The engagement of the <b>property</b> <b>developers</b> depends on several features, which can be divided into internal and external features. The internal features influencing the behavior of the <b>property</b> <b>developers</b> are their business model and the partnership agreement they have with the urban planners from the municipality. The external features consist of five conditions: The conditions set by the urban planners, through the master and zoning plan, the building permits and as an owner of the land they can influence the property developers’ behavior. The economic conditions in a city and country, influences the housing demand and prices, which {{have an impact on the}} development decisions of the <b>property</b> <b>developers.</b> The housing demand and prices are also influenced by the public flood risk awareness. which are the social conditions. The laws, regulations and interest of the national and regional government are steering and controlling the actions of the urban planners and therefore indirectly influencing the behavior of the <b>property</b> <b>developers,</b> which are the institutional conditions. Finally are the physical conditions influencing the adaptations and the nature of the adaptations that are needed. From the case studies three main features that influences the <b>property</b> <b>developers</b> in Gothenburg and Dordrecht to adapt the developments were identified: the business model, long term <b>property</b> <b>developers</b> have more incentives to adapt the developments to avoid damages. The partnership agreement the <b>property</b> <b>developers</b> have with the urban planners from the municipality, if they are given too much freedom, they will use this to make the most profit. Which does not always lead to the development of adapted buildings. The economic conditions: the housing demand and prices are influencing the adaptation investments <b>property</b> <b>developers</b> can afford and are willing to take. An understanding of the features and how they influence the behavior of the <b>property</b> <b>developers,</b> will contribute in the development of resilient waterfronts.

Saracen Properties announced in May 2009 that they would not seek to renew their lease, and would vacate at the termination of their lease in November 2009. It was also revealed that the 50th floor office space once occupied by Alan Bond was still in the same condition as when he left in 1991, with Bond's former chair, desk and boardroom table available as part of the lease.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, the Kilcoynes {{decided to}} sell the stadium to {{property}} developers, having recently purchased it from the Jesuits. The last game at Glenmalure Park was an FAI Cup semi-final between Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers on 12 April 1987. The game saw a pitch invasion by supporters protesting against {{the sale of the}} stadium. The next season, the supporters formed an association called Keep Rovers at Milltown and placed a picket on home games at Tolka Park, effectively bankrupting the club's owners. They accumulated funds, through supporter contributions, in an effort to purchase the stadium but failed to match the offer of a <b>property</b> <b>developer</b> to whom the Kilcoynes eventually sold the site. After a lengthy appeals process, Glenmalure Park was demolished in 1990 to be replaced by an apartment complex.|$|E
5|$|Safeway {{demolished}} Plough Lane {{and sold}} the site to a <b>property</b> <b>developer</b> in November 2002. Milton Keynes Council meanwhile granted planning permission to convert the National Bowl into a temporary football stadium, but the Football League delayed a decision on these plans in October 2002. At Selhurst Park, Wimbledon F.C. reported a divisional record low attendance of only 849—including over 200 away fans, around {{the same number of}} complimentary tickets, and Wimbledon F.C. youth players and members of the press—for the Tuesday-night game against Rotherham United on 29 October 2002. A temporary stadium in Milton Keynes proved difficult to arrange and Wimbledon F.C. remained in south London {{at the end of the}} season. On the field, the side finished the second-tier campaign in 10th place. Koppel re-adopted the National Hockey Stadium as his preferred interim destination, announcing a plan to convert the stadium for football and play there from the start of the 2003–04 season.|$|E
5|$|Despite this recognition, the {{increasing}} debts of the MDHB meant {{that by the}} 1960s the company was eager {{to get rid of}} the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land, the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a <b>property</b> <b>developer</b> owned by Harry Hyams. Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin. With the council reluctant to allow such a grandiose development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 {{the theatre}} {{impresario}} Arthur Carlton, from Worcester, {{took over the}} lease. As {{he was responsible for}} 14 theatres around the country at the time, he appointed Mrs D. Valantine Munro as the local manager. Performances were maintained during World War I, and in 1916 Sarah Bernhardt portrayed a wounded male French soldier in Du Théâtre au Champ d'Honneur. In the 1920s there were appearances by the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell. During the Great Depression of the 1930s the theatre was not profitable and closed completely for six months. In 1938 the lease was taken over by Reg Maddox, whose family were involved with the theatre for the next 40 years. During World War II the theatre fared better, with appearances by prominent actors including Donald Wolfit, Irene Vanbrugh, John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike. In the Post-War years, receipts suffered as audiences dwindled in the face of competition from cinema and television. Unsuccessful proposals were made for a trust to run the theatre in 1968, and in the 1970s, shares in the owning company were bought by the <b>property</b> <b>developer</b> Charles Ware, who sold to Charles Clarke, a solicitor from Bristol. Clarke was responsible for a redecoration of the building, but as profits were still small, in 1976 he sold it to Louis I. Michaels, who ran the Haymarket Theatre in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{junction}} with Tottenham Court Road suffered significant bomb damage during the Second World War. Patrick Abercrombie's contemporary Greater London Plan called for a new ring road around Central London called the 'A' Ring, but post-war budget constraints meant that a medley of existing routes were improved to form the ring road, including Euston Road. An underpass to avoid the junction with Tottenham Court Road was proposed in 1961, with construction taking place in 1964. The <b>property</b> <b>developer</b> Joe Levy was keen to develop buildings {{in the area and}} bought various properties. When the London County Council (LCC) refused planning permission because of the underpass development, Levy, who had outline planning permission, insisted the council pay him £1 million if they wanted to compulsorily purchase the site. Over the next four years, Levy bought properties along the north side of Euston Road, and an agreement was reached so that the council built the underpass and he built a complex of two tower blocks with office shops and apartments, the Euston Tower.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Reynolds {{was obliged}} to hand over control to the Sterling Consortium to bring the club out of administration, Stewart Davies taking over as chairman. He and his staff adopted a fan-friendly approach, in {{contrast}} to the abrasive Reynolds, before in 2006, the club was sold to <b>property</b> <b>developer</b> George Houghton. For four consecutive seasons, under Hodgson, sacked in 2006, and then under successor Dave Penney, the Quakers finished in {{the top half of the}} table, reaching the play-off semi-final in 2008 only to lose to Rochdale on penalties. In February 2009, Darlington again went into administration, triggering an automatic 10-point deduction, without which they would have again reached the play-offs. Fundraising efforts kept the club going, but when no buyer was found for the club by a May deadline, the administrators made the majority of the first-team squad available for transfer and cut staff numbers to a minimum. On 20 May, Houghton returned to the club as chairman, appointed former Middlesbrough boss Colin Todd as manager, and brokered an agreement which led to the club coming out of administration and ownership passing to local businessman Raj Singh and enabling it to compete in the 2009–10 season without any points deduction. Todd left the club after losing seven of his first nine games and was replaced by former Republic of Ireland manager Steve Staunton, who only won four of 23 league games.|$|E
