5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when many}} publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and <b>Poetry</b> <b>of</b> America.|$|E

5|$|Idiophones were {{extremely}} important in Chinese music, hence {{the majority of}} early instruments were idiophones. <b>Poetry</b> <b>of</b> the Shang dynasty mentions bells, chimes, drums, and globular flutes carved from bone, the latter {{of which has been}} excavated and preserved by archaeologists. The Zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such as clappers, troughs, wooden fish, and yǔ (wooden tiger). Wind instruments such as flute, pan-pipes, pitch-pipes, and mouth organs also appeared in this time period.

5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the <b>poetry</b> <b>of</b> Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E
