25|$|In the sport's early days, {{football}} {{was very much}} focused on attack and, as such, many teams (e.g. Royal Engineers, 1872) played with a 1–2–7 formation (one defender, two mid-fielders and seven attackers). The single defender {{was known as the}} three-quarter-back, and he {{was supported in part by}} two half-backs from mid-field who would be in charge of orchestrating the game with short passing. Up front, the seven forwards were split into four wing forwards and three centre forwards. The wingers' main task was to use their pace to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long balls sent forward by the half- and three-quarter-backs, whereas the centre forwards were charged with taking the short passes from the half-backs.|$|E

25|$|In Adone, Marino quotes and rewrites {{passages}} from Dante's Divine Comedy, Ariosto, Tasso and the French {{literature of the}} day. The aim of these borrowings is not plagiarism but rather to introduce an erudite game with the reader who must recognise the sources and appreciate {{the results of the}} revision. Marino challenges the reader to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quotations and to enjoy {{the way in which the}} material has been reworked, as part of a conception of poetic creation in which everything in the world (including the literature of the past) can become the object of new poetry. In this way, Marino also turns Adone into a kind of poetic encyclopaedia, which collects and modernises all the previous productions of human genius.|$|E
25|$|Searches for Naultinus {{are often}} {{inconclusive}} because the animals simply avoid detection. Improved detection methods would allow scientists to monitor populations much more accurately {{and a number}} of different studies in recent years have been doing research into this area – some key ideas are a new type of cover mounted on trees for animals to hide in, pheremone lures and even terriers trained to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scent of native geckos. Naultinus have been reintroduced to some predator free areas and are present at other locations where their habitat is protected and where pest control is being carried out but because Naultinus have a very slow breeding rate, recovery of populations is inevitably a relatively slow and gradual process.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Fiedler {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} professor at the University of Montana in Missoula. In February 1941 his first son, Kurt, was born two months prematurely. He elected to join the Navy Reserve after the United States entered World War II in December 1941 due to incipient fissures in his marriage and a previously unrequited thirst for adventure. Following enlistment, he gained admission to the Navy's Japanese Language School in Boulder, Colorado, where he was placed in an intensive fourteen-month course taught by a melange of Japanese American businessmen and missionaries. Initially suspected to be a security risk, Fiedler's lieutenant (junior grade) commission was delayed until the conclusion of a comprehensive background investigation; although Baxter Hathaway, a colleague at Montana, declared that Fiedler was a Lovestoneite, the investigator failed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> allusion.|$|E

25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

This view is echoed by the writer and critic Kim Newman, who has said that [...] "as an extreme exercise in revolutionary self-criticism {{on the part of}} television professionals, who also lampoon their own world of chattering commentators and ratings-chasing sensationalism, the play [...] is a trenchant contribution to a series of debates that is still raging" [...] and has concluded that [...] "Nigel Kneale might be quite justified in shouting, 'I was right!

500|$|Mwng is an {{understated}} rock record {{inspired by}} the band's love of [...] "Anglo-American pop culture of the 60s, 70s and 80s." [...] The album has a [...] "wintery persona" [...] that is best summed up by the track [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon". Rhys feels that the record {{marks the first time}} the band managed to escape their influences and clearly establish their own sound. The album's lyrics deal with a diverse set of subjects, such as the death of rural communities, old school teachers, and Sarn Helen (a Roman road built in Wales). Rhys has stated that many of Mwngs songs are highly personal reflections on what were difficult years for him. Rhys has also expressed the belief that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, as they can <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mood of the songs even if they cannot understand the lyrics. Critical reception was generally positive, although some reviewers criticised the album for its [...] "bare-boned production". Mwng was included in both the Melody Maker and NME [...] "Best album of 2000" [...] lists, with the latter calling the record the band's best release. The band were surprised by album's commercial success, entering number 11 in the UK charts, and going on to become the biggest-selling Welsh language album.|$|E

500|$|The Wii U version {{features}} high-definition 1080p {{graphics and}} a special mode that allows up to eight players simultaneously. This mode is restricted to certain larger stages and cannot be played online, though additional stages were made available for eight players via post-release update patches. Various modes from the 3DS version, such as Classic mode, feature various changes in the Wii U version, with some modes allowing two players to play cooperatively or {{against each other in}} other modes. The Wii U version also features three exclusive new game modes; Smash Tour, Special Orders, and Event Mode. Smash Tour is a traditional board game-type mode in which up to four players assemble a team of fighters that they <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board. Players have the ability to change size of the game board, the number of turns, and choose if they allow to have custom characters on the board (not including Miis). In this mode, players earn stat increasing power-ups, triggering various battles and events along the way. Special Orders is a series of challenges set by Master Hand and Crazy Hand, which players can attempt to earn rewards. Each time a battle is won, the reward and the stakes will rise, but if a round is lost, all accumulated prizes will be lost. In Event Mode, one or two players can participate in themed challenges, moving along the path by completion. The Wii U version has vast compatibility with controllers; Wii U GamePad, Wii Remote, Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, Wii U Pro Controller, GameCube controller through GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS systems (using either a copy of the 3DS version, or a Smash Controller app released on June 14, 2015). Returning features unique to this version include Special Smash, allowing for unique rules, Stage Builder and Photo mode, which allow players to create personalized stages and dioramas (with a compatible SD card), and demo versions of classic games in a [...] "Masterpieces" [...] gallery. An update on April 15, 2015 added content-sharing features, with a Miiverse stage added for free on June 14, 2015. An update released on July 31, 2015 added an online tournament mode.|$|E

Goss was previously cast as mutant vampire Jared Nomak in del Toro's 2002 film Blade II, and the director approached the actor to be cast in Hellboy II. The only other actor considered for the part was Charlie Hunnam. Goss trained with action director and former Jackie Chan Stunt Team member, Brad Allan, learning sword and spear skills for six to seven months for his role. He and Anna Walton also learned ancient Gaelic from a dialog coach for their lines. Goss did not perceive Nuada as evil, explaining, [...] "It's issues, his people, he's {{part of what he}} truly believes.
