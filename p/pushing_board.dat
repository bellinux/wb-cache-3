Television replays showed Martyn [...] placing {{his hand on}} the minister's shoulder and asking him to move aside, Ponting showing Pawar his forefinger as asking to give him the trophy. Indian media described [...] Australia as [...] "rude and arrogant". The Times of India reported that [...] "Australia showed they aren't exactly polite off it too" [...] while Indian Express headlined that [...] "this is how champions behave when they get the trophy." [...] Former Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar called the incident as [...] "unpleasant" [...] and said that [...] "such incidents should be avoided." [...] Indian chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar reacted that it was a [...] "behavior from uneducated people" [...] and called it [...] "appalling." [...] Pawar, however, recalled the incident [...] "a small thing, stupid thing," [...] and said that he did not [...] "want to react." ...|$|E

The results support a model of executive behavior in which the nonprofit executive uses his or her power to <b>push</b> <b>boards</b> towards fundraising in place of monitoring activity. Using a fixed effect framework, we also find no systematic relationship between board personal demographics and performance. Boards, Governance, Nonprofit Organizations...|$|R

25|$|The scandal was {{reported}} by the press in March 2002. AFL-CIO president John Sweeney <b>pushed</b> the <b>board</b> to appoint an internal investigator. When the investigator's report was complete in November 2002, Sweeney <b>pushed</b> the <b>board</b> to make the report public. A majority of the board voted to keep the report secret. Sweeney resigned from the board, then threatened to bring the matter up before a public meeting of the executive council of the AFL-CIO. The board established an eight-member special advisory committee, headed by O'Sullivan, {{to decide whether to}} release the report. The committee unanimously agreed to release the report, but O'Sullivan was out-voted 6 to 2 to accept the report's recommendation that directors return their profits to ULLICO.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{some of the}} key {{differences in}} board behavior between nonprofit organizations and for-profit firms using a relatively new dataset from New York City nonprofits. We provide evidence on the broader role that nonprofit boards play for their organizations and then give some suggestive results on the relationship between board structure and composition, and individual board member performance. The results provide some evidence that the executive directors of nonprofits may use their power to <b>push</b> <b>boards</b> toward fundraising in place of monitoring activity. Using a fixed-effects framework, we also find no systematic relationship between board personal demographics and performance, although both tenure on a board and multiple board service do seem to matter.

40|$|This Article is {{the first}} {{academic}} endeavor to analyze the efficacy and transparency of stock ownership policies (SOPs) in U. S. public firms. SOPs generally require managers to hold some of their firms’ stock for the long term. Following the 2008 financial crisis, firms universally adopted these policies and cited them {{more than any other}} policy as a key element in their mitigation of risk. However, my analysis of the recent SOPs of S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 CEOs disputes what firms claim about these policies. First, I find that SOPs are extremely ineffectual in making CEOs hold on to their firm’s stock; this is because these policies generally function in a way that allows CEOs to immediately unload virtually all of the stock they own. Second, I show that firms camouflage this weakness in their public filings. I explain why my findings are troubling and I propose a regulatory reform to make SOPs transparent. Transparency can be expected to <b>push</b> <b>boards</b> and shareholders to improve the actual content of these policies...|$|R

25|$|Returning {{to his old}} role as Executive Secretary, Truesdale <b>pushed</b> the <b>board</b> {{to re-establish}} Rule 76–1, a {{procedural}} rule established by the Board in 1976. The rule required that, if {{three members of the}} Board had agreed to a draft opinion and no dissent had yet circulated, the opinion would be issued within two weeks if no dissent was circulated within that time. On September 30, Truesdale formally asked the Board to re-establish the rule, but the Board declined in favor of other approaches to improve the speed with which decisions were issued.|$|R
50|$|The motion {{requires}} that the board be twisted back and forth so as to move either just the back foot or both {{the front and back}} feet side to side, essentially <b>pushing</b> the <b>board</b> forward at the outside of the movement, before the foot is brought back in the other direction. In principle, the act is similar to what is required to propel one who is riding inline skates forward, as opposed to how skateboarders push with their feet on the ground. Riding a caster board requires using a twisting motion of hips and legs.|$|R

Incredibly, he managed {{to walk away from the}} fall, but suffered a bruised liver, fractured wrist, and bruised lung. In replays, it was shown that he changed direction at the last second which forced his back foot to <b>push</b> the <b>board</b> away from him. This allowed him and his board to follow in different directions. Jake Brown would be released from the hospital on August 4 and was at the Moto X Freestyle preliminaries though he was walking with a cane.|$|R
40|$|While most {{economic}} organisation {{literature on}} cooperatives {{has focused on}} changes in income rights, we study changes in the allocation of decision rights between board of directors (representing members) and managers. The traditional role of the board is to direct {{the activities of the}} managers. However, professional management increasingly makes most strategic decisions, <b>pushing</b> the <b>board</b> into a supervisory role. We present two groups of findings on changing board – management relationships. We identify three corporate governance models: traditional model, management model, and corporation model, and we present an empirical illustration showing a relationship between the choice of board model and product portfolio and performance...|$|R
5000|$|According to Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana and others, as of 2011, {{institutional}} shareholders {{have become}} more active in challenging CEOs, if not necessarily the CEO's pay. [...] "It used to be shareholders <b>pushing</b> against <b>boards</b> who were buffering the CEOs. But now investors are telling directors who should be the CEO and how management should run the company." [...] In 2006, 28 directors at public companies in the Russell 3000 Index failed to receive a majority vote from shareholders. By 2011 79 did not, according to GMI Ratings. Disappointment at the sharp drop {{in the stock market}} has been blamed for this change in shareholder attitudes.|$|R

25|$|Surfing can {{be broken}} into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out {{requires}} strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (duck diving, eskimo roll). Take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly {{as soon as the}} wave starts <b>pushing</b> the <b>board</b> forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking. Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a Balance board or swing boarding helps novices master the art.|$|R

50|$|In 1949 {{during the}} McCarthy Era, {{a news story}} {{accurately}} accused writer Agnes Smedley of spying for the Soviet Union.

Poet Robert Lowell <b>pushed</b> the <b>Board</b> of Directors to oust Yaddo's director, Elizabeth Ames, who was being questioned by the FBI. Ames was eventually exonerated of all charges but learned from the investigation that her assistant Mary Townsend was an FBI informant. Ames remained director until her retirement in 1969, having overseen the Yaddo community from its creation in 1924. Ames was succeeded by Newman E. Waite who served as president from 1969 until 1977 when Curtis Harnack assumed the position.|$|R
