5|$|France: France was {{the first}} European country to destroy its three tons of seized illegal ivory in February 2014, with tusks fed one-by-one along with other ivory goods into a <b>pulverizer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crushing {{can also}} be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due to}} environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. What was left was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a <b>pulverizer</b> to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.|$|E
2500|$|This mill {{was started}} in {{operation}} {{the last day of}} December 1876, and though there has been no little dispute as to the matter of the first mill to be put in operation, Mr. Dunn gives the assurance that this one is unmistakably entitled to the distinction. The Bald <b>pulverizer</b> had been started previously and run a short time, but was not a stamp mill.|$|E
50|$|Pulverizers: Originally {{pneumatic}} powered standard sledgehammers {{that did}} minimal damage, the <b>Pulverizers</b> were first upgraded to 50 pound aluminum mallets for season 2, and were again upgraded to 150 pound mallets for season 3 and beyond. The <b>pulverizers</b> {{were capable of}} causing serious damage to the lighter weight class robots.|$|R
2500|$|In {{plants that}} burn {{pulverized}} coal, silos feed coal to <b>pulverizers</b> (coal mills) {{that take the}} larger [...] pieces, grind them to the consistency of talcum powder, sort them, and mix them with primary combustion air which transports the coal to the boiler furnace and preheats the coal in order to drive off excess moisture content. A 500 MWe plant may have six such <b>pulverizers,</b> five of which can supply coal to the furnace at 250 tons per hour under full load.|$|R
50|$|RNA {{extraction}} {{in liquid}} nitrogen, commonly using {{a mortar and}} pestle (or specialized steel devices known as tissue <b>pulverizers)</b> is also useful in preventing ribonuclease activity.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 a Jet <b>Pulverizer</b> was {{developed}} in which operates like a Vertical <b>Pulverizer</b> only the item is pulverized by the high speed air action. For example, forcing coal against coal.|$|E
50|$|In the worksite, a coal burner {{works with}} the coal <b>pulverizer</b> and coal hopper usually. The coal in the hopper is {{conveyed}} to the coal <b>pulverizer</b> by screw conveyor. The coal <b>pulverizer</b> will crush the coal into pulverized coal. In the coal burner, the pulverized coal mixes with air (High-speed air flow is generated by the draft fan on the coal burner), and is ignited by the oil burning igniter.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pulverizer</b> or grinder is a {{mechanical}} device for the grinding {{of many different}} types of materials. For example, a <b>pulverizer</b> mill is used to pulverize coal for combustion in the steam-generating furnaces of fossil fuel power plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{can be done}} {{by using}} a mortar and pestle cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures, but use of this classic apparatus is laborious and sample loss is often a concern. Specialised stainless steel <b>pulverizers</b> generically known as Tissue <b>Pulverizers</b> are also available for this purpose. They require less manual effort, give good sample recovery and are easy to clean between samples.Advantages of this technique are higher yields of proteins and nucleic acids from small, hard tissue samples - especially when used as a preliminary step to mechanical or chemical/solvent cell disruption methods mentioned above.|$|R

25|$|In {{coal-fired}} power stations, the {{raw feed coal}} from the coal storage area is first crushed into small pieces and then conveyed to the coal feed hoppers at the boilers. The coal is next pulverized into a very fine powder. The <b>pulverizers</b> may be ball mills, rotating drum grinders, or other types of grinders.|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of separating mineral matter and pyrite from coal {{as it is}} transported from <b>pulverizers</b> to boilers in pulverized coal combustion units will be examined. The charge imparted on coal during pulverization and transport to pulverized coal (PC) burners in a utility boiler will be quantified. In addition to field charge measurements, an existing computational model will be extended to numerically simulate charged particle motion in a turbulent gas through an electric field. Results from the field tests and numerical modeling will be employed in design and construction of a laboratory scale pulverizer/classifier. This laboratory unit {{will be used to}} quantify the magnitude and differential charge imparted on bituminous and subbituminous coals during pulverization and classification at temperatures and with gaseous constituents typical to utility PC units. An electrostatic separator, designed for in-line operation between <b>pulverizers</b> and PC boilers, will be used to clean prepulverized coals. Theoretical and experimental data are to be used in preparing a preliminary design for a full-scale, (15 ton/hr) in-line, electrostatic coal cleaning device. Finally, the economic potential for application to PC units will be assessed...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the net electric power and the net efficiency of the unit, an assessment {{was made of the}} demand for electric power of all the basic auxiliary equipment: the boiler feed pumps: both booster and main (for the EM variant), the condensate pumps, the pump of the water cooling the condenser, the air and flue gas fans, and the coal <b>pulverizers.</b> In each variant, identical operation and efficiency characteristics were adopted for corresponding facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{struggle}} {{reaches its}} climax at the Querr Energy Plant, where the Raven learns of a destructive weapon called Pulverizers. A weapon {{capable of taking}} data from its destruction {{to create a new}} <b>Pulverizer.</b> Its true destructive potential appeared again when Tartarus Headquarters and the Garav Desert was attacked by another <b>Pulverizer.</b> Meanwhile, Triton Ecoactivity center was destroyed as well, which was a source of biological weapons created by Kisaragi.|$|E
50|$|The {{historian}} Stuart Seely Sprague has researched {{much information}} about Parker and his life. Beginning as an iron moulder, Parker developed and patented {{a number of}} mechanical and industrial inventions, including the John P. Parker tobacco press and harrow (or <b>pulverizer),</b> patented in 1884 and 1885. He had invented the <b>pulverizer</b> while still {{a young man in}} Mobile in the 1840s. Parker {{was one of the few}} blacks to patent an invention before 1900.|$|E

50|$|In 1872, Thomas Chalmers {{founded the}} Fraser & Chalmers firm to {{manufacture}} mining machinery, boilers, and pumps. By 1880 steam engines {{were part of}} the product line and by 1890, the firm had become one of the world's largest manufacturers of mining equipment. Thomas Chalmers's son, William James Chalmers, was president of the company from circa 1890 to 1901. Meanwhile, the Gates Iron Works, with Chalmers family involvement, had become a manufacturer of crushers, <b>pulverizers,</b> and other rock and cement milling equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Air {{flow meters}} monitor air (compressed, forced, or ambient) in many {{manufacturing}} processes. In many industries, preheated air (called [...] "combustion air") {{is added to}} boiler fuel just before fuel ignition to ensure the proper ratio of fuel to air for an efficient flame. Pharmaceutical factories and coal <b>pulverizers</b> use forced air {{as a means to}} force particle movement or ensure a dry atmosphere. Air flow is also monitored in mining and nuclear environments {{to ensure the safety of}} people.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal <b>pulverizers</b> would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers {{without the need for}} hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|R

50|$|Protein {{extraction}} from tissues with tough extracellular matrices (e.g., biopsy samples, venous tissues, cartilage, skin) {{is often}} achieved {{in a laboratory}} setting by impact pulverization in liquid nitrogen. Samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently subjected to impact or mechanical grinding. As water in the samples becomes very brittle at these temperature, the samples are often reduced to a collection of fine fragments, which can then be dissolved for protein extraction. Stainless steel devices known as tissue <b>pulverizers</b> are sometimes used for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|Screws: Introduced for season 3, {{these devices}} were a {{modification}} to the static spike strips. The screws were continually rotating augers placed horizontally {{along the edges}} of the arena floor. The Screws were intended to scrape up a bot, and possibly drag it closer to the <b>Pulverizers</b> due to the corkscrew design. Much like the Spinners, the Screws had a greater effect on the lighter weight classes—although their impact on all weight classes was small. For Season 5, the screws were upgraded with biting 'teeth' to better catch onto robots. Their rotation was also modified so that instead of 'pushing' in one direction, they converged in a corner from opposite directions and created a 'V' that could damage or turn over robots.|$|R
