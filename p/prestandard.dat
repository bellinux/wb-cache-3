40|$|CEN ENV 12381 is a European <b>Prestandard</b> {{focusing}} on formal representation and explicit reference of temporal information in healthcare informatics and telematics. One of its merits {{is not just}} the possibility to represent natural language expressions containing time-related information in a structured way, but also to give some mechanisms on how clinical language itself can be used to convey meaning unambiguously. As such, CEN ENV 12381 introduces the notion of “controlled language use ” in the domain of healthcare. In this paper the principles behind controlled language design and use are explained. Through a detailed study of the inconsistencies and ambiguities that arise when interpreting Snomed procedure terms in the framework of the Galen-In-Use project, it is shown that most of them can be explained as a violation of sound term-formation principles. A proposal is made to develop a controlled language for health and to use it in subsequent versions of coding and classification systems.

In 2010 5, 75 % of the transportation fuels {{has to come from}} biological origin in accordance with a European directive (2003 / 30 /EG). This results in a boost of the biodiesel- and bio-ethanolindustry in Belgium. As an alternative for biodiesel also pure vegetable oils {{can be used as a}} transportation fuel. In most cases this will be rapeseed oil used in diesel engines. Also Rudolf Diesel, the inventor of the well known diesel engine, originally had the idea to build an engine running on a fuel which could be produced by the farmers themselves. This could make them independent from all other external sources. The evolution of the diesel engine turned out in the opposite way. Inspired by this idea several organizations and research centers are doing research to the local, decentralized production of PPO by the farmers themselves.

30|$|Natural {{durability}} of wood {{is determined by}} the European standard EN 252 for specimens in ground contact and EN 113 for basidiomycetes in the laboratory, but no test exists for above ground conditions. For above ground conditions, the European <b>prestandard</b> ENV 12037 and EN 330 are used to determine the {{durability of}} treated wood. The most important factors for fungal establishment on the surface and within wood are the moisture content, the surrounding temperature, and the relative humidity. Strength tests are the most sensitive for decay detection, but neither strength tests nor identification of fungi responsible for the decay are included in the standards of above ground durability in field tests. To detect decay, visual examination, pick or splinter tests, and mass loss determination are used. Identifying fungi with traditional methods, e.g., growth on solid medium, is time consuming and complicated. Molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction and sequencing do not require mycological skill for identification to species level, and furthermore the methods do not depend on the subjective judgement like most traditional methods, but are based on the objective information of the target organism (e.g., nucleotide sequences). The next generation of standard field tests will probably consider the drawbacks of standard tests today and be rapid and include both quality tests like molecular identification and nondestructive quantitative tests, e.g., acoustic tests. Laboratory tests can be improved by using fungi identified from field trials and by combining different fungi in the same test and thus simulate degradation in practice.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{scientific}} data on absorption of electromagnetic {{fields in the}} human body during the use of mobile telephones are mainly based on measurements on phantoms and on simulations. Up to now it has been unclear if measurements in human tissue would lead to the same conclusions as evaluations in phantoms and simulations did. During this project, the specific absorption rate (SAR) was evaluated in the heads of five fresh cadavers. The evaluation was performed at the frequencies 433 MHz, 900 MHz, 1, 300 MHz, 1, 800 MHz and 2, 450 MHz. We used dipole antennas at varying radiated powers. The emitted fields were unmodulated. Measurements were performed in the brain, the inner ears and the eyes of the heads. Evaluations were performed at two antenna positions: next to the ear (at 20 mm distance to the skull) and at 40 mm in front of the eye. The specific absorption rate was evaluated by performing measurements of the electric field strength in human tissue and also by measuring the temperature versus time during irradiation of the heads. The evaluation of the absorption rate requires the knowledge of the permittivity of the human tissue. Therefore permittivity and conductivity were examined in isolated samples of human brain, muscle and eyes before performing the SAR evaluation. At a radiated power below 1 W the limit of the specific absorption rate of the Austrian <b>prestandard</b> ÖNORM S 1120 of 4 W/kg averaged over 1 gram tissue was not exceeded. A radiated power of 2 W led to SARs above the mentioned limits in some cases. For comparison reasons measurements of the SAR were also performed in phantom heads.

40|$|As a {{capstone}} {{to several}} Mid-America Earthquake Center (MAE Center) projects, a full-scale two story unreinforced masonry (URM) building was tested following {{the application of}} several retrofit techniques, which included the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) overlays, near surface mounted (NSM) rods, vertical unbonded post-tensioning, and joist anchors. The test structure was composed of four URM walls, flexible timber diaphragms and interior stud walls, and was designed and built following construction practices consistent with those used in Mid-America prior to 1950. Initial testing subjected both the roof diaphragm and in-plane walls to slowly applied lateral load reversals in an unreinforced sate. Following this series of tests, each in-plane wall was retrofit and retested. Experimental results indicated that global issues such as flange participation {{and the effects of}} overturning moment substantially impacted the response of primary components both before and after retrofit. FRP retrofit techniques resulted in strength increases up to 32 % and displayed a pseudo-ductile response caused by progressive debonding. For cases where such retrofits forced sliding failures, large increases in energy dissipation resulted. The use of vertical unbonded post-tensioning resulted in strength increases between 40 %- 60 %; however, piers displayed a tendency to switch from a ductile rocking/sliding mode to a more brittle diagonal tension mode. In addition, results highlighted the need for retrofit schemes to employ both horizontal and vertical reinforcement to prevent progressive crack opening that can decrease wall displacement capacity. Based on the experimental results, the model implied by the and quot <b>Prestandard</b> for the Rehabilitation of Existing Structures and quot, FEMA 356, for the analysis of in-plane URM walls was modified and extended to (1) include the effect of FRP pier retrofits and (2) consider the global effects of URM structures. The resulting model displayed reasonable estimates of measured response both before and after retrofit, with an average error of 14 %. In addition, the proposed model displayed improvements over the current model from 14 % to 66 %. Based on the results of sensitivity analyses this improved accuracy was primarily attributed to the consideration of global effects. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Roberto T.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the testing of water based thermal buffer stores used for low {{temperature}} applications (< 100 &# 61616;C) and specifically those used in solar combisystems. Two different test methods are examined: a new method called Combitest, which was developed in this study; and the CEN <b>prestandard</b> ENV 12977 - 3. Combitest has two levels: Direct Characterisation (DC) where performance indicators are derived directly from measurements; and Annual Calculation (AC) with parameter identification and long term system simulations, as in ENV 12977 - 3. Five relatively complex buffer stores designed for solar heating systems have been tested according to ENV 12977 - 3. The stores included a large variety of features found in buffer stores used in solar combisystems that are currently on the market. Three of the models were used in 10 store variations to create simulated test data used {{in the development of}} the Combitest DC test sequence. A further 10 models of store variations were used for evaluating the test sequence and the resulting performance indicators. Two stores were tested in the test stand with the developed DC test sequence and results were compared to detailed simulations using the models derived from ENV 12977 - 3. A major advantage of Combitest is that it can be applied when the store cannot be modelled sufficiently accurately. Performance indicators are split into those relating to only the store and those relating to the store in the context of a system. The results show that the main system performance indicators of the DC level, fractional energy savings and final energy use, can be used to predict annual system performance of the studied stores with reasonable accuracy using a correction factor. However, the heat loss indicators cannot be used to compare the heat losses of different stores. The evaluation of the AC level, applied to two stores with measured data, shows that the results are similar to those achieved using ENV 12977 - 3 if the DC test sequence is supplemented with two test sequences from ENV 12977 - 3. An alternative method of extrapolating the DC system performance indicators to arbitrary boundary conditions was studied in less detail. The results showed that the method is possible but that there are significant uncertainties in the extrapolation process. It is suggested that Combitest be transformed into a system test method that can also be applied to stores using fixed boundary conditions for the boiler, collector and controllers. The study also showed that for some stores it was not easy to fit good parameter sets for the applied store model using ENV 12977 - 3. Guidelines are required in the choice of the model, choice of fixed values for parameters not identified and for interpretation of results from the identification program and verification sequences...|$|E
40|$|The masonry {{structures}} {{built in}} the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were designed with empirical equations derived from construction practice (Heyman, 1995). Many of these structures are still standing today, which attests to the soundness of the design with respect to gravity loads. However, many of these buildings are unreinforced and have not yet been subjected to intense lateral wind or earthquake loads (Epperson and Abrams, 1989). Throughout eastern and mid-America there exists a large inventory of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings that pose a great hazard in the case of an infrequent but large seismic event. The earthquakes of 1999 in Turkey and Taiwan, and 2000 in India, served as a reminder to the vulnerability of URM structures and the need for sound evaluation and rehabilitation techniques (Hays, et al., 1999). Seismic performance of these structures is largely dependent on the strength and behavior of in-plane shear walls. The lateral load capacity of URM shear walls is often limited by modern design codes (MSJC, 1999) to the onset of flexural cracking. However recent research has indicated that URM walls can resist considerable lateral force after the formation of the first crack and still behave in an elastic manner while resisting loads larger than those that caused initial cracking (Abrams, 1992 and Magenes, 1997). URM walls have been proven to be ductile elements capable of dissipating energy through rocking or bed-joint sliding, and thus design codes may be overly conservative in evaluating the capacity of these components. The leading document available today to guide an engineer on the seismic rehabilitation of URM walls is FEMA 356. This document titled ???<b>Prestandard</b> and Commentary for the Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings??? was released in December of 2000 by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). This document provides methods, using the concepts of performance based design, for the analysis and rehabilitation of buildings made of masonry, concrete, steel, timber or any combination of these materials. Performance based design allows the engineer, and building owner, to jointly specify the desired building performance level for a particular earthquake magnitude, evaluate the capacity of the structural components to determine if they meet performance objectives, and design rehabilitations for the components if they do not meet the objectives. Performance levels are based largely on the amount of damage that would be incurred. Damage to a structural component is often considered to be a function of lateral displacements. Unlike design codes, where the acceptability of a component is determined by its strength, in FEMA 356 component acceptability is determined by the amount of damage which is expected to occur at a particular lateral deflection or drift. Numerical coefficients relating drifts to damage were deduced from laboratory tests available at the time. Further research is needed to validate and reduce the uncertainty in this data, particularly for the case of rehabilitated components such as URM shear walls.
