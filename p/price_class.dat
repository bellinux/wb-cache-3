50|$|Bell's law of {{computer}} classes was first described in 1972 {{with the emergence}} of a new, lower <b>priced</b> microcomputer <b>class</b> based on the microprocessor. Established market class computers are introduced at a constant price with increasing functionality and performance. Technology advances in semiconductors, storage, interfaces and networks enable a new computer class (platform) to form about every decade to serve a new need. Each new usually lower <b>priced</b> <b>class</b> is maintained as a quasi independent industry (market). Classes include: mainframes (1960s), minicomputers (1970s), networked workstations and personal computers (1980s), browser-web-server structure (1990s), palm computing (1995), web services (2000s), convergence of cell phones and computers (2003), and Wireless Sensor Networks aka motes (2004). Bell predicted that home and body area networks would form by 2010.|$|R

30|$|It is {{necessary}} to underline that using the regression values obtained, transforming the averages of the original <b>price</b> <b>classes</b> (those released by the guide) clearly introduces a distortion (it is a linear transformation of values of which the actual distribution is unknown) and reduces the actual variability of prices. This reduction of variability in the explained variable partly hides the impacts of the explaining variables.
