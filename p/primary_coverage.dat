2500|$|The album has {{received}} mixed reviews from the Turkish media. Some journalists defended Tarkan saying that critics should {{be engaged in}} discussing his music rather than his dressing style, which characterized most of the publicism that appeared {{in connection with the}} release. Columnist Tuna Serim pointed out in one of her articles that there was a definite hunt for Tarkan news in the Turkish media, channels were ready to change their original schedules to feature Tarkan-related news, which are considered to be of primary importance. She also pointed out that the release of a music video is not given <b>primary</b> <b>coverage</b> in television news programmes in any country, while the release of [...] "Vay Anam vay" [...] was featured and discussed in the news programmes in Turkey. Cengiz Semercioğlu of Hürriyet thinks that there is an [...] "anti-Tarkan lobby" [...] in the domestic press, which might have resulted {{from the fact that the}} singer keeps a certain distance from the yellow press, so whatever he does, the press is going to tear into pieces with criticism. In other journalists and critics' opinion this is the worst album he has ever made, repeats himself and there is nothing original in it. There was one critic who refused to comment on the album or even to listen to it. Others do not otherstand what other critics find unacceptable in the album.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to {{determine}} the timeliness and level of <b>primary</b> immunization <b>coverage</b> against measles and rubella in Montenegro in the cohort born from January 1 to December 31, 2006. Cross-sectional study was conducted in the period from October to December 2008. All immunization points in Montenegro were visited and immunization records of the entire cohort born in 2006 were reviewed. Timeliness of <b>primary</b> immunization <b>coverage</b> with MMR was 91. 4 % at the level of Montenegro, but in seven (33, 3 %) municipalities timeliness of <b>primary</b> immunization <b>coverage</b> was less than 90 %, including one municipality even with less than 80 %. After the additional activities on the vaccination of previously unvaccinated children, <b>primary</b> immunization <b>coverage</b> with MMR reached the value of 96. 1 % at the level of Montenegro, and in the majority of municipalities exceeded the value of 95 %. However, after additional immunization activities in six out of 21 municipalities (28. 6 %), <b>primary</b> immunization <b>coverage</b> with MMR was below 95 % of which in one municipality below 90 %. In the cohort born during 2006, timely primary immunization with MMR was performed in one third of Montenegrin municipalities with the value less than 90 %. Supplemental immunization activities related to unvaccinated children significantly increased the <b>primary</b> immunization <b>coverage</b> with MMR in the cohort born in 2006. Yet, in a certain number of municipalities even after additional immunization activities, the <b>primary</b> immunization <b>coverage</b> did not reach the required 95 %. In comparison with routine administrative reporting on immunization coverage, the surveys which involve the review of immunization records after additional immunization activities provide more realistic rate of completeness and timeliness of <b>primary</b> immunization <b>coverage...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} clustering {{areas of}} infants exposed to HIV during pregnancy and {{their association with}} indicators of <b>primary</b> care <b>coverage</b> and socioeconomic condition. METHODS: Ecological study where {{the unit of analysis}} was <b>primary</b> care <b>coverage</b> areas in the city of Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil, in 2003. Geographical Information System and spatial analysis tools were used to describe indicators of <b>primary</b> care <b>coverage</b> areas and socioeconomic condition, and estimate the prevalence of liveborn infants exposed to HIV during pregnancy and delivery. Data was obtained from Brazilian national databases. The association between different indicators was assessed using Spearman's nonparametric test. RESULTS: There was found an association between HIV infection and high birth rates (r= 0. 22, p< 0. 01) and lack of prenatal care (r= 0. 15, p< 0. 05). The highest HIV infection rates were seen in areas with poor socioeconomic conditions and difficult access to health services (r= 0. 28, p< 0. 01). The association found between higher rate of prenatal care among HIV-infected women and adequate immunization coverage (r= 0. 35, p< 0. 01) indicates that early detection of HIV infection is effective in those areas with better primary care services. CONCLUSIONS: Urban poverty is a strong determinant of mother-to-child HIV transmission but this trend can be fought with health surveillance at the primary care level...|$|R
