40|$|Procedures, a {{subsidiary}} {{body of the}} United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, agreed to include in its programme of work in 1976 a project to specify various types and methods of packaging {{with a view to}} the subsequent creation of codes for names of packages most frequently used in trade. The aim was to provide a link between documents and goods and facilitate the identification of goods and other cargo handling operations during transport. Realizing that other international bodies, such as the UN/ ECE Inland Transport Committee, the European Economic Community (EEC), the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the International Union of Railways (UIC) also had a strong interest in and had undertaken work on this subject, the UN/ECE Working Party in 1981 invited the secretariats of all interested international organizations to examine the various concepts and to collaborate to harmonize the different codes. After extensive national and international consultation and collaboration, in 1986 a final project was transmitted to the Working Party which at its twenty-third session in March 1986 agreed to adopt the appropriate Recommendation. At its thirty-ninth session (March 1994), the Working Party agreed to approve the proposal made by the delegation of Canada in document TRADE/WP. 4 /R. 895 to incorporate, as an additional annex, the <b>packaging</b> <b>codes</b> used for the transportation of dangerous goods into the Recommendation and to amend it appropriately...|$|E
40|$|Project CPR/ 88 / 054 was {{successful}} in strengthening China's quality development and assurance system for wood-based panels, through the realization of its stated objectives. However, {{the achievements of the}} project would be further consolidated and strengthened through the implementation of the following recommendations. While the Chinese Research Institute of Wood Industry CRIWI has been revising/formulating newer standards and codes for end- products, {{more needs to be done}} to cover such areas as input standards, on-line specifications for process control, codes/specifications for wood dyes and pigments, product <b>packaging</b> <b>codes,</b> etc. Development/revision of two specific types of standards are of immediate importance. These relate primarily to standards/specifications of raw materials entering the production lines, particularly to significant machine down-time due to improper feed-stock, and, secondly, to revision of building codes to encourage expanded usage of wood-based panels products. The project identified four regional substations and formulated draft regulations for the introduction of a regional network of quality testing and monitoring stations for wood-based panels. The actual implementation of the system has, however, yet to come into force. Since the rationale for the introduction of the regional network is of a fundamental nature, its early implementation cannot be overstressed. The proposed regional stations should be delegated increasing responsibilities for both quality monitoring and extensions services and research. The frequency of independent inspection of producing units could be expanded to internationally acceptable standards by making the regional centres responsible for such activities. In addition, the current product certification system could be upgraded by making use of the regional stations. Thus, the early establishment of the regional stations and delegation of authority to these centres would serve to bring about further quality improvements on a national scale. Further work should be done at CRIWI to continue the development of wet-formed wood-plastic composites to consistently reproduce a high-quality panel over a range of wood-plastic compositions. Further testing could be done to determine the limits to which wood-plastic composites can be post-formed after pressing. These composites have very good potential for being used on the interior panels of automobiles and for other non-structural applications, such as safety guards for machinery, door skins, packaging and shipping. In addition work should focus on determining which compatabilizers would improve the bond strength between wood-fibre and plastic. Additional laboratory equipment would help facilitate research in this area, including (i) a laboratory-scale wet-process forming line, (ii) additional dies to test the formability of the composites, and (iii) test equipment to determine physical properties of composite panels. Computer-based technology needs to be significantly upgraded in CRIWI and other forestry institutions, to strengthen research activities and informatics. Computer-based in-process quality control in operating mills also requires significant upgrading to enable real-time analysis during successive production stages. The latter is important for both productivity and profitability of mills. There are certain areas that require strengthening: a module-based developmental plan could be designed and implemented over a period of time. To do this, however, China would need international assistance in the form of additional external consultants, more fellowships (one fellowship was provided under this project), equipment and hands-on training. While extension services aimed at dissemination of research technologies, user-related information and technical advisory assistance were developed under the current project, inculcation of the fundamentals of value engineering will go a long way in expanding the use of wood-based panels, and recycled products in diverse areas. In essence, this implies advisory services to users in the application of the correct material (and not necessarily material of the highest specifications) for the desired job. Such activities would reduce costs as well as serve to demonstrate the varied uses of panel products. In this context, the training workshop and related activities envisaged under the current project are crucial and need to be implemented at the earliest...|$|E
