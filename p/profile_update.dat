40|$|The {{prediction}} of the wear at the wheel–rail interface {{is a fundamental}} problem in the railway field, mainly correlated to the planning of maintenance interventions, vehicle stability {{and the possibility of}} researching specific strategies for the wheel and rail profile optimization. In this work the Authors present a model specifically developed for the evaluation of the wheel and rail profile evolution due to wear, whose layout is made up of two mutually interactive but separate units: a vehicle model for the dynamic analysis and a model for the wear estimation. The first one is made up of two parts that interact online during the dynamic simulations: a 3 D multibody model of the railway vehicle implemented in Simpack Rail (a commercial software for the analysis of multibody systems) and an innovative 3 D global contact model (developed by the Authors in previous works) for the detection of the contact points between wheel and rail and for the calculation of the forces in the contact patches (implemented in C/C++ environment). The wear model, implemented in the Matlab environment, is mainly based on experimental relationships found in literature between the removed material and the energy dissipated by friction at the contact. It starts from the outputs of the dynamic simulations (position of contact points, contact forces and global creepages) and calculates the pressures inside the contact patches through a local contact model (FASTSIM algorithm); then the material removed due to wear is evaluated and the worn profiles of wheel and rail are obtained. This approach allows the evaluation of both the quantity of removed material and its distribution along the wheel and rail profiles in order to analyze the development of the profiles shape during their lifetime. The whole model is based on a discrete process: each discrete step consists in one dynamic simulation and one <b>profile</b> <b>update</b> by means of the wear model while, within the discrete step, the profiles are supposed to be constant. The choice of an appropriate step is fundamental in terms of precision and computational load. Moreover the different time scales characterizing the wheel and rail wear evolution require the development of a suitable strategy for the profile update: the strategy proposed by the Authors is based both on the total distance traveled by the considered vehicle and on the total tonnage burden on the track. The entire model has been developed and validated in collaboration with Trenitalia S. p.

40|$|The Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{project has}} {{increased}} efforts {{to demonstrate the}} performance of fully integrated parachute systems at both higher dynamic pressures and {{in the presence of}} wake fields using a Parachute Compartment Drop Test Vehicle (PCDTV) and a Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV), respectively. Modeling the extraction and separation events has proven challenging and an understanding of the physics is required {{to reduce the risk of}} separation malfunctions. The need for extraction and separation modeling is critical to a successful CPAS test campaign. Current PTV-alone simulations, such as Decelerator System Simulation (DSS), require accurate initial conditions (ICs) drawn from a separation model. Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS), a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) tool, was employed to provide insight into the multi-body six degree of freedom (DOF) interaction between parachute test hardware and external and internal forces. Components of the model include a composite extraction parachute, primary vehicle (PTV or PCDTV), platform cradle, a release mechanism, aircraft ramp, and a programmer parachute with attach points. Independent aerodynamic forces were applied to the mated test vehicle/platform cradle and the separated test vehicle and platform cradle. The aero coefficients were determined from real time lookup tables which were functions of both angle of attack () and sideslip (). The atmospheric properties were also determined from a real time lookup table characteristic of the Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG) atmosphere relative to the planned test month. Representative geometries were constructed in ADAMS with measured mass properties generated for each independent vehicle. Derived smart separation parameters were included in ADAMS as sensors with defined pitch and pitch rate criteria used to refine inputs to analogous avionics systems for optimal separation conditions. Key design variables were dispersed in a Monte Carlo analysis to provide the maximum expected range of the state variables at programmer deployment to be used as ICs in DSS. Extensive comparisons were made with Decelerator System Simulation Application (DSSA) to validate the mated portion of the ADAMS extraction trajectory. Results of the comparisons improved the fidelity of ADAMS with a ramp pitch <b>profile</b> <b>update</b> from DSSA. Post-test reconstructions resulted in improvements to extraction parachute drag area knock-down factors, extraction line modeling, and the inclusion of ball-to-socket attachments used as a release mechanism on the PTV. Modeling of two Extraction parachutes was based on United States Air Force (USAF) tow test data and integrated into ADAMS for nominal and Monte Carlo trajectory assessments. Video overlay of ADAMS animations and actual C- 12 chase plane test videos supported analysis and observation efforts of extraction and separation events. The COTS ADAMS simulation has been integrated with NASA based simulations to provide complete end to end trajectories with a focus on the extraction, separation, and programmer deployment sequence. The flexibility of modifying ADAMS inputs has proven useful for sensitivity studies and extraction/separation modeling efforts. ...|$|E

40|$|From {{the past}} many {{numerical}} models which can predict coastal bed profile updates have been developed. They are ranged from one dimensional shore line change model to three dimensional bed profile evolution models. Three dimensional bed profile evolution models include both cross shore (due to wave actions) and long shore (due to currents) sediment transports components and widely use to predict bed profile evolutions from days to years. Two dimensional bed profile evolution models include only cross shore (due to wave actions) sediment transport component and widely use to predict bed profile evolution from hrs to days. One dimensional shoreline change models calculate bed profile evolutions {{for months to}} years. All these models are capable of producing bed profile evolutions well. However, to have detailed information on changing bed topography in short times, the effect of changing bed profiles to velocity fields and sediment concentrations in very short time periods can't be obtained using these models. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a bed profile updating model which can use to predict very short term bed profile evolutions and to study {{the effect on the}} developed bed profiles on the velocity fields and sediment concentrations. For the developed model, as it is considering very short time bed profile evolutions, only the cross shore sediment transport component was considered. Cross shore transport mainly governed by the wave actions specially wave breaking. The bed profile evolutions due to wave breaking mainly occur due to the turbulences and complex fluid motions occurred during wave breaking. The turbulences make shear stress on the bottom which cause sediments to pick up and horizontal and obliquely descending eddies cause the picked up sediments to transport. Therefore, a model which can calculate the turbulences and eddy structures well was needed and LES was used for that purpose. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a method for resolving the time dependent structure of high Reynolds number turbulent flows. LES is an important tool in wave breaking studies where flow mixing, sediment entrainment and sediment transport are all affected by the presence of coherent vortices and their interactions with boundaries and other flow structures. However, due to the simulation costs associated, the developed model can mainly be used for academic perspective where very small-scale bed profile changes are analyzed (e. g., erosion around breakwater due to a sudden flow, profile change under each wave, profileevolutions under buried obstacle, flow fields around cobble mines etc.). An existing LES code (Wijayarathne, 2000; Suzuki et al., 2007) was improved further to model bed profile evolution. The developed model consists of LES flow model, sediment pick up and advection model and a bed profile evolution model. The velocity fields, bottom shear stresses and pressure fields are calculated from the LES flow model. Navier stocks equation modified by adding a sub grid scale model to calculate the small scale eddies is used in the LES flow model. The sediment pick up and advection module calculates the sediment pick up from the bottom using Nielsen's formula which is depend on the shields parameter. When the instantaneous shields parameter value is greater than the critical shear stress, pick up occurs. The instantaneous shields parameter is mainly depend on the bottom velocities. The picked up sediments are assumed to be transported with the flow fields. A flux approach was used to calculate the sediment transport. Sediments which achieved the settling velocity, settled to the bottom. The bed profile evolution model uses the sediment continuity equation to calculate the <b>profile</b> <b>update.</b> The resultant of pick up and settled amounts caused for the bed <b>profile</b> <b>update.</b> Settled sediment amount calculated considering the sediment concentrations in each cells which includes sheet flow and the settling velocity of the sediments. If the change in bed profile is greater than 1 grid size, the corresponding grid is changed as a solid grid and if it is reduced more than one grid size, the corresponding grid is changed to water grid. The boundary conditions of the developed grids are changed accordingly. Mainly pressure and velocities are changed at the newly developed boundaries. The newly developed grids are updated to the domain and the next step's calculations are based on the new domain. The developed model was validated with the experimental results. Since several modifications were carried out in the existing flow module, the flow model also verified with the experimental results. Verification of the flow model was done with velocity fields and free surfaces. Particle image velocimetry was used to obtain velocity fields and wave gauge reading was used to obtain free surface distributions. With the results of free surfaces distributions, it was concluded that the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results. The non-linearity of the wave breaking region also well producedwith the model results. Results of velocity fields, both in magnitude and directions were consistent to each other. Small differences occurred due to random movements of seeded materials. The numerical model for the flow field after modifications was validated with the experimental results. The verified model was also used to simulate the flow around a stepped sea wall after wave overtopping. Several phases of a wave were considered. It was observed that the model is capable of simulating the overtopping well. The turbulence generated after wave overtopping caused high bottom shear stress and made some pick up and suspensions of sediments. Therefore, the change in bed profile was observed after wave overtopping. Numerical results were compared with the experimental results for the generated bed profiles. It was observed that a considerable erosion occurs at the toe of the structure followed by a small deposition and erosion again afterwards in both experiment and numerical simulation. The bed profile model results were validated with the profile evolution occurred due to wave overtopping from a stepped breakwater. The trend of profile evolutions were consistent in numerical and experimental results though numerical simulation results showed some overestimation. Some of the reasons for this discrepancy caused due to not considering the friction from the sediment clouds to the flow. This increases the velocities in the eroded cells and cause more erosion. Further, the large pressure gradient caused during wave overtopping also can cause for large erosion. Since the model can simulate the bed profile change after the wave overtopping, model can be used to simulate erosion or depositions around breakwaters or some other structures during a storm surges or tsunamis where waves overtopped from the structure. The verified model was used to study the flow fields and sediment motions under different wave breaking conditions. Particularly, spilling and plunging breaking conditions. Plunging breaking where the turbulences occur mostly in the wave plume and spilling phenomena where the turbulences are concentrated on wave crest were well simulated from the model. Vertical sections of velocity fields of each wave breaking conditions were compared. It was observed that the plunging wave breaking has higher velocities as well as more turbulence than spilling breaking. Since the turbulences are concentrated on the wave plume, generation of bottom shear stresses is higher in plunging wave breaking condition...|$|E

The principal finding is that, in trading settings with pure moral hazard and noisy ratings, if the per-period profit margin of cooperating sellers is sufficiently high, a mechanism that does not publish every single rating it receives but rather, only updates a trader’s public reputation profile every k transactions with a summary statistic of a trader’s most recent k ratings, can induce higher average levels of cooperation and market efficiency than a mechanism that publishes all ratings as soon as they are posted.

40|$|The goal of {{information}} filtering systems (IF systems) {{is to support}} users in finding relevant information from a dynamic base of data objects. IF systems base their relevance computations on so-called user profiles in which they maintain representations of the users interests. Whenever users interests change, user profiles become inaccurate and the prediction quality decreases. The more dynamic user interests are, the more important it is for IF systems to <b>update</b> user <b>profiles</b> rapidly to shorten this period of decreased prediction quality. A survey of existing systems, however, shows that they typically provide support only for selected types of interest changes, namely either for gradual or for abrupt interest changes. The objective of this dissertation is to design an information filtering architecture capable of dealing with frequently changing user interests. To make <b>profile</b> <b>updating</b> more efficient, our QuerySet filtering architecture (QSA) uses user profiles of a modular structure. QSA profiles primarily consist {{of a set of}} queries that are each expected to have a high correspondence with one of the user s interests. Interest changes affecting only a subset of the user s interests can then be handled efficiently by updating only the queries representing the affected interests. Complementing the queries, QSA profiles contain an aggregation function that aggregates the ratings that the individual queries assign to an object. This resulting rating is used to rank filtered objects. The aggregation function allows for especially efficient <b>profile</b> <b>updating</b> whenever the relative relevance of individual queries changes. To allow handling both gradual and abrupt interest changes, QSA profiles are provided with two distinct <b>profile</b> <b>updating</b> mechanisms. First, QSA systems can track gradual interest changes by learning from relevance feedback. Second, user-aggregated relevance feedback (URF) provides users with direct access to the aggregation function and allows them to manually handle major profile inaccuracies, as they occur during profile initialization and after major interest changes. URF is a rating that users assign not to a single object, but to a set of objects and that seamlessly integrates with relevance feedback in the <b>profile</b> <b>updating</b> process. We present a framework of specialized user interface families that allow entering URF. The individual interfaces are optimized for three different purposes, i. e. simplest learnability (form-based interfaces), maximum accuracy (histogram-based interfaces), and maximum efficiency (paintable interfaces). We present an experimental evaluation of the interfaces. We demonstrate the QuerySet Architecture at the example of our TV program recommendation system TV Scout. The system contains multiple subsystems using different content-based and collaborative filtering techniques and allows users to combine these techniques in their profiles. Additional subsystems can be plugged in at any time to assimilate more query functionality. The TV Scout is currently in commercial, Internet-wide use. While the Query- Set Architecture proved very successful in the TV application area, we believe that it will prove equally useful for a number of other highly dynamic application areas, such as, for example, news, web pages, and Internet auctions...|$|R

In this paper, we present results of data analysis over user <b>profiles,</b> <b>update</b> activities, mobility characteristics, social graphs, and attribute correlations. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this study is the first large-scale quantitative analysis of a real-world commercial LSN service. I...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] or [...] norm of the {{computed}} corrector vector {{is compared}} with a provided tolerance value. If the computed norm {{is less than the}} tolerance, the numerical procedure is concluded and the inverted impedance profile for the earth region is given by [...] from Eqn. 14. On the other hand, if the norm is greater than the tolerance, iterations through steps 2-6 are repeated but with an <b>updated</b> impedance <b>profile</b> as computed from Eqn. 14. Fig. 2 shows a typical example of impedance <b>profile</b> <b>updating</b> during successive iteration process. According to Cooke and Schneider (1983), use of the corrected guess from Eqn. 14 as the new initial guess during iteration reduces the error.|$|R
