This is {{a process in which}} lead sulfate forms on the plates, and during charge is converted to lead dioxide (<b>positive</b> <b>plate)</b> and pure lead (negative plate). Repeating this process results in a microscopically rough surface, increasing the surface area, increasing the current the cell can deliver.|$|E
2500|$|The current I(t) {{through any}} {{component}} in an electric circuit {{is defined as}} the rate of flow of a charge Q(t) passing through it, but actual charges—electrons—cannot pass through the dielectric layer of a capacitor. Rather, one electron accumulates on the negative plate for each one that leaves the <b>positive</b> <b>plate,</b> resulting in an electron depletion and consequent positive charge on one electrode that is equal and opposite to the accumulated negative charge on the other. Thus the charge on the electrodes is equal to the integral of the current as well as proportional to the voltage, as discussed above. As with any antiderivative, a constant of integration is added to represent the initial voltage V(t0). This is the integral form of the capacitor equation: ...|$|E

Those from the <b>positive</b> <b>plate</b> are exceedingly small, and separate instantly from every part of the surface of the metal, in consequence of its perfect cleanliness (633.); whilst in the liquid they give it a hazy appearance, from their number and minuteness; are easily carried down by currents, and therefore not only present far greater surface of contact with the liquid than larger bubbles would do, but are retained a much longer time in mixture with it. But the bubbles at the negative surface, though they constitute twice the volume of the gas at {{the positive}} electrode, are nevertheless very inferior in number. They do not rise so universally from every part of the surface, but seem to be evolved at different parts; and though so much larger, they appear to cling to the metal, separating with difficulty from it, and when separated, instantly rising {{to the top of the}} liquid. If, therefore, oxygen and hydrogen had equal solubility in, or powers of combining with, water under similar circumstances, still under the present conditions the oxygen would be far the most liable to solution; but when to these is added its well-known power of forming a compound with water, it is no longer surprising that such a compound should be produced in small quantities at the positive electrode; and indeed the blenching power which some philosophers have observed in a solution at this electrode, when chlorine and similar bodies have been carefully excluded, is probably due to the formation there, in this manner, of oxywater.|$|E

50|$|Charge/discharge {{involves}} {{the transfer of}} oxygen from one electrode to the other (from one group of plates to the other). Hence this type of cell is sometimes called an oxygenlift cell.

50|$|Under {{discharge}} the <b>positive</b> <b>plates</b> {{are reduced}} ("deoxidized"); the oxygen, with its natural affinity for iron, {{goes to the}} negative plates, oxidizing them. It is permissible to discharge continuously at any rate up to 25% above normal, and for short periods at up to six times normal. When the normal discharge rate exceeds this value, abnormal voltage drops will occur.|$|R

40|$|The {{curing process}} is the longest step in the {{manufacture}} of lead/acid batteries. In this work, curing of lead/acid battery pastes is undertaken by a hydrothermal method with the aim of shortening the duration of the process. The effects of curing temperature, time and atmosphere on the composition and toughness of the <b>positive</b> <b>plates</b> are investigated. Both the latter parameters are found to be strongly influenced by these curing conditions. In particular, the strength of <b>positive</b> <b>plates</b> prepared either in the presence of water vapour or in an atmosphere containing O 2 and water vapour is lowered with increasing temperature and time. This is due to the formation and growth of large tetrabasic lead sulphate (4 PbO. PbSO 4) crystals. By contrast, if the hydrothermal curing is conducted in an atmosphere containing CO 2 and water vapour, plate strength is increased {{as a result of the}} formation of small crystals of PbCO 3 and a reduction in the number of large 4 PbO.

50|$|However, if {{one or both}} of the {{capacitor}} plates is a semiconductor, then {{galvani potential}} is not necessarily the only important contribution to capacitance. As the capacitor charge increases, the negative plate fills up with electrons, which occupy higher-energy states in the band structure, while the <b>positive</b> <b>plate</b> loses electrons, leaving behind electrons with lower-energy states in the band structure. Therefore, as the capacitor charges or discharges, the voltage changes at a different rate than the galvani potential difference.|$|E
5000|$|During discharge, [...] {{produced}} at the negative plates {{moves into the}} electrolyte solution and then is consumed into the <b>positive</b> <b>plates,</b> while [...] is consumed at both plates. The reverse occurs during charge. This motion can be by electrically driven proton flow or Grotthuss mechanism, or by diffusion through the medium, or by flow of a liquid electrolyte medium. Since the density is greater when the sulfuric acid concentration is higher, the liquid will tend to circulate by convection. Therefore, a liquid-medium cell tends to rapidly discharge and rapidly charge more efficiently than an otherwise similar gel cell.|$|R

50|$|Under certain {{conditions}} for some electrochemical cells, {{especially if they}} use an aqueous electrolyte, hydrogen ions can be converted into hydrogen atoms and H2 molecules. In the extreme case, bubbles of hydrogen gas might appear {{at one of the}} electrodes. If such a layer of hydrogen or even H2 gas bubbles appear on the <b>positive</b> <b>plate</b> of a battery, they interfere with the chemical action of the cell. An electrode covered with gases is said to be polarized. Polarization in galvanic cells causes the voltage and thus current to be reduced, especially if the bubbles cover a large fraction of a plate. Depolarizers are substances which are intended to remove the hydrogen, and therefore, they help to keep the voltage at a high level. However, this concept is outdated, since if enough depolarizer is present, it will react directly in most cases by getting electrons from the <b>positive</b> <b>plate</b> of the galvanic cell, i.e. there will be no relevant amount of hydrogen gas present. Therefore, the original concept of polarization does not apply to most batteries, and the depolarizer does not react with hydrogen as H2. Still, the term is used today, however, in most cases, it might be replaced with oxidizing agent.|$|E
