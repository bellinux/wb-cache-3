5|$|The next morning, England progressed strongly. Nightwatchman Alec Bedser hit three {{consecutive}} fours from Toshack, prompting Bradman {{to replace him}} with Johnson. Bedser surveyed Johnson's wares for one over before hitting him into the leg side {{three times in the}} next, yielding a six and two fours. Bradman responded by removing Johnson from the attack. When the off spinner came back, Edrich hit him for another six to reach 96. However, Johnson soon had his revenge. England reached 2/423 when Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson, <b>patting</b> the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. This ended a 155-run third-wicket partnership. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 4/426. Johnson's two wickets brought two new batsmen were to the crease and precipitated a collapse that saw England dismissed for 496. Johnson ended with 2/89 from 33 overs and was the least economical of the frontline bowlers except Toshack, who broke down with a knee injury.|$|E

After the king died on 6November 1632 on the battlefield, his corpse was brought home in a coffin, with his heart in a separate box. Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried until she could be buried with him. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open, and went to see it regularly, <b>patting</b> it and taking no notice of the putrefaction. Eventually, the embarrassed Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, saw no other solution than to have a guard posted at the room to prevent further episodes. As a result, he was not buried until 22June 1634, more than eighteen months later.|$|E

25|$|Knowing that {{an all-out}} {{war with the}} Pandavas may not lead to {{definitive}} success, Shakuni devises a scheme to rob Yudhishthira of his kingdom and wealth by defeating him {{in a game of}} dice, which Shakuni cannot lose due to his superior skill over Yudhishthira's ineptitude and addiction to the game of dice. Unable to resist the challenge, Yudhishthira gambles away his entire kingdom, his wealth, his four brothers and even his wife, in a series of gambits to retrieve one by staking another. Duryodhana encouraged his brother Dushasana to drag Draupadi into the court. As she is Duryodhana's property after Yudhishthira had gambled everything away to him, Duryodhana tells Draupadi to sit on his thigh, <b>patting</b> it suggestively. Due to this action, Bhima swears, he would break Duryodhana's thigh. As an enraged Draupadi is about to curse the Kuru clan, Gandhari intervenes. Fearing retribution by the Pandavas, their allies, and history, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari reverse all of Yudhishthira's losses. But then (either through Duryodhana forcing his father to command the Pandavas to play again, or through the Pandavas' own desire to win a kingdom without bloodshed) the game is repeated. For this game of dice Shakuni sets the condition that upon losing, Yudhishthira and his brothers must spend thirteen years in exile in the forest before they may reclaim their kingdom. The thirteenth year must be passed incognito, or else the term of exile would be repeated. The Pandavas lose and begin their exile.|$|E

500|$|Edrich and Bedser {{continued}} to amass runs after the break, and Lindwall appealed for lbw {{for the fourth}} time while Saggers remained silent. The pair brought up their century partnership as England scored 22 runs in the 30 minutes after lunch. Johnson came on, and Edrich lofted him for six to reach 96. Edrich then hit a long hop from the part-time wrist spin of Arthur Morris for four to reach his century. Bedser joined the attack and lifted Morris high over square leg for six, and Bradman replaced him with Toshack, who bowled a maiden. O'Reilly said that during the partnership, only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said Lindwall [...] "kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after {{the other members of the}} attack had lost all signs of hostility…Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley-slave work." [...] O'Reilly decried Lindwall's workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity. However, against the run of play, Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson after almost three hours of batting, ending a 155-run stand for the third wicket. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a Test best of 79. He appeared upset by his dismissal, <b>patting</b> the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came after only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 426/4. Edrich had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111, with 13 fours and a six.|$|E

40|$|The long-standing {{proposal}} that phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) enzymes {{are involved in}} rickettsial infection of host cells has been given support by the recent characterization of a patatin phospholipase (<b>Pat</b> 2) with PLA 2 activity from the pathogens Rickettsia prowazekii and R. typhi. However, <b>pat</b> 2 is not encoded in all Rickettsia genomes; yet another uncharacterized patatin (<b>Pat</b> 1) is indeed ubiquitous. Here, evolutionary analysis of both patatins across 46 Rickettsia genomes revealed 1) <b>pat</b> 1 and <b>pat</b> 2 loci are syntenic across all genomes, 2) both <b>Pat</b> 1 and <b>Pat</b> 2 do not contain predicted Sec-dependent signal sequences, 3) <b>pat</b> 2 has been pseudogenized multiple times in rickettsial evolution, and 4) ubiquitous <b>pat</b> 1 forms two divergent groups (<b>pat</b> 1 A and <b>pat</b> 1 B) with strong evidence for recombination between <b>pat</b> 1 B and plasmid-encoded homologs. In light of these findings, we extended the characterization of R. typhi <b>Pat</b> 1 and <b>Pat</b> 2 proteins and determined {{their role in the}} infection process. As previously demonstrated for <b>Pat</b> 2, we determined that 1) <b>Pat</b> 1 is expressed and secreted into the host cytoplasm during R. typhi infection, 2) expression of recombinant <b>Pat</b> 1 is cytotoxic to yeast cells, 3) recombinant <b>Pat</b> 1 possesses PLA 2 activity that requires a host cofactor, and 4) both <b>Pat</b> 1 cytotoxicity and PLA 2 activity were reduced by PLA 2 inhibitors and abolished by site-directed mutagenesis of catalytic Ser/Asp residues. To ascertain the role of <b>Pat</b> 1 and <b>Pat</b> 2 in R. typhi infection, antibodies to both proteins were used to pretreat rickettsiae. Subsequent invasion and plaque assays both indicated a significant decrease in R. typhi infection compared to that by pre-immune IgG. Furthermore, antibody-pretreatment of R. typhi blocked/delayed phagosomal escapes. Together, these data suggest both enzymes are involved early in the infection process. Collectively, our study suggests that R. typhi utilizes two evolutionary divergent patatin phospholipases to support its intracellular life cycle, a mechanism distinguishing it from other rickettsial species...|$|R
