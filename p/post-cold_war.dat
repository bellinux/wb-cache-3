5|$|After World War II, the {{military}} {{continued to play}} a major role in the local economy, but <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> cutbacks took a heavy toll on the local defense and aerospace industries. The resulting downturn led San Diego leaders to seek to diversify the city's economy by focusing on research and science, as well as tourism.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Rothbard {{left the}} Libertarian Party and began {{building}} bridges to the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism. Paleolibertarianism sought {{to appeal to}} disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{division}} was slated {{to move to}} Fort Lewis, WA and inactivate {{as part of the}} <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> drawdown of the US Army. The 1st Brigade relocated to Ft. Lewis and was later reflagged as the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division while {{the division}} headquarters formally inactivated on 16 June 1994 at Fort Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> {{events of}} the early 1990s led to a large {{increase}} in participating nations at the Olympics. At the 1992 Games, in Albertville, France, a total of 64 NOCs were represented, including a single Germany team—following the German reunification in 1990—and a Unified Team composed of six of the ex-republics of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|First {{activated}} as a {{customs unit}} in post-World War II Germany, the brigade {{has a long}} history with United States Army Europe. Its duties as a customs unit meant that the unit was garrisoned in Germany for over forty years from 1950 until 1990, never seeing action in the American operations in the Korean War, Vietnam War, or the Persian Gulf War. It was deactivated during the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> drawdown of the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{division}} was {{slated to be}} inactivated {{as part of the}} <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> drawdown of the US Army. The 1st Brigade relocated to Fort Lewis in 1993 and was reflagged on 15 August 1995 as the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division; while the 2nd Brigade and the 3rd Brigade of the 7th was inactivated at Fort Ord. The division headquarters was formally inactivated on 16 June 1994 at Fort Lewis.|$|E
5|$|In the Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and <b>Post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> Operations, author David Horner {{stated that}} the Australian {{government}} led by Robert Menzies was loath to criticise South Africa during the 1950s. At that time Australia generally opposed anti-colonial movements (which were often supported by the Soviets or China), believing them part of a worldwide communist offensive. Indeed, as late as 1961 Australia (and Britain) abstained from a vote to condemn South Africa in the UN.|$|E
5|$|After its {{deployment}} in the Korean War, {{the division}} {{was active in}} Europe and the United States during the Cold War, but saw relatively little combat until the Persian Gulf War, when it faced the Iraqi military. A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated {{as part of the}} <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying U.S. Army National Guard units before its deactivation in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes {{brought about by the}} collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the loss of}} life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in Southeast Asia. Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> years. Left over from the Cold War are numbers stations, which are shortwave radio stations thought to be used to broadcast covert messages, some of which can still be heard today.|$|E
5|$|Over {{his four}} years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney {{downsized}} the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993. Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed {{the development of a}} Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> era.|$|E
5|$|The other {{defining}} {{aspect of}} Turkey's {{foreign policy is}} the country's long-standing strategic alliance with the United States. The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key {{issues such as the}} country's bid to join the European Union. In the <b>post–Cold</b> <b>War</b> environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 Sweden {{chose not}} to join NATO and {{declared}} a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war. A modified version now qualifies non-alignment in peace for possible neutrality in war. This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however {{there has been an}} active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the <b>post–Cold</b> <b>War</b> world. These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force. Sweden have been active participants in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).|$|E
5|$|Kudos Film and Television {{developed}} Spooks after releasing Channel 4 medical drama Psychos in 1999, {{though the}} company initially faced friction from television networks which saw no potential in a <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> spy show. The producers later successfully pitched the series to the BBC after the networks' commissioning teams were replaced. Four episodes were being written when the September 11 attacks took place, and the some scenes were rewritten to take the event into account to show the audience Spooks's goal of fighting terrorism. Throughout production, the producers were advised by former intelligence officers from the Security Service, KGB and Central Intelligence Agency. Filming took place from November 2001 to March 2002.|$|E
5|$|NATO's 2004 Istanbul summit {{was also}} remarkably {{silent on the}} subject of nuclear weapons policy and non-proliferation, as opposed to pre-summit {{diplomacy}} and earlier <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul. In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact sheets on nuclear policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. In practice, no real changes {{since the end of the}} Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and as Cold War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force. Additionally, no changes were made to Alliance nuclear policy since the 1999 Strategic Concept.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War {{continues}} to influence world affairs. The <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> world {{is considered to}} be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World WarII—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which in west Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science. These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The US, the UK, {{and most}} other NATO {{countries}} opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval. The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine {{the authority of the}} alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission {{recommended}} {{the closing of}} Fort Ord due to the escalating cost of living on the Central California coastline. By 1994, the garrison was closed and the Division was assigned to relocate to Fort Lewis, Washington. The 2nd Brigade, to include its Headquarters and Headquarters Company along with the 3rd Brigade's 3rd Battalion 17th Infantry Regiment and other assigned military police companies participated in one final mission in the United States before inactivation; quelling the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, called Operation Garden Plot. In 1993 the division was slated to move to Fort Lewis, WA and inactivate {{as part of the}} <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> drawdown of the US Army, but the 2nd and 3rd Brigades of the 7th inactivated at Ft. Ord in 1993. The 1st Brigade relocated to Ft. Lewis and was later reflagged as the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division while the division headquarters formally inactivated on 16 June 1994 at Fort Lewis.|$|E

5|$|After her {{completion}} Petr Veliky {{was assigned}} to the Gunnery Training Detachment through 1917. A number of sources report that she was renamed by the Soviets as Respublikanets (Republican) or Barrikada (Barricade), but this is not confirmed by the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> sources used by McLaughlin. That year she was assigned as a depot ship for submarines at Kronstadt and later Helsinki. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Petr Veliky reached Kronstadt in April in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'. The ship was hulked on 21 May 1921 and used to store mines. She was renamed Blokshiv Nr. 1 on 4 December 1923 and forced aground in shallow water by autumn floods in September 1923. She was not refloated and repaired until 5 October 1927. On 1 January 1932 she was renamed to Blokshiv Nr. 4, and to BSh-3 on 16 May 1949, by which time she was being used as a barracks ship at Kronstadt. The ship was stricken on 18 April 1959 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Cambodian {{conflict}} {{also brought}} an end the ASEAN-imposed trade and aid embargo which had been in place since 1979. In January 1990, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan publicly voiced his support for Vietnam, {{and the rest of}} Indochina, to gain admission into ASEAN. In the period between late 1991 and early 1992, Vietnam restored relations with several member nations of ASEAN. As a result, between 1991 and 1994, investments from ASEAN countries made up 15 percent of direct foreign investment in Vietnam. Aside from the obvious economic benefits, ASEAN also provided a peaceful environment that guaranteed Vietnam's national security against foreign threats in the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> era, when Soviet aid was no longer available. Thus, on 28 July 1995, Vietnam officially became the seventh member of ASEAN, after leading ASEAN officials invited Vietnam to join at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in 1994. Then, in August 1995, the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi was upgraded to Embassy status, after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced a formal normalisation of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 11 July 1995, thereby ending Vietnam’s isolation from the United States.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> era, the United Nations {{has taken}} on a more nuanced, multidimensional {{approach}} to Peacekeeping. In 1992, {{in the aftermath of the}} Cold War, then Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali put together a report detailing his ambitious concepts for the United Nations and Peacekeeping at large. The report, titled An Agenda for Peace, described a multi-faceted and interconnected set of measures he hoped would lead to effective use of the UN in its role in <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> international politics. This included the use of preventative diplomacy, peace-enforcement, peace-making, peace-keeping and post-conflict reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|The PSIA {{had been}} {{supposed}} to be integrated with Naicho in order to reorient the agency to a <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> and to enhance Naicho's resources, but the proposal was not adopted.|$|E
25|$|President Bill Clinton {{spoke at}} the school in 1993. In Clinton's speech, he marked the community's {{technological}} contributions to national security, and envisioned a new <b>Post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> role for the town in promoting technological advancement and prosperity.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the free}} travel {{agreement}} and politic of the <b>post–Cold</b> <b>War</b> period, {{as well as}} hardship of the life in the post 1990s economic depression, Romania has an increasingly large diaspora. The main emigration targets are Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Canada and the USA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Post–Cold</b> <b>War</b> Romania {{developed}} {{closer ties}} with Western Europe, eventually joining NATO in 2004. The country applied in June 1993 {{for membership in}} the European Union (EU). It became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a member on 1 January 2007.|$|E
25|$|EUCOM Commander Gen. John M. Shalikashvili {{hosted the}} June 5, 1993 {{ceremony}} officially dedicating the Marshall Center in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The center {{was given the}} charter of stabilizing and thereby strengthening <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> Europe. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and German Minister of Defense Volker Rühe were the keynote speakers.|$|E
25|$|Early 1990s {{development}} of the Leclerc fitted with a turret derived {{from that of the}} German Flakpanzer Gepard. Armed with twin 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons and two twin pack Mistral SAM launchers (total of four ready missiles). It was not adopted for service due to <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> defence cutbacks.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} debated issues {{relating}} to ethnic conflict is whether {{it has become more}} or less prevalent in the <b>post–Cold</b> <b>War</b> period. At the end of the Cold War, academics including Samuel P. Huntington and Robert D. Kaplan predicted a proliferation of conflicts fueled by civilisational clashes, Tribalism, resource scarcity and overpopulation.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{themes in}} the 1990s {{included}} environmental issues, {{the implications of the}} global Internet and the expanding information universe, questions about biotechnology and nanotechnology, as well as a <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> interest in post-scarcity societies; Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age comprehensively explores these themes. Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan novels brought the character-driven story back into prominence.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Bottom Up Review and <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> force cutbacks, the Army National Guard {{maneuver}} force was reduced to eight divisions (from ten; the 26th Infantry and 50th Armored were consolidated in the northeastern states) and fifteen 'enhanced brigades,' which were supposed to be ready for combat operations, augmenting the active force, within 90 days.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Clinton {{administration}} advised cutting {{funding for}} Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty {{as it was}} felt <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and he then proposed the compromise of the International Broadcasting Act. The Broadcasting Board of Governors was established and took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously oversaw funding for RFE/RL.|$|E
25|$|VP-93 was disestablished on 30 September 1994 due to (1) {{retirement}} of the P-3B from the U.S. Navy inventory and {{a transition to}} an all P-3C force, (2) a reduction in active and Reserve VP squadrons as part of <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> drawdown, and (3) BRAC action directing the closure of NAF Detroit and its realignment as Naval Air Reserve Center Detroit (NAVAIRESCEN Detroit) with no operational flying units or activities.|$|E
25|$|The U-2 {{is one of}} {{a handful}} of {{aircraft}} types to have served the USAF for over 50 years accompanied by aircraft such as the B-52. The newest models (TR-1, U-2R, U-2S) entered service in the 1980s. The current model, the U-2S, received its most recent technical upgrade in 2012. They have taken part in <b>post–Cold</b> <b>War</b> conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and supported several multinational NATO operations.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{had plans}} to {{construct}} cargo submarines both during World War II and in the Cold War, but these plans were never carried out. These would not strictly count as merchant submarines, {{as they would have}} been at least lightly armed and used mainly for directly war-related duties, such as supplying troops or delivering military forces to their targets. However, in the <b>post-Cold</b> <b>War</b> period, Soviet designers also proposed purely peaceful applications.|$|E
25|$|The <b>post–Cold</b> <b>War</b> {{period has}} {{witnessed}} {{a number of}} ethnically-informed secessionist movements, predominantly within the former communist states. Conflicts have involved secessionist movements in the former Yugoslavia, Transnistria in Moldova, Armenians in Azerbaijan, Abkhaz and Ossetians in Georgia. Outside the former communist bloc, ethno-separatist strife {{in the same period}} has occurred in areas such as Sri Lanka, West Papua, Chiapas, East Timor, the Basque Country Southern Sudan and Hazaras in Afghanistan under the Taliban.|$|E
