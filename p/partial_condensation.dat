40|$|It is {{well known}} that when a {{superheated}} gas reaches a cold surface, the condensation starts immediately only if the wall temperature is lower than the dew temperature of the refrigerant; in this case, the heat transfer phenomenon can be also affected by the superheating temperature.

40|$|AbstractThe {{death of}} poliovirus-infected cells may occur in two forms: {{canonical}} cytopathic effect (CPE) (on productive infections) or apoptosis (when the viral reproduction is hindered by certain drugs {{or some other}} restrictive conditions). Morphological manifestations of the CPE and apoptosis, being distinct, share some traits (e. g., chromatin condensation and nuclear deformation). It was shown here that a permeable caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD. fmk), prevented {{the development of the}} poliovirus-induced apoptosis on abortive infection. The apoptotic pathway could be dissected by an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), which prevented the cleavage of DNA to oligonucleosome-sized pieces and nuclear fragmentation but did not suppress cellular shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing, and <b>partial</b> chromatin <b>condensation.</b> These results demonstrate that caspase activation is involved in the execution phase of the viral apoptosis and suggest that a nuclear subset of the apoptotic program is under a separate control, involving a TPCK-sensitive event.

40|$|AbstractDue {{to climate}} change it is {{necessary}} to reduce anthropogenic climate gas emissions. The application of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies could be a suitable approach to lower the specific CO 2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. One of these CCS technologies is the Oxyfuel process. In the Oxyfuel process the coal is burned in a mixed atmosphere of O 2 and recycled flue gas. The flue gas thus generated has a high CO 2 concentration, because of the missing air nitrogen. Still the dried flue gas consists of approximately 15 mol-% impurities (O 2, N 2, Ar, NOx and SOx). To increase the CO 2 -purity the flue gas is treated in a gas processing unit (GPU). Two promising technologies to perform the gas processing are <b>partial</b> <b>condensation</b> and distillation. Both are well known and available at industrial scale. Using these technologies about 90 % of the CO 2 can be separated. The remaining part of the CO 2 leaves the GPU with the offgas. To increase the overall capture rate of the CO 2 in the Oxyfuel process the offgas from the GPU can be treated in either a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycle or a polymeric membrane (PM) cycle. These cycles generate a CO 2 -enriched GPU-recycle stream and an exhaust gas stream which consists of the residual impurities. The CO 2 -enriched GPU-recycle can be fed back to the GPU or mixed with the CO 2 product stream of the GPU. The exhaust gas stream with the impurities has a high content of O 2 and could be refed to the air separation unit (ASU) to increase the efficiency of the overall process. The additional gas treatment in the PSA- or the PM-cycle has influences on the specific energy demand of the GPU, the CO 2 capture rate, the composition of the CO 2 product stream and the overall process efficiency. In the work presented here the feed gas of the GPU is the flue gas of a large scale bituminous coal-fired Oxyfuel power plant. The plant model is based on the actual state-of-the-art power plant technology. For the GPU two different reference process cases are modelled. One case with a distillation of the CO 2 and one case with a <b>partial</b> <b>condensation</b> of the CO 2 are considered. For both cases the GPU process is externally cooled. These reference cases are compared then with a distillation and a <b>partial</b> <b>condensation</b> which have an additional offgas treatment by PSA or PM. For the offgas treatment with membranes, polymeric membranes are considered due to their high CO 2 /O 2 -selectivity and high permeability. For the offgas treatment with PSA a multiple bed cycle is modelled to assure continuous operation of the plant. The overall CO 2 capture rate, the specific energy demand and the composition of the CO 2 product stream are calculated for the reference cases, the distillation with PSA or PM and the <b>partial</b> <b>condensation</b> with PSA or PM. With these results the potential of these technologies for the GPU shall be compared with the reference cases. Furthermore a recycle of the O 2 -containing gas stream to the ASU is modelled in the overall process model. This recycled gas stream can be used to reduce the energy demand of the ASU. The influence of the offgas treatment is evaluated by calculating the net efficiency of the overall process...|$|E

Cells depleted of the Aurora B kinase show only <b>partial</b> chromosome <b>condensation</b> at mitosis. This {{is associated with a}} reduction in levels of the serine 10 phosphorylated form of histone H 3 and a failure to recruit the Barren condensin protein onto chromosomes. These defects are associated with abnormal segregation resulting from lagging chromatids and extensive chromatin bridging at anaphase, similar to the phenotype of barren mutants (Bhat, M. A., A. V. Philp, D. M. Glover, and H. J. Bellen. 1996. Cell. 87 : 1103 â€“ 1114.). The majority of treated cells also fail to undertake cytokinesis and show a reduced density of microtubules in the central region of the spindle. This is accompanied by a failure to correctly localize the Pavarotti kinesin-like protein, essential for this process. We discuss these conserved functions of Aurora B kinase in chromosome transmission and cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|We {{analytically}} derive {{the expressions}} for {{the structure of}} the inner region of protoplanetary disks based on the results from the recent hydrodynamical simulations. The inner part of a disk can be divided into four regions: dust-free region with gas temperature in the optically thin limit, optically thin dust halo, optically thick condensation front and the classical optically thick region in order from the inside. We derive the dust-to-gas mass ratio profile in the dust halo using the fact that <b>partial</b> dust <b>condensation</b> regulates the temperature to the dust evaporation temperature. Beyond the dust halo, there is an optically thick condensation front where all the available silicate gas condenses out. The curvature of the condensation surface is determined by the condition that the surface temperature must be nearly equal to the characteristic temperature âˆ¼ 1200 K. We derive the mid-plane temperature in the outer two regions using the two-layer approximation with the additional heating by the condensation front for the outermost region. As a result, the overall temperature profile is step-like with steep gradients at the borders between the outer three regions. The borders might act as planet traps where the inward migration of planets due to gravitational interaction with the gas disk stops. The temperature at the border between the two outermost regions coincides with the temperature needed to activate magnetorotational instability, suggesting that the inner edge of the dead zone must lie at this border. The radius of the dead-zone inner edge predicted from our solution is âˆ¼ 2 - 3 times larger than that expected from the classical optically thick temperature.

40|$|The {{origin of}} olivine grains {{isolated}} in the matrix of C 2 carbonaceous chondrites i an important problem. If these grains are condensates from a solar nebular gas, they contain compositional, isotopic and physical features that further elucidate that process. If, however, they are grains released by the breakup of chondrules, then many impor-tant condensation features have been lost during the melting that took place to form chondrules. In evaluating these two possibilities, {{care must be taken}} to determine which inclusions in C 2 meteorites are actual chondrules and which are aggregates of grains that have never undergone melting. The two main types of aggregates, pyroxene-rich and pyroxene-poor, are forty to fifty times more abundant than chondrules. Four scena-rios are presented to account for the kinds of aggregates and isolated grains seen in the Murchison C 2 meteorite. An analysis of these scenarios i made in light of olivine crystal morphology, comparison of composition of glass inclusions inside olivine grains with interstitial glass in true chondrules and size distributions of olivines, isolated, in aggregates and in chondrules. It is concluded that no scenario that includes a chondrule-making step can account for the observed population of isolated olivine grains. An origin by direct <b>condensation,</b> <b>partial</b> comminution, aggregation and accretion best accounts for the sizes and morphological features observed. 1...|$|R
