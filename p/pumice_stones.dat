25|$|The Shulchan Aruch quotes the Talmud {{that because}} {{scissors}} have two blades, it would therefore {{be permitted to}} trim the beard by using them, since the cutting action would come from contact between two blades and not from that between blade and skin. In Germany and Italy, {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century, Jews started removing beards with the aid of <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> and chemical depilatories, which would leave the face smooth, as if it had been shaven. These are non-razor shaves which are not prohibited. Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (Tzemach Tzedek) argued that shaving a beard would fall under the biblical regulation against males resembling a female (he also extended the prohibition for wanton destruction to destroying the hair of the beard); the Shulchan Aruch interpreted this regulation in a different way, arguing that it forbade men from removing hair from areas where women were accustomed to remove hair, such as underarm hair and pubic hair.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{basic information}} on the mechanical properties of steel fibre-reinforced lightweight concrete, manufactured using <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> or expanded clay aggregates. Results are presented for standard compressive tests and indirect tensile tests (splitting tests on cylinder specimens and flexure tests on prismatic beams using a three-point loading arrangement) under monotonically increasing or cyclically varying loads. The influence of steel fibres and aggregate types on modulus of elasticity, compressive and tensile strength and post-peak behaviour is evaluated. Test results show that compressive strength does not change for <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> aggregates, while an increase is observed for expanded clay; tensile strength and fracture toughness are significantly improved for both <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> and expanded clay. The results also show that with both expanded clay and <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> lightweight aggregates a suitable content of fibres allows one to obtain performances comparable with those expected from normal weight concrete, the important advantage of lower structural weight being maintained...|$|R
25|$|One notable {{aspect of}} the {{construction}} at El Tajin {{is the use of}} poured cement in forms. Surviving roof fragments from Building C in the Tajín Chico section is an example of cement roof constructions. Due to the lack of beams or other materials to prop it up, this roof had to be very thick to support itself. To lighten the load and to bind the layers of cement, <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> and pottery shards were mixed into the cement. The cement could not be poured all at once but rather in successive layers. It has been suggested that the buildings were filled with earth to support the roof as it was being poured and dried. The finished roofs were nearly a meter thick and almost perfectly flat. While this kind of cement roof is common in modern times, it was unique in the Mesoamerican world. Impressions of baskets, tamale wrappers and other items have been found in the dried cement. The poured cement was used in the only building with two floors at the site, Building B, as a roof and as a separator between the ground and upper floor. The only other known example of two story construction is in the Mayan territories. Another feature shared only with the Mayans is the use of a light blue paint. (wikerson45) Another feature unique to El Tajin is that a number of the residences have windows placed to allow cool breezes to enter on hot days.|$|E

In Costa Rica, atenolol, a β-blocker drug, {{has been}} {{identified}} like an organic emerging compound of high incidence in urban wastewater. Due to its continue discharge, its potential chronic effect on exposed aquatic organisms and the limitation of removal in conventional wastewater treatments, it is {{of great interest to}} develop methodologies that contribute to its removal. This research studies the use of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> as an adsorbent to remove atenolol from wastewater. The adsorption capacity of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was characterized by isotherms and kinetics adsorption, including its dependence on pH, using atenolol solutions of 8 mg/L in batch experiments, with <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> of 0, 85 - 1, 18 mm granulometry and 4, 24 m 2 /g of superficial area. The adsorption isotherm results were adjusted to Langmuir model, with an adsorption capacity of 0, 1131 mg/g in water type II and 0. 0439 mg/g in wastewater, both at pH 7, 2. The adsorption kinetics of atenolol on <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> were adjusted to the pseudo second order model, with an equilibrium time of 4, 0 hours.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} a broad audience of rural populations affected by drinking arsenic-contaminated water. Exposure to arsenic in the drinking water {{has been associated with}} the development of skin and internal cancers and non-carcinogenic effects such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (Abernathy et al., 593 – 597). Traditional technologies to remove arsenic from water include: coagulation and filtration, activate alumina, ion-exchange, reverse osmosis, and electro-dialysis. These methods are very expensive to build and operate in rural areas with scattered populations. The focus of this research was to remove the arsenic from drinking water by a sorption process. Batch studies were conducted on twelve adsorbent materials with water containing 100 μg/L arsenic (V). The outcome of the research indicates that iron-oxide-coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> (IOCPS) removes both arsenic (III) and arsenic (V). The arsenic (V) appears to be more easily removed than arsenic (III). In a laboratory column test, the breakthrough volume of the iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was 4000 bed volumes. The concentration of arsenic in the feed water was 100 μg/L and the effluent concentration was below detection limit (3 ̆c 2 μg/L). Optimum empty bed contact time for arsenic (V) removal by the iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was 8 to 10 minutes. The optimum pH for arsenic removal by IOCPS was found to be in the range of 5. 5 to 6. 0. The presence of sulfate, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate in the water reduces the arsenic removal capacity of iron-oxide-coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone.</b> Presence of calcium, magnesium in the water does not effect the arsenic removal by iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone.</b> The residual waste is non-hazardous and can be disposed in landfills. ...|$|R
