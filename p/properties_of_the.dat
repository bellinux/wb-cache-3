30|$|In this section, we {{summarize}} <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> a WSN as four secure properties when it {{is under}} a distance-consistent spoofing attack: <b>the</b> temporal <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locators, <b>the</b> spatial <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locators, <b>the</b> consistent <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legitimate locators, and <b>the</b> consistent <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacked locators. The detection schemes are therefore proposed based on the corresponding properties. Though the detection schemes based on the temporal and spatial properties {{have been used in}} [20] and the detection scheme based on <b>the</b> consistent <b>property</b> <b>of</b> legitimate locators has been used in [9], we jointly use these properties to defend against the distance-consistent spoofing attack.|$|R
