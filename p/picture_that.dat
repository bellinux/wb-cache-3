5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a photo album, so every single scene is kind of like a <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|The five reel {{film was}} {{released}} through the Pathé Exchange as a Pathé Gold Rooster Play on October 7, 1917. Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor's Trade Review {{found it to}} be a good film with great direction and photography, but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared {{to be involved in the}} accident was too real. Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness; which should prove a strong program for the Pathé program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph {{found it to be}} an average <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> was not exceptional for audiences, but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable, but found Warde's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the improbable story more plausible.|$|E
5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> the old man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E

When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had.
