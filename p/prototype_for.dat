5|$|Franjo Klein, a Vienna-born Zagreb architect, was {{commissioned}} {{to build the}} synagogue. Klein, a representative of romantic historicism, modeled the building on the Viennese Leopoldstädter Tempel (1858), a Moorish Revival temple designed by Ludwig Förster. It became a <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> synagogue design in Central Europe. Zagreb Synagogue used the already developed round arch style (Rundbogenstil), but did not adopt Förster's early oriental motifs.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed XF-104 was a single-engine, high-performance, {{supersonic}} interceptor <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> a United States Air Force (USAF) {{series of}} lightweight and simple fighters. Only two aircraft were built; one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic {{research and the}} other served as an armament testbed, both aircraft being destroyed in accidents during testing. The XF-104s were forerunners of over 2,500 production Lockheed F-104 Starfighters.|$|E

5|$|The Tupolev Tu-80 was a Soviet <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> a longer-ranged {{version of}} the Tupolev Tu-4 bomber, built after World War II. It was {{canceled}} in 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tupolev Tu-85 program which offered even more range. The sole prototype was used in various test programs before finally being used as a target.|$|E
5|$|The contract, car numbers (and year built) {{used were}} Arnines, {{specifically}} R1 100 (built 1930), R1 381 (1931), R4 401 (1932), R4 484 (1932) – Bulls Eye lighting and a test P.A. system added in 1946, R6-3 1000 (1935), R6-1 1300 (1937), R7A 1575 (1938) – rebuilt in 1947 as a <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> the R10 subway car, and R9 1802 (1940).|$|E
5|$|Although The Marble Index {{was largely}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it has {{achieved}} acclaim from music critics over time. Nico's unprecedented sound and personal style—both recognised for their tenebrous quality—are considered an influence on several artists. Most notably, they served as a musical and visual <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> the 1980s post-punk movement's gothic rock scene. Nico and Cale continued working together, releasing two more studio albums in the same vein—Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974)—which are now considered parts of a trilogy.|$|E

Microsoft ended production of the Lumia 2520 the following month, meaning {{that there are no}} longer any Windows RT devices in active production. In July 2016, an image depicting a number of cancelled Lumia devices was released, depicting a <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> a second Nokia tablet known as the Lumia 2020.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Holden {{transferred}} to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) with the new rank of major. From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries. Initially, Holden ran the drawing office and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium (Edwin Lutyens, Reginald Blomfield and Herbert Baker). Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at Louvencourt and, according to Geurst and Karol, probably on the one at Forceville that {{was selected as the}} <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> all that followed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> pre-production Harriers.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March 2012 Remedy Entertainment {{announced}} that the game has passed 2 million copies sold, including Xbox 360 and PC. On 23 May 2013 Remedy creative director Sam Lake {{announced that}} the game and its standalone follow up had sold 3 million copies. On 25 March 2015 Remedy's CEO Matias Myllyrinne tweeted that the franchise had sold over 4.5 million units. The following month a Polygon story on the game's <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> a sequel mentioned that Alan Wake had sold more than 3.2 million copies.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1862, the Confederate Navy {{initiated}} the first combat between ironclads when the Virginia successfully attacked the blockade. The next day, the Monitor engaged the Virginia in the Battle of Hampton Roads. Their battle {{ended in a}} draw, and the Confederacy later lost the Virginia when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture. The Monitor was the <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> the monitor warship and many more were built by the Union Navy. While the Confederacy built more ironclad ships during the war, they lacked the ability to build or purchase ships that could effectively counter the monitors.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} {{example of}} a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind in 1997. This theory describes {{the behavior of a}} set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.|$|E

5|$|Rætikon {{was first}} {{announced}} in July 2013, though its development began in 2011. The game's Viennese developer and publisher, Broken Rules Games, had previously {{worked on the}} 2012 Wii U game Chasing Aurora, which itself {{was based on a}} multiplayer <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> Rætikon. The game is partly based on an Alps region culture conquered by the Roman Empire. Its visuals were inspired by dream-like flying sensations. In an effort to increase the game's replay value, the developers emphasized its artificial intelligence, physics, and interactive qualities, including animal-specific behaviors and strippable plant foliage.|$|E
5|$|The Guthrie Theater, {{opened in}} 1963, was {{the brainchild of}} Sir Tyrone Guthrie, who wanted to found a {{regional}} theater without the commercial constraints of Broadway. The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the New York Times, and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> other resident non-profit theaters.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet <b>prototype</b> <b>for</b> {{a heavily}} armored ground-attack {{aircraft}} {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10. It featured a number of innovative concepts including a cockpit mounted {{on top of the}} engine, directly behind the propeller, and wing-mounted autocannon that could be adjusted on the ground to fire level or depressed 23° to allow the aircraft to strafe ground targets while remaining in level flight. However it was slower than the Il-10, and its M-47 engine was problematic in flight tests in 1948–49. It was not placed into production. The test pilots called the aircraft the Gorbach (Hunchback).|$|E
