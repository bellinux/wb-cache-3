5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into {{direct contact with}} the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese <b>papermaking</b> craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of <b>papermaking</b> to the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|China {{has been}} the source of many innovations, {{scientific}} discoveries and inventions. This includes the Four Great Inventions: <b>papermaking,</b> the compass, gunpowder, and printing (both woodblock and movable type). The list below contains these and other inventions in China attested by archaeology or history.|$|E
5|$|Coal lies {{under the}} area of mines opened in the Industrial Revolution, {{providing}} fuel for the cotton spinning and <b>papermaking</b> industries. By the mid-19th century, Radcliffe was an important mill town with cotton mills, bleachworks and a road, canal and railway network.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known Chinese {{piece of}} hard, hempen {{wrapping}} paper {{dates to the}} 2nd century BC. The standard <b>papermaking</b> process was invented by Cai Lun (50–121 AD) in 105 AD. The oldest known surviving {{piece of paper with}} writing on it was found in the ruins of a Han watchtower that had been abandoned in 110 AD, in Inner Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis is the third-most literate {{city in the}} U.S. A {{center for}} {{printing}} and publishing, Minneapolis was the city in which Open Book, the largest literary and book arts center in the U.S., was founded. The Center consists of the Loft Literary Center, the Minnesota Center for Book Arts and Milkweed Editions (the latter is sometimes called the country's largest independent nonprofit literary publisher). The Center exhibits and teaches both contemporary art and traditional crafts of writing, <b>papermaking,</b> letterpress printing and bookbinding.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp <b>papermaking</b> process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp <b>papermaking</b> being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. Paper is used a lot.|$|E
5|$|During the Islamic {{conquest of}} Persia (633–656), {{the son of}} the last ruler of the Sassanid Empire, Prince Pirooz, fled to Tang China. According to the Old Book of Tang, Pirooz was made the head of a Governorate of Persia in what is now Zaranj, Afghanistan. During this conquest of Persia, the Rashidun Islamic Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan (r. 644–656) sent an embassy to the Tang court at Chang'an. By the 740s, the Arabs of Khurasan had {{established}} a presence in the Ferghana basin and in Sogdiana. At the Battle of Talas in 751, Qarluq mercenaries under the Chinese defected, helping the Arab armies of the Islamic Caliphate to defeat the Tang force under commander Gao Xianzhi. Although the battle itself was not of the greatest significance militarily, this was a pivotal moment in history; it marks the spread of Chinese <b>papermaking</b> into regions west of China as captured Chinese soldiers revealed secrets of Chinese <b>papermaking</b> to the Arabs. These techniques ultimately reached Europe by the 12th century through Arab-controlled Spain. Although they had fought at Talas, on June 11, 758, an Abbasid embassy arrived at Chang'an simultaneously with the Uyghur Turks bearing gifts for the Tang Emperor. In 788–9 the Chinese concluded a military alliance with the Uighur Turks who twice defeated the Tibetans, in 789 near the town of Gaochang in Dzungaria, and in 791 near Ningxia on the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|Many calcium {{compounds}} {{are used}} in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a white powder that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in <b>papermaking</b> and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Italy {{a number}} of banks in Florence {{collapsed}} due to internal problems in Florence, contributed by King Edward III of England defaulting on some of his loans. Most notably, the Bardi family went bankrupt in this year. Italy also suffered a famine, {{making it difficult for}} the Papacy to recruit troops for the attack on Smyrna. The Venetians, however, organized an alliance uniting several European parties (Sancta Unio), composed notably of the Knights Hospitaller, which carried out five consecutive attacks on İzmir and the Western Anatolian coastline controlled by Turkish states. In the realm of technology, <b>papermaking</b> reached Holland, and firearms made their way to Northern Germany in this year. The earliest records in the area place them in the city of Aachen.|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty was {{an age of}} {{economic}} prosperity and saw a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c.1050–256 BC). The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To pay for its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including <b>papermaking,</b> the nautical steering rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum.|$|E
5|$|For printing, {{the mass}} {{production}} of paper for writing was already well established in China. The <b>papermaking</b> process had been perfected and standardized by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121) in 105, {{and was in}} widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century. The Song dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue paper-printed money—the banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Toilet paper had been in general use in China since the 6th century, paper bags for preserving the flavor of tea leaves by the 7th century, and by the Song dynasty government officials who had done a great service were rewarded by the court with gifts of paper-printed money wrapped in paper envelopes. During the Song dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed {{to meet the needs}} of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run mints and factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.|$|E
5|$|While maps {{drawn in}} ink on flat silk cloths {{have been found}} in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai (interred in 168 BCE at Mawangdui, Hunan province), the {{earliest}} known paper map found in China, dated 179–41 BCE and located at Fangmatan (near Tianshui, Gansu province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper. Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The <b>papermaking</b> process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack. By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the <b>papermaking</b> process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.|$|E
25|$|In the 8th century, <b>papermaking</b> {{spread to}} the Islamic world, where the process was refined, and {{machinery}} was designed for bulk manufacturing. Production began in Samarkand, Baghdad, Damascus, Cairo, Morocco, and then Muslim Spain. In Baghdad, <b>papermaking</b> was {{under the supervision of}} the Grand Vizier Ja'far ibn Yahya. Muslims invented a method to make a thicker sheet of paper. This innovation helped transform <b>papermaking</b> from an art into a major industry. The earliest use of water-powered mills in paper production, specifically the use of pulp mills for preparing the pulp for <b>papermaking,</b> dates back to Samarkand in the 8th century. The earliest references to paper mills also come from the medieval Islamic world, where they were first noted in the 9th century by Arabic geographers in Damascus. <b>Papermaking</b> was diffused across the Islamic world, from where it was diffused further west into Europe.|$|E
25|$|A fourth {{development}} was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing paper manufacture. The introduction of water-powered paper mills, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282, {{allowed for a}} massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese and Muslim <b>papermaking.</b> <b>Papermaking</b> centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further; <b>papermaking</b> centers reached Germany a century later.|$|E
25|$|<b>Papermaking</b> {{was once}} a local industry; the mill closed finally in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Cai Lun (ca. 50 AD– 121) {{introduced}} {{the first significant}} improvement and standardization of <b>papermaking</b> by adding essential new materials into its composition.|$|E
25|$|Later, Muslim {{engineers}} {{introduced the}} use of trip hammers {{in the production of}} paper, replacing the traditional Chinese mortar and pestle method of <b>papermaking.</b>|$|E
25|$|During 1890–1930, Sweden {{experienced}} the second industrial revolution. New industries developed with {{their focus on}} the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, <b>papermaking</b> and textile.|$|E
25|$|In technology, the Muslim world adopted <b>papermaking</b> from China. The {{knowledge}} of gunpowder was also transmitted from China via predominantly Islamic countries, where formulas for pure potassium nitrate were developed.|$|E
25|$|In 1803 {{the first}} {{automatic}} <b>papermaking</b> machinery {{was developed in}} Hemel by the Fourdrinier brothers at Frogmore. Paper making expanded in the vicinity in the early 19th century and grew into the huge John Dickinson mills in the 20th.|$|E
25|$|The Ralph Green {{collection}} on {{printing and}} the Joseph Hennage collection on printing and the Carol Beinbrink collection on <b>papermaking</b> total more than 1,400 volumes {{on the history}} of the book as an object, with the oldest title being the Quadragesimale by Johannes Gritsch printed in 1479.|$|E
25|$|In the Postbellum era (1865–1877), York {{remained}} a regional center for local agriculture, but increasingly {{became an important}} industrial center, with such industries as steam engines, railroad manufacturing, and <b>papermaking</b> coming to the forefront. York also features some unique architecture ranging from colonial era buildings to large gothic churches.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Japanese <b>papermaking</b> {{uses the}} inner bark fibers of plants. This fiber is soaked, cooked, rinsed and {{traditionally}} hand-beaten {{to form the}} paper pulp. The long fibers are layered to form strong, translucent sheets of paper. Three traditional fibers are abaca, kozo and gampi. Today, this paper is used for calligraphy, printing, book arts, and three-dimensional work, including origami.|$|E
25|$|The art, science, and {{technology}} of <b>papermaking</b> addresses the methods, equipment, and materials {{used to make}} paper and cardboard, these being used widely for printing, writing, and packaging, among many other purposes and useful products. Today almost all paper is manufactured using industrial machinery, while handmade paper survives as a specialized craft and a medium for artistic expression.|$|E
25|$|Cement-making, <b>papermaking,</b> and coal-mining were {{important}} industries in Kent during the 19th and 20th century. Cement {{came to the}} fore in the 19th century when massive building projects were undertaken. The ready supply of chalk and huge pits between Stone and Gravesend bear testament to that industry. There were also other workings around Burham on the tidal Medway.|$|E
25|$|Fine ground calcium {{carbonate}} (GCC) {{is an essential}} ingredient in the microporous film used in diapers and some building films as the pores are nucleated around the {{calcium carbonate}} particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching. GCC or PCC {{is used as a}} filler in paper because they are cheaper than wood fiber. In terms of market volume, GCC are the most important types of fillers currently used. Printing and writing paper can contain 10–20% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of glossy paper. Europe has been practicing this as alkaline <b>papermaking</b> or acid-free <b>papermaking</b> for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometres.|$|E
25|$|The first {{identified}} coarse paper, {{made from}} hemp, {{dates to the}} early Western Han Dynasty, two hundred years before the nominal invention of <b>papermaking</b> by Cai Lun, who improved and standardized paper production using a range of inexpensive materials, including hemp ends, approximately 2000 years ago. Recycled hemp clothing, rags and fishing nets were used as inputs for paper production.|$|E
25|$|In <b>papermaking,</b> a dilute {{suspension}} consisting {{mostly of}} separate cellulose fibres in water is drained through a sieve-like screen, {{so that a}} mat of randomly interwoven fibres is laid down. Water is further removed from this sheet by pressing, sometimes aided by suction or vacuum, or heating. Once dry, a generally flat, uniform and strong sheet of paper is achieved.|$|E
25|$|Acrylamide can be {{prepared}} by the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile by nitrile hydratase. In industry, most acrylamide is used to synthesize polyacrylamides, which find many uses as water-soluble thickeners. These include use in wastewater treatment, gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), <b>papermaking,</b> ore processing, tertiary oil recovery, and the manufacture of permanent press fabrics. Some acrylamide {{is used in the}} manufacture of dyes and the manufacture of other monomers.|$|E
25|$|Angoulême is a {{centre of}} the paper-making and {{printing}} industry, with which the town has been connected since the 14th century. <b>Papermaking</b> is favoured because of the uniform temperature and volume of the water year-round, {{partly due to the}} Touvre River, which joins the Charente at Angoulême. The Touvre is the second largest river with an underground source in France after the River Sorgue (Fontaine-de-Vaucluse).|$|E
25|$|<b>Papermaking</b> has {{traditionally}} been traced to China about AD 105, when Cai Lun, an official attached to the Imperial court during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), created {{a sheet of paper}} using mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishnets, old rags, and hemp waste. However, a recent archaeological discovery has been reported from Gansu of paper with Chinese characters on it dating to 8 BC.|$|E
25|$|North Kent {{is heavily}} industrialised with cement-making at Northfleet and Cuxton, brickmaking at Sittingbourne, {{shipbuilding}} on the Medway and Swale, engineering and aircraft {{design and construction}} at Rochester, chemicals at Dartford and <b>papermaking</b> at Swanley, and oil refining at Grain. A steel mini mill in Sheerness and a rolling mill in Queenborough.There are two nuclear power stations at Dungeness, although the older one, built in 1965, was closed {{at the end of}} 2006.|$|E
25|$|Some {{well known}} and {{recognized}} papermakers have found fame in other fields, {{to the point that}} their <b>papermaking</b> background is almost forgotten. One of the most notable examples might be that of the first humans that achieved flight, the Montgolfier brothers, where many accounts barely mention the paper mill their family owned, although paper used in their balloons did play a relevant role in their success, as probably did their familiarity with this light and strong material.|$|E
25|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{impacted by}} biofouling include microelectrochemical drug delivery devices, <b>papermaking</b> and pulp industry machines, underwater instruments, fire protection system piping, and sprinkler system nozzles. In groundwater wells, biofouling buildup can limit recovery flow rates, {{as is the}} case in the exterior and interior of ocean-laying pipes where fouling is often removed with a tube cleaning process. Besides interfering with mechanisms, biofouling also occurs on the surfaces of living marine organisms, when it is known as epibiosis.|$|E
25|$|While monitoring, {{regulations}} and action by concerned citizens, {{as well as}} improvements within the industry itself are limiting the worst abuses, <b>papermaking</b> continues to be of concern from an environmental perspective, due to its use of harsh chemicals, its need for large amounts of water, and the resulting contamination risks, as well as trees being used as {{the primary source of}} wood pulp. Paper made from other fibers, cotton being the most common, tends to be valued higher than wood-based paper.|$|E
