5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's <b>police</b> <b>radio,</b> but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own <b>police</b> <b>radio.</b> While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E
25|$|The {{recording}} {{was made}} from Dallas <b>Police</b> <b>Radio</b> Channel 1, which carried routine <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> traffic (Channel 2 was reserved for special events, such as the presidential motorcade). The open-microphone portion of the recording lasts 5.5 minutes, and begins about 12:29p.m. local time, about a minute before the assassination. Verbal time stamps were made periodically by the <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> dispatcher and can be heard on the recording.|$|E
50|$|<b>Police</b> <b>Radios</b> {{also use}} this {{technique}} to escalate {{a call that}} is quickly becoming an emergency.|$|R
25|$|The {{auxiliary}} policemen are un-armed {{and equipped}} with <b>police</b> <b>radios</b> and handcuffs and are issued an ID {{similar to the}} ones used by the National Police.|$|R
5000|$|Auxiliary Police {{officers}} carry handcuffs, PR-24 or expandable batons, pepper spray, and <b>police</b> <b>radios.</b> All {{officers are}} also trained in defensive tactics and in CPR/First Aid ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Police</b> <b>radio</b> (VK-1) was {{transmitted}} from Wireless Hill, operated remotely from police headquarters in Roe St, Perth. Initially, {{in the late}} 1920s, two patrol cars in Perth were equipped with radios.|$|E
25|$|Auxiliary Police {{officers}} {{can make}} arrests for crimes {{that occur in}} their presence and for crimes that weren't committed in their presence based on information from a dispatcher or police officer heard over a <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> or from {{a police officer in}} person. This authority was established by the New York Court of Appeals in the case of People v. Rosario, 78 N.Y.2d 583, 585 N.E.2d 766, 578 N.Y.S.2d 454 (1991).|$|E
5000|$|MTA <b>police</b> <b>radios</b> and New York City <b>Police</b> Department <b>radios</b> {{transmitted}} {{at different}} frequencies, {{so they could}} not coordinate with each other. Subway patrols were also adherent to tight schedules, and felons quickly knew when and where police would make patrols. Public morale of the MTA police was low at the time. so that by October 1979, additional decoy and undercover units were deployed in the subway.|$|R
50|$|In 1940, HPD {{had grown}} to 466 officers. With the {{increased}} use of the <b>police</b> <b>radios,</b> a PBX operator was hired to handle police calls.In the same year the Department started giving voluntary blood tests to determine the intoxication of suspected drunken drivers.|$|R
25|$|While on duty, all {{officers}} of the Metuchen Auxiliary Police have powers to enforce laws in the borough of Metuchen. Auxiliary Police officers in Metuchen do not carry firearms, but do carry other items such as handcuffs, expandable batons, pepper spray, EMS gloves, and <b>police</b> <b>radios.</b> All members are also trained in self-defensive tactics for their safety, and in CPR/AED.|$|R
25|$|It was {{a police}} car version of the Gallardo LP560-4 coupé for the Italian State Police, with a camera {{recording}} system featuring a camera beside the rear view mirror, GPS navigation, a gun holster, a <b>police</b> <b>radio,</b> a Paletta warning sign, a portable screen, a refrigerator and defibrillator in the front cargo compartment, blu Polizia body colour, a police beacon with blue LEDs at the vehicle's front, roof, side, and rear.|$|E
25|$|Skala then {{indicated}} to Novak {{that she did}} not require his assistance with Morris—who, aside from being intoxicated, was over six feet tall and a foot taller than officer Skala. Novack did not place himself back in service for new assignments, but instead tried to catch up with Skala on the courtesy ride, but did not use his <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> to coordinate movements with Skala, and arrived at the scene too late.|$|E
25|$|Major {{changes have}} {{occurred}} to the memorial and the nearby area since it was completed in 1970. The King Street Metro station opened about three blocks from the memorial in November 1983. Storm windows on the exterior of building were also replaced about this time, {{at a cost of}} $75,000. Microwave transmission antennas were added {{to the top of the}} memorial in 1990 to help the City of Alexandria improve <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> transmissions in the area.|$|E
50|$|A larger {{specification}} {{battery and}} 110A alternator was also fitted to run all the extra equipment, {{along with a}} dedicated Police fuse box in the boot. Extra wiring looms are also fitted specially for the <b>Police</b> <b>radios</b> and other equipment, including CCTV cameras. Additional electrical noise suppression has been added {{so as not to}} interfere with the sensitive electronics the police use.|$|R

50|$|Communication with Highway Patrol members {{prior to}} the use of <b>police</b> <b>radios</b> was {{accomplished}} through posting of signs in public places. This method of communicating required a strong relationship with the public that was being served. Highway Patrol Officers would call their stations for messages about accidents or the status of motor vehicle complaints when signs were posted. Today this close association with the public would be considered community policing.|$|R
25|$|Campo de Marte {{is located}} in Santana district, the {{northern}} zone of São Paulo. The airport handles private flights and air shuttles, including air taxi firms. Opened in 1935, Campo de Marte is the base for the largest helicopter fleet in Brazil and the world's, ahead of New York and Tokyo, with a fleet of more than 3.500 helicopters. This airport is the home base of the State Civil Police Air Tactical Unit, the State Military <b>Police</b> <b>Radio</b> Patrol Unit and the São Paulo Flying Club.|$|E
25|$|BPD {{has evolved}} its crime {{fighting}} technology and techniques over the years, {{beginning with the}} introduction of call boxes in 1885. Other major technological upgrades include the introduction of the Bertillion system in 1896, <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> communications in 1933, a police laboratory in 1950, computerized booking procedures and 911 emergency systems in 1985, the first ever 311 non-emergency system and CCTV cameras (like those in the United Kingdom) in 1996, and the CitiStat system in 2000. The latter enables the police to concentrate its resources on areas with particular types or high rates of crime.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2004, the {{majority}} of the existing <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> spectrum, which was subject to serious interference in some areas, was to be withdrawn and replaced by a new spectrum of superior quality, dedicated to use by public safety organisations, on which users would be required to use digital equipment. Knowledge of this change reinforced the need, already identified by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Home Office, for a new radio strategy. A Review of Radio Communications in the Police and Fire Services of England and Wales was inaugurated, a parallel review was carried out in Scotland, and the Public Safety Radio Communications Project was born. The radios proved exceptional during the 2005 London bombings.|$|E
50|$|After the war, the Delaware State Guard {{received}} surplus {{equipment from}} the federal armed forces, including eight jeeps and an ambulance from Fort Dix, New Jersey in August 1945. Additionally, in June 1946, the State Guard received its own waveband from the FCC {{in order to provide}} radio communication among all the units in the state. Previously the State Guard had been forced to rely upon borrowed State <b>Police</b> <b>radios</b> for maneuvers and for radio cars.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of economically developed countries police services have access to such equipment; also, in most countries, police cars have sets which are designed to receive calls from the control room, and respond. Also, small personal radios exist that allow each officer to carry one easily, {{as well as a}} large central room at the Police station which directs personnel to the location of emergency incidents. Portable <b>police</b> <b>radios</b> first appeared within the British police in 1969.|$|R
50|$|Toronto, Hamilton, Berlin (Kitchener), Windsor {{and other}} cities modernized and professionalized their public {{services}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. No service was changed more dramatically than the police. The introduction of emergency telephone call boxes linked to a central dispatcher, plus bicycles, motorcycles and automobiles shifted the patrolman's duties from passively walking the beat to fast reaction to reported incidents, as well as handling automobile traffic. After 1930 the introduction of <b>police</b> <b>radios</b> speeded response times.|$|R
25|$|On March 18, 2016, California State Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez of the Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management {{conducted}} {{a hearing in}} which first responders were to share details of {{the response to the}} attack and possible aspects that could be improved on. During the hearing, Michael Madden, a lieutenant with the San Bernardino Police Department {{and one of the first}} responders to respond to the Inland Regional Center, requested state aid in encrypting <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> channels. He explained that police communications were playing out real-time across the U.S. during the attack, being broadcast on YouTube and other network systems. According to Madden, this put first responders at risk, as potential suspects could have been monitoring the communications and tracking the actions of law enforcement. He added that the City of San Bernardino, as well as San Bernardino County, were moving towards a radio system that will incorporate encrypted frequencies.|$|E
500|$|Police {{telephone}} logs {{had been}} entered as evidence during the trial, {{but had not}} been noticed by Bamber's lawyers. Bamber's new defence team based their new CCRC submissions in part on these logs, particularly on the radio log that, they say, shows Neville called police that night to say his daughter had [...] "gone berserk" [...] {{with one of his}} guns. A separate log of a <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> message shows there was an attempt to speak to someone inside the farmhouse that night, as police waited outside to enter, but there was no response. Police say the officers simply made a mistake.|$|E
500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, two deleted {{scenes from}} [...] "Greg Pikitis" [...] were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first minute-long clip, Leslie broadcasts an impression of a police officer on Dave's <b>police</b> <b>radio,</b> which gets him into trouble. She also discusses the frequent use of torture by Jack Bauer, the protagonist of the Fox series 24, while she contemplates torturing Greg Pikitis. In the second 75-second clip, Jerry nearly passes out from dehydration in his oversized Halloween dragon costume, and Leslie arrives late to the party dressed as a nurse.|$|E
2500|$|Auxiliary Police {{officers}} wear {{virtually the}} same uniform as regular officers, and are equipped with straight wood batons as the standard issue weapon, bullet resistant vests, <b>police</b> <b>radios</b> (directly linked to the Central dispatcher, other Auxiliary officers, and Regular officers), flashlights, whistles, handcuffs, and reflective traffic vests. Their badge is a seven-point star, {{in contrast to the}} shield as [...] "Part Time Peace Officers without Firearms Training" [...] and are registered as peace officers in the NYS DCJS registry of peace officers.|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic {{interference}} (EMI) {{from sources}} such as television transmitters, <b>police</b> <b>radios</b> and cellular phones can cause medical monitors and other hospital devices to malfunction, says the principal investigator of a McGill biomedical engineering group set up in 1989 to study, predict and prevent such problems. The impact of equipment malfunction can range from mere inconvenience to serious problems. The research group advises physicians {{and other health care}} professionals to learn how to spot problems related to EMI and electromagnetic compatibility...|$|R
500|$|Johnson, alive but injured, is {{spying on}} his own home, {{watching}} Briggs visit Shelly. Shelly is terrified that Johnson will return and kill her; but Briggs reassures her he {{will take care of}} things. Johnson is also listening to a <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> in his truck, and hears that Renault's myna bird is being considered a witness as its ability to mimic speech might provide a clue; he drives off immediately. That night, he shoots the bird dead through the sheriff station's window. However, a voice-activated tape recorder had been left by the bird's cage; Cooper is able to find the words [...] "Leo, no!" [...] among the phrases it had repeated that evening.|$|E
500|$|Acting Mayor Feinstein, Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, and Milk's {{successor}} Harry Britt {{condemned the}} jury's decision. When {{it was announced}} over the <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> in the city, someone sang [...] "Danny Boy" [...] on the police band. A surge {{of people from the}} Castro District walked again to City Hall, chanting [...] "Avenge Harvey Milk" [...] and [...] "He got away with murder". Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk's friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They shoved a burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew. One of the rioters responded to a reporter's question about why they were destroying parts of the city: [...] "Just tell people that we ate too many Twinkies. That's why this is happening." [...] The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground. The White Night riots, as they became known, lasted several hours.|$|E
500|$|Petty thief Louis [...] "Lou" [...] Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) {{is caught}} {{stealing}} from a Los Angeles construction site by a security guard. He attacks the guard, steals {{his watch and}} leaves with the stolen material. After selling the material at a scrap yard, Lou asks for a job, but the foreman {{says he does not}} hire thieves. While driving home, Lou sees a car crash and pulls over. Stringers—freelance photojournalists—arrive and record two police officers pulling a woman from the wreck. One of the stringers, Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), tells Lou that they sell their footage to local news stations. Inspired, Lou steals a bicycle and pawns it for a camcorder and a <b>police</b> <b>radio</b> scanner. After two unsuccessful attempts at recording incidents, Lou records the aftermath of a fatal carjacking and sells the footage to KWLA 6. The morning news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) tells him the station is especially interested in footage of violent incidents in affluent areas. Lou hires an assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate for money. To give his footage more impact, Lou begins tampering with crime scenes and in one case moves a body. As Lou's work gains traction, he buys better equipment and a faster car.|$|E
