40|$|Rod-rod and {{multiple}} rod gaps {{are used for}} overvoltage protection of various power system apparatus. These are mostly located outdoors and are subjected to dust and sand particulate contamination in desert lands. This paper discusses the influence of these pollutants on the breakdown voltage and breakdown time of <b>protective</b> <b>rod</b> gaps. The tested gaps include single rod-rod gaps as well as multiple rod-rod gaps in series. The rod radius and its end profile are changed to find the rod configuration which is least affected by dust pollution. In addition several practical protective gaps that are used across transformer bushings are also tested to check their performance in clean and dust polluted conditions. It is found that such pollution drastically changes the breakdown voltage {{as well as the}} breakdown time. Specific recommendations are made concerning the choice of suitable <b>protective</b> <b>rod</b> gap configuration and gap spacings which depend upon geographical location.

40|$|Outdoor air insulated, {{high voltage}} {{transmission}} and distribution networks are frequently exposed to atmospheric pollution {{in the form of}} sand and dust storms which can affect the breakdown and prebreakdown characteristics and insulation performance of air gaps. This paper summarizes the findingks of an extensive study carried out to determine the effect of sand/dust contamination on the high voltage impulse breakdown characteristics of different types of air gaps. Analysis of {{the results of this study}} highlight the influence of airborne and surface adhering sand/dust contamination on the engineering, design criteria to specify clearances of overhead lines and station equipment, design and performance of <b>protective</b> <b>rod</b> gaps and the accuracy of high voltage measurements using sphere gaps...|$|E

50|$|The mortar joints {{have been}} repointed {{throughout}} {{the structure and}} the coquina rock pieces that were missing have been replaced. The blind oculus opening and the decorative inset grids on the cupola have been repainted. The entire structure has been rewired and new exterior and interior lighting has been installed. Lightning <b>protective</b> <b>rods</b> have been installed {{on the top of}} the tower. The fountain has been upgraded with a new motor and pump and it has been resurfaced as well.|$|R
25|$|In a {{lightning}} protection system, {{a lightning}} rod is a single component of the system. The lightning rod requires a connection to earth to perform its <b>protective</b> function. Lightning <b>rods</b> come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed, rounded, flat strips or even bristle brush-like. The main attribute common to all lightning rods {{is that they are}} all made of conductive materials, such as copper and aluminum. Copper and its alloys are the most common materials used in lightning protection.|$|R
40|$|<b>Protective</b> gaps; <b>Rod</b> gaps; Standard {{switching}} impulses This paper {{presents the}} effects of simulated dust pollution on the breakdown characteristics of protective gaps subjected to standard switching impulses (250 / 2500 μs) of both polarities. Hemispherical and square cut rod gaps were employed and their performance was compared in a gap spacing varying from 5 cm to 120 cm. It was found that dust pollution either reduces the 50 % breakdown voltage or increases it, depending upon the gap spacing. Formation of a stable dust particle film on the cathode was found to control these irregularities in breakdown parameters. It was also found that square cut rod gaps display immunity toward dust pollution under positive switching impulses and are therefore best suited for applications in terrains where dust storms are common.

6000|$|The {{bill which}} {{was before the}} {{committee}} {{two years ago when}} I was down there was the most stupefying jumble of conflicting and apparently irreconcilable interests that was ever seen; and we all said [...] "the case is hopeless, absolutely hopeless--out of this chaos nothing can be built." [...] But we were in error; out of that chaotic mass this excellent bill has been instructed; the warring interests have been reconciled, and the result is as comely and substantial a legislative edifice as lifts its domes and towers and <b>protective</b> lightning <b>rods</b> out of the statute book, I think. When I think of that other bill, which even the Deity couldn't understand, and of this one which even I can understand, I take off my hat to the man or men who devised this one. Was it R. U. Johnson? Was it the Author's League? Was it both together? I don't know, but I take off my hat, anyway. Johnson has written a valuable article about the new law--I enclose it.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Lightning {{triggered}} {{from natural}} thunderclouds using the rocket-and-wire technique was employed {{in order to}} subject to direct lightning strikes the lightning protective system of a test house at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, FL. The electrical circuit of the test house {{was connected to the}} secondary of a padmount distribution transformer located a distance of about 50 m from the house. The transformer primary was connected to a 650 -m long unenergized underground power cable. The test house had two ground rods, one for the lightning protective system grounding and the other for the power supply system grounding. The two rods were about 3 m apart and were connected by a metallic cable. Lightning current was injected into the lightning <b>protective</b> system ground <b>rod,</b> and the currents and voltages at different points in the test system were measured.

40|$|In nonphagocytic cells, Rac 1 is a {{component}} of NADPH oxidase that produces reactive oxygen species [Ushio-Fukai M (2006) Sci STKE 2006 :re 8]. Rac 1 is expressed abundantly in mammalian retinal photoreceptors, where it is activated in response to light stimuli [Balasubramanian N, Slepak VZ (2003) Curr Biol 13 : 1306 – 1310]. We used Cre-LoxP conditional gene targeting to knock down Rac 1 expression in mouse rod photoreceptors and found protection against light-induced photoreceptor death compared with WT litter-mates. We also found a similar <b>protective</b> effect on <b>rods</b> using apocynin, which inhibits NADPH oxidase activity. These results implicate both neuronal Rac 1 and NADPH oxidase in cell death in this model of CNS degeneration. Studies in which dominant-mutants of Rac 1 were expressed in transgenic Drosophila species demonstrated that Rac 1 is a key regulator of photoreceptor morphogenesis and polarity [Chang HY, Ready DF (2000) Science 290 : 1978 – 1980]. However, we found that diminished Rac 1 expression in mouse rods {{had no effect on}} retinal structure or function examined by light microscopy, electron microscopy, rhodopsin measurement, electroretinogram activity, and visual acuity, indicating rod outer segment morphogenesis proceeded normally in Rac 1 conditional knockout mice. The lack of structural or functional effect of Rac 1 depletion on photoreceptors, but protection under conditions of stress, indicate that the Rac 1 pathway warrants exploration as a target for therapy in retinal neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
