5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at least a week after the hurricane. Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas, which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed. Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended {{to turn it into a}} railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> penny.|$|E

40|$|A {{new class}} of options, " double lookbacks", where the payoffs depend on the maximum and/or minimum <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> or two traded assets is {{introduced}} and analyzed.

Analytical expressions of the joint probability distribution of the maximum and minimum values of two correlated geometric Brownian motions are derived and used in the valuation of double lookbacks.

The DAP, through its leader Lim Kit Siang also pressured Hui Yew to speak up against the government's education policy, claiming that Hui Yew's choice to have his children educated overseas demonstrated his {{lack of confidence in}} Malaysian education. On education, the DAP also criticised SUPP's involvement in the sale of the Laila Taib College, previously known as United College Sarawak, to the Yayasan Sarawak (Sarawak Foundation) for the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> ringgit, when the local Chinese population had donated money to fund the college's building.|$|E

Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{explore the}} {{properties}} of various types {{of public and private}} pricing on a congested road network, with heterogeneous users, and allowing for elastic demand. The network allows them to model certain features <b>of</b> real-world significance: <b>pricing</b> restrictions on either complementary or substitute links, as well as interactions between different user groups on shared links. They find that revenue-maximising pricing is much less efficient than welfare-maximising pricing, but this difference is mitigated by the product differentiation made possible with heterogeneous users. Ignoring heterogeneity causes the welfare benefits of a policy of current interest, namely second-best <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two parallel links, to be dramatically underestimated. Unlike first-best policies, secondbest policies are in danger of losing much of their potential effectiveness if heterogeneity is ignored when setting toll levels. © The London School of Economics and the University of Bath 2004...|$|R

25|$|Every order theoretic {{definition}} has its dual: it is {{the notion}} one obtains by applying the definition to the inverse order. Since all concepts are symmetric, this operation preserves the theorems of partial orders. For a given mathematical result, one can just invert the order and replace all definitions by their duals and one obtains another valid theorem. This is important and useful, since one obtains two theorems for the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>one.</b> Some more details and examples {{can be found in}} the article on duality in order theory.|$|E

25|$|The Emperor Aurelian {{is said to}} have {{forbidden}} {{his wife}} to buy a mantle of Tyrian purple silk. The Historia Augusta claims that the emperor Elagabalus was the first Roman to wear garments of pure silk (holoserica) as opposed to the usual silk/cotton blends (subserica); this is presented as further evidence of his notorious decadence. Moral dimensions aside, Roman importation and expenditure on silk represented a significant, inflationary drain on Rome's gold and silver coinage, to the benefit of foreign traders and loss to the empire. Diocletian's Edict on Maximum Prices of 301 AD set the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> kilo of raw silk at 4,000 gold coins.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} first-best and second-best {{congestion}} <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> a stylised two-link network with probabilistic route choice of travellers. Travellers may have heterogeneous values of travel times and may {{differ in their}} idiosyncratic route preferences. We derive first-best and second-best tolls taking into account how the overall network demand responds to generalized costs including the tolls that are levied. We show that with homogeneous values of times the welfare losses <b>of</b> second-best <b>pricing,</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> link only, may be smaller if route choice is probabilistic. Furthermore, we show that with heterogeneous values of times, common second-best tolls and group-differentiated tolls can be very close when route choice is governed by random utility maximisation, leading to low welfare losses from the inability to differentiate tolls...|$|R
