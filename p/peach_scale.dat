40|$|White <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozetti) (He- miptera: Diaspididae) is {{a serious}} {{economic}} and quarantine pest of papaya, Carica papaya L. The parasitic wasp Encarsia diaspidicola (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) was brought from Western Samoa into a quarantine containment facility in Hawaii for evaluation and potential release against white <b>peach</b> <b>scale.</b> E. diaspidicola was considered an ideal biological control candidate for release in Hawaii because it is reportedly highly host specific. Host range testing in quarantine with several exotic diaspidids and related taxa, including a native palm scale, indicated that E. dispidicola is unlikely to attack non-target species or cause {{harm to the environment}} if released for control of white <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> in Hawaii. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture and USDA APHIS issued permits for its release. Releases of E. diaspidicola were made beginning in February 2013 in a papaya field in Kapoho on the Big Island. Yellow sticky trap monitoring suggests that the wasp has established in the area of release. Infested papaya logs are being used to spread the wasp to new areas...|$|E
40|$|The distribution, host plants, {{and natural}} {{enemies of the}} white <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozzetti) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), were {{investigated}} in 25 districts of Ankara Province, Turkey, during 2013 - 2015. Thirteen districts were infested with harmful white peach scale; infestation was most common in parks, roadsides, private and institution gardens in centrum and old silkroad parts of Ankara. Twenty-two host plant species were found in these 13 districts, five of which (Aesculus carnea, Hibiscus sp., Paulownia tomentosa, Rhus thyphina and Salix babylonica) had not previously been recorded as host plants in Turkey. Some host plant species, including Catalpa bignonioides, Cornus alba, Fraxinus americana, F. excelsior, Forsythia intermedia, Morus alba, M. nigra and Sophora japonica, {{were found to be}} very highly infested. Five species of predators and three species of parasitoids were associated with white <b>peach</b> <b>scale.</b> Orius minutus L., Chrysoperla pallida (Henry et al.) are new record as predator of P. pentagona in World and Epitetracnemus comis Noyes &Ren Hui are first time record in Turkey...|$|E
40|$|Pediatric audiologists lack evidence-based, age-appropriate outcome {{evaluation}} tools with well-developed normative data {{that could be}} used to evaluate the auditory development and performance of children aged birth to 6 years with permanent childhood hearing impairment. Bagatto and colleagues recommend a battery of outcome tools that may be used with this population. This article provides results of an evaluation of the individual components of the University of Western Ontario Pediatric Audiological Monitoring Protocol (UWO PedAMP) version 1. 0 by the audiologists associated with the Network of Pediatric Audiologists of Canada. It also provides information regarding barriers and facilitators to implementing outcome measures in clinical practice. Results indicate that when compared to the Parents’ Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH) Diary, audiologists found the <b>PEACH</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> to be a more clinically feasible evaluation tool to implement in practice from a time, task, and consistency of use perspective. Results also indicate that the LittlEARS® Auditory Questionnaire could be used to evaluate the auditory development and performance of children aged birth to 6 years with permanent childhood hearing impairment (PCHI). The most cited barrier to implementation is time. The result of this social collaboration was the creation of a knowledge product, the UWO PedAMP v 1. 0, which has the potential to be useful to audiologists and the children and families they serve...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} the current work were to: 1) {{identify}} caregiver report questionnaires for inclusion in an outcome evaluation guideline for infants, toddlers, and preschool children who wear hearing aids and 2) evaluate the chosen tools to determine their usefulness for the population of interest. A critical review of auditory-related subjective outcome evaluation tools for infants, toddlers, and preschool children is presented (Chapter 2). Good psychometric properties and clinical feasibility were considered important elements for the guideline (Andresen, 2000). Existing norms for the chosen questionnaires were validated with normal hearing children from Canadian English-speaking families (Chapters 3 and 5). Finally, The University of Western Ontario Pediatric Audiological Monitoring Protocol (UWO PedAMP), how {{it was used to}} collect clinical data with children who wear hearing aids, and their performance on the questionnaires is provided (Chapter 4). Children with comorbidities and complex factors related to hearing aid use were also investigated. The results of this work revealed two caregiver report questionnaires that were suitable for use within the UWO PedAMP (Chapter 2) : the LittlEARS® Auditory Questionnaire (Tsiakpini, et al., 2004) and the Parents’ Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (<b>PEACH)</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> (Ching 2 ̆ 6 Hill, 2005). Both questionnaires were considered feasible for clinical use (Moodie, et al., 2011) and are supported by good psychometric properties. Norms for the questionnaires were found to be appropriate for use with normal hearing children (Chapters 3 and 5). Outcomes of children with hearing loss who wear hearing aids were investigated using the UWO PedAMP (Chapter 4). Results indicated typically developing children fitted with hearing aids displayed auditory development and performance similar to their normal hearing peers. Children with comorbidities displayed borderline normal auditory development which progressed as they got older. Children with complex factors related to hearing aid use displayed borderline normal development up to 12 months of age where it began to decline. This work also demonstrated that the UWO PedAMP {{can be used in a}} clinical setting to evaluate the outcome of hearing aid fitting to infants, toddlers, and preschool children. This is an important finding since outcome evaluation guidelines for this population are lacking...|$|R
40|$|The parents' {{evaluation}} of aural/oral performance of children (<b>PEACH)</b> <b>scale</b> {{was developed to}} assess the effectiveness of amplification for children, based on a systematic use of parents' observations of children's performance in real-world environments. Objective: The {{purpose of the present}} study was to adapt the <b>PEACH</b> <b>scale</b> into the Malay language, and to collect normative data on a group of children with normal hearing. Study sample: The participants were parents of 74 children aged between 3 months and 13 years of age. Parents were requested to observe their children's auditory/oral behavior in everyday life and to record their observations in the PEACH booklet. Results: High internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 93) and item-total correlation were found (0. 520. 85). Similar to the published norms for English-speaking children, near-perfect scores were achieved by Malaysian children around 40 months of age. Conclusions: The adapted version can be used to evaluate amplification for children in the Malay speaking environment. The normative curve relating age to scores for the Malay PEACH can be used as a reference against whic h functional aural/oral performance of hearing-impaired Malaysian children can be evaluated. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The white <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni Tozzetti) (PP) is {{considered}} a main pest of peach orchards in the East Mediterranean region of Turkey. Peach is grown traditionally in the mountain area, {{but in the last}} two decades the number of peach orchards increased significantly in the coastal plains of the East Mediterranean region. PP is distributed in all peach-growing localities and heavy infestation occurs in orchards of the coastal plain. During this study two parasitoids — Encarsia berlesei (Howard) and Azotus perspeciosus (Girault) — and four predators — Cybocephalus fodori minor (Endrody-Younga), Chilocorus bipustulatus (L.), Rhyzobius lophanthae (Blaisdell) and Pharoscymnus pharoides Marseul — were found. The white <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> occurs in Turkey on 14 host plants including several fruit trees, ornamental plants and some herbaceous plants under the canopy of heavily infested peach trees. Population fluctuations from November 1991 through November 1993 were observed at four locations representing two different ecological conditions. In the mountain area two distinct generations were recorded, the first in June/July and the second in September/October. In the coastal plain three generations were observed, the first in mid-April, the second in June/July and the third in October/November. PP population peaks are not followed by the parasitoid and predator populations, suggesting that the effectiveness of these natural enemies is not sufficient to control the pest...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic stress {{disinfection}} and disinfestation (MSDD) is a postharvest {{treatment that}} combines {{short periods of}} low pressure (vacuum) and elevated CO 2 with ethanol vapor to control pathogens and arthropod pests on commodities. The system was tested against white <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni Tozzetti) (Homoptera: Diaspididae), a serious pest of papaya in Hawaii. Treatment with low pressure (125 mm Hg) and high CO 2 (> 99 %) alone {{had no effect on}} mortality of second stage nymphs, whereas a combination of low pressure, high CO 2 and ethanol vapor (75 mg l- 1) killed 98 % of the individuals tested. This combination treatment has potential to disinfest fresh commodities of surface pests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The white <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> (WPS), Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozzetti) (Homoptera: Diaspididae), is a {{world wide}} {{polyphagous}} scale insect. It is widely distributed in north of Iran, near the Caspian Sea areas, where it is the main pest of mulberry and kiwi trees. The development and fecundity of P. pentagona were examined at different temperatures and on different hosts in the laboratory. The longevity of WPS decreased with a rise in temperature. At 25 °C {{the largest number of}} crawlers (76. 1 crawlers/female) was observed. The development time of WPS was generally longer on kiwi than mulberry or potato; fecundity was higher on potato than on other hosts, potato tubers and kiwi trees...|$|E
40|$|Abundance of White <b>Peach</b> <b>scale</b> (WPS), Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozzetti) and San José scale (SJS), Diaspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) {{adult males}} and their {{attracted}} parasitoids were monitored using pheromone and sticky tape traps in an orchard of Budapest, Hungary, during 2010. In this study, we tried answer {{on the question}} raised whether synthetic commercial pheromones of WSP or SJS could work as a kairomonal stimulant and positively attract higher numbers of the specialized parasitoids. Although pheromone traps attracted {{a wide range of}} parasitoid species, most of them were accidentally. However, the parasitoid Thomsonisca amathus (Walker) (Hymenoptera: E ncyrtidae) and the parasitoid Encarsia perniciosi (Tower) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) significantly respond to the sex pheromones of WPS and SJS, respectively, suggesting that they may {{play an important role in}} host location...|$|E

Summary and conclusions [...] References [...] Appendices. "The National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) and the Desired Sensation Level (DSL) prescriptive procedures are often cited as the most sustainable, validated procedures and the most common methods used for hearing aid fitting in adults and in children. The overall aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the relative performance of the two procedures in children. The study focuses on children because they are most likely to rely on hearing aids fitted with techniques based solely on prescriptive approach. Sixteen Malaysian children with moderately severe to profound hearing loss were involved in the study. The children were fitted with the Phonak Naida V SP hearing aids based on the NAL-NL 1 and DSL v 5 prescriptive procedures. The NAL-NL 1 and DSL v 5 were the latest versions of the respective prescriptive formulae available at the time when this study was carried out. After hearing aid fitting, an extended period of hearing aid trial was given to each child. The relative performance of the two procedures was assessed using speech tests, paired-comparison judgments of speech intelligibility tests and questionnaires completed by the parents, teachers and the children themselves. The questionnaires used in the study were the Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH), the Teachers' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (TEACH) and the Self Evaluation of Listening Function (SELF). The questionnaires were adapted into the Malay language. Each child also completed a short diary for them to compare the performance of the two procedures in different listening environments. The results showed a significant difference of performance between the NAL-NL 1 and DSL v 5 procedures for sentence test in quiet and for the subjective measures using questionnaires completed by the parents, teachers and children. The study concluded that the required hearing aid gain for children with moderately severe to profound hearing loss would seem to approximate the DSL v 5 prescription, at least in quiet listening environments. The findings have important clinical implications for country like Malaysia where many children with severe to profound hearing loss still rely on hearing aids as their primary amplification devices".
