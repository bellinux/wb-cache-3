5000|$|Recent {{findings}} {{with respect to}} epiblasts before and after implantation have produced proposals for classifying pluripotency into two distinct phases: [...] "naive" [...] and [...] "primed". The baseline stem cells commonly used in science that are referred as Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from a pre-implantation epiblast; such epiblast is able to generate the entire fetus, and one epiblast cell is able to contribute to all cell lineages if injected into another blastocyst. On the other hand, several marked differences can be observed between the pre- and <b>post-implantation</b> epiblasts, such as their difference in morphology, in which the epiblast after implantation changes its morphology into a cup-like shape called the [...] "egg cylinder" [...] as well as chromosomal alteration in {{which one of the}} X-chromosomes undergoes random inactivation in the early stage of the egg cylinder, known as X-inactivation. During this development, the egg cylinder epiblast cells are systematically targeted by Fibroblast growth factors, Wnt signaling, and other inductive factors via the surrounding yolk sac and the trophoblast tissue, such that they become instructively specific according to the spatial organization. Another major difference that was observed, with respect to cell potency, is that <b>post-implantation</b> epiblast stem cells are unable to contribute to blastocyst chimeras, which distinguishes them from other known pluripotent stem cells. Cell lines derived from such <b>post-implantation</b> epiblasts are referred to as epiblast-derived stem cells which were first derived in laboratory in 2007; it should be noted, despite their nomenclature, that both ESCs and EpiSCs are derived from epiblasts, just at difference phases of development, and that pluripotency is still intact in the <b>post-implantation</b> epiblast, as demonstrated by the conserved expression of Nanog, Fut4, and Oct-4 in EpiSCs, until somitogenesis and can be reversed midway through induced expression of Oct-4.|$|E

50|$|MLL1 {{has been}} found to be an {{important}} regulator of epiblast-derived stem cells, <b>post-implantation</b> epiblast derived stem cells which display pluripotency yet many recognizable differences from the traditional embryonic stem cells derived from inner cell mass prior to implantation. Suppression of MLL1 expression was shown to be adequate for inducing ESC-like morphology and behavior within 72 hours of treatment. It has been proposed that that the small molecule inhibitor MM-401, which was used to inhibit MLL1, changes the distribution of H3K4me1, the single methylation of the histone H3 lysine 4, to be significantly downregulated at MLL1 targets thus leading to decreased expression of MLL1 targets, rather than a direct regulation of pluripotency core markers.|$|E
50|$|Mammalian PGCs are {{specified}} by signalling between cells (induction), {{rather than by}} the segregation of germ plasm as the embryo divides. In mice, PGCs originate from the proximal epiblast, close to the extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE), of the <b>post-implantation</b> embryo as early as embryonic day 6.5. By E7.5 a founding population of approximately 40 PGCs are generated in this region of the epiblast in the developing mouse embryo. The epiblast, however, also give rise to somatic cell lineages that make up the embryo proper; including the endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm. The specification of primordial germ cells in mammals is mainly attributed to the downstream functions of two signaling pathways; the BMP signaling pathway and the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway.|$|E
50|$|DNA Methylation {{patterns}} are largely erased and then re-established between generations in mammals. Almost {{all of the}} methylations from the parents are erased, first during gametogenesis, and again in early embryogenesis, with demethylation and remethylation occurring each time.

5000|$|The {{reversion}} {{back to the}} naive-state {{has also}} been achieved by suppressing {{the activity of the}} histone methyltransferase MLL1, also known as KMT2A. The inhibition of MLL1 via the small-molecule inhibitor MM-401 in EpiSC showed marked increase in alkaline phosphatase staining as well as upregulation of [...] "naive" [...] markers such as Rex1 and downregulation of [...] "primed" [...] markers such as FGF5. Moreover, beyond the potency-state comparison, MLL1 inhibition was also shown to reactivate the silenced X-chromosome which is typically deactivated in <b>post-implantation</b> epiblast stem cells, suggesting a epigenetic reversion back to a more ground-level, naive state. What's more, some EpiSCs affected by the MLL1 inhibition-induced reversion were able to contribute to germline-competent chimeras, which had been considered {{as one of the most}} major differences between ESCs and EpiSCs.|$|E
5000|$|Scientists {{have been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the induction of EpiSC-like cells in vitro from mouse ESCs, which are referred to as Epiblast-like cells (EpiLC). Many studies have used EpiLC as suitable analogues for actual <b>post-implantation</b> derived epiblast stem cells, especially in attempts at reversion back to the [...] "naive" [...] state. Recently, overexpression of PR-domain Zinc Finger Protein 14 (PRDM14) in EpiLC was shown to cause a reversion back to a ESC-like state (with levels of Alkaline Phosphatase staining recovered to that observed in ESCs as well as more ESC-like cell morphology), with Klf2 being required for the mechanism to occur. It has been proposed that PRDM14 induces this state by activating Klf2 via active demethylation recruitment of Oct-4; such technique has yet to be demonstrated in actual epiblast-derived EpiSCs.|$|E
50|$|With {{the vast}} {{knowledge}} about in-vivo PGC specification collected {{over the last}} few decades, several attempts to generate in-vitro PGCs from <b>post-implantation</b> epiblast were made. Various groups were able to successfully generate PGCs, cultured in the presences of BMP4 and various cytokines. The efficiency of this process was later enhanced by the addition of stem cell factor (SCF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and BMP8B. PGCs generated using this method can be transplanted to give viable gametes and offspring in vivo. PGCs can also be generated from naïve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that are cultured for two days in the presence of FGF and Activin-A to adopt an epiblast-like state. These cells are then cultured with BMP4, BMP8B, EGF, LIF and SCF and various cytokines for four more days. These in-vitro generated PGCs can also develop into viable gametes and offspring.|$|E
5000|$|Sex selection, which after {{preimplantation}} {{genetic diagnosis}} may be performed by selecting only embryos of the preferred sex, or, after <b>post-implantation</b> methods by performing sex-selective abortion depending on the test result and personal preference.

50|$|In his {{continuous}} {{search for}} the 'Holy Grail', Ionescu experimented with valves made from bovine pericardium (the membrane which surrounds the heart) treated with glutaraldehyde and mounted on a Dacron covered titanium frame. This original valve, designed and created by Ionescu, demonstrated excellent hydrodynamic performance with good durability during in-vitro fatigue testing. In March 1971 Ionescu began the clinical implantation, for the first time, of this original device. The results were very encouraging. In 1976 Shiley Laboratory in California began to manufacture and to distribute worldwide this valve {{under the name of}} 'Ionescu-Shiley Pericardial Xenograft'. Its use by Ionescu and many other surgeons demonstrated very good performance in all aspects until 6 to 10 years post-operatively when signs of malfunction appeared progressively in younger patients and some of the valves had to be removed and replaced. Although {{a small percentage of the}} pericardial valves continued to function normally for up to 26 years <b>post-implantation,</b> the majority of them had to be replaced between 6 and 14 years, and a few some time later.|$|E
50|$|When silicon {{is grown}} by the Czochralski method, the melt is {{contained}} in a silica (quartz) crucible. During growth, {{the walls of the}} crucible dissolve into the melt and Czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 cm. Oxygen impurities can have beneficial or detrimental effects. Carefully chosen annealing conditions can give rise to the formation of oxygen precipitates. These have the effect of trapping unwanted transition metal impurities in a process known as gettering, improving the purity of surrounding silicon. However, formation of oxygen precipitates at unintended locations can also destroy electrical structures. Additionally, oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing. It was experimentally shown in the 1990s that the high oxygen concentration is also beneficial for the radiation hardness of silicon particle detectors used in harsh radiation environment (such as CERN's LHC/HL-LHC projects). Therefore, radiation detectors made of Czochralski- and Magnetic Czochralski-silicon are considered to be promising candidates for many future high-energy physics experiments. It has also been shown that the presence of oxygen in silicon increases impurity trapping during <b>post-implantation</b> annealing processes.|$|E
5000|$|Her recent {{development}} of systems permitting {{for the first}} time both mouse and human embryogenesis during implantation and early <b>post-implantation</b> stages in vitro allowed her to reveal that mouse and human embryo remodelling at implantation is entirely embryo autonomous. She uncovered the mechanism underlying embryo remodelling between the blastocyst and gastrula stages that has led to a change in the text-book model. Her demonstration of the self-organisation of human embryos developing in vitro until day 13/14, gastrulation, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to study our own development at previously inaccessible and critical stages. [...] This discovery was hailed as the people’s choice for the scientific breakthrough of 2016 by Science magazine. [...] The knowledge she gained through her work on how the embryo develops during the blastocyst to gastrula transition, allowed her to mimic these developmental processes with different types of stem cells in vitro. This led her to the pioneering success of constructing embryo-like structures from pluripotent embryonic and multipotent extra-embryonic (trophoblast) stem cells in a 3D scaffold of extra-cellular matrix proteins in vitro. These [...] "synthetic embryos" [...] recapitulate the natural architecture of the embryo and their patterns of gene expression leading to the specification of the germ layers and germ cells. This system allowed her to identify signalling pathways responsible for morphogenesis of stem cells into embryos. Together these models bring outstanding potential for understanding development and for regenerative medicine.|$|E
