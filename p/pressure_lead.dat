Intraocular pressure laws follow fundamentally from physics. Any kinds of intraocular surgery should be done by considering the intraocular pressure fluctuation.

The original AWS controller and latching control are used as a term of comparison. Simulation results show that, as a rule, low tides and lower atmospheric <b>pressures</b> <b>lead</b> to higher power productions, while high tides and higher atmospheric <b>pressures</b> <b>lead</b> to lower power productions; but, in spite of model maladjustments, model-based control strategies are not at disadvantage when compared with latching control.

5000|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{distribution of}} petroleum hydrocarbons {{in the environment}} is the consequence of diagenetic processes that occur in sedimentary rock formations containing large amounts of organic matter. Heat and <b>pressure</b> <b>lead</b> {{to the formation of}} a wide variety of hydrocarbons, including alkanes, alkenes, and cyclic/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which can seep into aquatic environments. The environmental recalcitrance of many of these compounds is governed by their high bond dissociation energies [...] Alkanes are the least reactive class of hydrocarbons due to their apolar sigma bonds. In the absence of high temperatures, high pressures, metal catalysts or UV light, biotransformation plays the dominant role in environmental alkane degradation.|$|E

5000|$|Passage of the Wild Horse Annie Act did not {{alleviate}} {{the concerns of}} advocates for free-roaming horses, who continued to lobby for federal rather than state control over these horses. [...] At the same time, ownership of the free-roaming herds was contentious, and ranchers continued to use airplanes to gather them. Federal agencies also continued to try to eliminate horses from areas where they were perceived to be causing resource damage. In 1962, public <b>pressure</b> <b>lead</b> {{to the establishment of}} the Nevada Wild Horse Range, and in 1968, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range was established.

However, since the bill also called for the removal from public lands of all non-Spanish horses, it came under heavy opposition. Federal protection for all free-roaming horses was ultimately accomplished by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971(WFRHBA). The bill specifically stated: [...] "A person claiming ownership of a horse or burro on the public lands shall be entitled to recover it only if recovery is permissible under the branding and estray laws of the State in which the animal is found." [...] This eventually alleviated the problem of horses being rounded up under the auspices of belonging to local ranchers, but right after the law passed, many ranchers claimed all the horses on their allotments, and set about rounding them up.|$|E

Typical pressures range from one to several tens of atmospheres.

Furthermore, payoffs frequently depend on the speed of decision-making, as, for instance, when buying and selling stocks. In this paper, we examine the influence of time pressure and time-dependent incentive schemes on the quality of decision-making in an experimental beauty-contest game. We find that convergence to equilibrium is faster and payoffs are higher under low time pressure than under high time pressure. Interestingly, time-dependent payoffs under high time <b>pressure</b> <b>lead</b> to significantly quicker decision-making without reducing the quality of decisions. ...|$|E
