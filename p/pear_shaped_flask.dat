30|$|Silica (1000  mg/ 6  ml) {{cartridges}} {{which have}} 1  g layer of anhydrous magnesium sulphate weighed on top was conditioned using 6  ml acetonitrile. A 50  ml <b>pear</b> <b>shape</b> <b>flasks</b> were {{placed under the}} columns in a vacuum manifold, and the concentrated extracts loaded onto the cartridges. The extracts were allowed to filter and the cartridges eluted with 10  ml of acetonitrile with slight intermittent vacuum use. The eluents collected were then concentrated to dryness using the rotary film evaporator (Buchi Ratovapor R- 210) set at 40  °C. The extracts were re-dissolved in 1  ml ethyl acetate by pipetting and the dissolved extracts carefully transferred into labelled 2  ml chromatography (GC) standard opening vials prior to quantitation by gas chromatography (GC) (Varian Association Inc. USA) equipped with Electron Capture Detector (ECD). All extracts were kept frozen until quantification was achieved.|$|R
30|$|The {{silica gel}} {{clean-up}} {{process for the}} soil extracts were {{carried out by the}} methods described by Frimpong et al. (2013), with slight modifications from the Ghana Standard Authority (GSA) Pesticides Residue Laboratory protocols. Extracts clean up were done, using polypropylene cartridge columns, packed with one-gram silica gel previously activated for 10  h in an oven at 130  °C, which have 1  cm thickness layer of anhydrous magnesium sulphate on top and conditioned with 6  mL acetonitrile. The concentrated extracts were then loaded onto the columns/cartridges, and 50  mL <b>pear</b> <b>shape</b> <b>flasks</b> placed under the columns to collect the eluates. A 10  mL acetonitrile was used to elute the columns/cartridges afterwards. The total filtrates (eluents) collected were concentrated to dryness using the rotary evaporator (Buchi Ratovapor R- 210) set at 40  °C. The residues were re-dissolved in 1  mL ethyl acetate by pipetting and transferred into 2  mL standard opening vials prior to quantitation by gas chromatography (GC) (Varian Association Inc. USA) equipped with pulse flame photometric detector (PFPD). All extracts were kept frozen until quantification was achieved.|$|R

50|$|The Moon of Baroda weighed 25.95 carat g at {{the time}} it was found. It was later cut into a <b>pear</b> <b>shaped</b> diamond, {{weighing}} 24.04 carat g.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to changes}} in market {{desirability}} and popularity, the value of different styles of diamond fluctuate. All diamonds can be recut into new shapes that will increase value {{at that time in}} the market and desirability. An example of this is the marquise cut diamond which was popular in the 1970s to 1980s. In later decades, jewelers had little success in selling this shape in comparison to other shapes like the oval or <b>pear</b> <b>shape.</b> The marquise can be cut into an oval diamond by any diamond cutter with a loss of 5-10% in total weight. For example a 1.10 carat marquise shape would be a 1.00 oval cut diamond by rounding the sharp points and creating an oval which currently in the market has a much greater desirability and resale value. The same marquise shape also could become a <b>pear</b> <b>shape</b> instead by only trimming and rounding the side which will be turned into the base of the <b>pear</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|R
