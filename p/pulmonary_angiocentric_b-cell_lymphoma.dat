In this study, we assessed rearrangements and expression of MYC, BCL 2 and BCL 6 in 898 patients with de novo diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> treated with standard chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab).

Targeting mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) {{offers a new}} approach to improve the treatment. mTOR inhibitors are being developed and are in clinical use in mantle cell lymphoma therapy and clinical trials are ongoing in other high-grade lymphomas as well. However, there is limited data about mTOR activity and the expression of its different complexes in diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> Tissue microarray blocks were constructed from paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens. More than 700 immunohistochemical stainings (mTOR signaling-related proteins and phosphoproteins, markers for lymphoma classification) were evaluated from 68 diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> biopsies from conventionally treated and followed patients. Approximately 30 % of cases were characterized as germinal center-derived diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> which showed virtually no mTOR activity, as determined by phospho-ribosomal S 6 expression, the most sensitive marker of mTOR activity. In about 80 % of non-germinal center-derived diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cases, positivity of mTOR-related phosphoproteins was observed, denoting mTOR activity. Moreover, Rictor (a characteristic protein of the mTOR complex 2) was overexpressed in 43 % of all diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and in 63 % of mTOR-active non-germinal center diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> samples. Rictor overexpression with mTOR activity indicated significantly worse survival for patients than mTOR inactivity or mTOR activity with low Rictor expression.

In recent years, there has been considerable debate regarding the classification and terminology of the group of primary cutaneous <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and different classification schemes were used. In the new WHO-EORTC consensus classification for cutaneous lymphomas published in 2005, three major groups of primary cutaneous <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> are distinguished: primary cutaneous marginal zone <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma with a good prognosis, and primary cutaneous diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> leg type with an intermediate prognosis. Studies presented in this thesis focus on three aspects of these primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: (1) the clinical usefulness of the WHO-EORTC classification in daily practice, (2) the validity of prognostic parameters reported in previous studies and identified in patient groups classified according to previously used classification schemes and (3) optimal management for the different types of primary cutaneous <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> as defined in the WHO-EORTC classification.

We, therefore, investigated the role of FoxM 1 expression in a large cohort of diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> samples and panel of cell lines. Design and Methods: FoxM 1 expression was investigated in a large series of diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> tissues in a tissue microarray format by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and protein expression was detected by immunoblotting using diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cell lines following treatment with either pharmacological inhibitor of FoxM 1 or small interference RNA knockdown strategy.

Using a tissue microarray approach, we identified 8 out of 258 diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cases fulfilling the World Health Organization criteria of an Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> of the elderly, suggesting an incidence of 3. 1 % in a European population. The median patient age was 65 years. The highest diagnostic sensitivity was only achieved by EBER in situ hybridization. No correlation between Epstein-Barr virus status and outcome was noted except in latency type 3 lymphomas, which had a very poor survival. Sixty-seven percent of Epstein-Barr virus-positive cases showed the presence of necrosis and 50 % expressed the activation marker CD 30. However, no morphological or immunohistochemical features reliably distinguished all Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cases. Thus, to identify these Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in the elderly, EBER in situ hybridization of all de novo diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cases of patients older than 50 years should be considered.

The aim of our study is to validate the differential expression in germinal center and non-germinal center diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma,s</b> and to study to the extent to which the primary site of differentiation is associated with the miRNA expression profile. We studied 50 cases of de novo diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> for the expression of 15 miRNAs (miR- 15 a, miR- 15 b, miR- 16, miR- 17 - 3 p, miR- 17 - 5 p, miR- 18 a, miR- 19 a, miR- 19 b, miR- 20 a, miR- 21, miR- 92, miR- 127, miR- 155, miR- 181 a and miR- 221). Apart from 19 nodal cases without extranodal dissemination (stages I and II), we selected two groups with unambiguous stages I and II extranodal presentation; 9 cases of primary central nervous system, II cases of primary testicular and II cases of other primary extranodal diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> All cases were analyzed with qRT-PCR. In situ hybridization for the most differentially expressed miRNAs was performed to show miRNA expression in tumor cells, but not in background cells.

No significant differences were seen between germinal center and non- germinal center diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> in either the total or the nodal group for any of the 15 miRNAs. Two miRNAs showed significant differences in expression levels for diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> subgroups according to the site of presentation. MiR- 17 - 5 p showed a significant higher expression level in the central nervous system compared with testicular and nodal diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (P < 0. 05). MiR- 127 levels were significantly higher in testicular than in central nervous system and in nodal diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (P < 0. 05). We conclude that the location of diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> is an important factor in determining the differential expression of miRNAs...|$|R
40|$|Gene-expression {{profiling}} in <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> {{has provided}} crucial data on specific lymphoma types, which {{can contribute to}} the identification of essential lymphoma survival genes and pathways. In this study, the gene-expression profiling data of all major <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> types were analyzed by unsupervised clustering. The transcriptome classification so obtained, was explored using gene set enrichment analysis generating a heatmap for <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> that identifies common lymphoma survival mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, recognizing sets of coregulated genes and functional pathways expressed in different lymphoma types. Some of the most relevant signatures (stroma, cell cycle, B-cell receptor (BCR)) are shared by multiple lymphoma types or subclasses. A specific attention was paid to the analysis of BCR and coregulated pathways, defining molecular heterogeneity within multiple <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> types...|$|R
40|$|The current {{classification}} of lymphoid neoplasms {{is based on}} clinical information, morphology, immunophenotype, and molecular genetic characteristics. Despite technical and scientific progress, some aggressive <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas</b> with features overlapping between {{two different types of}} lymphomas remain difficult to classify. The updated 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) {{classification of}} Tumours of the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues has addressed this problem by creation of two new provisional categories of <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> unclassifiable; one with features intermediate between diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and classical Hodgkin lymphoma and the second with features intermediate between diffuse large <b>B-cell</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and Burkitt lymphoma. We review here the diagnostic criteria of these two provisional entities and discuss new scientific findings in light of the 2008 WHO classification...|$|R
