5|$|Of the {{original}} British flame fougasse designs, {{there were three}} main variants: the safety fougasse, the demigasse and the hedge hopper. They all used metal barrels and similar pre-prepared explosive charges, although they varied {{in the details of}} construction and the amount of ammonal used for the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E
5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several {{variants}} of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient {{to the present}} day. Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord. In some designs, detonating cord is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge.</b> In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw {{and the other to}} ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.|$|E
50|$|The {{howitzer}} fired separate loading, bagged charge ammunition, {{with seven}} different <b>propelling</b> <b>charges,</b> from 1 (the smallest) to 7 (the largest). The M454 Nuclear shell {{had its own}} M80 cartridge with three <b>propelling</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{particle}} accelerator is {{a machine that}} uses electromagnetic fields to <b>propel</b> <b>charged</b> particles to nearly light speed and to contain them in well-defined beams.|$|R
50|$|In 1963 certain NATO nations, {{including}} the UK, agreed a Ballistics Memorandum of Understanding for a 155 mm 39 calibre ordnance and a baseline projectile with the shape {{used for the}} US M549 rocket-assisted shell. The AS-90 uses a conforming 39 calibre barrel which fires the L15 unassisted projectile out {{to a range of}} 24.7 km. However, this was a new design of ordnance using a split sliding block breech with Crossley obturation, instead of the more usual screw breech, to permit bagged charges (no metal cartridge cases). The breech mechanism has a primer magazine holding 18 primers. The standard ammunition is that designed for FH-70 (L15 HE and associated <b>propelling</b> <b>charges)</b> although in training the less effective but cheaper M107 with Green and White <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> is used.|$|R
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
25|$|The {{projectile}} {{could be}} fired with <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> M7 (normal) at reduced velocity or with <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> M8 (super) to achieve full velocity. The dummy <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> M6 simulated the M8 charge. The velocity and range {{data in the}} table below is for the M8 charge.|$|E
25|$|HEAT M67 Shell had {{non-adjustable}} <b>propelling</b> <b>charge.</b> For blank ammunition, {{a shorter}} Cartridge Case M15 with black powder charge was used.|$|E
50|$|An {{ammunition}} manipulator {{system is}} available to transport projectiles and <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> from the main ammunition store to the feeding magazines, which are automatically reloaded. Ammunition flow is reversible. Rounds can be automatically unloaded from the gun. Digital and analog interfaces are available for any Combat Management System, also according to COBRA protocol.|$|R
50|$|C: Propellant {{explosive}} substance or other deflagrating {{explosive substance}} or article containing such explosive substance (1.1C, 1.2C, 1.3C, 1.4C). These are bulk propellants, <b>propelling</b> <b>charges,</b> and devices containing propellants {{with or without}} means of ignition. Examples include single-based propellant, double-based propellant, triple-based propellant, and composite propellants, solid propellant rocket motors and ammunition with inert projectiles.|$|R
50|$|The M795 is {{designed}} to be a more lethal, longer range version of the M107. A welded band replaced the swaged rotating band of the M107 allowing the M795 to be fired with M119, or M203 <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> generating 6,000 meters more range. The explosive payload was also improved as was the fragmentation pattern, giving 30% higher lethality.|$|R
25|$|The gun {{utilized}} separate loading, bagged charge ammunition. The <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> {{consisted of}} base (9.23kg) and increment (4.69kg). The {{data in the}} table below is for supercharge (base and increment).|$|E
25|$|The {{howitzer}} {{was designed}} to fire the same ammunition as the longer M2. However, {{it turned out that}} shorter barrel resulted in incomplete burning of the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge.</b> The problem could be solved by use of faster burning powder. Otherwise the design was considered acceptable and was standardized as 105mm Howitzer M3 on Carriage M3. The carriage was soon succeeded by the M3A1, which had trails made from thicker plate. Even stronger tubular trails were designed, but never reached production.|$|E
25|$|The gun fired semi-fixed {{ammunition}}, {{similar to}} the ammunition of the M2; it used the same projectiles and the same 105mm Cartridge Case M14, but with different <b>propelling</b> <b>charge.</b> The latter used faster burning powder to avoid incomplete burning; it consisted of a base charge and four increments, forming five charges from 1 (the smallest) to 5 (the largest). In an emergency, gunners were authorized to fire M1 HE rounds prepared for the Howitzer M2, but only with charges from 1 to 3. M1 HE rounds for the M3 could be fired from an M2 with any charge.|$|E
50|$|The {{tail unit}} is loaded {{first with the}} {{necessary}} <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> (up to eight increments), then the sustainer motor (if required) and finally, the programmed projectile. A hand-held programming unit {{is connected to the}} projectile by cable prior to loading to feed in flight time before seeker activation, and with allowances for terminal phase ballistic conditions.|$|R
50|$|Soviet 122 mm howitzers used {{different}} {{ammunition to}} 122 mm guns, {{although there was}} some compatibility. In the case of ammunition for the D-30, the standard 122 mm howitzer shell weight of 21.8 kg was retained, with a metal cartridge case holding variable <b>propelling</b> <b>charges.</b> Cartridge and shell are loaded separately; {{this means that the}} shells have to be hand-rammed by a man {{to the right of the}} breech with a ramming rod. The D-30 could fire the older M-30 ammunition; however, new shells were also introduced, eventually including a rocket assisted projectile with a range of 21.9 km. The M-30’s range of <b>propelling</b> <b>charges,</b> comprising base and eight increments, was replaced by a new set comprising base and four increments; single base propellant was retained. A more effective High Explosive (HE) shell was developed, as well as smoke, illumination and chemical filled projectiles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Propelling</b> <b>charges</b> are {{in metal}} {{cartridge}} cases and loaded {{separately from the}} projectile. Projectiles originally included HE fragmentation, Armour Piercing solid shot, smoke, illuminating and chemical. HE shells weigh some 33 kg. Illuminating shells have a substantially lower muzzle velocity. APHE and extended range shells were introduced later. Maximum rate of fire is probably 6-7 rounds/minute, and about 70 rounds/hour. The standard Soviet unit of fire was 80 rounds.|$|R
25|$|It {{fired the}} same {{projectiles}} as other 75mm pieces {{and had a}} cartridge case identical in length with that used in the Model 38. This case was longer than that used in the Model 41 mountain gun. This was necessary because the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> used in Model 94 ammunition was less than that used in the ammunition for Model 38, and firing the latter ammunition from Model 94 would damage the gun. Lack of a howitzer trajectory and of varying charges increased the dead space for the Model 94 when it fired in mountainous terrain, and the counterrecoil {{was said to be}} so slow when the piece was fired at elevations above 30° that, rather than fire above that elevation, the battery displaced forward.|$|E
500|$|The <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> was {{prepared}} with an electrically triggered detonator in a primer bound with insulating tape {{to three or}} four cartridges of ammonal explosive. This assembly was placed in a small, waterproof rubber bag that was, in turn, placed inside a used cocoa tin. [...] of magnesium alloy turnings were added to ensure ignition of the fuel. The electrical wires were passed through a small hole in the lid of the tin which was then tightly fitted. The propelling charges were kept in storage, only to be deployed when enemy action was imminent. To activate the device, the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> was lowered down the pipe and tamped down with dry soil before being connected to a firing point about [...] away. Firing required the current delivered by a 120 V battery.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} form of the flame fougasse was the safety fougasse. This design allowed the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> to be stored {{separately}} until needed. The safety fougasse was constructed as follows: a small section was excavated from the side of a slope, leaving a shallow platform of earth, and a barrel of incendiary mixture was placed horizontally in a low position with one round face pointing towards the target. At the back, a section of stove or drain pipe was placed vertically against the rear face of the barrel. The lower end of the pipe was blocked off with a thin cover and positioned a few inches above the bottom of the barrel. The top of the pipe was fitted with a loose cap to keep water out. This pipe is what makes it a [...] "safety" [...] fougasse because it allows later installation of the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge.</b> Soil was then built up over the weapon until all that could be seen were the front disk of the barrel and top of the pipe.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{taxonomies}} {{of artillery}} pieces used by European (and European-style) armies in the 17th to 20th centuries, the howitzer stood between the [...] "gun" [...] (characterized by a longer barrel, larger <b>propelling</b> <b>charges,</b> smaller shells, higher velocities, and flatter trajectories) and the [...] "mortar" [...] (which {{was meant to}} fire at even higher angles of ascent and descent). Howitzers, like other artillery equipment, are usually organized in groups called batteries.|$|R
50|$|Each gun {{mounting}} {{was installed}} on a central cast-steel pedestal {{in an open}} concrete gunpit 35 feet in diameter and 11 feet deep. The gun and mounting weighed 125 tons. A very narrow gauge rail track was embedded around the gunpit floor. A trolley was manhandled around the track between the two ammunition lifts (one for projectiles, one for <b>propelling</b> <b>charges)</b> and {{the rear of the}} gun (this position varied depending on where the gun was pointed).|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} the result of {{extended}} studies looking to replace the 18-pounder (3.3 in bore) field gun and the 4.5-inch howitzer (114.3 mm bore), which had been the main field artillery equipments during the First World War. The basic idea was to build one weapon with the high velocity of the 18-pounder and the variable <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> of the howitzer, firing a shell about halfway between the two in size, around 3.5 - 4.0 in of about 30 lb.|$|R
500|$|Another {{variant of}} the flame fougasse was the [...] "hedge hopper". This was a barrel of {{petroleum}} mixture placed upright with a cocoa tin charge containing two primers and just one ammonal cartridge buried in an [...] deep pit placed underneath and slightly off centre, but carefully aligned with the seam of the barrel. On firing, the barrel would be projected [...] {{into the air and}} [...] forwards, bounding over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden. It was difficult to get the hedge hopper's <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> right, but it had the great advantage of being quick to install and easy to conceal.|$|E
500|$|Innovations continued, {{notably the}} German {{invention}} of the mortar, a thick-walled, short-barreled gun that blasted shot upward at a steep angle. Mortars were useful for sieges, as they could fire over walls and other defenses. This cannon found more use with the Dutch, who learned to shoot bombs filled with powder from them. However, setting the bomb fuse in the mortar was a problem. [...] "Single firing" [...] was the first technique used to set the fuse, where the bomb was placed with the fuse down against the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge.</b> This practice often resulted in the fuse being blown into the bomb, causing it to blow {{up in front of}} the mortar. Because of this danger, [...] "double firing" [...] was developed, where the fuse was turned up and the gunner lighted the fuse and the touch hole simultaneously. This, however, required much skill and timing, and was especially dangerous when the gun failed to fire, leaving a lighted bomb in the barrel. Not until 1650 was it accidentally discovered that double-lighting was a superfluous process: the heat of firing was enough to light the fuse.|$|E
2500|$|Ramming {{the shell}} home is {{followed}} by loading a number of powder bags, as required for the desired range. [...] The powder charge could be loaded in up to seven charge settings. [...] Once the powder is loaded, the breech plug is closed and locked, and a primer {{is placed in the}} breech plug's firing mechanism. After setting the elevation and azimuth, the gun is ready to fire. The firing mechanism is a device for initiating the ammunition primer. The primer then sets off the igniter which ignites the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> of the ammunition. A continuous-pull lanyard first cocks the firing pin, then fires the primer when pulled.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of iontophoresis involves applying an electrical current to an ionisable substance {{to increase its}} mobility across a surface. The EyeGate II Delivery System (EGDS; EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), a novel iontophoretic system, {{has been designed to}} achieve optimal therapeutic levels of drug in the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, while simultaneously minimizing systemic distribution [70]. The system consists of an inert electrode which electrolyzes water to produce hydronium ions. These hydronium ions <b>propel</b> <b>charged</b> drug molecules. Studies demonstrating safety and efficacy profile show promise for the future [71].|$|R
50|$|Below the gunhouse {{there may}} be a working chamber, where {{ammunition}} is handled, and the main trunk, which accommodates the shell and propellant hoists that bring ammunition up from the magazines below. There may be a combined hoist (cf the animated British turret) or separate hoists (cf the US turret cutaway). The working chamber and trunk rotate with the gunhouse, and sit inside a protective armoured barbette. The barbette extends down to the main armoured deck (red in the animation). At the base of the turret sit handing rooms, where shell and <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> are passed from the shell room and magazine to the hoists.|$|R
50|$|The 220 mm howitzers were a {{compromise}} designs for their time, with decent capability to destroy fortifications and yet mobile enough. Constructively, design has shared many features with the 149 mm Skoda Model 1928 Gun. The howitzer used only immobile, fully traversable siege mount {{which must be}} offloaded from the transport platform into shallow (0.5m deep) pit before firing. Typical preparation time was 3 hours. The Skoda 220 mm howitzer utilized a hydro-pneumatic recoil system. Loading was manual, with separate shell and the bags of the propellant allowing 9 different <b>propelling</b> <b>charges.</b> For transport, howitzer was disassembled into three loads and each was towed by a separate 8-ton tractor. The maximal towing speed was 30 km/h.|$|R
2500|$|To {{the modern}} eye, the tank is hardly {{recognizable}} as such and appears as an armoured steel box resting {{on top of}} a caterpillar tractor. [...] It has no turret, and its inconspicuous main armament is a fortification 75mm Blockhaus Schneider, placed in a barbette in the right front corner of the tank. [...] The right side had been chosen because the gunner had to stand {{to the left of the}} barrel to operate the gun. [...] The cannon type was developed from a 75mm trench mortar that had been adapted to fire from a fixed fortification position by adding a recoil compensator and a gun shield; in this configuration it weighed 210 kilogrammes. [...] This short-barrelled cannon had a length of just 9.5 calibres. It fired the standard French HE Model 1915 75mm shell but with a reduced <b>propelling</b> <b>charge,</b> shortening the length of the round from 350 to 241 millimetres, allowing for a muzzle velocity of only two hundred metres per second. This limited the maximum range to 2200 metres, the practical range was six hundred metres and the tank needed to close within two hundred metres of a point target to allow for precision shooting. [...] The gun has a traverse of 60°, a depression of -10° and an elevation of 30°. [...] The ammunition stock is ninety vertically stowed rounds. [...] Two 8mm Hotchkiss Model 1914 machine guns, projecting from the flanks in large hemispherical ballmounts, and resting on pintles, complement the short 75mm gun. The right machine gun is, because of the room needed for the main gun, positioned more to the rear than the left one. [...] The machine guns have a traverse of 106°, a depression of -45° and an elevation of 20°. [...] To the right of the cannon there is a bin for twenty readily accessible 75mm rounds. [...] Three other bins are positioned respectively at the extreme right rear corner (fourteen rounds), to the left of the engine (thirty-two) and at the left rear corner (twenty-four). The latter is situated to the right of a bin, at the extreme left corner, for the stock of four thousand rounds of 8mm ammunition. In 1918, in practice fifty belts with ninety-six rounds were carried, for a total of 4800 rounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{projectile}} {{could be}} fired with <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> M7 (normal) at reduced velocity or with <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> M8 (super) to achieve full velocity. The dummy <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> M6 simulated the M8 charge. The velocity and range {{data in the}} table below is for the M8 charge.|$|E
50|$|F {{containing}} a secondary detonating explosive substance with its means of initiation, with a <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> (other than one containing flammable liquid, gel or hypergolic liquid) {{or without a}} <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> (1.1F, 1.2F, 1.3F, 1.4F).|$|E
50|$|The M795 is a 155mm high {{fragmentation}} steel (HF1) body projectile {{filled with}} 23.8 lb of TNT and weighing approximately 103 lb. The high fragmentation steel body is encircled by a gilding metal rotating band making it compatible with 3W through 8S (M3A1 through M203A1) zone <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> across all current 155mm howitzers. The projectile is packaged {{on a metal}} pallet with a shock attenuating lifting plug and flexible rotating band cover. The M795 projectile is ballistically similar to the M483A1 family of cargo projectiles and {{may be used as}} a registration round for the M483A1 family. The M795 projectile provides an increased effectiveness against major ground force threats at greater ranges for anti-personnel and anti-materiel targets when compared to the current M107 projectile.|$|R
2500|$|Apart from {{extensive}} {{experimentation with}} shell and rifling designs, two problems slowed development; both were howitzer-specific issues. [...] The {{first was the}} need for an adjustable quick firing recoil system to prevent the breech striking the ground when fired at high elevation angles. [...] The second was the suitable design for a range scale in yards able to accommodate a choice of <b>propelling</b> <b>charges.</b> [...] The first was solved by use of a “cut-off gear” that allowed 40 inches of recoil when the barrel was horizontal but only 20 inches when it was at 45 degrees. [...] The second led to the range scale being designed for charge four and a “range rule” provided to convert the actual range for other charges to a false range set on the charge four scale.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{modelling}} of gun interior ballistic processes aids in {{the design}} and analysis of guns and their <b>propelling</b> <b>charges.</b> Presently, the most accurate modelling of the interior ballistics problem is provided by two-phase, multidimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. We present our development of a CFD code, Casbar, which solves a two-phase (gas/particulate) flow problem in axisymmetric geometries. Our model is based on the governing equations for two-phase flow derived from separated flow theory. A finite-volume discretisation of the governing equations is used. The resulting set of equations is solved with a timestep-splitting approach based on the separation of various physical processes. We also present the modelling for the component physics such as propellant combustion and interphase drag. In addition, the solver includes the motion of the projectile and its influence on the flow dynamics. The capabilities of the code are demonstrated with some verification exercises...|$|R
