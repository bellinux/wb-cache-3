The United States established the Sinai Field Mission to monitor access to the passes utilizing seismic, aural and infra-red sensors monitored from three watch stations. The U.S. military also performed reconnaissance flights. U.S. monitoring was coordinated with the activities of UN peacekeepers. After an initial <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>suspicion,</b> the parties came to accept monitoring as routine. The system successfully distinguished between significant and inconsequential sensor activations. All violations were relatively minor and resolved by a Joint Commission. Political leaders in both countries eventually praised the system.|$|E
40|$|In January 2002, Singapore {{was confronted}} with the {{knowledge}} of a Jemaah Islamiah (JI) terrorist cell operating within its borders. The arrests had placed the local Malay/Muslim community in the spotlight and created unease among the non-Muslims, especially the Chinese. Soon after, {{the chief executive officer of}} a local Islamic web portal, Fateha. com, came out in protest against the Singapore government 2 ̆ 7 s close alignment with the United States and Israel, condemning their acts as anti-Islamic. A debacle over the wearing of headscarves, or tudung, by four primary school girls soon followed, raising questions of discrimination against Singaporean Muslims, some of whom had claimed to be marginalised by the Chinese-dominated government. The JI arrests plunged the tiny, multi-religious and multiracial country of four million, into a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> and distrust, and issues which had originally been discussed behind closed doors were suddenly thrust into the public sphere, forcing the opening of racial and religious discussions. This thesis employs a two part process to examine how the Singapore government and the media cooperated to preserve the country 2 ̆ 7 s racial and religious harmony. In the first part, interviews with one former Cabinet minister, three community leaders, three journalists - two from The Straits Times, one from Berita Harian - and one political commentator were used to explore how the government, the community and the press viewed these efforts. In the second part, articles appearing in The Straits Times and Berita Harlan between January 6 and January 31, 2002, were studied from a qualitative perspective as to how they played their part in maintaining this peace, and particular consideration was given to the size and placement of the articles. Attention was also paid to any discrepancies that arose between interview responses and what was written in the papers. In all, the cooperation between the Singapore government and the press is shown to have been an important factor in preventing racial and religious rifts among Singaporeans during the incidents. Yet, they have also provided a valuable lesson in highlighting the shortcomings inherent in the lack of open interracial and inter-religious debate...|$|E

This research examines American Muslim perspectives on national security discourse regarding terrorism and radicalization, both domestic and foreign, after 9 / 11. The article argues {{that it is important to}} highlight developments, both progressive and conservative, in Muslim communities in the United States over the last 12 years that belie <b>suspicions</b> <b>of</b> widespread anti-American sentiment among Muslims or questions about the loyalty of American Muslims. The article concludes with a discussion of important shifts from a Muslim identity politics that disassociated from American identity and ‘American exceptionalism’ to a position of integration and cultural assimilation...|$|R
5000|$|In episode one Stewart {{tells the}} story of British {{interventions}} in Afghanistan in the 19th century when the British became obsessed with the idea that their rival, Russia expanding south, was considering the invasion of Afghanistan as a staging post for an attack on British India.

Stewart {{tells the story}} of explorer and spy Alexander Burnes whose book when translated into French and read by Russia alerted them to believe Britain was expanding north and then Stewart relates the decision-making that led to the first British invasion of Afghanistan and the three Anglo-Afghan wars fought in this era. After the first world war an Afghan elite, led by King Amanullah Khan, made a futile attempt to impose western inspired ideas and modernity such as western dress and education of girls in a conservative country that forced the king into exile.|$|R

5000|$|Bribery {{is one of}} {{the most}} common tools of subversion. Most {{societies}} see bribery as a form of corruption and it used as a subversive tool because it, [...] "implies the undermining of existing rules of political or moral conduct". It can also be one of the less reliable tools as well. Bribed officials are only useful if they take action. However actions taken over a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time draw <b>suspicion</b> from the public. The official must be able to carefully conceal their actions or perform only key functions and action.

40|$|There is a {{reciprocal}} {{relationship between the}} study of language disorders and research in normal language development. Recent studies in normal acquisition {{have led to a}} model of language devel-opment that includes not only lin-guistic achievements, but the de-velopment of social and cognitive abilities that lay the basis for the transition from prelinguistic com-munication to the use of conven-tional forms. This model has been applied to the study of develop-mental disorders of language learning. Such a model allows the more puzzling disorders of lan-guage development, such as child-hood aphasia and primary autism, to be placed in a framework that predicts language disruption when underlying perceptual, cog-nitive, or social abilities are lacking. Assessment procedures that can be drawn from the model of language disorders are pre-sented. It is argued that the study of these disabilities is important in the building of theoretical models of intact language proc-essing that specify more precisely the contribution of underlying skills to overall functioning. Questions for future research that serve this reciprocal purpose are discussed. One of the most frequent present-ing problems in children referred for developmental disorders of any kind is a delay in the acquisition of language. Failure to talk at the ap-propriate age may be the first sig-nal that alerts parents to the fact that their child is different from other children, or it may be the culmination <b>of</b> a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> vague <b>suspicion</b> that there is something "funny " about the child. In both cases, it is very often the child's lack of speech that finally impels the parents to seek professional help. Psycholinguistic research into these failures in language acquisi-tion has been of interest not only to those who deal with communi-catively impaired youngsters, but also to theorists concerned with the nature of language and the normal course of its developmen...|$|R

Technologies <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> are predicated upon a framework of trust; they are deployed within a “system of takings-for-granted ” that presupposes trust and thus makes distrust possible. Drug-testing provides {{an excellent example of}} the institutionalization of distrust through the deployment <b>of</b> technologies <b>of</b> <b>suspicion</b> not only within institutions but beyond their real and virtual walls.
