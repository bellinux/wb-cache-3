25|$|No new {{guidelines}} dealing specifically with HPV+OPC have yet been developed, outside of clinical trials. Indirect data suggests {{the efficacy of}} less intense treatment. A retrospective analysis of advanced (N+) HPV+OPC suggested 96% 5 year local control with deintensified radiation of 54Gy and concurrent cisplatin based chemotherapy. The conclusions of the above pair of similar phase II trials have been supported by several other phase II trials. A <b>prospective</b> <b>trial</b> (ECOG 1308) demonstrated similar locoregional control with 54Gy., and another study, a high pathological complete response rate at 60Gy. These studies all used well below the previous standard dose of 70Gy. Since long term toxicity is associated with radiation dose, determining the efficacy of lower and hence less morbid doses of radiation is a priority, since many HPV+ patients {{can be expected to}} have long term survival.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The risk {{of severe}} {{cardiovascular}} toxicity, specifically thromboembolic events (TE), {{in patients with}} cervical cancer receiving concurrent irradiation and cisplatin chemotherapy {{is reported to be}} less than 1 % in several large <b>prospective</b> <b>trials.</b> However, the anecdotal risk appears to be far higher. Results and discussion A review of several <b>prospective</b> <b>trials</b> demonstrates no treatment related grade 4 cardiovascular toxicities and only two grade 5 toxicities in 1424 (0. 1 %) collective patients. A recent publication and our own unpublished experience finds 6 of 128 (4. 7 %) patients developed grade 4 to 5 cardiovascular (thrombosis/embolism) toxicity. The differenc in incidence of severe or life threatening cardiovascular toxicity of 0. 1 versus 4. 7 % is highly statistically significant (p Conclusion This dramatic difference in incidence of cardiovascular toxicity raises the possibility that cardiovascular toxicities were inadequately reported on the listed <b>prospective</b> <b>trials.</b> For those patients enrolled in <b>prospective</b> <b>trials,</b> we suggest that thromboses should be diligently documented and reported. Only after the true incidence of thromboses is established can we implement appropriate levels of early screening and intervention that may prevent life threatening complications. </p...|$|R

50|$|Bönninghausen's Therapeutic Pocketbook of 1846 was {{the first}} homeopathic {{repertory}} to grade individual remedies by their strength of relationship with each symptom, and each other. This so-called von Bönninghausen (or von Boenninghausen)-method has remained in use until the present day. He proposed that disparate symptoms associated with a remedy could be grouped as a single overarching tendency, hence the importance of generalities and modalities in his system of case analysis. His method was sometimes misunderstood by later homeopaths such as C. Hering and J.T. Kent. Latter did this on purpose, just to promote his own repertory. However, recent translations and revisions point to a revival of interest in Bönninghausen's approach. An early advocate of high potencies, he conducted a successful <b>prospective</b> <b>trial</b> of 200C in domestic animals and livestock, reasoning that veterinary homeopathy was harder to dismiss as a placebo effect.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes, after {{a number}} of {{witnesses}} have been deposed, the parties will have enough information that they can reasonably predict the outcome of a <b>prospective</b> <b>trial,</b> and may decide to arrive at a compromise settlement, thus avoiding trial and preventing additional costs of litigation. Accordingly, while most depositions are not videotaped, opposing counsel may use the opportunity to get an impression of the witness's affect and appearance, because these are telling factors as to how that person will present in front of a jury. Furthermore, deposition transcripts are frequently submitted in support of motions for summary judgment as evidence that there is no triable issue of fact. The moving party may use transcripts to argue that even if all the testimony given at deposition was given again at trial, no reasonable factfinder could find in the opponent's favor on a material issue of fact. The rationale is that generally, a witness must give consistent testimony on all material issues of fact both at deposition and at trial (unless there is a very good reason for changing one's answers), or else the inconsistencies can and will be used to impeach his credibility.|$|E

40|$|Background: Through {{a review}} of the English literature, this study aimed to assess the incidence, etiology, risk factors, and {{preventive}} measures for postoperative infections occurring after plastic surgery operations. Methods: All studies describing the occurrence of infections after plastic surgery procedures including case reports, <b>prospective</b> <b>trials,</b> and retrospective series were selected. Results: The 85 articles analyzed showed that incidences differ greatly among procedures and seem to be influenced by different and specific risk factors for each operation. Etiologic agents are primarily bacteria, although mycobacteria, virus, and fungi also have been described. No agreement exists on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, except for abdominoplasties, because few specific <b>prospective</b> <b>trials</b> are present in the literature. Conclusions: Infections remain an important problem in plastic surgery with different points that still need to be clarified. Hopefully, in the future <b>prospective</b> randomized <b>trials</b> will definitively address this issue in order to provide plastic surgeons with clear and unbiased guidelines on its prevention and management.

40|$|Non-small-cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{represents}} a common health {{issue in the}} elderly population. Nevertheless, the paucity of large, well-conducted <b>prospective</b> <b>trials</b> {{makes it difficult to}} provide evidence-based clinical recommendations for these patients. The present paper reviews the currently available evidence regarding treatment of all stages of NSCLC in elderly patients. Surgery remains the standard for early-stage disease, though pneumonectomy is associated with higher incidence of postoperative mortality in elderly patients. Given the lack of demonstrated benefit for the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, it is also not recommended in elderly patients. Elderly patients seem to derive the same benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy as younger patients do, with no significant increase in toxicity. For locally advanced NSCLC, concurrent chemoradiotherapy may be offered to selected elderly patients as there is a higher risk for toxicity reported in the elderly population. Third-generation single-agent treatment is considered the standard of care for patients with advanced/metastatic disease. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy needs to be evaluated in <b>prospective</b> <b>trials.</b> Unfortunately, with the exception of advanced/metastatic NSCLC, <b>prospective</b> elderly-specific NSCLC <b>trials</b> are lacking and the majority of recommendations made are based on retrospective data, which might suffer from selection bias. <b>Prospective</b> elderly-specific <b>trials</b> are needed...|$|R
