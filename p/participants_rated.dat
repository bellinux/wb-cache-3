500|$|Muzafer Sherif {{conducted}} an experiment, {{very similar to}} Lorge, in which he investigated how prestige affects the evaluation of literary materials. College {{students were asked to}} rank a set of prose passages according to their literary quality. Each passage also included the name of a well-known author. However, all of the passages were actually written by the same author. [...] <b>Participants</b> <b>rated</b> the authors earlier in terms of their literary standing. Sherif found that passages that were identified with highly acclaimed authors received higher rankings.|$|E
500|$|In his experiment, {{subjects}} rated {{a set of}} 50 quotations on a 5-point {{scale of}} [...] "agreement" [...] or [...] "disagreement" [...] with the statement. The quotes were followed by the names of two public people. Subjects were informed {{that one of the}} names was the author of the true source and were asked to select the true author. After about a month, the subjects again rated the same quotation but with the true author only listed below the quotation. Subjects also rated earlier their [...] "respect for the political opinions of each of these individuals". This was used as a measure of prestige. [...] Lorge found that the <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> the same statement differently when it was referred to a different author. More specifically, the rating of a statement tended to rise when it was referred to a more [...] "prestigious" [...] author.|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, {{the study}} The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2011) {{indicated}} that <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> 80 names and 80 paintings [...] {{based on how}} much they liked the name {{and how much they}} liked painting. To give meaning to the decisions, {{the participants were asked to}} select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, the participants were asked to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.|$|E
40|$|The Montreal Affective Voices {{consist of}} 90 nonverbal affect bursts {{corresponding}} to the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, pain, sadness, surprise, happiness, and pleasure (plus a neutral expression), recorded by 10 different actors (5 of them male and 5 female). Ratings of valence, arousal, and intensity for eight emotions were collected for each vocalization from 30 participants. Analyses revealed high recognition accuracies {{for most of the}} emotional categories (mean of 68 %). They also revealed significant effects of both the actors and the participants gender: The highest hit rates (75 %) were obtained for female <b>participants</b> <b>rating</b> female vocalizations, and the lowest hit rates (60 %) for male <b>participants</b> <b>rating</b> male vocalizations. Interestingly, the mixed situations that is, male <b>participants</b> <b>rating</b> female vocalizations or female <b>participants</b> <b>rating</b> male vocalizations yielded similar, intermediate ratings.

50|$|Subliminal stimuli can elicit {{significant}} emotional changes, {{but these}} changes are not valuable for a therapeutic effect. Spider-fearful and non-fearful undergraduates experienced either a positive, negative, or neutral subliminal prime followed immediately by {{a picture of a}} spider or a snake. Using visual analogue scales, the <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> the affective quality of the picture. No evidence was found to support that the unpleasantness of the pictures can be modulated by subliminal priming. In fact, the non-fearful <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> the spiders as more frightening after being primed with a negative stimuli, however, for the fearful participants, this effect was not found.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} raising {{consumer}} financial literacy {{is a major}} initiative {{across a range of}} countries. A key dimension of financial literacy programs is the systematic evaluation of their effectiveness. One element of such evaluation involves <b>participant</b> <b>rating</b> of program effectiveness. An issue in the modelling of such data is that <b>participants</b> typically <b>rate</b> multiple elements of the program, and these multiple ratings result in a correlation structure in their responses. This paper explores different ways of modelling the correlation structure. We find strong differences in significance levels and marginal effects depending on how the correlation structure is modelled...|$|R

30|$|After {{removing}} {{respondents who}} gave illogical VAS responses or “straight lined” answers, N= 458 responses were analysed. Coefficients {{were in the}} expected direction and statistically significant. Valuations were typically higher than the standard UK EQ- 5 D- 3 L tariff. Removing participants who chose a dominated health state resulted in coefficients with a magnitude of 90 - 115 % of the coefficients from the full sample, although differences were not statistically significant. Removing participants who stated they {{did not understand the}} VAS task meant coefficients with 80 - 90 % of the magnitude of those from the full sample, though differences were insignificant. Excluding <b>participants</b> <b>rating</b> death above 50 on the VAS gave significantly different coefficients, with magnitudes of 65 - 70 % compared to the full sample, though little additional change occurred from removing <b>participants</b> <b>rating</b> death above 10. Valuations from HB estimation were typically closer to standard tariff values than those from SML.|$|R

Some <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> previously heard sentences as true even when they were previously told that they were false. The illusion-of-truth effect shows in some ways the potential dangers of implicit memory as it can lead to unconscious decisions about a statement's veracity.|$|E

50|$|In 2002 (published in 2006), a more rigorously {{controlled}} {{version of}} this experiment was conducted at Johns Hopkins University by Roland R. Griffiths, yielding similar results.

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} obesity and related conditions among Sudanese adult migrants living in Brisbane, Australia. Data were obtained on 314 Sudanese immigrants aged 18 - 70 years. Measured body mass index (BMI) and self-reported diabetes and hypertension were obtained. More than half (51 %) of participants were overweight or obese, 6. 4 % reported having type 2 diabetes while 12. 4 % had hypertension. The full adjusted regression model explained 28. 1 % {{of the variance in}} BMI. Odds of reporting type 2 diabetes increased with age, BMI and were greater among <b>participants</b> <b>rating</b> health as poor/fair than those rating as good/very good/excellent. Odds of high blood pressure increased with age, BMI, and were higher among <b>participants</b> <b>rating</b> health as poor/fair than those as good/very good/excellent. Health promotion programs to prevent weight gain in this subpopulation will significantly reduce inequalities related to type 2 diabetes and improve cardio-vascular outcomes...|$|R
3000|$|... 1. We {{asked the}} <b>participants</b> to <b>rate</b> their emotion on a 5 -point Likert scale with anchors at − 2 and + 2 {{representing}} the bipolar opposites. We assessed the cognitive load of each participant {{after the completion}} of the scenario using a validated subjective rating tool 2. We asked the <b>participants</b> to <b>rate</b> their cognitive load on a scale of 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating higher mental effort.|$|R
50|$|However, {{since this}} is a self-report inventory, how {{reliable}} the assessment is depends on how accurately <b>participants</b> <b>rate</b> themselves. An androgynous score is the result of extremely masculine and feminine scores and an undifferentiated score is the result of extremely low masculine and feminine scores. It has been theorized that perhaps tendencies to rate oneself extremely low and extremely high on traits can affect a subjects' resulting gender placement.|$|R
50|$|Although {{different}} colors can be perceived in different ways, {{the name of}} those colors matters as well. Many products and companies focus on producing {{a wide range of}} product colors to attract the largest population of consumers. For example, cosmetics brands produce a rainbow for eye shadow and nail polish colors for every type of person. Even companies such as Apple Inc. and Dell make iPods and laptops with color personalization to attract buyers. But, color name, not only the actual color, can actually attract or repel buyers as well. When asked to rate either color swatches or products with generic color names, such as brown, or fancy color names, such as mocha, <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> items with fancy names as significantly more likable than items with generic names. In fact the same paint color swatch with two different names produced different rating levels. The same effect was found when <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> the pleasantness of towels with fancy and generic names. This shows a greater favorability for fancy names compared to generic names for exactly the same colors.|$|E

50|$|Studies of nonverbal cues {{have shown}} {{repeatedly}} that less conscious or vigilantly controlled displays of discomfort increase in aversively racist Whites when interacting with Blacks, {{even when a}} concerted effort is being made and the white participants reported liking the black participants. Dovidio et al. found that negative implicit attitudes where correlated with nonverbal cues of discomfort such as increased rates of blinking and decreased eye contact in interactions with blacks. Those observing the nonverbal cues may often receive very mixed messages. Consistent with this reasoning, Dovidio, Kawakami, and Gaertner (2002) found that racial majority and racial minority members often based their perceptions of interracial interactions on two different sources of information, with white people relying more on verbal behavior and black people more on nonverbal behaviors. In their experiment, black and white participants engaged in paired conversations and then provided their assessments of the interaction. Consistent with the aversive racism framework, black <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> a white partner's friendliness {{as a function of}} their nonverbal behaviors and implicit attitudes while white <b>participants</b> <b>rated</b> their own friendliness based on the verbal content of their conversation. Thus, participants left the same interaction with differing perceptions.|$|E
