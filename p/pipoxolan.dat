40|$|P> 1. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the molecular mechanisms by which <b>pipoxolan</b> exerts its inhibitory effects and apoptotic activity in human leukaemia HL- 60 cells. 2. The effects of <b>pipoxolan</b> on the proliferation of HL- 60 cells and on the distribution of cells within different phases of the cell cycle were investigated indirectly using a Trypan blue assay and a flow cytometer, respectively. The effects of <b>pipoxolan</b> on the apoptosis of HL- 60 cells was investigated using DNA fragmentation and flow cytometer. The expression of factors affecting the cell cycle and apoptosis, including p 53, p 21, Bax, Bcl 2, cytochrome c, caspase 3 and caspase 9, was examined by western blotting. 3. At 6. 25 mu g/mL, <b>pipoxolan</b> significantly induced apoptosis in human leukaemia HL- 60 cells after 24 h exposure. In addition, HL- 60 cells were arrested in the G(0) /G(1) phase via the induction of p 53 /p 21 by <b>pipoxolan.</b> Apoptosis was associated with an increased Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio, cytochrome c release, cleavage of procaspases- 9 and - 3 and hydrolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) seem to play a key role in the pipoxolan-induced apoptosis, because high levels of ROS were produced early in the drug treatment. Apoptosis was significantly abrogated by the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pipoxolan</b> (PIPO) has anti-spasmodic effects, {{and it is}} used {{clinically}} {{to relieve}} smooth muscle spasms. Cerebrovascular disease {{is one of the}} leading causes of disability and death worldwide. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PIPO on cerebral ischemia and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration in vivo and in vitro. Cerebral infarction area, ratio of intima to media area (I/M ratio) and PCNA antibody staining of the carotid artery in vivo were measured. Cell viability of A 7 r 5 cells, PDGF-BB-stimulated cell migration, and potential mechanisms of PIPO were evaluated by wound healing, transwell and Western blotting. PIPO (10 and 30 mg/kg p. o.) reduced: the cerebral infarction area; neurological deficit; TUNEL-positive cells; cleaved caspase 3 -positive cells; intimal hyperplasia; and inhibited proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) -positive cells in rodents. PIPO (5, 10 and 15 ÂµM) significantly inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMC migration and reduced Ras, MEK, and p-ERK levels. Moreover, PIPO decreased levels of matrix metalloproteinases - 2 and - 9 in PDGF-BB-stimulated A 7 r 5 cells. In summary, PIPO is protective in models of ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral infarction, carotid artery ligation-induced intimal hyperplasia and VSMC migration both in vivo and in vitro. PIPO could be potentially efficacious in preventing cerebrovascular and vascular diseases...|$|E
