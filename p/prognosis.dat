5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of <b>prognosis.</b> Some have found that the accuracy of <b>prognosis</b> improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of <b>prognosis</b> accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, because <b>prognoses</b> {{have neither}} proved useless [36, 37] nor {{dismissed}} {{as an instrument}} to address the future [3], {{there is also no}} coherent set of rules to distinguish scenarios from <b>prognoses</b> and other forms of exposing the future.

30|$|All {{explanations}} using probability as {{a criterion}} are <b>prognoses</b> by definition. This means that all explanations in social science justified as true are in fact <b>prognoses</b> because theories, scientific laws, and explanations are not universal. Taking into account that the explanans needs to manifest empirical significance, it also becomes clear that <b>prognoses</b> by definition are scientific statements about the past, not about the future [3].|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The <b>prognosis</b> for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse <b>prognosis,</b> with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS <b>prognosis</b> is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best <b>prognosis,</b> with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a <b>prognosis</b> of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a <b>prognosis</b> of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less <b>prognosis,</b> this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E

30|$|A SEF {{should allow}} for {{scientific}} statements about possible, alternative developments. Explanations {{cannot be used}} to justify these statements because they are <b>prognoses</b> about the past. Another form of explanations is needed instead. The justification of alternative mental constructions needs <b>prognoses</b> with the aim to illustrate rather than to explain future developments. <b>Prognoses</b> just illustrating rather than explaining future developments (leaving out the question what that is for now) can create a justification for mental constructions but only under the condition of acceptance by others. Following that, and having in mind that <b>prognoses</b> about the future are much more uncertain than about the past, the role of critical discourse in a SEF is fundamental.|$|R
40|$|Road Safety Outlook 2020; Interim report phase 1. In 2008 the Strategic Road Safety Plan 2008 - 2020 (SPV) was formulated. This plan is {{the basis}} of the {{biannual}} Action Programmes, among other things. It has been decided that the SPV will be reviewed every four years to assess whether its implementation will meet the targets in 2020 and whether the SPV must possibly be revised. This report is meant as a tool for this review. It deals with <b>prognoses</b> for the number of fatalities and serious road injuries in 2020 with implementation of the SPV; they are defined as reference <b>prognoses.</b> Before drawing up the <b>prognoses,</b> it was studied whether the points of departure of the SPV are still applicable. Modification in the points of departure has been accounted for in the formulation of the <b>prognoses.</b> The <b>prognoses</b> have been drawn up in two stages. In the first place, the development in risk from the past (1995 - 2009) has been extrapolated to the future (2020) for various groups of casualties. The ‘forecasting model’ developed by SWOV has been used for this purpose. The expected risks are multiplied by mobility or population <b>prognoses</b> derived from the Welfare, Prosperity and Quality of the Living Environment (WLO) study from 2006. The total number of casualties in 2020 has been estimated by adding the <b>prognoses</b> for the various subgroups. These first reference <b>prognoses</b> for the total number of fatalities and the total number of serious road injuries have next been revised for adjustments in road safety policy. Taken into account are the a number of ‘current measures’ that may be expected to have less or, rather, more effect on road safety and a number of ‘new measures’ in the SPV that are expected to have extra effect...|$|R

5|$|PTEN and p27 loss of {{function}} mutations {{are associated with a}} good <b>prognosis,</b> particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu oncogene, which indicates a poor <b>prognosis,</b> is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good <b>prognosis,</b> but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with squamous cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prognosis</b> of {{spontaneous}} cervical arterial dissection involves neurological and arterial results. The overall functional <b>prognosis</b> {{of individuals with}} stroke due to cervical artery dissection {{does not appear to}} vary from that of young people with stroke due to other causes. The rate of survival with good outcome (a modified Rankin score of 0–2) is generally about 75%, or possibly slightly better (85.7%) if antiplatelet drugs are used. In studies of anticoagulants and aspirin, the combined mortality with either treatment is 1.8–2.1%.|$|E
5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best <b>prognosis.</b> Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse <b>prognosis,</b> but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse <b>prognosis.</b> In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good <b>prognosis</b> compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E

50|$|Time-to-event studies {{must have}} {{sufficiently}} long follow-up durations to capture enough events to reveal meaningful {{patterns in the}} data.

5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor <b>prognosis</b> include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor <b>prognosis</b> (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good <b>prognosis</b> (100% survival). Patients with a poor <b>prognosis</b> are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E

The more elaborated and sophisticated they are, the better they can approximate truth, the more they can predict the past, thereby becoming an useless instrument to expose the future in a scientific way.
