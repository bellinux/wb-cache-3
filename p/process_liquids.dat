40|$|Abstract: The cut-density of sink-float separations with {{water-based}} magnetic liquids linearly {{depends on}} the magnetization of the <b>process</b> <b>liquid.</b> The control of the magnetization of the liquid, by means of measurement followed by extraction {{of water from the}} <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> by membranes or mixing with water or concentrated magnetic liquid, is therefore a critical part of the technology. A potential problem with mixing-in concentrated magnetic liquid is that the <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> may become inhomogeneous and will segregate in the magnetic field region. Mixing experiments for various scenarios were carried out on a simplified experimental process line and magnetization levels were compared with theoretical models. The results show as <b>process</b> <b>liquid</b> segregation, due to incomplete mixing, can be avoided for all conceivable control strategies by using static mixers. A measurement tool based on a magneto-gravimetric principle was shown to have sufficient sensitivity to detect and control fluctuations of the magnetization of such a fluid in an industrial environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct an applied field study {{investigating}} the feasibility of utilizing <b>processed</b> <b>liquid</b> swine manure in crop production. Four treatments were evaluated; unprocessed <b>liquid</b> swine manure, <b>processed</b> <b>liquid</b> effluent, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and zero-rate control. For shallow subsurface water (as measured by lysimeters), the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer treatment had the greatest levels of nitrate-N. However, there were no significant differences for any measured chemical parameter for groundwater (as measured by sampling wells) among the four treatments. In general, the zero-rate control treatment was the lowest yielding treatment for corn (Zea mays L.), in contrast to the equivalent response of the other treatments. Nutrient accumulation was similar for the four treatments, with the exception of greater plant manganese content of the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer treatment. For soybean (Glycine max L.), all four treatments responded in a similar fashion. After 5 years of annual treatment application, the <b>processed</b> <b>liquid</b> effluent and unprocessed manure treatments were similar for most soil parameters. In addition, soil and plant tissue samples were evaluated for pathogenic organisms (total coliform and Escherichia coli) and non-detectable levels were found for all treatments. The results of this study indicate the <b>processed</b> <b>liquid</b> swine effluent produced in this study, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and unprocessed manure had similar effects on crop characteristics and subsurface water quality...|$|R

5000|$|Where level must be sensed {{inside a}} {{pressurized}} vessel, often a magnet {{is used to}} couple {{the motion of the}} float to a switch located outside the pressurized volume.

Successful float switch installations minimize the opportunity for accumulation of dirt on the float that would impede its motion. Float switch materials are selected to resists the deleterious effects of corrosive <b>process</b> <b>liquids.</b> In some systems, a properly selected and sized float can be used to sense the interface level between two liquids of different density.|$|E
50|$|Though {{many modern}} authors {{make the mistake}} of {{translating}} a dolium as a wooden barrel, it was actually a very large jug or container made of fired clay. Oval in shape, with a wide mouth and rim, it was much larger than the amphora, a similar pottery container. The dolium had no neck or handles and, in many cases, could measure up to six feet in height. Some dolia have a rounded body tapering into a flat bottom, while more frequently, dolia maintained a rounded bottom. They were lined with pitch or wax in order to contain or <b>process</b> <b>liquids</b> and solid foods. Some sources mention dolia holding up to 50 quadrantals, equivalent to 346.5 gallons. Though there was no standard size for dolia, even the smallest capacity recorded by Pliny the Elder was large for Roman earthenware containers.|$|E
