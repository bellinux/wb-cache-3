40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{the design}} of a support <b>plate</b> <b>for</b> the <b>accumulator</b> of an {{electric}} motor vehicle. The support {{is an integral part of}} motor vehicle chassis. Therefore, geometrical configuration and boundary conditions require careful optimisation research of both function and structural behaviour, since lightness and dimension problems in the presence of dynamic stresses due to external factors have to be considered. Since these factors are complex and not homogeneous, the problem requires multi-criteria analysis. The presence, of factors that are not precisely computable calls for fuzzy-logic application to optimisation problems, because fuzzy-logic is non-standard logic, particularly suitable for making choices in structural design. In plate optimisation, in fact, not numerically quantifiable characteristics such as a part's workability, numerically determinable structural values such as stresses and strains, and analytically calculable properties such as weight come into play. These four parameters become the domain of fuzzy membership functions, by which we will extract membership grade values (codomain). Design variables (domain) are plate thickness, ashlar's number on the plate and stiffening ashlar's depth. In our research, we characterise fuzzy correlation between parameters and required characteristics in order to determine, according to non-standard logics, the best topological configuration which corresponds to the optimisation of individualised characteristics in conformity with design constraints. Results show value improvement in stress and strain in comparison with the not yet optimsed plate and small reduction in workability, whereas the mass is almost the sam...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the articles (A) obtained by the process, containing the pyrolyzed (I). USE - The use of (A) is claimed: (1) as electrodes or bipolar <b>plates</b> <b>for</b> batteries, <b>accumulators</b> or fuel cells; (2) for screening against electromagnetic waves; (3) as filter elements, especially for corrosive and/or hot liquids; or (4) as highly mechanically and/or thermally stressed components, specifically heat shields for aircraft or spacecraft, brake disks for automobiles or machine or turbine elements for power stations or reactors. ADVANTAGE - A simple, inexpensive procedure is provided for providing high quality (specifically electrically conductive) articles (A) of almost any shape. In particular (A) have at least comparable electrical conductivity with highly filled polymeric articles containing 60 w. t % carbon black or graphite, and also show high mechanical strength, wear and abrasion resistance, inertness to corrosive materials and resistance to high temperatures. The natural fibers (I) are markedly less expensive than synthetic reinforcing fibers (e. g. carbon, metal or ceramic fibers); are considerably lighter than metal or ceramic fibers; are readily incorporated in polymers and non-abrasive to processing machinery (being relatively flexible and soft); and reduce stresses and surface defects in (A) (being shrinkable) ...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic {{accumulator}} is an algorithm, which gathers {{together a}} large set of elements into a constant-size value such {{that for a}} given element accumulated, there is a witness confirming that the element was indeed included into the value, with a property that accumulated elements can be dynamically added and deleted into/from the original set such {{that the cost of}} an addition or deletion operation is independent of the number of accumulated elements.

40|$|Web-scale {{search engines}} {{deal with a}} volume of data and queries that forces them {{to make use of}} an index {{partitioned}} across many machines. Two main methods of partitioning an index for distributed processing have been described in the literature. In document partitioning, each processor node holds the information for a subset of documents, while in term partitioning, each node holds the information for a subset of terms. Additionally, a novel architecture, pipelining, has been proposed, offering to combine the best features of both architectures. This thesis develops a careful methodology for the experimental comparison of distributed information retrieval architectures, addressing questions such as experiment scalability and query set generation. Novel methods are proposed <b>for</b> <b>accumulator</b> pruning, and <b>for</b> compression of <b>accumulators</b> <b>for</b> shipping between nodes in the pipelined architecture. A meticulous experimental assessment of the three distributed architectures is then undertaken. The results demonstrate that term distribution suffers...|$|R

The instructions <b>for</b> <b>accumulator</b> or memory-to-memory machines are not padded out with multiple register fields. Instead, they use compiler-managed anonymous variables for subexpression values. These temps need extra memory reference instructions which take more code space {{than for the}} belt machine.
