40|$|Abstract: We {{present in}} this paper a novel method for {{comparing}} alternative 2 D measurements. The method {{is based on a}} new image registration algorithm developed for the automatic registration and alignment of randomly textured image data. Our aim in the algorithm development has been to enable fast registration of the measured 2 D <b>property</b> <b>maps</b> without the need for special registration marks. To improve robustness, the maps are registered in two steps; the first step exhibits plain translation and the second phase iteratively refines the transformation estimate. Sub-pixel registration accuracy is achieved. Several experiments have been conducted showing that the algorithm is able to register various 2 D <b>property</b> <b>maps</b> successfully. After the registration we align the alternative 2 D measurements. This enables the comparison and statistical joint analysis of several 2 D <b>property</b> <b>maps</b> measured from the same target area. The high amount of independently measured data points in the <b>property</b> <b>maps</b> provides a firm statistical ground for conclusions. We have used the new registration algorithm to align various 2 D surface profile measurements of paper and board. The analysis of the aligned measurements has confirmed the feasibility of our registration method and revealed fundamental differences between the measurement devices...|$|R

The land was put up for auction in 2007 by State Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson because the property was too difficult to maintain.

The gift deed required the Conservation Fund’s approval before conveying the property to any party other than the federal or state parks agencies. Patterson, however, decided the provision was not enforceable. The winning bid was $652,000 ($70/acre), but the sale was canceled on September 18, 2007 after the state said a <b>property</b> <b>map</b> was inaccurate.|$|E

5000|$|Ringing Rocks County Park is a Bucks County park in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania at [...] [...] Originally, {{the land}} was {{acquired}} by the Penn family from the Lenape (Delaware Nation) through the infamous 1737 Walking Purchase. It is not clear who made the original land warrant for the area now covered by the Ringing Rocks County Park. On the 1850 <b>property</b> <b>map</b> of Bucks County, the owner appears to be Tunis Lippincott; however, there is no warrantee listing under that name. The earliest published description of the Bridgeton boulder field is found in Davis 1876. The seven-acre boulder field was purchased in 1895 by Abel B. Haring, president of the Union National Bank in Frenchtown, NJ. Apparently Haring wished to protect the ringing rocks from development, and even refused an offer from a manufacturer of Belgian blocks {{for the right to}} quarry the stones. (Humphreys 1905, Sigafoos 1935). On August 22, 1918, the land which contains the Bridgeton boulder field was donated by Haring to the Bucks County Historical Society. The grant included 7 acres 8.08 perches of land. A right-of-way was granted by John O. McEntee for access to the park (Fackenthal 1919). Later {{the land was}} transferred to Bucks County and operated as a county park. Additional land acquisitions have increased the size of the park to 128 acres.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the efficiency of}} geostatistical digital soil mapping (DSM) with conventional soil mapping (CSM) for updating soil class and <b>property</b> <b>maps</b> of a cultivated peatland in the Netherlands. For digital soil class mapping, the generalized linear geostatistical model was used. Digital mapping of the soil organic matter (SOM) content and peat thickness was done by universal kriging. The conventional soil class map was created by free survey, while the <b>property</b> <b>maps</b> were created with the representative profile description (RPD) and map unit means (MUM) methods. For each method, we computed the effort invested in the mapping {{in terms of the}} sampling and cost densities. The accuracies of the created soil maps were estimated from independent probability sample data. The results showed that for DSM, the cost density could be reduced by a factor of three compared with CSM without compromising accuracy. The map purity of both maps was around 55 %. For conventional soil <b>property</b> <b>mapping,</b> the MUM maps were more accurate than the RPD maps. For SOM, CSM-MUM (RMSE 7. 5 %) performed better than DSM (RMSE 12. 1 %), although accuracy differences were not significant. For peat thickness, DSM (RMSE 23. 3 cm) performed slightly better than CSM-MUM (RMSE 24. 9 cm). Despite the differences in accuracy being small, the digital soil <b>property</b> <b>maps</b> were produced more efficiently. The cost density was a factor of 3. 5 smaller. We conclude that for updating conventional soil maps in the Dutch peatlands, geostatistical DSM can be more efficient, although not necessarily more accurate, than CSM...|$|R

This paper presents an effective method to produce detailed soil <b>property</b> <b>map</b> based on representative samples which were extracted from each polygon on the 1 : 1 000 000 soil type map. The representative sample of each polygon is defined as the location that can represent the largest area within the polygon. The representativeness of a candidate sample is determined by calculating the soil-forming environment condition similarities between the sample and other locations. Once the representative sample of each polygon has been chosen, the property values of the existing typical samples are assigned to the corresponding representative samples with the same soil type. Finally, based on these representative samples, the detailed soil <b>property</b> <b>map</b> could be produced by using existing digital soil mapping methods.
