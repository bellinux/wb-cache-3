However, some new {{research has indicated that}} HSP60 possibly <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in <b>a</b> “danger signal cascade” immune response.

5|$|It is {{theorized that}} the use of birth control pills should affect eating {{behaviour}} as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels. The neurotransmitter serotonin is also thought to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in food intake. Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size, among other things, and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{may also}} <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in {{supporting}} cardiovascular health by modulating cholesterol and fat uptake.

5|$|Multifactorial sex {{determination}} occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems. Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes. For example, the darter characine has a ZW multifactorial system where the female {{is determined by}} ZW1W2 and the male by ZZ. The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as zebrafish, have a polyfactorial system, where there are several genes which <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in determining sex. Environment-dependent {{sex determination}} has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost. Temperature is the main factor, but PH levels, growth rate, density and social environment may also <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role.</b> For the Atlantic silverside, spawning in colder waters creates more females, while warmer waters create more males.|$|E

5|$|Several {{pathways}} {{by which}} mHTT may cause cell death have been identified. These include: effects on chaperone proteins, which help fold proteins and remove misfolded ones; interactions with caspases, which <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> {{in the process}} of removing cells; the toxic effects of glutamine on nerve cells; impairment of energy production within cells; and effects on the expression of genes.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role.</b> Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
