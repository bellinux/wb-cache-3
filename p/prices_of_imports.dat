The case {{which we}} have just examined, is an example in how {{remarkable}} a manner every cause which materially influences exports, operates upon the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports.</b> According to the ancient theory of the balance of trade, and to the associations of the generality of what are termed practical men to this day, the sole benefit derived from commerce consists in the exports, and imports are rather an evil than otherwise. Political economists, seeing the folly of these views, and clearly perceiving that the advantage of commerce consists and must consist solely of the imports, have occasionally suffered themselves to employ language evincing inattention to the fact, that exports, though unimportant in themselves, are important by their influence on imports. So real and extensive is this influence, that every new market which is opened for any of our goods, and every increase in the demand for our commodities in foreign countries, enables us to supply ourselves with foreign commodities at a smaller cost.|$|E

50|$|Immediately {{following}} the depreciation or {{devaluation of the}} currency, {{the total value of}} imports will increase and exports may remain largely unchanged due in part to pre-existing trade contracts that have to be honored. This is because in the short run, <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> rise due to the depreciation and also in the short run there is a lag in changing consumption of imports, therefore there is an immediate jump followed by a lag until the long run prevails and consumers stop importing as many expensive goods and along with the rise in exports cause the current account to increase(a smaller defect or a bigger surplus). Moreover, in the short run, demand for the more expensive imports (and demand for exports, which are cheaper to foreign buyers using foreign currencies) remain price inelastic. This is due to time lags in the consumer's search for acceptable, cheaper alternatives (which might not exist).|$|E

The corresponding figure for producer prices is 28 percent and for consumer prices 8 percent.

We exploit the fact that in a small open economy such as Canada the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> and exports should represent pure demand shocks. We specify wage and employment determination equations for a sample of collective bargaining agreements from 1965 to 1983. Our estimation strategy consists of specifying the wage as a function of firm-specific value added per worker instrumented with the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> and the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> exports in the industry. The OLS specification is rejected in favor of the instrumental variables specification using standard specification tests. The instrumental variables estimates imply that a 1 % change in value-added per worker increases the negotiated wage settlements by 0. 25 %. Similarly, we specify union employment as a function of firm-specific sales instrumented by the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> and exports in the industry. The instrumental variables estimates are imprecise and the specification test fails to reject the OLS specification.
