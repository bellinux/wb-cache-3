Even though the summary of 6 POPs was strongly associated with diabetes, individual POPs had substantial differences in strength of association (1). Thus, it is also of interest to estimate risk within subclasses of POPs that have similar physical and chemical properties.

However, results of studies carried out on humans are conflicting. Objective: We evaluated the exposure to organochlorinated persistent pollutants as a risk factor for endometriosis. Met h o d s: We conducted a case–control study in Rome on 158 women comprising 80 cases and 78 controls. In all women, serum concentrations of selected non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs) and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs), 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2,-bis(4 -chlorophenyl) -ethene (p,p´-DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were determined by ion-trap mass spectrometry. DR-CALUX bioassay was employed to assess the 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicity equivalent (TEQ) concentrations of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-p-dioxins</b> (<b>PCDDs),</b> <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and DL-PCBs. Re s u l t s: We found an increased risk of endometriosis for DL-PCB- 118 [odds ratio (OR) = 3. 79...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the levels of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-p-dioxins</b> (<b>PCDDs),</b> <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs) in blood serum obtained from non-occupationally exposed volunteers living in the Naples area (Campania Region, southern Italy). The samples were taken from two geographical zones: one was an urban area of Naples and its surroundings and the other was located in an area deemed to be at high environmental risk. Total mean concentrations of these persistent pollutants proved to be in the range 1. 43 - 17. 38 pgWHO-TEQ 1998 g- 1 lipid for PCDD/Fs, and 0. 98 - 25. 45 pgWHO-TEQ 1998 g- 1 lipid for DL-PCBs. NDL-PCBs were in the range 316. 57 - 482. 90 ngg- 1 lipid. No significant differences were observed between women and men, nor between donors living in the two different areas. The mean levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in the population living in the Naples area were lower than those observed in some studies of populations living in exposed areas (near incineration plants or industrial sites) and urban or rural areas. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
