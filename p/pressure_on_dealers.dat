40|$|The 1994 [...] 95 {{heating season}} {{approached}} with {{more attention to}} petroleum products than experienced in some time. This year, however, {{the focus was on}} transportation fuels with the introduction of reformulated gasolines scheduled for the first of 1995. Last year transportation fuels had been in the spotlight in the Northeast as well, for the ills experienced with a new winter mix for diesel fuel. Would RFG have the same dubious entrance as diesel`s winter mix? Would RFG implementation work and what effect would the change in stocks have on the refineries? With worries related to transportation fuels being recognized, would there be reason for concern with heating fuels? As the new year approached, the refineries seemed to have no problem with supplies and RFG stocks were eased in about the second week of December. In Maine, the southern half of the state was effected by the gasoline substitution but seven of Maine`s sixteen counties were directed to follow the recommended criteria. Since the major population concentration lies in the southern three counties, concern was real. Attention paid to emission testing had come to a head in the fall, and RFG complaints were likely. There have been years when snow and cold arrived by Thanksgiving Day. In northern Maine, snow easily covers the ground before the SHOPP survey begins. The fall slipped by with no great shocks in the weather. December was more of the same, as the weather continued to favor the public. Normally the third week in January is considered the coldest time in the year, but not this year. By the end of January, two days were recorded as being more typical of winter. By March {{and the end of the}} survey season, one could only recognize that there were perhaps a few cold days this winter. Fuel prices fluctuated little through the entire heating season. There were no major problems to report and demand never placed <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>dealers...</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{force is}} exerted {{by the air}} as a <b>pressure</b> {{difference}} <b>on</b> the airfoil's surfaces. Pressure in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense, so that pressure must always {{be thought of as}} pushing, and never as pulling. The pressure thus pushes inward on the airfoil everywhere on both the upper and lower surfaces. The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the wing's upper surface and increasing the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the lower surface. The <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the lower surface pushes up harder than the reduced <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the upper surface pushes down, and the net result is upward lift.|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonography of {{the optic}} nerve sheath {{diameter}} (ONSD) is a non-invasive and rapid method {{that might be}} helpful {{in the identification of}} increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The use of an ONSD greater than 5 mm on ultrasound as an indicator of increased ICP in a Caucasian population has been studied. However, the cut-off point of this predictor in Chi-nese patients has not been established. Thus, we conducted this study to identify the ONSD criterion for the detection of elevated opening <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> lumbar puncture (LP) in a Chinese population and to investigate the influencing factors. This study was a blind cross-sectional study. Patients who presented with suspected increased ICP were included. The opening <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> LP of each participant was confirmed. We analyzed the clinical differ-ences between the groups of patients with abnormal and normal opening <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> LP. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to determine the ONSD cut-off point for the identification of abnormal opening <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> LP. In total, 279 patients were recruited, and 101 patients presented with elevated opening <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> LP. ONSD was a significant independent predictor of elevated opening <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> LP (p< 0. 001). However...|$|R

The spatial coupling vibration model of vehicle-bridge system was established and corresponding procedure was compiled. The effect of travelling, steering and stabilizing wheel pressure respectively and typical combined wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the system vibration was studied. The results show that the change of wheel pressure has great effect on the response of the system. The vertical response value increases with travelling wheel pressure increasing. The lateral response value increases with steering wheel pressure increasing, while the effect of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the response is irregular. The effect of steering wheel pressure is greater than that of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> lateral responses. The effect of all of travelling and steering wheel pressure is greater than that of unilateral wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the response. The effect tendency of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the response is opposite to that of unilateral wheel pressure...|$|R
