40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> can be observed in children, and that these characteristics are associated with increased risk for the development of borderline personality disorder. It is not clear whether borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> in children share etiological features with adult borderline personality disorder. We investigated the etiology of borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> in a longitudinal cohort study of 1, 116 pairs of same-sex twins followed from birth through age 12 years. Borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> measured at age 12 years were highly heritable, were more common in children who had exhibited poor cognitive function, impulsivity, and more behavioral and emotional problems at age 5 years, and co-occurred with symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Exposure to harsh treatment in the family environment through age 10 years predicted borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> at age 12 years. This association showed evidence of environmental mediation and was stronger among children with a family history of psychiatric illness, consistent with diathesis–stress models of borderline etiology. Results indicate that borderline personality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> in children share etiological features with borderline personality disorder in adults and suggest that inherited and environmental risk factors make independent and interactive contributions to borderline etiology...|$|R

40|$|Objective To examine ethnic {{disparities in}} {{maternal}} prepregnancy obesity and gestational weight gain, {{and to examine}} to which extent these differences {{can be explained by}} socio-demographic, lifestyle and pregnancy <b>related</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Methods In a multi-ethnic population-based prospective cohort study among 6444 pregnant women in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, maternal anthropometrics were repeatedly measured throughout pregnancy. Ethnicity, socio-demographic, lifestyle and pregnancy <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> were assessed by physical examinations and questionnaires. Results The prevalence of prepregnancy overweight and obesity was 23. 1 % among Dutch-origin women. Statistically higher prevalences were observed among Dutch Antillean-origin (40. 8 %), Moroccan-origin (49. 9 %), Surinamese-Creole-origin (38. 6 %) and Turkish-origin (41. 1 %) women (all p-values < 0. 05). Only Dutch Antillean-origin, Moroccan-origin, Surinamese-Creole-origin and Turkish-origin women had higher risks of maternal prepregnancy overweight and obesity as compared to Dutch-origin women (p-values < 0. 05). Socio-demographic and lifestyle <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> explained up to 45 % of the ethnic differences in body mass index. Compared to Dutch-origin women, total gestational weight gain was lower in all ethnic minority groups, except for Cape Verdean-origin and Surinamese-Creole-origin women (p-values < 0. 05). Lifestyle and pregnancy <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> explained up to 33 % and 40 % of these associations, respectively. The largest ethnic differences in gestational weight gain were observed in late pregnancy. Conclusion We observed moderate ethnic differences in maternal prepregnancy overweight, obesity and gestational weight gain. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and pregnancy <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> partly explained these differences. Whether these differences also lead to ethnic differences in maternal and childhood outcomes should be further studied...|$|R

40|$|This {{study used}} Probit model to analyze factors {{influencing}} probability of household {{willingness to pay}} for non-marketed benefits (NBS) of cattle in Mozambique. The primary data from 184 agro-pastoralist households were collected using a structured questionnaire. Data collected comprised information relating to household demographic, household livelihoods and non-marketed benefits of cattle. The result showed that the probability of household willingness to pay (WTP) was influenced by both animal and household <b>related</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Animal <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> that had a significant influence on the probability of households WTP for NMB’s of cattle included: Animal age (ANAGE), herd size (HERDSIZE) and cattle breeds (INDBRED). Household <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> that had significant (p< 0. 05) influence on probability of household WTP for NMB’s of cattle, comprised: Dependant ratio (DEPRAT), household size (HHS), off-farm income (OFFINC) and distance to the market (DISTMK). As expected, however, the OFFINC had a negative influence on probability of household WTP for NMB’s of cattle. The study concluded that non-marketed benefits of cattle were highly valued among agro-pastoralist in Mabalane district and thus {{were willing to pay}} for them...|$|R

40|$|Disruptions in airline {{operations}} {{can result}} in infeasibilities in aircraft and passenger schedules. Airlines typically recover aircraft schedules and disruptions in passenger itineraries sequentially. However, passengers are severely affected by disruptions and recovery decisions. In this paper, we present a mathematical formulation for the integrated aircraft and passenger recovery problem that considers aircraft and <b>passenger</b> <b>related</b> costs simultaneously. Using the superimposition of aircraft and passenger itinerary networks, passengers are explicitly modeled {{in order to use}} realistic <b>passenger</b> <b>related</b> costs. In addition to the common routing recovery actions, we integrate several passenger recovery actions and cruise speed control in our solution approach. Cruise speed control is a very beneficial action for mitigating delays. On the other hand, it adds complexity to the problem due to the nonlinearity in fuel cost function. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. We show that the problem can be reformulated as conic quadratic mixed integer programming (CQMIP) problem which can be solved with commercial optimization software such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. Our computational experiments have shown that we could handle several simultaneous disruptions optimally on a four-hub network of a major U. S. airline within less than a minute on the average. We conclude that proposed approach is able to find optimal tradeoff between operating and passenger-related costs in real time. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the lifetime prevalence of teenage pregnancy in the histories of detained adolescent females and to examine the relationship between teenage pregnancy on the one hand and mental health and sexuality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> on the other. Methods Of 256 admitted detained adolescent females aged 12 – 18 years, a representative sample (N = 212, 83 %) was examined in the first month of detention. Instruments included a semi-structured interview, standardized questionnaires and file information on pregnancy, sexuality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> (sexual risk behavior, multiple sex partners, sexual trauma, lack of assertiveness in sexual issues and early maturity) and mental health characteristics (conduct disorder, alcohol and drug use disorder and suicidality). Results Approximately 20 % of the participants reported having been pregnant (before detention), although none had actually given birth. Sexuality <b>related</b> <b>characteristics</b> were more prevalent in the pregnancy group, while this was not so for the mental health characteristics. Age at assessment, early maturity, sexual risk behavior, and suicidality turned out to be the best predictors for pregnancy. Conclusion The lifetime prevalence of pregnancy in detained adolescent females is high and is associated with both sexuality related risk factors and mental health related risk factors. Therefore, prevention and intervention programs targeting sexual risk behavior and mental health are warranted during detention. </p...|$|R
