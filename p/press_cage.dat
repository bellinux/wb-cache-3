40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{pressing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used methods of separating oil from oil plants. Screw press is a typical oil extraction equipment adopting this method. In which the pressing chamber is a core component, and the <b>press</b> <b>cage,</b> as a main part of it, whose strength is a precondition to ensure normal operation of the screw press. Comparing with the complexity and drawbacks of traditional analyzing and checking methods, here, computer aided analysis was used to make stress analysis. A simplified 3 -D model of the <b>press</b> <b>cage</b> was built, and the finite analysis was conducted by ANSYS software. Then, the continuous deformation and stress distribution of the cage were obtained. The results can provide a good reference to the improvement and optimization of its structure design...|$|E
40|$|A {{screw press}} machine {{is used to}} {{compress}} the fruit mash between the main screw and the travelling cones to extract the palm oil. The position of the cones against the discharge end of the <b>press</b> <b>cage</b> determines the pressure. The pressure controller {{is an important factor}} in determining the oil loss and nut breakages. A conventional control system which is the band control system, uses a kilowatt meter as a controller in adjusting the <b>press</b> <b>cage</b> pressure. However, the screw press machine can be improved in order to reduce the oil loss and nut breakages. Not much researches has been conducted on reducing the nut breakages as well as oil loss. Therefore, the objective of this study is to minimise the oil loss and broken nuts. The objective can be achieved through upgrading the screw press machine and the use of fuzzy control system. During the course of this research project, the hydraulic system of the screw press machine was upgraded by utilising the proportional pressure relief valve. A current transducer was used to measure the motor current load. A ladder diagram program and fuzzy logic algorithm were written and downloaded into the programmable logic control to regulate the <b>press</b> <b>cage</b> pressure. For comparison purposes, a band control system and fuzzy control system were implemented in the control environment. The performances of both systems were compared in a number of tests. The first test was the oscillation of motor current load with the performance of fuzzy control system that was stabilised at 8. 33 mA. This is due to the reaction of fuzzy pressure controller in regulating the proportional pressure relief valve. The fuzzy control system is able to reduce 1. 20 % of oil loss compared to tiie band control system. The percentage of the broken nuts of the fuzzy control system was reduced by 3. 55 %. This implies that the objective to reduce the breakages is achieved. Thus, the screw press machine with a fuzzy control system is found to be significantly more efficient than the band control system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{small scale}} {{sugarcane}} juice extractor using a screw pressing system was designed, constructed and tested. Consideration {{was given to}} the techno-economic status of the micro and small scale sugarcane farmers and juice processors who are the intended users of the machine. The functional parts of the machine included grating unit, extraction unit, prime mover, pulley, transmission belts, bearings and frame. The machine was tested with two varieties of sugarcane each at three levels of moisture content and results showed that average grating efficiency and juice yield of 87. 8 % and 2. 5 % respectively were obtained. Powered by a 3 hp single-phase electric motor, the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs. A cottage sugarcane juice extraction plant based on this technology could provide employment {{and at the same time}} produce sugarcane juice and bagasse at low costs for sugar and biofuel industries. An improvement in the design, analysis and optimization of the worm shaft and <b>press</b> <b>cage</b> is expected to improve the juice yield and extraction efficiency; hence, this is highly recommended.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{on the effect of}} hydraulic press parameters such as <b>press</b> <b>cage</b> diameter (D) (80, 120, and 150 mm) and wall pore diameter (H) (4, 6, and 10 mm) and expression pressure (P) on crude palm oil yield. The oil yield was found to increase with increase in cage diameter from 80 to 120 mm, after which it decreased as the cage diameter was increased to 150 mm. The volumetric oil flow followed the same pattern. The oil yield and volumetric flow increased with increase in pore size from 4 to 6 mm and decreased as the pore size increases to 10 mm. Increase in pressure form 0. 5 to 1. 5 MPa was observed to increase oil yield. Statistical analysis of the effect of the processing factors on oil yield indicates that the effect of all the factors were significant at 99 %. It was observed that oil yield can be represented by the regression equation: Y= 27. 76 - 0. 07 D+ 0. 33 H+ 5. 82 P. The results of this study are useful in optimising the design of presses for palm oil extraction...|$|E

30|$|The {{two main}} {{mechanical}} expression methods were hydraulic pressing and windmill powered expression. Both {{were used to}} produce linseed oil for artists’ paints [28, 30, 31]. In the Netherlands and in Belgium extraction of linseed oil was chiefly done {{with the use of}} wind power until the 1900 s [32, 33]. Windmills were equipped with a ‘Kollergang’ (two edge runner stones rolling on the pan) that crushed the seeds, which were then wrapped in filter cloths and expressed with a wedge press. The hydraulic press was invented by Joseph Bramah in 1795; the expression outlet of his press was based on the traditional oil mill method with filter cloths. At the end of the 19 th century German companies produced hydraulic <b>cage</b> <b>presses,</b> with rams pressing the seeds inside of vertical slotted barrels that did not require filter cloths [29]. The hydraulic press developed during Carlyle’s MolArt-fellowship, is based on these clothless models but works horizontally instead of vertically.|$|R
5000|$|Southworth next {{moved to}} Strikeforce, where his first fight was against James [...] "The Sandman" [...] Irvin. The bout was {{declared}} a No-Contest after a mere 17 seconds when in a freak accident, Southworth and Irvin's clinch <b>pressed</b> against the <b>cage,</b> pushing open the cage door and causing Irvin {{to fall out}} of the ring. In his next fight, Southworth was given the opportunity to fight for Strikeforce's vacant light heavyweight championship against Vernon [...] "Tiger" [...] White. Southworth won a decision victory, taking White down repeatedly and controlling the pace of the match. Southworth's next fight was a non-title bout against Anthony Ruiz, a fight that Ruiz won by way of TKO (cut) in round 2. A rematch was set up, but this time it would be for Southworth's championship. In a rather slow-paced fight, Southworth defeated Ruiz via 5-round Unanimous Decision on June 27, 2008 and thus became the only man to successfully defend the championship.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gameplay}} in Sudden Impact is {{very similar}} to that of the previous entries in the series. Each fighter possess a fighting style that varies between Boxing, Karate, Kung-Fu, Kempo, Muay Thai, Ninjitsu, Sambo, Submission, Sumo, Pro Wrestling, Kickboxing, Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and more. Each of the four face buttons on the controller specifically controls one of the fighters limbs. By hitting two buttons at once, the player can perform a takedown, a grappling move, a submission move or other similar technique. An addition made to Sudden Impacts gameplay is an added focus on fence positioning. When backing an opponent into the cage that surrounds the Octagon ring, attempting a grapple maneuver will put the player into one of several different possible positions, including a standing face-off as well as a special ground-mount, where the bottom fighters head is literally <b>pressed</b> against the <b>cage.</b> The overall gameplay is also slightly faster in comparison to the previous games. Fights are announced by Bruce Buffer and refereed by [...] "Big" [...] John McCarthy.|$|R
40|$|Recommendations for {{the amount}} of cage space {{required}} for female mice with litters were first made in the 2011 Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. We hypothesized that if a difference in mouse behavior and reproduction exists within the limits of commercially available caging, this difference would be detected between the smallest and largest cages. C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl and Crl:CD 1 (Icr) breeding mice were randomly assigned to a cage treatment: LP 18790 (226 cm 2); A RC 1 (305 cm 2); A N 10 (432 cm 2); T 1291 (800 cm 2) and a breeding configuration: single (male removed after birth); pair (1 male + 1 female); or trio (1 male + 2 females) in a factorial design for 12 weeks. All cages received 8 - 10 g of nesting material and nests were scored weekly. Pups were weaned between post-natal day 18 and 26 and were weighed at weaning. Adult behavior and location in the cage were recorded by scan samples every 30 min over 48 hr of video recorded on PND 0 - 8 and PND 14 - 21 when pups were in the <b>cage.</b> <b>Press</b> posture and play behavior were recorded by 1 / 0 sampling method. Cage space did not significantly alter typical reproductive measures. Pups in the smallest cage played less than in the other cages. Adults in the smallest <b>cage</b> displayed more <b>press</b> posture than in the two largest cages. Mice in the largest cage spent more time under the feeder than {{in other areas of the}} cage. Nest score was also the highest in the largest cage. Housing breeding groups of mice in a range of commercially available cage sizes does not affect reproduction but behavioral measures suggest that the smallest cage tested, LP 18790, may be stressful for outbred mice when pups are present...|$|R
