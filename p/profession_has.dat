25|$|The role of hazzanim as a {{respected}} full-time <b>profession</b> <b>has</b> {{become a reality}} in recent centuries.

25|$|Van Helmont “had {{frequent}} visions {{throughout his}} life and laid great stress upon them.” His choice of a medical <b>profession</b> <b>has</b> been attributed to {{a conversation with the}} angel Raphael., and some of his writings described imagination as a celestial, and possibly magical, force. Though Van Helmont was skeptical of specific mystical theories and practices, he refused to discount magical forces as explanations for certain natural phenomena. This stance, reflected in a 1621 paper on sympathetic principles, may have contributed to his prosecution and subsequent house arrest.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} right of freedom of assembly, there has not {{traditionally}} been positive protection {{of the right of}} freedom of association. The common law has recognised the autonomy of organisations in deciding their membership and legislation has not placed any general controls on the exercise of the right of association. The right is generally reflected in the principle of freedom of contract and the relative ease by which companies and trusts can be set up. The right is most regulated in the area of labour relations including the right to join a trade union which achieved statutory recognition in the Industrial Relations Act 1971, the right not to be dismissed or refused employment on the basis of non-membership under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 and the right to claim unfair dismissal on the basis of trade union activity. However, there is no obligation on employers to recognise collective bargaining agreements except in certain very limited circumstances and their role has declined significantly. The right to strike was acknowledged {{for the first time in}} March 2011 by the Court of Appeal. The right not to be unjustly excluded from the exercise of a trade or <b>profession</b> <b>has</b> been recognised by the courts, in a case brought by female horse trainer Florence Nagle against the Jockey Club's refusal to grant her a training licence on grounds of her sex.|$|E

Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether you can achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." [...] In 2000, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers [...] The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that [...] "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass.".|$|E
