25|$|If the SDRAM is idle (all banks precharged, no {{commands}} in progress) when CKE is lowered, the SDRAM automatically enters <b>power-down</b> mode, consuming minimal power until CKE {{is raised}} again. This must not {{last longer than}} the maximum refresh interval tREF, or memory contents may be lost. It is legal to stop the clock entirely during this time for additional power savings.|$|E
25|$|Finally, if CKE {{is lowered}} {{at the same}} time as an auto-refresh command is sent to the SDRAM, the SDRAM enters self-refresh mode. This is like power down, but the SDRAM uses an on-chip timer to {{generate}} internal refresh cycles as necessary. The clock may be stopped during this time. While self-refresh mode consumes slightly more power than <b>power-down</b> mode, it allows the memory controller to be disabled entirely, which commonly more than makes up the difference.|$|E
2500|$|Intel Active Management Technology, part of Intel vPro, {{implements}} out-of-band management, giving administrators remote administration, remote management, {{and remote}} control of PCs with no {{involvement of the}} host processor or BIOS, even when the system is powered off. Remote administration includes remote power-up and <b>power-down,</b> remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, out-of-band policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second non-removable spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have [...] "the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G". Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.|$|E
50|$|A {{simple way}} of looking at it is a slogan adopted by self-advocates 'nothing about us, without us' , {{encouraging}} educators to co-teach with people who have lived experience of mental illness or distress.A key concept in this ontolology is the idea of saneism - a sixth structural oppression to go alongside those associated with race, gender, disability, age and class. It is also defined as Mentalism (discrimination) :“From where we stand , saneism is a devestating sic? form of oppression , often leading to negative stereotyping, discrimination, or arguments that Mad individuals are not fit for professional practice or , indeed, for life (Poole et al., 2012). According to Kalinowski and Risser (2005), saneeism also allows for a binary that separates people into a power-up group and a <b>power-down</b> group. The power-up group is assumed to be normal , healthy and capable. The <b>power-down</b> group is assumed to be sick,disabled,unreliable, and , possibly violent. This factional splitting ensures a lower standard of service for the <b>power-down</b> group and allows the power-up group to judge, reframe and belittle the <b>power-down</b> group in pathological terms”.|$|E
5000|$|Five new Assassin Missions were added; Guard Break, <b>Power-Down</b> Battle, Big Bang Anarchy, Shortcake Freaks and Crowded Train Carnage.|$|E
5000|$|AUP - Low-voltage - 0.8-3.6 V (3.3 V typically), TPD 15.6/8.2/4.3 ns at 1.2/1.8/3.3V, partial <b>power-down</b> {{specified}} (IOFF), inputs protected.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the command}} is a burst {{terminate}} (CA0-2 = HHL), the chip enters the deep <b>power-down</b> state. (A full reset sequence is required when leaving.) ...|$|E
50|$|The fourth subcommand {{places the}} chip in <b>power-down</b> mode. In this mode, it {{performs}} internal refresh and ignores the high-speed data lines. It must be woken up using the low-speed serial bus.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that the}} HPA feature can be hidden by DCO {{commands}} (documentation states {{only if the}} HPA is not in use), and can be [...] "frozen" [...] (until next <b>power-down</b> of the hard disk) or be password protected.|$|E
50|$|A common {{parasitic}} {{structure is}} that of an SCR. Once triggered, an SCR conducts {{for as long as}} there is a current, necessitating a complete <b>power-down</b> to reset the behavior of the device. This condition is known as latchup.|$|E
5000|$|LPDDR2 {{also has}} an active-low chip select (when high, {{everything}} is a NOP) and clock enable CKE signal, which operate like SDRAM. Also like SDRAM, the command sent on the cycle that CKE is first dropped selects the <b>power-down</b> state: ...|$|E
5000|$|On November 29, a {{drain line}} of a turbine control valve broke down, causing a loss and {{increasing}} the temperature inside its building. It was the 10th year (classified as Level 0). There was an unscheduled <b>power-down</b> of up to 20 percent.|$|E
50|$|Engagement {{can refer}} to {{automated}} or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment <b>power-down</b> processes, with or without human intervention.|$|E
50|$|DTV {{converter}} boxes {{could earn}} a United States Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star label if they consume {{no more than}} eight watts of electricity while operating, {{no more than one}} watt while in standby mode, and if they automatically <b>power-down</b> after four hours of inactivity.|$|E
50|$|CECBs must consume no {{more than}} an average of 2 watts of power when not in use (no video or audio display). They must provide an {{automatic}} <b>power-down</b> option that can put the unit in standby mode when it has not received any commands for a while.|$|E
50|$|Volatile {{memory has}} several uses - for example, as main memory. In {{addition}} to usually being faster than forms of mass storage {{such as a}} hard disk drive, volatility can protect sensitive information as it becomes unavailable on <b>power-down.</b> Most of the general-purpose random-access memory (RAM) is volatile.|$|E
50|$|Leica X1 uses an APS-C (23.6 mm × 15.8 mm) format CMOS sensor with 12.2 megapixels (4272 × 2856 pixels, 3:2 aspect ratio). Fixed 24 mm/2.8 prime lens, {{equivalent}} to 36 mm focal length for a 35 mm camera, contains 8 elements in 6 groups. The lens extends to working position on power-up and retracts on <b>power-down.</b>|$|E
50|$|If the SDRAM is idle (all banks precharged, no {{commands}} in progress) when CKE is lowered, the SDRAM automatically enters <b>power-down</b> mode, consuming minimal power until CKE {{is raised}} again. This must not {{last longer than}} the maximum refresh interval tREF, or memory contents may be lost. It is legal to stop the clock entirely during this time for additional power savings.|$|E
50|$|The Lorentz forces {{increase}} with B2. In large electromagnets the windings must be firmly clamped in place, to prevent motion on power-up and <b>power-down</b> from causing metal fatigue in the windings. In the Bitter design, below, used in very high field research magnets, the windings are constructed as flat disks {{to resist the}} radial forces, and clamped in an axial direction to resist the axial ones.|$|E
5000|$|In CMOS technology, {{there are}} a number of {{intrinsic}} bipolar junction transistors. In CMOS processes, these transistors can create problems when the combination of n-well/p-well and substrate results in the formation of parasitic n-p-n-p structures. Triggering these thyristor-like devices leads to a shorting of the Vdd and GND lines, usually resulting in destruction of the chip, or a system failure that can only be resolved by <b>power-down.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Oh!: Originally in MSX Parodius, {{this simply}} strips the player of all power-ups and sets {{movement}} speed to normal. The voiceover says [...] "Oh my god!" [...] upon collection of this <b>power-down.</b> This is also called [...] "!?" [...] in Parodius Da! -Shinwa kara Owarai e-. It is included to add {{risk to the}} roulette. In the ports of Jikkyo Oshaberi Parodius, it can be replaced with a roulette game instead.|$|E
5000|$|Active {{performance}} scaling: Unlike idle-power down, {{this approach}} allows {{work to be done}} in any state, all of which are considered active, but with different power/performance tradeoffs. Usually, slower modes consume less power. The problems unique to this approach are: (1) {{it is difficult to determine}} which combination of states is the most energy efficient for an application, and (2) the energy efficiency improvements are usually not as lucrative as those from idle <b>power-down</b> modes.|$|E
50|$|Finally, if CKE {{is lowered}} {{at the same}} time as an auto-refresh command is sent to the SDRAM, the SDRAM enters self-refresh mode. This is like power down, but the SDRAM uses an on-chip timer to {{generate}} internal refresh cycles as necessary. The clock may be stopped during this time. While self-refresh mode consumes slightly more power than <b>power-down</b> mode, it allows the memory controller to be disabled entirely, which commonly more than makes up the difference.|$|E
50|$|System administrators can use IPMI {{messaging}} {{to monitor}} platform status (such as system temperatures, voltages, fans, power supplies and chassis intrusion); to query inventory information; to review hardware logs of out-of-range conditions; or to perform recovery procedures such as issuing requests from a remote console {{through the same}} connections e.g. system <b>power-down</b> and rebooting, or configuring watchdog timers. The standard also defines an alerting mechanism for the system to send a {{simple network management protocol}} (SNMP) platform event trap (PET).|$|E
5000|$|HPA {{can be used}} {{by various}} booting and {{diagnostic}} utilities, normally in conjunction with the BIOS. An example of this implementation is the Phoenix FirstBIOS, which uses Boot Engineering Extension Record (BEER) and Protected Area Run Time Interface Extension Services (PARTIES). Another example is the Gujin installer which can install the bootloader in BEER, naming that pseudo-partition /dev/hda0 or /dev/sdb0; then only cold boots (from <b>power-down)</b> will succeed because warm boots (from Control-Alt-Delete) {{will not be able to}} read the HPA.|$|E
5000|$|Idle power-down: This {{technique}} exploits gaps in workload {{demand to}} shut off components that are idle. When shut down, components cannot do any useful work. The problems unique to this approach are: (1) it costs {{time and energy to}} transition between active and idle <b>power-down</b> states, (2) no work can be done in the off state, so power-up must be done to handle a request, and (3) predicting idle periods and adapting appropriately by choosing the right power state at any moment is difficult.|$|E
50|$|The Avalon Hill edition {{also changed}} the cards. The new Move cards have only an arrow {{in the corner}} instead of the number with the arrow, which {{means you have to}} look at the full face of the card to {{distinguish}} them. It also has larger counters. Character sheets were introduced to track damage, life counters, <b>power-down</b> status, and program cards. Each sheet also contains a copy of the turn sequence for reference. The graphics have been redesigned to make the functionality of board elements clearer. The rules were also simplified to remove the concept of virtual robots.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasitic}} {{structure is}} usually {{equivalent to a}} thyristor (or SCR), a PNPN structure which acts as a PNP and an NPN transistor stacked next to each other. During a latch-up {{when one of the}} transistors is conducting, the other one begins conducting too. They both keep each other in saturation {{for as long as the}} structure is forward-biased and some current flows through it - which usually means until a <b>power-down.</b> The SCR parasitic structure is formed as a part of the totem-pole PMOS and NMOS transistor pair on the output drivers of the gates.|$|E
50|$|This {{property}} {{can be used}} {{to circumvent}} security and recover data stored in the main memory that is assumed to be destroyed at <b>power-down.</b> The computer could be quickly rebooted, and the contents of the main memory read out; or by removing a computer's memory modules, cooling them to prolong data remanence, then transferring them to a different computer to be read out. Such an attack was demonstrated to circumvent popular disk encryption systems, such as the open source TrueCrypt, Microsoft's BitLocker Drive Encryption, and Apple's FileVault. This type of attack against a computer is often called a cold boot attack.|$|E
50|$|At <b>power-down</b> the MS {{requests}} a signaling channel.Once assigned, the MS sends an IMSI detach {{message to}} the VLR.When the VLR receives the IMSI detach-message, the corresponding IMSI is marked as detached by setting the IMSI detach flag. The HLR is not informed of this and the VLR does not acknowledge the MS about the IMSI detach.If the radio link quality is poor when IMSI detach occurs, the VLR may not properly receive the IMSI-detach request. Since an acknowledgment message is not sent to the MS, {{it does not make}} further attempts to send IMSI detach messages. Therefore, the GSM network considers the MS to be still attached.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that all}} of the above {{innovations}} for CPU power consumption preceded Barroso and Hölzle's paper on energy proportionality. However, most of them have contributed some combination of the two broad types of power management mentioned above, namely, idle <b>power-down</b> and active performance scaling. These innovations have made CPUs scale their power relatively well in relation to their utilization, making them the most energy-proportional of computer hardware components. Unlike CPUs, most other computer hardware components lack power management controls, especially those that enable active performance scaling. CPUs are touted as a good example of energy-proportional computer engineering that other components should strive to emulate.|$|E
5000|$|Holtek's design {{focus is}} {{in the area of}} {{microcontroller}} development. Holtek's 32-bit series are based around an ARM Cortex-M0+ and Cortex-M3 cores, and it is producing some 8051 based cores, but the majority of its 8-bit microcontrollers are based on its own self-designed core that is very similar to the Microchip PIC16 architecture. All have common features such as timers, external interrupts, <b>power-down</b> functions, low-voltage reset, bi-directional I/O pins etc. The range of microcontrollers support clock speeds from 32 kHz up to 20 MHz. Device specific features include functions such as EEPROM memory, A/D converters, LCD interfaces, USB interfaces, operational amplifiers. Some of Holtek's 8-bit microcontroller devices: ...|$|E
50|$|A unique {{application}} of a runtime environment (RTE) is within an operating system (OS) that only allows that RTE to run, meaning from boot until <b>power-down</b> the entire OS is dedicated to only the application(s) running within that RTE. Any other code that tries to run or any failures in the application(s) break the RTE which breaks the OS which stops all processing and requires a re-boot. If the boot is from read-only memory, an extremely secure, simple, single-mission system is created. For example, this {{an easy way to}} create a never-needs-patching, can-never-be-modified Internet of Things device. In this case, the IOT could not be used for other purposes (e.g. a botnet) but nor can it be patched to prevent exploiting vulnerabilities to force a reboot.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} HP calculators then and now, the HP-21 used RPN entry logic, with a four-level stack. It {{also had a}} single user-accessible memory register. As was normal at the time, memory was not {{preserved}} on <b>power-down.</b> A physical slider switch toggled between degrees and radians modes, which was an unusual feature. It had a 12-digit LED display, which was less than the 15 digits of the HP-35. Because of these fewer digits the HP-21 (and similar calculators such as the HP-25) could display 10-digit floating point numbers but only an 8-digit mantissa with a 2-digit exponent when scientific notation was used. A shift key provided access to functions whose legends were printed on the fronts of the tall trapezoidal keys.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with most}} HP calculators then and now, the HP-25 used RPN entry logic, with a four-level stack. It also had ten user-accessible memory registers. As was normal at the time, memory was not {{preserved}} on <b>power-down.</b> Its principal functions were (1) time value of money (TVM) calculations, where the user could enter any {{three of the}} variables and the fourth would be calculated, and (2) statistics calculations, including linear regression. Basic logarithmic and exponential functions were also provided. For TVM calculations, a physical slider switch labelled [...] "begin" [...] and [...] "end" [...] {{could be used to}} specify whether payments would be applied at the beginning or end of periods. It had a 12-digit LED display. A shift key provided access to functions whose legends were printed on the faceplate above the corresponding keys.|$|E
50|$|The 67.5 kg MS-1 {{communications}} satellite was {{shaped like a}} small rectangular box. Within the box, electronics consisted of two command receivers, two minitrack beacons, two telemetry transmitters, an S- and C-band beacon, and antennas; all powered by a 1500 watt-hour battery. Also attached was the fourth stage instrument package. The battery could power the electronics for 18½ hours before running down. To extend the satellite life, the equipment would be powered off by a ground command after the first three orbits (5 hours). During <b>power-down,</b> data results would be analyzed. The satellite would then be powered up for another three orbits (5 more hours). This process would then be repeated a third time. Mercury planners thought that by shutting down and powering up the satellite, the Mercury Tracking Network would get data and experience from the equivalent of three Mercury orbital missions.|$|E
