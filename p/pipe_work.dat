The organ was dismantled and shipped to the Philippines and revoiced and repaired while the cathedral was closed. The organ was provided with a new console and a new tracker action, while the original organ case was restored and extended. One no longer sees the asymmetrical facade, as all the <b>pipe</b> <b>work</b> was re-organized into the new case. The organ is also playable from a remote console located in the south transept, where the choir is now located. The cherubs and Saint Caecilia statue were not reinstalled after the restoration.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Thomas began courting Lucy Coleman, {{daughter}} of Pittsburgh iron manufacturing magnate William Coleman. Coleman provided Thomas with critical {{advice on how}} to improve the Union Iron Mills, and inside information on the coming railroad building boom. Another critical business relationship was with Piper & Shiffler (later known as the Keystone Bridge Company), an iron bridge building firm invested in by Andrew Carnegie in 1862. Andrew diverted much of Piper & Shiffler's contracts to the Union Iron Mills, further bolstering the company's profits. Tom often tried to rein in some of his brother's excesses, but to no avail. For example, in 1866 Andrew proposed purchasing a <b>pipe</b> <b>works</b> adjacent to the old Cyclops iron works. Thomas opposed the purchase, arguing that the time for expansion was not ripe and that the <b>pipe</b> <b>works</b> used a kind of iron which the Union Iron Mills did not produce. The <b>pipe</b> <b>works</b> {{turned out to be a}} white elephant, but they burned down shortly thereafter (saving the firm from further losses).|$|R
