40|$|The {{space flight}} {{community}} has been investigating lightweight composite materials for use in propellant tanks for both liquid and gaseous oxygen for space flight vehicles. The use of these materials presents some risks pertaining to ignition and burning hazards {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Through hazard analysis process, some <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been identified as being potentially credible. One of the <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanisms</b> was reciprocal friction; however, test data do not exist {{that could be used to}} clear or fail these types of materials as "oxygen compatible" for the reciprocal friction <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Therefore, testing was performed at White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) to provide data to evaluate this <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This paper presents the test system, approach, data results, and findings of the reciprocal friction testing performed on composite sample materials being considered for propellant tanks...|$|R

40|$|Under typical {{conditions}} of pulverized-coal combustion, which {{is characterized by}} fine particles heated at very high rates, there is currently a lack of certainty regarding the <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism</b> of bituminous and lower rank coals. It is unclear whether ignition occurs first at the particle-oxygen interface (heterogeneous ignition) or if it occurs in the gas phase due to ignition of the devolatilization products (homogeneous ignition). There have been no previous studies aimed at determining the dependence of the <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism</b> on variations in experimental conditions, such as particle size, oxygen concentration, and heating rate. There {{is a need to}} improve current mathematical models of ignition to realistically and accurately depict the particle-to-particle variations that exist within a coal sample to enable the extraction of useful reaction parameters from ignition studies, and to interpret ignition data in a more meaningful way. We examine fundamental aspects of coal ignition through experiments to determine the <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism</b> of various coals by direct observation, and modeling of the ignition process to derive rate constants to provide a more insightful interpretation of data from ignition experiments. The heating source will be a pulsed, carbon-dioxide laser in which both the pulse energy and pulse duration are independently variable, allowing {{for a wide range of}} heating rates and particle temperatures ï¿½ both of which are decoupled from each other and from the particle size. Laser-ignition experiments also offer the distinct advantage of easy optical access to the particles because of the absence of a furnace or radiating walls, and thus permit direct observation and particle temperature measurement. The <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism</b> of different coals under various experimental conditions can therefore be easily determined by direct observation with high-speed photography. The ignition rate-constants, when the ignition occurs heterogeneously, and the particle heating rates will both be determined from analyses based on direct, particle-temperature measurements using two-color pyrometry...|$|R

40|$|BAM furnace {{apparatus}} {{tests were}} conducted to investigate the minimum ignition temperature of coal dusts (MITC) in O 2 /CO 2 atmospheres with an O 2 mole fraction from 20 to 50 %. Three coal dusts: Indonesian Sebuku coal, Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and South African coal were tested. Experimental {{results showed that the}} dust explosion risk increases significantly with increasing O 2 mole fraction by reducing the minimum ignition temperature for the three tested coal dust clouds dramatically (even by 100 Â°C). Compared with conventional combustion, the inhibiting effect of CO 2 was found to be comparatively large in dust clouds, particularly for the coal dusts with high volatile content. The retardation effect of the moisture content on the ignition of dust clouds was also found to be pronounced. In addition, a modified steady-state mathematical model based on heterogeneous reaction was proposed to interpret the observed experimental phenomena and to estimate the <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism</b> of coal dust clouds under minimum ignition temperature conditions. The analysis revealed that heterogeneous ignition dominates the <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism</b> for sub-/bituminous coal dusts under minimum ignition temperature conditions, but the decrease of coal maturity facilitates homogeneous ignition.

40|$|Catalytic partial {{oxidation}} (CPO) {{has received}} considerable interest recently {{both as a}} way to utilize remote natural gas resources and to provide H 2 for a fuel cell. Studies on the reactions at lower temperatures and transient conditions were performed, which can provide insights on the mechanism of CPO at high reactions, particularly {{on the role of the}} chemical and physical state of the noble metal catalyst. In this work, ignition of methane CPO on Pt/Al 2 O 3 and Rh/Al 2 O 3 catalysts and methanol CPO on Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts were studied using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism</b> study of CH 4 on Pt/Al 2 O 3 showed that oxygen mainly covers the surface until ignition. Competition between the two reactants is assumed.

We carry out a physics-based analysis of general explosions scenarios for cryogenic gaseous H 2 /Ox mixtures and determine their realizability conditions, using the well-established simplified models from the detonation and deflagration theory. We study the features of aerosol H 2 /Ox mixture combustion and show, in particular, that aerosols intensify the deflagration flames and can induce detonation for any <b>ignition</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We propose a cavitation-induced mechanism of self-ignition of cryogenic H 2 /Ox mixtures that may be realized when gaseous H 2 and Ox flows are mixed with a liquid Ox turbulent stream, as occurred in all HOVI tests.
