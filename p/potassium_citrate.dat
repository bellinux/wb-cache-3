500|$|Long-term {{use of the}} {{ketogenic}} diet {{in children}} {{increases the risk of}} slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures and kidney stones. The diet reduces levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone. About 1 in 20 children on the ketogenic diet will develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (topiramate, zonisamide) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone. The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet. Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in a sevenfold decrease in the incidence of kidney stones.

40|$|Eight {{different}} poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) /salt aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS's) {{were characterized}} at 23 °C. PEGs with different molecular weights (1500 and 8000) were combined with different salts (sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>citrates</b> and formates) {{to study the}} effect of each ATPS constituent in the phase diagram. The binodal curve and several tie-lines were determined for each system using common analytical techniques described in the literature for ATPS's (cloud point method, conductivity, and gravimetric analysis after lyophilization). According to the results, {{it was found that}} each ATPS constituent produced a particular effect in the phase diagram. For the salts, changes in the anion produced larger variations in the heterogeneous region size than changes of the cation. Thus, the effect of salt type seems to be largely dependent on the anion, which makes the dominant contribution. The ability to form ATPS's is connected with the Gibbs energy of hydration, ΔG hyd, of the anions: more negative ΔG hyd values facilitate ATPS formation. Changes in the PEG molecular weight affected also the phase diagram: the size of the heterogeneous region increases with the increase in the polymer molecular weight.

50|$|There {{is no one}} food or {{nutrient}} {{capable of}} providing adequate bone health on its own. Instead, a balanced diet sufficient in fruits and vegetables for their vitamins, minerals, and alkalinizing substrates {{is thought to be}} most beneficial. High protein diets supply larger amounts of amino acids that could be degraded to acidic compounds. Protein consumption above the Recommended Dietary Allowance is also known to be beneficial to calcium utilization. Overall it is understood that high-protein diets have a net benefit for bone health because changes in IGF-I and PTH concentrations outweigh the negative effects of metabolic acid production. The source of protein, plant or animal, does not matter in terms of acid produced from amino acid metabolism. Any differences in Methionine and Cysteine content is not significant to affect the overall potential renal acid load (PRAL) of the food. In addition to their acid precursor protein content, plants also contain significant amounts of base precursors. Potassium bicarbonate, a basic salt, is produced via the metabolism of other organic <b>potassium</b> salts: <b>citrate,</b> malate, and gluconate, which are substantial in plants. The discrepancy observed in PRAL is accounted for by differences in base precursor content.|$|R

Each antimony forms the usual distorted pseudo-trigonal bipyramidal four-coordinate complex through the α-hydroxy carboxylate oxygens of two citrate residues. A feature of the structure is the presence of three differently charged citrate species (1 -, 2 -, 3 -), giving the formula {K[Sb(CHO) ][Sb(CJO) (CHO) ](HO) }.

40|$|Solutions of <b>potassium</b> dihydrogen <b>citrate,</b> KH 2 C 6 H 5 O 7, exhibit {{reference}} pH values {{close to}} those of the primary standard pH buffer solutions of tartrate and phthate. Nevertheless, as opposed to all other recommended primary buffer standards, the citrate reagent is not commercially available as a standard reference material (SRM). In this work, experiments have been performed on solid reagent from different sources, which revealed the presence of the various citrate species in variable amounts. This may arise from the sensitivity of the system to the purification strategy, owing to the proximity of the acidity constants of the triprotic citric acid, H 3 C 6 H 5 O 7. An experimental procedure has been developed which leads to a satisfactory preparation of the citrate reagent, to an extent that its solutions, independently of batch on supplier, exhibit reproducible pH values, in agreement with the conventionally assigned pH (S) = 3. 776 at 25 degreesC for 0. 05 m KH 2 C 6 H 5 O 7. Comparison of expected and experimental values is used as a quantitative test for the quality of reagent, eventually indicating the need for purification according to recommendations.
