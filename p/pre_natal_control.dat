Gender {{preference}} of young couples, their attitude towards <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> sex determination and awareness regarding related social issues {{plays an important role}} in de-termining their practice and needs to be studied. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional; community based descriptive study conducted in Lucknow district from August, 2012 to April, 2013. Couples were interviewed using a pre tested, semi structured questionnaire. Gender preference was assessed using the Coombs scale and attitude towards <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> sex determination was elicited with the help of a case study. Multi stage random sampling technique was adopted to select the couples. A total of 308 couples were interviewed. Results: Son preference was observed among 64. 6 % of the couples while 28. 1 % couples were in favour of <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> sex determination. Overall 72. 1 % couples were aware of unfavourable sex ratio in the country and 74. 7 % were aware of the harmful effects of declining sex ratio on the society. Majority (93. 2 %) knew that <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> sex determination is a crime but only 1. 6 % were aware of the punishment for the offence. Conclusion: The study clearly shows that son preference and <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> sex determination still finds favour with a substantial proportion of young couples and emphasises the need for proper counselling and behaviour change communication among them...|$|R

What motivates the various personalities who go on to create these schools is that they believe not much has changed since Hawthorne's time when one considers the harassment and gossip a pregnant teen may have to endure in a modern high school.

Considerada um momento importante para a vida da mulher, a gravidez sintetiza o encontro de sentimentos ambivalentes: medo, alegria e autoafirmação. Pela importância desse evento para a mulher, decidi refletir sobre a Consulta de Enfermagem no Pré-Natal como espaço que a gestante tem para expressar suas necessidades. Esse estudo tem como objetivo conhecer e analisar as representações sociais das gestantes atendidas no Pré-Natal do Centro de Saúde N. 11 de Brasília, sobre a Consulta de Enfermagem, com a finalidade de oferecer subsídios para melhorar a qualidade dessa assistência. Preliminarmente, procedi à caracterização do perfil da gestante atendida no Pré-Natal no ano de 2004, por meio dos Prontuários e/ou Fichas de Atendimentos. Foram {{realizadas}} entrevistas semi-estruturadas com 13 gestantes. Para sistematizar os dados, utilizei o software ALCESTE, com o intuito de conhecer o discurso coletivo e a identificação dos significados compartilhados por essas mulheres. Os resultados da análise lexical mostraram que as falas se organizaram em torno de três Eixos e seis Classes Temáticas, a saber: Eixo I - Vivenciando a gravidez: mostra elementos significativos acerca da experiência vivida pelas mulheres durante a gravidez, o que possibilita identificar e entender como elas perceberam que estavam grávidas, bem como as mudanças biológicas e emocionais experienciadas. Eixo II - Recebendo orientações sobre a gravidez: encontram-se, as representações apontadas pelas gestantes acerca da Consulta de Enfermagem no Pré-Natal, o que tem revelado a natureza do acolhimento à gestante, bem como as orientações dadas a esta, tanto para vivenciar bem o processo da gravidez, quanto para instruir-se sobre o planejamento familiar associado, principalmente aos métodos para o controle da gravidez. Eixo III - Cuidando do bebê: as gestantes, através de suas representações, revelam que os cuidados com o recém-nascido estão centrados no Modelo Biológico, nos princípios de higiene e de prevenção de doenças, para o seu crescimento e desenvolvimento, e o aleitamento materno, como uma prática importante para o bebê e a nutriz. Mesmo a Consulta de Enfermagem sendo representada como um espaço interativo e de acolhimento, faz-se necessário repensar o paradigma de uma consulta normativa, informativa e centrada no Modelo Biológico. Para tanto, deve ser enfocado, pelas enfermeiras, nas orientações à gestante sobre os cuidados com o pré-natal, o paradigma da integralidade. __________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTConsidered as {{an important}} moment of the woman´s life, the pregnancy sinthetizes the sum of ambivalent feelings: fear, cheerfulness and self fulfilment. Thinking {{about the importance of}} this event led me to reflect on the nursing attendance in <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> process as the space the pregnant women have to express their necessities. This study aims at learning and analyzing the social representations of pregnant women attended in “Centro de Saúde N. 11 ” of Brasilia, about the nursing attendance, with the objective of offering subsidies {{to improve the quality of}} the assistance. The work primarily developed was the characterization of the profile of the pregnant women attended in the <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> process of the year 2004, examining the attendance files. There were semi structured interviews with 13 pregnant women. In order to organize data, I applied the software ALCESTE, with the intention to learn from the collective speech and to identify the meaning shared by these women. The results of the lexical analyses showed that their speech were organized around three axes and six thematic classes which specifies: Axe I - living the pregnancy: shows the significative elements about the experience the women are living during their pregnancy, which makes possible to identify and understand how they notice they were pregnant as well as the biological and emotional changes. Axe II – Receiving orientations about the pregnancy: There are representations appointed by the pregnant women about the <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> nursing attendance which reveals the nature of the attendance to the pregnant, as well as the orientations given to them, wether to experience well the pregnancy process, as well as to reveal the care of the associated family planning mainly for the methods of pregnancy control. Axe III – taking care of the baby: the pregnant women, through their representations reveal that the care provided to the newly born is centered in the biological model, in the principles of higiene and prevention of the diseases, for the growth and development, and the breast feeding, {{as an important}} practice for the baby and the mother. Even when the nursing consultation represented as an interactive and welcoming space it is necessary to rethink the paradigm of normative attendance which is informative and centered in the Biological Model. In order to achieve this end, the nurses should reinforce the paradigm of integrality along with the orientations to the pregnant women concerning the care which involves the <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> process...|$|R

IUGR fetuses can be separated from Normal ones by parameters with high levels of significance. Moreover, collecting few of them allow obtaining classification models able to provide correct classification for more than 90 % fetuses. Results obtained from Normal and IUGR populations of fetuses show that i) the integration of linear and nonlinear parameters provide reliable indications about pathophysiologic fetal states; ii) could support early clinical diagnosis of fetal pathologies; iii) should be considered to design novel fetal monitoring systems...|$|R

It is second only to uveal melanoma in the frequency of occurrence of malignant intraocular tumors. Pawius described retinoblastoma as early as in 1597 referred to the tumor as fungus hematodes and suggested enucleation as the primary mode of management. The discovery of ophthalmoloscope in 1851 facilitated recognition of specific clinical features of retinoblastoma. Initially thought to be derived from the glial cells, it was called a glioma of the retina by Virchow (1864). Flexner (1891) and Wintersteiner (1897) believed it to be a neuroepithelioma {{because of the presence of}} rosettes. Later, there was a consensus that the tumor originated from the retinoblasts and the American Ophthalmological Society officially accepted the term retinoblastoma in 1926. Retinoblastoma was associated with near certain death just over a century ago. There has been a dramatic change in the overall management of retinoblastoma in the last decade. Specific genetic protocols have been able to make <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> diagnosis of retinoblastoma.

Materials and methods: The present research was a cross- sectional (descriptive, analytical) one. In this study, the amount of sampling was done by census in a way that all the case (372 cases) related to the year 2010. The questionnaire was prepared based on the information present in the files. In order to compare the quantitative and qualitative variables, two sample t - test and K sample t- test were used. Results: Out of 372 fetuses tested, 25. 5 % had major thalassemia, 48. 7 % minor thalassemia, 0. 8 % intermediate, 1. 3 % sickle cell, and 23. 7 % were healthy. All the cases diagnosed with thalassemia were introduced for abortion, and abortion was carried out. Major thalassemia was more prevalent in Lore tribes (32. 9 %), which was more in comparison to the members of others tribes. Conclusion: In order to prevent major thalassemia, it is important to identify the gene carriers and prevent their marriage. Nevertheless, in many places in the country, especially in the villages and rural areas, the couples do the experiment after they have already gotten emotionally involved and made the arrangements to get married; therefore they're unwilling to stop the marriage.

40|$|Apoptosis is {{the main}} cause of {{primordial}} germ cell and oocyte degeneration in the developing fetal ovary. In this study we examined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting the expression of the anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins Bcl- 2 and Bax in primordial germ cells and fetal oocytes during <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> oogenesis in the mouse embryo. While Bcl- 2 and Bax were not detectable in primordial germ cells in vivo, both proteins were upregulated when they undergo apoptosis in culture. Treatment with the stem cell factor (SCF), a growth factor known to partially reduce primordial germ cell apoptosis, resulted in decreased Bax expression. Bcl- 2 was barely detectable in oocytes entering into meiosis and its expression did not change during the stage of meiotic prophase I examined. On the contrary, high levels of Bax was expressed in degenerating oocytes while low levels of the protein was present in many apparently healthy oocytes between 15. 5 days post coitum (d. p. c.) and birth, when Bax was downregulated. Oocytes isolated from 15. 5 days post coitum (d. p. c.) ovaries that progress through prophase I and undergo a wave of apoptosis at the stage of pachytene/diplotene in vitro, showed a pattern of Bax expression similar to the in vivo condition. Although the addition of SCF to the culture medium reduced significantly apoptosis in oocytes at the pachytene/diplotene stages, {{it was not possible to}} directly correlate this effect with the downregulation of Bax in the surviving oocytes. These findings indicate that whereas a balance between Bcl- 2 and Bax might regulate apoptosis of proliferating primordial germ cells under a partial control by SCF, Bax-mediated apoptosis in meiotic oocytes may be due to intrinsic meiotic checkpoints which act to monitor aberrant DNA recombination rather than to a growth factor-dependent process. Elimination of supernumerary oocytes might be a subsequent apoptotic phenomenon controlled by the availability of growth factors such as SCF within the ovary...|$|R

40|$|The Australian Government {{and state}} and {{territory}} governments are reviewing the processes for setting child care standards in Australia. A comprehensive and integrated system of quality assurance for children’s services requires the administration of structural, process and contextual elements of service quality which, in turn, affect outcomes for children, families, service providers, and governments. National standards form a key structural element in the quality assurance agenda, illustrating the level of care that is assured to children in licensed services across Australia. This report presents findings from {{a review of the}} approach to setting standards and the quality processes surrounding certain child care services—long day care, family day care, outside school hours care and in-home care services. The development and implementation of acceptable standards in child care is a significant endeavour because the quality of care children receive affects their ongoing wellbeing and development—their health, socialisation and learning. Effective child care is also vital to adult workforce participation and smooth family functioning. Because of the scope and size of the Australian child care sector (providing care for 839000 children 1), together with the level of public investment (2. 4 billion in 2003 – 04), the standards and quality processes that are developed and administered by governments need to be robust. The importance of measures to require, encourage and support the provision of high-quality child care services is reflected in the communiqué released by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) on 10 February 2006 : High quality and integrated early childhood education and care services, encompassing the period from <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> up to and including the transition to the first years of school, are critical to increasing the proportion of children entering school with the basic skills for life and learning. COAG will give priority to improving early childhood development outcomes, {{as a part of a}} collaborative national approach (p. 4). Promoting children’s health, learning and wellbeing is a shared responsibility, requiring input and commitment from governments, families, professionals, service providers and the broader community. This project comprised three broad and interrelated areas of work which resulted in: • a review of the current approach to the setting of child care standards and the operation of related standards and quality assurance systems • some options for an agreed national approach to standards and quality assurance in children’s services that reflect contemporary evidence and support continuous improvement • a conceptual analysis of the costs and benefits of the identified options. 1 These data are drawn from the Productivity Commission. These are 24. 4 per cent of children aged 12 years or younger—the recipients of Australian, state and territory government funded and/or provided formal childcare in 2003 – 04 (see section 14. 7). While the number of children experiencing formal and informal care has remained similar over the past decade (1. 5 million aged birth– 11 years in both 1993 and 2002), the types of care received and the age of children cared for have changed. Parents have increasingly used formal child care over informal care and the proportion of younger children (birth–four years) spending time in non-parental care has increased.

40|$|Resumo: O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar um novo protocolo de assistência prénatal de baixo risco implantado no Hospital das Clínicas da UNICAMP em julho de 1996 em relação ao diagnóstico de estados patológicos (anemia, infecção urinária, sífilis, HIV, hepatite B, toxoplasmose, rubéola, vulvovaginite e {{diabetes}} gestacional). Foi realizado um estudo de coorte, retrospectivo, operacional, tipo ensaio clínico com abordagem antes e depois da introdução do novo protocolo. Foram estudadas 250 gestantes deste protocolo e 250 gestantes do protocolo anterior. Os critérios de inclusão foram: gestantes que ingressaram no pré-natal até no máximo com 28 semanas de gestação e realizaram pelo menos quatro consultas. As análises dos dados, para algumas variáveis, foram realizadas pelo teste exato de Fisher e regressão logística. Para outras variáveis, as análises foram apenas descritivas. O nível de significância preestabelecido foi de 5 %. Concluímos que o novo protocolo era composto de pacientes mais jovens, apresentou 10, 8 % e 29 % de anemia, respectivamente no primeiro e terceiro trimestres de gestação, permitiu maior número de diagnóstico de infecção urinária e menor de sífilis em relação ao antigo protocolo. O novo protocolo identificou 45 % e 25 % de gestantes suscetíveis à toxoplasmose e rubéola, respectivamente. Em relação ao diabetes gestacional, o novo protocolo diagnosticou 17, 4 % de glicemia de jejum alterada. Vinte e seis por cento das gestantes do novo protocolo apresentaram vulvovaginite confirmada por bacterioscopia de secreção vaginal no primeiro trimestre e 18 % no terceiro trimestre.;;Abstract:The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate a new protocol for pre-natal care of women with low risk pregnancies. The new protocol, which was used from July 1996 on in the general hospital of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), served to diagnose the following pathologic conditions: anemia, urinary infection, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, toxoplasmosis, rubella, vaginitis and gestational diabetes. The study was of a retrospective, operational, cohort nature, involving a clinical trial which assessed conditions before and after the introduction of the new protocol. 500 patients were studied, of which 250 had been evaluated with the new protocol and 250 with the protocol that had been in use previously. The criteria for inclusion in the study were that the patients should have started <b>pre</b> <b>natal</b> care until the 28 th gestational week and have had at least four medical evaluations. Data were analyzed with the help of Epi-Info statistical package, the Fisher’s exact test or logistic regression being used for some variables, other analyses being merely descriptive. The level of significance defined was 5 % (a= 5 %). The conclusion was that, in comparison with the old protocol, the new one allowed identification of the same number of cases of anemia, of a greater number of cases of urinary infection and of a lower number of cases of syphilis. The new protocol also allowed identification of cases of toxoplasmosis and rubella in, respectively, 45 % and 25 % of the patients. As to gestational diabetes, the new protocol allowed the identification of 17, 4 % cases of modified glycemy in patients under fasting. Twenty six percent of the pregnant women in the new protocol had vaginitis confirmed by vaginal smear at the first trimester and 18 % at the third one...|$|R
40|$|Following a {{workshop}} on infant feeding {{held at the}} Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Aberdeen on March 17, 2010 experts were invited to exchange ideas and to review evidence on both <b>pre</b> and post <b>natal</b> dietary environments in shaping children's eating habits. A central theme during the workshop {{was the idea of}} “sensitive periods” during infancy for learning about foods and a particular focus was developed around acceptance and intake of fruits and vegetables. Presentations covered the guidelines provided by various governments on how to feed infants during weaning; the importance of the in utero experience; the impact of varying the sensory experience at weaning; the effect of parenting styles and practices on children's eating habits; the use of visual experience in promoting intake of vegetables; and reports from mothers regarding their decisions about weaning and the introduction of vegetables. This collection of papers seeks to review guidance from governments on feeding infants and to consider current evidence on parental feeding practices with the aim of enhancing insight into best practice in establishing healthy eating in children...|$|R
50|$|The {{new version}} of the medal was instituted in 1880 to {{recognise}} service in a number of campaigns over the preceding three years to bring the eastern area of the Cape of Good Hope and northern <b>Natal</b> under British <b>control,</b> which effectively meant the pacification by force of the unruly local tribes. The medal could be awarded to all personnel, British regular forces, Colonial Volunteers and native levies included, who had served in any of the campaigns in South Africa between September 1877 and December 1879. The military operations during this period were a series of separate campaigns against specific tribes and the unrest would eventually culminate in the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. Hence, the medal {{is often referred to as}} the Zulu War Medal.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: As preterm {{birth and}} {{survival}} rates continue to rise, circulatory failure remains a {{leading cause of}} mortality and morbidity. Structural and functional variations in circulatory physiology within the preterm population have been described, secondary to <b>pre</b> and post <b>natal</b> factors. This study applied magnetic resonance imaging techniques to assess cardiac function; analysed suitable techniques for indexing functional parameters by body size and applied a novel method of body composition quantification to investigate the impact of varying growth patterns on cardiac measures. Methods: Steady state free precession MRI imaging was used to analyse cardiac function in 78 preterm neonates. Analysis techniques were validated by comparison to phase contrast measures in 40 infants. Current methods of indexing for body size were compared. A modified DIXON whole body MRI scan utilising chemical shift was validated in phantoms and in vivo and successfully applied to 20 infants to assess adipose tissue content. Results: Validation of acquisition and analysis techniques demonstrated an acceptable level of accuracy. Functional measures indexed by body weight generally decreased with increasing corrected gestational age but patterns were altered when indexed by body surface area. Allometric transformation did not significantly improve correlation between size and function. Full body MDIXON scans demonstrated variations in body fat percentage of between 15 and 25...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} study of members of 265 nuclear families, aged six or more. This study is based of family heredograms, and {{takes into account the}} {{clinical}} form ofschistosomiasis observed before treatment with oxamniquine. The probability of occurrence of two or more cases ofhepatosplenomegaly is low, notwithstanding {{the fact that it was}} observed in 38 families. Even less frequent is the occurrence of three or more cases observed in 17 families (P= 0. 002). The concentration of the hepatosplenic form was higher among siblings than it was among mothers and children, or fathers and children. It was found to be not significant between husband (father) and wife (mother). These observations reinforce the evidence for the presence of a genetic component in susceptibility to the hepatosplenic form of the disease. In cases in which the mother was hepatosplenic there was a higher incidence of hepatosplenic children; the relative risk was a least five times higher than in those in which the father was the affected member (the maternal effect). In cases where both members were affected by the hepatointestinal form, the risk to the filial generation was similar to that of the population in general. Thus, in the process towards severe forms of Schistosomiasis mansoni, <b>pre</b> and post <b>natal</b> factors might be involved...|$|R
