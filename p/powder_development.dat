Powder particles and microstructure grains vary {{from a few}} nanometres to hundreds of micrometres. It is therefore necessary to combine different methods of analysis. In the granule and particle size analysis, laser diffraction, sieve analysis, image analysis and the BET method are used. Both the macrostructure and microstructure of the thermal spray coating and composite powder granules are investigated including computer analysis. As a result, a numerical database was obtained that permits to compare the characteristics of different coatings and to analyse {{the resistance of the}} coatings to the abrasive wear...|$|E
40|$|Two {{programs}} {{have been developed to}} compute the dimensional and property changes that occur with repetitive impacts during the mechanical alloying process. The more sophisticated of the programs also maintains a running count of the fractions of particles present and from this calculates a population distribution. The programs predict powder particle size and shape changes in accord with the accepted stages of <b>powder</b> <b>development</b> during mechanical alloying of ductile species. They also predict hardness and lamellar thickness changes with processing, again with reasonable agreement with experimental results. These predictions offer support of the model (and thereby give insight into the possible 'actual' happenings of mechanical alloying) and hence allow refinement and calibration of the myriad aspects of the model. They also provide a vehicle for establishing control over the dimensions and properties of the output powders used for consolidation, thereby facilitating optimization of the consolidation process...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} cycle of a Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) material incorporates many aspects {{that must be}} fulfilled {{before it can be}} satisfactory processed. Among these properties the polymer flowing behavior in its powder state is of primary importance. A lack of a suitable powder spreading quality during SLS processing leads to inhomogeneity of part density and reduced mechanical properties. However, none of the available powder characterization methods attempts to simulate the powder flowability at effective SLS processing temperatures. Therefore this investigation characterizes the powder flowing dynamics at higher temperature for commercially available materials and research powders. A measuring system with a rotating drum emulates the stress state of the material during the SLS deposition. New insights regarding the spreading conditions are presented, particularly above the glass transition point were the viscous part of the polymer becomes more relevant. In particular the dynamic avalanche angle, volume expansion ratio and surface fractal distributions represent suitable parameters to characterize the different powders in terms of the flowing behavior and its correlation to the final sintered density. This system is proposed as a SLS quality control and screening tool during the early stages of <b>powder</b> <b>development...</b>|$|E

The parameters of RAW MATERIAL SELECTION and their uses in pressed powders are studied, and prop-erties imparted to the face and eyes are briefly indicated. Representative FORMULATIONS, and MANUFACTURING and PRESSING TECHNIQUES encompassing modern compact face powder, blusher. eyeliner, eyebrow, eyeshadow, and rouge are detailed. This paper briefly covers quality control, equipment requirements, manufacturing problems, fashions, and trends in pressed <b>powder</b> <b>developments.</b> INTROI) UCTION It was not until after World War I that the first pressed powder appeared on the market. The compact was a sixnple face powder molded into a pressed form by the addition of about 20 % of plaster of Paris. The resultant product was very rough in texture and difficult to use. It required a lot of rubbing in order to remove sufficient powder for application (1, 2). Later improvements included the use of various gum binding agents. Most compacts, however, turned out either too hard or too soft. The next major advance in pressed powder technology occurred in the early 1930 's when a facsimile of modern compact powder was prepared using petrolatum, ammonia, starch, and stearic acid as the binding agents (3). The first patents for cake make-up (4 - 6) wer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As {{a result}} of testing {{the large number of}} organic liquids, it was {{established}} that benzyl alcohol is the most suitable medium for the reduction of nickel compounds. This is a monohydric aromatic alcohol; its composition is described by formula С 6 H 5 −CH 2 −CH 2 OH. Benzyl alcohol has not very high boiling point (205 °C), the catalytic activity of nickel is low under these conditions, so the negative consequences of dehydrogenation become noticeable only if the process duration is tens hours. At the same time, the reducing potential of benzyl alcohol turned out to be rather high. In application of nickel carboxylates, the time of complete reduction did not exceed 3 - 4 hours, which allowed us to obtain high-purity nickel <b>powders.</b> Further <b>development</b> of the investigation showed that benzyl alcohol can be successfully used also to reduce the salts of other metals: copper, bismuth, silver, cobalt...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of latent fingerprint development techniques is {{heavily influenced by}} the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the deposition surface. The use of powder suspensions is increasing for development of prints on a range of surfaces. We demonstrate that carbon <b>powder</b> suspension <b>development</b> on polymers is detrimentally affected by the presence of common white pigment, titanium dioxide. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that patches of the compound are clearly associated with increased levels of powder adhesion. Substrates with nonlocalized titanium dioxide content also exhibit increased levels of carbon powder staining on a surface-wide basis. Secondary ion mass spectrometry and complementary techniques demonstrate the importance of levels of the pigment within the top 30 nm. The association is independent of fingermark deposition and may be related to surface energy variation. The detrimental effect of the pigment is not observed with small-particle reagent (MoS 2 SPR) or cyanoacrylate (superglue) fuming techniques that exploit different development mechanisms...|$|R

The deformation during milling reduces the grain size of the alloys to 6 - 20 nm. The final grain size of the powders depends on {{the composition of the}} material.

40|$|Summary. Statement of the problem. In recent years, {{products}} {{based on}} gypsum binding materials is widespread, as their application allows {{to increase the}} productivity and quality of work. However, their production is constrained by lack of efficient dry additives. Domestic additives for adjusting the properties of gypsum binders are mainly in the liquid state. The use of imported additives increases the cost of products. One {{of the ways to}} obtain the dry additive is the use of polyvinyl acetate dispersion, which is widely used in liquid form to adjust the properties of cementations materials. But by the reworking to the dry condition the dispersion is aggregated. Furthermore, the additive does not have the required functional properties. The main problem of the production of dispersible polymer <b>powders</b> is <b>development</b> of the mechanism of their dispersion and film formation, and selection of regulators. So the stabilizers in the system prevent the coagulation of the emulsion (dispersion). Protective colloid provides obtaining of the dispersion powder, then is able to disperse in the water.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{progress made}} during fiscal year 2007 {{in studies of}} converting the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) from highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel to low enriched uranium fuel (LEU). Conversion from HEU to LEU will require a change in fuel form from uranium oxide to a uranium-molybdenum alloy. A high volume fraction U/Mo-in-Al fuel could attain the same neutron flux performance as with the current, HEU fuel but materials considerations appear to preclude production and irradiation of such a fuel. A diffusion barrier would be required if Al is to be retained as the interstitial medium and the additional volume required for this barrier would degrade performance. Attaining the high volume fraction (55 wt. %) of U/Mo assumed in the computational study while maintaining the current fuel plate acceptance level at the fuel manufacturer is unlikely, i. e. no increase {{in the percentage of}} plates rejected for non-compliance with the fuel specification. Substitution of a zirconium alloy for Al would significantly increase the weight of the fuel element, the cost of the fuel element, and introduce an as-yet untried manufacturing process. A monolithic U- 10 Mo foil is the choice of LEU fuel for HFIR. Preliminary calculations indicate that with a modest increase in reactor power, the flux performance of the reactor can be maintained at the current level. A linearly-graded, radial fuel thickness profile is preferred to the arched profile currently used in HEU fuel because the LEU fuel media is a metal alloy foil rather than a <b>powder.</b> <b>Developments</b> in analysis capability and nuclear data processing techniques are underway with the goal of verifying the preliminary calculations of LEU flux performance. A conceptual study of the operational cost of an LEU fuel fabrication facility yielded the conclusion that the annual fuel cost to the HFIR would increase significantly from the current, HEU fuel cycle. Though manufacturing can be accomplished with existing technology, several engineering proof-of-principle tests would be required. The RERTR program is currently conducting a series of generic fuel qualification tests at the Advanced Test Reactor. A review of these tests and a review of the safety basis for the current, HEU fuel cycle led to the identification of a set of HFIR-specific fuel qualification tests. Much additional study is required to formulate a HFIR-specific fuel qualification plan from this set. However, one such test - creating a graded fuel profile across a flat foil - has been initiated with promising results...|$|R

Carrier retention and de-agglomeration results obtained with a basic classifier concept are discussed. The theoretical cut-off diameter for lactose of the classifier used, is between 35 and 15 μm for flow rates ranging from 20 to 70 l/min. Carrier retention of narrow size fractions is higher than 80 % for flow rates between 30 and 60 l/min, inhalation times up to 6 s and classifier payloads between 0 and 30 mg. The de-agglomeration efficiency for adhesive mixtures, derived from carrier residue (CR) measurement, increases both with increasing flow rate and inhalation time. At 30 l/min, 60 % fine particle detachment can be obtained within 3 s circulation time, whereas at 60 l/min only 0. 5 s is necessary to release more than 70 %. More detailed information of the change of detachment rate within the first 0. 5 s of inhalation is obtained from laser diffraction analysis (LDA) of the aerosol cloud. The experimental results can be explained with a novel force distribution concept (FDC) which is introduced {{to better understand the}} complex effects of mixing and inhalation parameters on the size distributions of adhesion and removal forces and their relevance to the de-agglomeration in the classifier. © 2003 Elsevier B.
