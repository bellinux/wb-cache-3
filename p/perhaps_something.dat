5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if <b>perhaps</b> <b>something</b> was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{starboard}} engine ran normally {{after it was}} decoupled from the reduction gear, a likely reason for the sudden drop of engine speed from 1,000 to 270 rpm and subsequent stalling when reconnected was increased load in the propulsion system due to damaged shaft bearing or a foreign object, <b>perhaps</b> <b>something</b> that had fallen from the deck, wedged in the propeller duct, although malfunction in the fuel supply and lubrication system due to the violent pitching of the vessel were not ruled out.|$|E
25|$|There was however {{one huge}} {{improvement}} created by Wyatt – the cloisters. This two-storeyed gallery {{which was built}} around all four sides of the inner courtyard, provided the house with not only the much needed corridors to link the rooms, but also a magnificent gallery to display the Pembroke collection of classical sculpture. Wyatt died before completion, but not before he and Lord Pembroke had quarrelled over the designs and building work. The final touches were executed by Wyatt's nephew Sir Jeffry Wyatville. Today nearly two hundred years later Wyatt's improvements do not jar the senses {{as much as they}} did those of the great architectural commentators James Lees-Milne and Sir Sacheverell Sitwell writing in the 1960s. That Wyatt's works are not in the same league of style as the south front, and the Tudor tower, is <b>perhaps</b> <b>something</b> for future generations to judge.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to ascertain {{the nature and extent}} of coin-use in Anglo-Saxon England. Written references to minting and money are scarce, and it is likely that even a single silver penny had considerable buying power – <b>perhaps</b> <b>something</b> in the region of £10–£30 in modern currency. Their use may also have been concentrated in certain classes of society, and was probably most associated with particular transactions such as the payment of rents, tributes and legal fees. However, analysis of surviving single-finds (principally made since the 1970s by users of metal-detectors) shows that coins were used extensively, especially in the eastern half of England, both within and outside towns; they also circulated widely, and are frequently found far from their mint of origin. Substantial numbers of English coins have been found elsewhere in Europe, especially in Italy and Scandinavia, while English designs were influential on the emergent coinages of Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Bohemia.|$|E
500|$|At {{least two}} schools of {{researchers}} {{have proposed that}} dromaeosaurids may actually be descended from flying ancestors. Hypotheses involving a flying ancestor for dromaeosaurids are sometimes called [...] "Birds Came First” (BCF). George Olshevsky is usually credited as the first author of BCF. In his own work, Gregory S. Paul pointed out numerous features of the dromaeosaurid skeleton that he interpreted {{as evidence that the}} entire group had evolved from flying, dinosaurian, ancestors, <b>perhaps</b> <b>something</b> like Archaeopteryx. In that case, the larger dromaeosaurids were secondarily flightless, like the modern ostrich. In 1988, Paul suggested that dromaeosaurids may actually be more closely related to modern birds than to Archaeopteryx. By 2002, however, Paul placed dromaeosaurids and Archaeopteryx as the closest relatives to one another.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} of short vowels in unstressed syllables {{is a little}} complicated. All short vowels may appear in absolutely final position (at {{the very end of}} a word) after both broad and slender consonants. The front vowels [...] and [...] are often spelled ae and ai after broad consonants, which might indicate a retracted pronunciation here, <b>perhaps</b> <b>something</b> like [...] and [...] All ten possibilities are shown in the following examples: ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{very little}} {{information}} in the open literature about the mechanism of the interstage. Its first mention in a U.S. government document formally {{released to the public}} appears to be a caption in a recent graphic promoting the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program. If built, this new design would replace [...] "toxic, brittle material" [...] and [...] "expensive 'special' material" [...] in the interstage. This statement suggests the interstage may contain beryllium to moderate the flux of neutrons from the primary, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>something</b> to absorb and re-radiate the x-rays in a particular manner. There is also some speculation that this interstage material, which may be code-named FOGBANK, might be an aerogel, possibly doped with beryllium and/or other substances.|$|E
