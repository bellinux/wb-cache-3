The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the Federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.|$|E

5000|$|... "Zone skipping" [...] {{is the use}} of LTL {{carriers}} to transport <b>parcels</b> to a <b>parcel</b> carrier's hub near the load's final destination instead of relying on the <b>parcel</b> carrier for end-to-end delivery. The term [...] "zone skipping" [...] refers to the LTL carrier bypassing the <b>parcel</b> carrier's traditional [...] "zones", which allows the shipper to avoid charges incurred by the <b>parcels</b> crossing multiple zones en route from the shipper to the final destination. For example, if a shipper in North Carolina has 500 <b>parcels</b> bound for California, 250 bound for New York, and 250 bound for Indiana, the shipper will segregate the <b>parcels</b> by their destination, combine the segregated <b>parcels</b> into loads, and use LTL {{carriers to}} transport the loads to the <b>parcel</b> carrier's hubs in that state or region; the <b>parcel</b> carrier will then unpack the load that was delivered and transport the individual <b>parcels</b> to their final destinations. This method can allow for substantial savings, particularly if the <b>parcels</b> would have to cross multiple <b>parcel</b> carrier zones if transported by the <b>parcel</b> carrier from end-to-end, and also reduces the possibility of loss on the <b>parcel</b> carrier's part (since all <b>parcels</b> for a destination will arrive at the hub at the same time).|$|R

2500|$|Over the 20th century, trusts {{came to be}} {{used for}} {{multiple}} purposes beyond the classical role of <b>parcelling</b> out wealthy families' estates, wills, or charities. First, as more working-class people became more affluent, they began to be able to save for retirement through occupational pensions. After the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, everyone who worked and paid National Insurance would probably have access to the minimal state pension, but if people wanted to maintain their living standards, they would need more. Occupational pensions would typically be constituted through a trust deed, after being bargained for by a trade union under a collective agreement. After World War Two, the number of people with occupational pensions rose further, and gradually regulation was introduced to ensure that people's [...] "pension promise" [...] was protected. The settlor would usually be the employer and employee jointly, and the savings would be transferred to a trustee {{for the benefit of the}} employee. Most regulation, especially after the Robert Maxwell scandals and the Goode Report, was directed at ensuring that the employer cannot dominate, or abuse its position through undue influence over the trustee or the trust fund. The second main use of the trust came to be in other financial investments, though not necessarily for retirement. The unit trust, since their launch in 1931, became a popular vehicle for holding [...] "units" [...] in a fund that would invest in various assets, such as company shares, gilts or government bonds or corporate bonds. One person investing alone might not have much money to spread the risk of his or her investments, and so the unit trust offered an attractive way to pool many investors wealth, and share the profits (or losses). Nowadays, unit trusts have been mostly superseded by Open-ended investment companies, which do much the same thing, but are companies selling shares, rather than trusts. Nevertheless, trusts are widely used, and notorious in offshore trusts in [...] "tax havens", where people hire an accountant or lawyer to make an argument that shifting assets in some new way will avoid tax. The third main contemporary use of the trust has been in the family home, though not as an expressly declared trust. As gender inequality began to narrow, both partners to a marriage would often be contributing money, or work, to pay the mortgage, make their home, or raise children together. A number of members of the judiciary became active from the late 1960s in declaring that even if one partner was not on the legal title deeds, she or he would still have an equitable property interest in the home under a [...] "resulting trust" [...] or (more normally today) a [...] "constructive trust". In essence the courts would acknowledge the existence of a property right, without the trust being expressly declared. Some courts said it reflected an implicit common intention, while others said the use of the trust reflected the need to do justice. In this way, trusts continued to fulfill their historical function of mitigating strict legal rules in the interests of equity.|$|E
5000|$|Since in most California {{communities}} {{the vast}} majority of taxable <b>parcels</b> are single-family residential, the statutory uniformity requirement results in most of the tax burden for a <b>parcel</b> tax falling on single-family residential property owners.

[...] As another example, in Santa Clara County about 88% of the taxable <b>parcels</b> are single-family residential <b>parcels</b> (including condominiums). It is for this reason local business communities are often supportive of <b>parcel</b> taxes because the tax burden on commercial <b>parcels,</b> especially large commercial <b>parcels,</b> is very low. Business interest groups in California such as the Bay Area Council, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce frequently support <b>parcel</b> taxes that disproportionately burden single-family residential <b>parcels.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Parcels</b> without road {{frontage}} {{are produced}} by subdividing larger <b>parcels</b> of land before the land planning and Building Act was established. <b>Parcels</b> without road frontage are neglected in real estate investment and urban development causing their deterioration and isolation in the city. <b>Parcels</b> without road frontage can be discovered in dense residential districts which were informally developed. Sometimes, an easement agreement is established for a new construction. However, validity of the easement could be changed pending upon the land ownership. Therefore it makes the development of <b>parcels</b> without road frontage unstable and unsustainable. In this paper, through case study of <b>parcels</b> without road frontage of Changsin Sungin District in Seoul, <b>parcels</b> without road frontage are categorized to examine their conditions and problems. This analysis allows evaluation of development possibilities of <b>parcels</b> without road frontage based on information of land owners, adjacent lot conditions, and physical situations of existing buildings to lead the development of <b>parcels</b> without road frontage. By considering such an information, if we induce adequate development of <b>parcels</b> without road frontage in Seoul, it would contribute to regeneration of the <b>parcel,</b> the block and the neighborhood, enhancing the value of <b>parcel</b> and driving the sustainable urban transformation...|$|R
