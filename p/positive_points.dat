25|$|A Moment on the Earth {{proved to}} be very controversial, {{especially}} among environmentalists. Easterbrook was accused of mischaracterizing data concerning environmental health, using faulty logic, and being overly optimistic.

25|$|In {{spite of}} its <b>positive</b> <b>points,</b> the MK 23's large size and weight have {{resulted}} in some criticism. The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{part of the}} {{strategy}} {{of the game is}} to begin by selecting a relatively powerful button. However, buttons may be stronger or weaker when playing against other buttons with certain characteristics. For example, a button with small Poison dice might be powerful in general because it has fewer dice worth <b>positive</b> <b>points</b> for its opponent to capture. However, a button with large Shadow dice might be powerful against that button specifically because it can allow the round to end with the Poison and Shadow dice unable to capture each other, and therefore still counted towards their owners' scores.|$|E
25|$|Since the physicist's {{concept of}} force has a {{direction}} and a magnitude, {{it may be}} seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force F of 15 newtons. If the positive axis is also directed rightward, then F is represented by the vector 15 N, and if <b>positive</b> <b>points</b> leftward, then the vector for F is −15 N. In either case, the magnitude of the vector is 15 N. Likewise, the vector representation of a displacement Δs of 4 meters would be 4 m or −4 m, depending on its direction, and its magnitude would be 4 m regardless.|$|E
25|$|Royal Challengers Bangalore {{started their}} {{season with a}} blitz from AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli against SRH at Bengaluru, to comfortably win their first match. A bludgeoning century from Quinton de Kock meant RCB lost their second match of the season. Their form {{deteriorated}} in the coming matches, winning only one match of the next five. Although, Virat Kohli and AB de Villier's brilliant form, along {{with the emergence of}} KL Rahul as an important member of RCB's batting, were <b>positive</b> <b>points.</b> Royal Challengers needed to win at least 6 of their next seven matches to have a chance at qualifying for the playoffs. They won matches against KXIP and Rising Pune Supergiant, the new entrant in the tournament. But a loss against Mumbai Indians meant they needed 4 wins in 4 matches to qualify. Since then, Virat Kohli found himself in sublime form, with captaincy and the bat. RCB most notably defeated the Gujarat Lions by 144 runs, the highest margin in IPL history, during this 4 match winning streak. Through other match results, RCB ended at an unlikely second position {{at the end of the}} league stage. Virat Kohli dominated the run-scoring list, while Shane Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal collectively topped the wicket taking list at the end of the league stage. They faced the Gujarat Lions in the Qualifier 1 at their home ground, the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. They won by 4 wickets to make it to their third final in nine seasons. They played the final against SRH, again in Bengaluru. RCB lost a hard fought match by 8 runs, to end as runners up in this ninth season of the IPL. This is the third instance of RCB losing the finals in the IPL.|$|E

[...] Robinson was equally damning {{of the changes in}} the production crew, observing that Ken Adam, an [...] "attraction of the early Bond films," [...] had been [...] "replaced by decorators of competence but little of his flair." [...] The writers [...] "get progressively more naive in their creation of a suburban dream of epicureanism and adventure." [...] Writing for The New York Times, Nora Sayre considered the film to suffer from [...] "poverty of invention and excitement", criticising the writing and Moore's performance and finding Villechaize and Lee as the only <b>positive</b> <b>points</b> for their [...] "sinister vitality that cuts through the narrative dough." ...|$|E

[...] The games' Wi-Fi connectivity also earned largely positive reviews. 1UP.com called the addition of wireless connectivity the games' [...] "biggest improvements". GameSpot and GameSpy both listed the addition of online play as one of the <b>positive</b> <b>points</b> of the games and called the system [...] "robust" [...] and [...] "probably the most significant new feature."

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and grade it a C+. Handlen criticized the episode's lack of resolution, noting that [...] "The show can feed our social {{paranoia}} [...] {{but when it}} comes time to deliver on all this, to finally pull back the curtain and move on to the next stage, it fumbles things." [...] Furthermore, he called the Mulder/Scully/Fowley love triangle [...] "immediately off-putting" [...] and criticized Mimi Rogers's characterization. However, Handlen did call The Smoking Man's return [...] "thrilling" [...] and wrote that the burning of Mulder's office was [...] "arguably one of the most iconic visuals in the run of the series". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two criticized the closing down of the X-Files division, due largely to the fact that [...] "we've seen [...] before", a reference to the divisions's closing at the conclusion of the show's first season. However, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'The End' works in spite of itself", citing the arrival of Diana Fowley and the confrontation between The Smoking Man and Jeffrey Spender as <b>positive</b> <b>points</b> in the episode.|$|E

Anime News Network writer Carlo Santos praised the animation while awarding the film a [...] "B", calling it [...] "outstanding", and About.com's Roger Altizer, while giving the film overall 2 {{and a half stars}} out of 5, cited the visuals as one of its few <b>positive</b> <b>points.</b> The film's plot was generally criticized as confusing; Leslie Felperin of Variety, in a sharply negative review, described the plot as [...] "soulless" [...] and [...] "utterly impenetrable" [...] to anyone who had not played the game, and Anime News Network's Santos agreed that people who had not played Final Fantasy VII would not understand the story. Mania Entertainment's John Eriani also found the plot confusing to non-players, though they liked how the characters were further explored in the film. Todd Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk, while [...] "highly recommending" [...] the film, praised Cloud's character development in particular. About.com's Altizer summarized the plot and dialogue as [...] "weak", and IGN's Chris Carle, in their 9 out of 10 review, felt that the plot was just as excuse to get to the next action sequence. The story digest [...] "Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII", included with the DVD to explain the plot of Final Fantasy VII, was described by Anime News Network's Santos as [...] "just as confusing as the movie", and of no help in explaining the plot to anyone who had not already played the game, though Carle of IGN felt it was helpful to those who had not played the game in a while.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} defective barrier on the optimum breakdown voltage, using positive and negative needle electrodes in an air medium of 10 cm gap distance. Methodology: The barriers for the tests were placed at 2. 5 cm from the point electrode for each test. The defective barriers were created by having holes of 6 mm, 8 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm diameter at {{the centre of the}} barrier. For each barrier position the breakdown test for positive and negative polarity for needle electrodes were carried out. Also, tests were carried out with non defective barrier and with point-plane airgap (without barrier). Result: From the test without barrier the negative point electrode offered higher breakdown voltage (1. 8 times), than the <b>positive</b> <b>point.</b> When with plain barrier the <b>positive</b> <b>point</b> was optimized to 1. 6 times, while the negative point was lowered. The optimum breakdown voltage decreased gradually as the hole diameter increased and at 20 mm hole diameter the effect was like the plain barrier. Conclusion: From the results, optimization is only effective with <b>positive</b> <b>point’s</b> electrode and it endures even with small opening within the ionization zone. It is necessary to check this in practical situations because the specified optimum voltage of an equipment may be lowered...|$|R
2500|$|In 2006, Floberg {{played the}} main villain {{in the crime}} thriller Uro, {{directed}} by Stefan Faldbakken. The film starred Nicolai Cleve Broch and Ane Dahl Torp, who were both nominated for Amanda Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively. The critical reception was overall good. Veteran critic Pål Bang-Hansen, who saw the film at Cannes Film Festival, enthusiastically exclaimed: [...] "Bjørn Floberg is the foremost villain of Norwegian film. In this film he {{is more of an}} asshole than ever". Dagbladets Inger Bentzrud commended the actors, but noted that all of Cleve Broch, Floberg, and Ahmed Zeyan played similar roles in Uno. One particularly negative review came from Bergens Tidende, who gave the film a 2/6 rating, highlighting Floberg's performance {{as one of the few}} <b>positive</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Over time, {{additional}} penalty {{cards were}} added to Reversis, and around 1850, the game {{gave way to a}} simple variant of Hearts, where each heart was worth 1 point. The Queen of spades (sometimes referred to as [...] "Calamity Jane") was introduced in a variant called Black Maria which then became known as the standard Hearts game, and soon thereafter, the idea of [...] "shooting the moon" [...] was introduced to the game to add depth to the gameplay. In the 1920s, the Jack of diamonds variation (ten <b>positive</b> <b>points)</b> was introduced, and some time later the scoring was reversed so that penalty points were expressed as positive instead of negative. Passing cards, breaking hearts, leading 2, and [...] "shooting the foot", whereby a player attempts to shoot the moon, but succeeds in taking the Queen and all but one heart, are more recent additions.|$|E
2500|$|In Fable, a player's Hero has {{a measure}} of good or evil {{alignment}} based on the Hero's actions. Good deeds award good points, which produce a positive alignment, while committing evil acts adds evil points, producing a negative alignment. Killing monsters or saving villagers are acts of good, whereas killing innocents, breaking laws, or abusing a spouse will accumulate evil points. Consuming certain foodstuffs can also affect the Hero's alignment; for example, eating tofu will earn the hero <b>positive</b> <b>points,</b> while eating crunchy chicks (because crunchy chicks {{are assumed to be}} still alive) will earn evil points. The player may also pray at the temples of Avo and Skorm. Donations to the Temple of Avo will result in good points, while [...] "gifts" [...] to the Chapel of Skorm will result in evil points. [...] The alignment affects not only the responses of non-player characters around the Hero, but also the appearance of the Hero himself. A Hero with a strongly positive alignment will feature a halo and a shaft of sparkling light above his head, butterflies fluttering around him and lighter features. An evil Hero emits a red haze from around his legs, draws flies, has glowing red eyes and grows horns.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Bayonetta's character has been mainly positive. Computer and Video Games praised her as {{more interesting than}} the game's storyline, describing her as the [...] "sexiest collection of pixels [...] ever seen", though not a character they considered a sex object. They further compared her to [...] "Lara Croft without the prudishness, Rubi from Wet played with honest sexuality", {{and one of the most}} memorable characters they'd seen. GamesRadar stated the character deserved plenty of respect, describing her as [...] "sexy, witty and can certainly handle herself in a fight" [...] and further named her one of the game's most <b>positive</b> <b>points</b> as she [...] "kicks all sorts of ass and is funny too." [...] GamePro felt that the character's [...] "overt sexuality and frantic anime-inspired shenanigans" [...] hampered the game's presentation, adding they would have enjoyed the character more if less focus had been put on her sexuality. [...] IGN's Ryan Clements described the character as a [...] "hardcore badass" [...] that was also [...] "brimming with sexual energy", further describing her as an [...] "immensely powerful protagonist". However, associate editor Nicole Tanner disagreed, noting she did not find the character's sexuality at all empowering as [...] "just because you give a girl an attitude and guns isn't enough to offset what she looks like". Other members of IGN's staff named her their favorite video game character, describing her as [...] "the playfulness and versatility of Dante" [...] combined with [...] "visually inventive combat". They cited her constant nudity as a point of appeal, calling the mechanic of her hair serving as her clothing both one of the stupidest and one of the coolest elements of a character.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} afford little Ned every {{advantage}} to these natural gifts, Doctor Grim nevertheless failed {{not to provide}} the best attainable instructor for such <b>positive</b> <b>points</b> of a polite education as his own fierce criticism, being destructive rather than generative, would not suffice for. There was a Frenchman in the town--a M. Le Grand, secretly calling himself a Count--who taught the little people, and, indeed, some of their elders, the Parisian pronunciation of his own language; and likewise dancing (in which he was more of an adept and more successful than in the former branch) and fencing: in which, after looking at a lesson or two, the grim Doctor was satisfied of his skill. Under his instruction, with the stimulus of the Doctor's praise and criticism, Ned soon grew to be the pride of the Frenchman's school, in both the active departments; and the Doctor himself added a further gymnastic acquirement (not absolutely necessary, he said, to a gentleman's education, but very desirable to a man perfect at all points) by teaching him cudgel-playing and pugilism. In short, in everything that related to accomplishments, whether of mind or body, no pains were spared with little Ned; but of the utilitarian line of education, then almost exclusively adopted, and especially desirable for a fortuneless boy like Ned, dependent on a man not wealthy, there was little given.|$|E
