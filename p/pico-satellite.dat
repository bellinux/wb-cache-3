40|$|AbstractThe ZDPS- 1 A <b>pico-{{satellites}}</b> are {{the first}} satellites in China within the 1 - 10 kg mass range that are successfully operated on orbit. Unlike common <b>pico-satellites,</b> {{they are designed to}} be “larger but stronger” with more powerful platforms and unique payloads so as to bear a better promise for real applications. Through their space flight mission, the functionality and performance of the two flight models are tested on orbit and validated to be mostly normal and in consistency with design and ground tests with only several inconforming occasions. Moreover, they have worked properly on orbit for one year so far, well exceeding their life expectancy of three months. Therefore, the space flight mission has reached all its goals, and verified that the design concept and the engineering process of the <b>pico-satellites</b> are sufficient in allowing them the desired functionality and performance in, and the adaption to the launch procedure and the low-Earth orbit space environment. In the foreseeable future, the platform together with the design concept and the engineering process of the <b>pico-satellites</b> are expected to be applied to more complicated real space applications...|$|R

40|$|Satellites {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role in collecting scientific infor-mation, providing communication services, and revolutionizing navigation. Until re-cently satellites were large and very expensive, creating a high barrier to entry that only large corporations and government agencies could overcome. In {{the past few years}} the CubeSat project at California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) has worked to refine the design and launching of small, lightweight, and less expensive satellites called <b>pico-satellites,</b> opening space up to a wider audience. Now that Cal Poly has the launch logistics and hardware under control, a new problem has arisen. These <b>pico-satellites</b> are within communication range of a ground station only 40 minutes a day. This, combined with their 1200 bps communication speed, lim-its the usefulness of the satellite missions to those only transmitting small amounts of data back to Earth. This thesis proposes a novel protocol that allows a sparse network of <b>pico-satellites</b> to communicate among one another and to larger satellites called data mules, which relay the information back to the ground station at much higher speeds.

40|$|Attitude {{control is}} an {{essential}} subsystem of most spacecraft buses, therefore attitude determination plays {{a very important role}} as it is the feedback system for any closed-loop attitude control system. Of all attitude determination sensors star trackers are usually the most accurate ones. Unfortunately, the star trackers usually used on classical, large spacecrafts are too big, heavy and power hungry. For <b>pico-satellites,</b> which can only carry a limited amount of volume and mass and provide only limited power, these sensors obviously cannot be used. Consequently, miniaturized star trackers have been developed in recent years, but so far the available star trackers are not sufficiently miniaturized to be feasible for the use on <b>pico-satellites,</b> including STELLA, a miniaturized star tracker developed at the University of Würzburg. Therefore, further miniaturization is necessary, which is why the University of Würzburg is active on the research of star trackers for small satellites. A first prototype for a new star tracker for <b>pico-satellites,</b> called PicoStar, has been developed in the scope of this thesis. Using a simpler system design and new image sensors, its volume could be reduced by two-thirds and the mass by about half compared to STELLA. The expected performance is kept reasonably. There is still room for further reduction of the power consumption, as it is currently up to 30 % higher than required. As this Master thesis focuses on the implementation of the embedded system and the optimization of the software of the star tracker, the prototype is not finalized. So far, the star tracker algorithm has been implemented and the attitude determination is running. First test results have shown that the next steps in the PicoStar development, among other things, have to be further calibration and testing.

40|$|<b>Pico-satellites</b> have {{recently}} gained substantial traction {{in research and}} educational communities due to their rela tively low cost. The largest factor in keeping the cost down, their small size, also poses their biggest engineering chal lenge. The tiny, low power radios used to communicate with earth have extremely slow data rates. A typical pico satellite is within communication range of the ground sta tion for approximately 40 minutes per day with a theoreti cal maximum data rate of 1200 bps. At this speed a high-resolution digital photograph can take weeks to download. This paper presents a novel communication protocol that allows a sparse network of <b>pico-satellites</b> to transfer data directly between one another. This capability is used to get the data to a “data mule”. The data mule is a spe cialized satellite capable of relaying traffic back to earth at higher rates than the current satellites. This work includes an implementation of the commu nication protocol and a simulator {{used to evaluate the}} pro tocol. Simulation results show that, regardless of varying satellite topologies and traffic workloads, the protocol has a significant increase in both the quantity of data transferred to earth and a reduction in the total time required to transfer all the data...|$|R

40|$|As long {{duration}} manned {{missions are}} {{considered in the}} near future a lot of experiments on life support systems and space environment will be necessary. On the other hand experimenting in manned missions and traditionally large satellites have become virtually impossible due to capacity of existing systems (no more space shuttle flights, ISS experiments too expensive and scarce). This calls for a new approach. Pico and small satellites could fill the gap for doing necessary experiments on life support systems. Research on the physiological and metabolic properties of in zero gravity has its application in the field of prolonged manned space missions. Bacteria can be used for waste recycling and resource recuperation, but can also be hazardous when travelling along in confined spaces, such as the ISS or because of corrosive properties. To investigate the change of conduct due to microgravity and cosmic radiation a lot of tests should be done with a lot of different types of biological loads. This is often not possible to do in the ISS, because waiting lines are long and getting tests on a mission is difficult. <b>Pico-satellites</b> (CubeSats) can be a solution to do more frequent and cost-effective research, if tests can be automated, controlled and monitored from earth. Defining a proper biochemical experiment, is a challenge, as for now recovery of reaction products is not feasible.
