25|$|In The Deer and the Cauldron, Cha {{intentionally}} {{created an}} anticlimax and an antihero in Wei Xiaobao, who possesses {{none of the}} desirable traditional values and no knowledge in any form of martial arts, and depends on a <b>protective</b> <b>vest</b> made of alloy to absorb full-frontal attack when in trouble, and a dagger that can cut through anything. Wei was a street urchin and a womanising weasel, with no admirable qualities whatsoever. The fiction writer Ni Kuang wrote a connected critique of all of Cha's works and concluded that Cha concluded his work with The Deer and the Cauldron as a satire to his earlier work, and a reminder to the readers for a reality check.|$|E

Protective clothing is used to achieve safety for people in professional and other surroundings. In the past people wore protective clothes with one purpose - to protect their body from attacks, but today the advanced soldier needs protective clothes with featuring design and higher level of protection. The process of designing advanced protective clothes is a lengthy process {{that is based on}} researching the currently existing models of the <b>protective</b> <b>vests,</b> and searching the needs of the soldiers for new model with contemporary design. In this paper new generation of materials used in this <b>protective</b> <b>vests</b> and their selection is made. The right selection of vest design means better protection and higher satisfaction of both, the wearer and the technologist. Keywords: protective clothes, design, fabric, materials...|$|R

500|$|Introduced in Resident Evil 3, the Nemesis was {{designed}} under {{the concept of}} a [...] "huge, overpowering monster that could use weapons and intelligently track you anywhere". During development, many different designs were considered. Although some elements remained constant among them, the early designs featured several different degrees of surface damage, as well as different options for clothing such as a <b>protective</b> <b>vest</b> instead of a coat or a nude design similar to the original Tyrant from Resident Evil.|$|E
500|$|KNB Effects created over 50 {{gallons of}} fake blood, {{normally}} composed of corn syrup and food dye, {{to create the}} special effect of severe wounds. [...] For the penetrating effect of knives, the production used collapsible blades to prevent injury. [...] An umbrella with a retractable tip {{is used as a}} stabbing weapon in the finale. Ulrich wore a <b>protective</b> <b>vest</b> beneath his shirt to help prevent harm while a stuntwoman attacked him with it. The second thrust missed the vest and stabbed Ulrich on his chest, impacting a wound from an open heart surgery operation. Ulrich's genuine pain was captured on film and used in the release version of Scream.|$|E
2500|$|Rhyner {{and several}} Special Forces members were wounded {{throughout}} the course of the battle. Rhyner was shot twice in the chest and once in the leg, although his <b>protective</b> <b>vest</b> stopped the two bullets to his chest from causing a mortal injury. Despite being wounded within the first fifteen minutes of the battle, Rhyner continued to direct close air support and airstrikes until the assault force was evacuated seven hours later. 50 of the airstrikes he called in were within 200m of friendly positions; the term [...] "danger close" [...] is applied when referring to airstrikes within 600m. He was credited with saving the entire 100-man team from being overrun twice. According to the Air Force Cross citation, during the battle Rhyner directed close air support and airstrikes totalling 4,570 cannon rounds, nine Hellfire missiles, 162 rockets, a dozen 500-pound bombs, and one 2,000-pound bomb. As a result of the same battle, ten U.S. Army soldiers, nine Special Forces and one Combat Cameraman received the Silver Star, the greatest number of Silver Stars awarded for a single battle since the Vietnam War.|$|E

A black-and-white or red-and-white kaffiyeh was also worn around the neck as a foulard or wrapped around the head to conceal identity. In the field, PLA infantrymen could be found wearing a variety of helmet types, consisting of Syrian-supplied Soviet SSh-60 and SSh-68 steel helmets and captured French M1951 NATO (French: Casque Mle 1951 OTAN) steel helmets and Israeli Orlite OR-201 (Model 76) ballistic helmets.

In addition to helmets, some PLA militiamen also used captured flak jackets, either the Ballistic Nylon US M-1952/69 [...] "Half-collar" [...] vest and the Israeli-produced Kevlar Rabintex Ltd Type III RAV 200 <b>Protective</b> <b>Vest</b> ("Shapats").|$|E
2500|$|In Week 2 {{against the}} San Francisco 49ers, Romo {{suffered}} a broken rib and a punctured lung on a hit from Carlos Rogers {{in the second}} quarter that forced him to miss part of the game. In this game, rookie kicker Dan Bailey missed a 21-yard field goal {{at the end of the}} game.

40|$|This report summarises data on gunshot and {{fragmentation}} wounds (collectively called "missile wounds") {{drawn from}} journal articles {{available in the}} public domain. Wound location is discussed with respect to military personal body armour (helmets and <b>protective</b> <b>vests).</b> The data is reviewed according to areas of past conflict (Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Northern Ireland, Lebanon and Croatia). It was found that helmets offered significant protection against fragments. This is important given that fragmentation wounds accounted for up to 90 % of all missile injuries. The head should {{be considered to be}} a high priority area of protection, given that it received up to 7 times more wounds than would be expected given its size relative the the body. Also, in some conflicts, over 35 % of wounds were to the upper-mid chest, supporting the idea that a bullet-resistant strip is needed in this area...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a one-year, Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Current {{civilian}} security may be enhanced {{by the use of}} flexible tile technology. This project explored the use of such materials in three areas: bomb disposal containers, portable armor, and <b>protective</b> <b>vests.</b> In particular, there has been no evaluation of the use of flexible tiles, functional graded ceramics, and ballistic modeling codes in developing improved systems. The state of the art in these three areas was reviewed and potential collaborators were contacted. Civil security forces, both state and Laboratory, were interviewed to determine issues and needs. From a collaboration established with the New Mexico State Police, the authors now know that the technology has the potential to increase protection without adding undue weight and will be usable by civilian police forces for some applications...|$|R
