25|$|The 1963 Corvette Sting Ray {{not only}} had a new design, but also newfound {{handling}} prowess. The Sting Ray was also a somewhat lighter Corvette, so acceleration improved despite unchanged horsepower. For the 1963 model year, 21,513 units would be built, which was up 50 percent from the record-setting 1962 version. Production was divided almost evenly between the convertible and the new coupe – 10,919 and 10,594, respectively – {{and more than half}} the convertibles were ordered with the optional lift-off hardtop. Nevertheless, the coupe wouldn't sell as well again throughout the Sting Ray years. In fact, not until 1969 (by which time the coupe came with removable T-tops) did the closed Corvette sell better than the open one. Equipment installations for 1963 began reflecting the market's demand for more civility in sporting cars. The <b>power</b> <b>brake</b> option went into 15 percent of production, power steering into 12 percent. On the other hand, only 278 buyers specified the $421.80 air conditioning; leather upholstery – a mere $80.70 – was ordered on only 1,114 cars. The cast aluminum knock-off wheels, manufactured for Chevy by Kelsey-Hayes, cost $322.80 a set, but few buyers checked off that option. However, almost 18,000 Sting Rays left St. Louis with the four-speed manual gearbox – better than four out of every five.|$|E

50|$|If the {{amplifier}} {{is designed}} to accommodate being driven continuously at full power, {{the use of an}} attenuator will neither increase nor reduce the potential of damage to the amplifier. An early guitar amplifier to include a power attenuator was the Jim Kelley amplifier, which came with its own L-pad type attenuator. Some production attenuators are the Scholz Power Soak, the Marshall <b>Power</b> <b>Brake,</b> THD Hot Plate, Weber MASS, and ARACOM.|$|E

Included were bucket seats, center console, carpeting, full wheel covers, and padded instrument panel. A three-speed column-shift manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed Roto Hydra-matic automatic with console-mounted T-handle shifter optional. Adding just automatic transmission, power steering, and <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> brought the 4028 lb Jetstar I's price close to $4,000.|$|R
50|$|Beyond {{the unusual}} power train (batteries, {{controller}} and motor), the remaining {{systems in the}} RAV4 EV are comparable to the gasoline-powered RAV4. The <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> steering, tire wear and suspension components are similar except that they use electric power sources. The <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> use an electric pump to provide vacuum instead of deriving vacuum from the engine manifold. The power steering use an electric motor instead of mechanical energy delivered by fan belts. The passenger compartment is heated and cooled electrically using a heat pump (the first fleet application of a heat pump in a road vehicle) with supplemental electrical resistance heating as backup.|$|R

[...] It is claimed that the advantages are: increasing the operational average speed, the brake force, safety, retaking with fuel reduction, and speed on downward slopes. [...] This means less gear shifts, lower maintenance costs, and helps improve the service life of the brakes and tyres.|$|E

50|$|Christensen {{became a}} leading {{draftsman}} at Fraser and Chalmers in Chicago, {{a manufacturer of}} machinery for industry, mining, and transportation. While working in Chicago, he witnessed an accident of a new electric railway, which resulted in two deaths {{and a number of}} injuries because the conductor was unable to stop the rail cars in time using the mechanical brake. Christensen decided to design and build a <b>power</b> <b>brake.</b> The Christensen air brake was successfully tested on Detroit's streetcar system, but a downturn of the economy prevented Christensen from manufacturing and marketing the system.|$|E

50|$|A power {{attenuator}} can {{be either}} purely resistive, or mostly resistive and partly reactive. The original guitar amp power attenuator, the Altair Attenuator, was primarily resistive, used a rotary switch to select taps on a toaster coil with low inductance windings. Another early model, simply called 'Power Attenuator' by Active Guitar Electronics, used continuously variable power rheostats. Other models, such as the Marshall <b>Power</b> <b>Brake,</b> add some electrical inductance or capacitance to the electrical load (including fans, light bulbs and coils). There is debate about whether reactive attenuators {{do a better job}} of preserving a guitar amplifier's tone.|$|E
50|$|General Motors (GM) {{ordered a}} recall on August 16, 2013, for 292,879 model year 2011 and 2012 Cruze models, {{manufactured}} at the Lordstown, Ohio plant United States. General Motors told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the recall {{was due to}} a potential intermittent loss of brake assist in Cruze models featuring {{the combination of the}} 1.4-liter dual overhead cam gasoline turbo engine and the 6T40 FWD automatic transmission. GM said it was aware of 27 alleged low-speed crashes due to brake issues that may include this particular issue, but it reported no injuries.To address the issue, GM said dealers will replace a micro-switch in the <b>power</b> <b>brake</b> vacuum pipe assembly.|$|E
50|$|Another type of <b>power</b> <b>brake</b> {{installed}} in automobiles {{is called the}} drum brake. This type of brake, in general, will create some friction that will slow down the wheel. How this works {{is there is a}} brake cylinder that connects master cylinder to the drum brake via brake lines that transfer pressure from the master cylinder. When the driver pushes the brake pedal with his/her foot, the pistons inside the cylinder will activate. The activation of this piston will allow two brake shoes located within the drum of the brake to expand, thus generating friction to slow down and stop the wheel. Usually, this brake is located in the rear wheels of the vehicle, while the disk brake is located {{at the front of the}} vehicle. A car may also have only drum brakes or disc brakes both front and rear.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{standard}} axle [...] "bogies" [...] provide the drive mechanism. Each bogie {{is driven by}} 3-phase alternating current (AC) motor.
