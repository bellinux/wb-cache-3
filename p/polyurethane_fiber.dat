2500|$|Chain extenders (f=2) {{and cross}} linkers (f≥3) are low {{molecular}} weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that {{play an important role}} in the polymer morphology of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>fibers,</b> [...] elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.|$|R

Furthermore, in contrast to VOC sorption on activated carbon, where complete regeneration of the adsorbent was not possible, the polyurethane fibers demonstrated a completely reversible absorption and desorption, with desorption obtained by a simple purging with nitrogen at room temperature. The fibers possessed a high affinity toward toluene and chloroform, but aliphatic hexane lacked the necessary strong attractive interactions with the polyurethane chains and therefore was less strongly absorbed.

In this dissertation, co-axial electrospinning is introduced {{as a mean to}} efficiently encapsulate and release protein and live entities while producing a tissue engineering scaffold with uniaxial topography. In the first specific aim, aligned poly (caprolactone) nanofibers encapsulated with BSA and growth factors were produced to demonstrate controlled release and bioactivity retention properties. Control over release kinetics {{is achieved by}} incorporation of poly(ethylene glycol) as a porogen in the shell of the fibers. PEG leaches out in a concentration and molecular weight dependent fashion, leading to BSA release half-lives that range from 1 - 20 days. The second specific aim introduces the fabrication of virus and bacterial cell encapsulated electrospun fibers to achieve unique biological functionalization. Adenovirus encoding the gene for green fluorescent protein was efficiently encapsulated into the core of poly(caprolactone) fibers through co-axial electrospinning and subsequently released via the porogen-mediated process. Encapsulated bacterial cells were confined to fibers of varying core sizes, which provided an aqueous core environment for free mobility and allowed the bacterias to proliferate within the fibers. In the third specific aim, the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts on aligned electrospun <b>polyurethane</b> <b>fibers</b> and in the presence of electromechanical stimulation were systematically studied. Skeletal myoblasts cultured on aligned <b>polyurethane</b> (PU) <b>fibers</b> showed more pronounced elongation, better alignment, upregulation of contractile proteins and higher percentage of striated myotubes compared to those cultured on random PU fibers and film. In the last specific aim, the controlled release aspect of co-axial electrospun fibers were combined with skeletal tissue engineering to serve as a therapeutic implant for the treatment of hemophilia. A non-viral, tissue engineering approach were taken to stimulate local lymphatic or vascular system in order to enhance transport near the FVIII-producing implants to provide effective and sustained treatment for hemophilia A.

The mechanical properties and molecular morphology of some electrospun polymers are shown to be fundamentally different compared to their bulk analogs. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} mechanical behavior of electrospun <b>polyurethane</b> <b>fiber</b> mats is influenced by fiber mat morphology, molecular orientation, and surface flaws on electrospun fibers. ^ This research characterizes the mechanical behavior of randomly oriented electrospun polyurethane mats and sheds light on general differences in behavior between electrospun and bulk materials. Further, the mechanical response of random fiber mats is modeled based on the mechanical characterization of aligned electrospun fibers. Also, empirical models are employed to relate the tensile properties of electrospun materials to their bulk analogs. ^ The crystallinity and melting behavior of a family of electrospun polyesters is studied and provides insight to the rapid cooling and effects on solidification and crystallization of electrospun polymeric fibers. The results indicate a commonly accepted idea in electrospinning, that electrospun fibers result from rapid solvent evaporation and experience quench-like solidification from a jet of polymer solution. ^ A qualitative study illustrates a color change phenomenon in a series of electrospun polymer/solvent systems. Color change is produced by electrospinning, and subsequent heating, and occurs at characteristic temperatures dependent on the polymer system used.

40|$|Presently most {{road and}} railway {{vehicles}} designed to haul toxic or flammable liquids are built {{with a single}} shell tank construction. The transportation of hazardous liquids poses a problem if the vehicle hauling the liquid is involved in an accident. Loss of liquid can happen if the tank integrity is compromised. The current work {{is an attempt to}} develop a lightweight, relatively inexpensive, sparsely reinforced elastomer liner material to incorporate inside the containers, to contain leakage should the outer shell fail. The general design methodology is thus Fail-Safe Design. If this were designed properly to be an inexpensive easily replaceable disposable item, it could prevent significant liquid loss, and reduce subsequent clean-up costs. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer is chosen as an ideal candidate for at least one side of the sheet matrix material because of its high strength, tear resistance, puncture and cut resistance, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, and generally good impermeability to fluids being transported. In this project, sparsely reinforced TPU elastomer composites have been developed. The TPU matrix was reinforced with webs of continuous fibers of various types and patterns, wherein the reinforcement serves as a load carrying structural element designed to resist both crack initiation and propagation. A unique thermoforming process technique has been designed specifically to produce the sparsely reinforced sheet material. Representative sheets of these materials have been studied for strength, toughness and different deformation behaviours by the means of tensile tests, tear tests, snag tests, slow puncture tests, and hydraulic bulge tests. A series of test apparatus have been designed and built for examining these mechanical properties. Also, the effect of different reinforcements, web patterns and strand diameters on the mechanical properties has been investigated. The sparsely reinforced TPU composites produce outstanding tear strength, snagging resistance, and an increase in the elongation to failure in an ASTM Die-C type of tear test.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{integration}} of functional electrospun micro- and nanofiber based materials in two fields of microsystem technology: fibrous scaffolds as cell culture substrates and fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites as thermal interface materials (TIMs). Electrospun structures {{have been found to}} carry great potential as biomimicking microenvironments for future tissue engineering and cell culture applications. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, electrospun <b>polyurethane</b> <b>fiber</b> architectures have been fabricated, characterized and studied as cell culture scaffolds. The effects of plasma treatment, as a physical surface modification of the electrospun scaffold interface, are characterized and demonstrated to improve the possibility for human embryonic stem cell culture expansion. Electrospun scaffolds with specific fiber diameters are shown to allow maintenance of astrocytes with complex morphologies, limit up-regulation of protein expression related to astrocyte stress and activation, and to facilitate the formation of three-dimensional neuronal networks. Taken together, these findings indicate that electrospun scaffolds can be used to complement or improve traditional in vitro culture methods. To enable detailed studies of the interplay between physical and chemical cues for cells in controlled microenvironments, a method to integrate electrospun structures with microfluidic systems was devised. Thermal interface materials have been identified by the semiconductor industry as one of the major bottlenecks in the heat dissipation for high power density devices. The second part of this thesis presents the development of a novel metal matrix composite TIM technology utilizing fiber reinforcements formed through electrospinning. Employed as a TIM, the composite structure relies on heat conduction through its continuous metal phase, while the fiber network modifies the thermo-mechanical properties. Three specific implementations have been developed: Polyimide fibers with an indium matrix and a tin-silver-copper (SnAgCu) alloy matrix, and carbonized mesophase-pitch based fibers with a SnAgCu alloy matrix. To facilitate liquid phase infiltration of the indium matrix into the polyimide fibers, a chemical reduction based method for coating Ag nanoparticles on the fiber surface was developed. Using the same Ag coating, the SnAgCu composite was fabricated and demonstrated to exhibit a reduced elastic modulus, which indicates the potential to lower the thermally induced stress when bonding materials with thermal expansion mismatch. The expected increase in thermal conductivity when switching from polymer to carbonized fibers is found to be limited, and improved methods to reduce the thermal contact resistance at the matrix-fiber interface are needed. Measurements of low thermal contact resistances (< 1 Kmm 2 /W) and high thermal conductivities (~ 20 W/mK) show that the composite architectures are promising candidates for future applications when compared to both existing and other emerging TIM technologies...|$|E

For a tissue engineered heart valve to work well, it {{must meet the}} mechanical demands of the natural heart valve and support healthy valve cell behavior. Natural heart valve leaflets have a heterogeneous structure with distinct layers that provide the valve with unique mechanical functions. My research focused on mimicking the mechanics and biochemical signaling of each layer so that the entire scaffold will function similar to the natural valve. Three specific strategies to add heterogeneity into tissue engineered heart valve scaffolds are described in this thesis. First, I designed an innovative method to direct the proper spatial arrangement of cell adhesive peptides {{in order to promote}} the correct organization of the two different cell types in the valve (valve endothelial cells and valve interstitial cells). Second, hyaluronan hydrogels were utilized as a mechanical and biochemical mimic of the middle, spongiosa layer of heart valves.

The results of this research also lay the groundwork for constructing heart valve scaffolds for the purpose of in vitro disease modeling.

All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They are all suitable for thermoplastic polyurethanes with the exception of ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.|$|R
