5|$|After initial {{rises in}} opinion polls {{following}} Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined {{with the onset}} of a recession in 2008, leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. A year later, Labour lost 91 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931, making the Conservatives the largest party in a hung parliament. Brown remained in office as Labour negotiated to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. On 10 May 2010, Brown announced he would stand down as leader of the Labour Party, and instructed the party to put into motion the <b>processes</b> <b>to</b> elect a new leader.

5|$|All group 3 {{elements}} have an odd atomic number, {{and therefore}} few stable isotopes.

However, the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 {{is thought to be}} more abundant than it otherwise would be, {{due in part to the}} s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other <b>processes</b> <b>to</b> decay by electron emission (neutron → proton). Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable atomic nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. 89Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.|$|E

Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time.

5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse <b>processes</b> <b>to</b> the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse processes in the last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become more pronounced in the rear dorsals.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first <b>processes</b> <b>to</b> develop late in the century, and {{electric}} resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E

5|$|There was {{considerable}} conglomeration in the US ice trade {{towards the end}} of the century, and foreign competitors, such as Norway, complained of US collusion. Charles W.

In turn Morse bought out his major competitor the Knickerbocker Ice Company of New York in 1896, giving him control of around four million tons (four billion kg) of the regional ice harvests each year. Morse incorporated his few remaining rivals into the American Ice Company in 1899, giving him control of all of the natural and plant ice supplies and distribution in the north-east of the US. On the west coast, Edward Hopkins formed the Union Ice Company in San Francisco, bringing together a range of regional ice companies to produce another huge ice company. In contrast, the competition in the British market remained harsh, keeping prices relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} {{education}} reform {{early in his}} administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was a code word for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and <b>processes</b> <b>to</b> realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75cents for every dollar initially invested.|$|E
