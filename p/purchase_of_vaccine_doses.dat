40|$|The infant {{mortality}} rate (IMR) {{is one of the}} most important indicators of the socio-economic well-being and public health conditions of a country. The US childhood immunization schedule specifies 26 <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> for infants aged less than 1 year—the most in the world—yet 33 nations have lower IMRs. Using linear regression, the immunization schedules of these 34 nations were examined and a correlation coefficient of r = 0. 70 (p < 0. 0001) was found between IMRs and the number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> routinely given to infants. Nations were also grouped into five different <b>vaccine</b> <b>dose</b> ranges: 12 – 14, 15 – 17, 18 – 20, 21 – 23, and 24 – 26. The mean IMRs of all nations within each group were then calculated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} costs of {{vaccination}} regimens for introducing inactivated polio vaccine in routine immunization in Brazil. METHODS A cost analysis was conducted for vaccines in five vaccination regimens, including inactivated polio vaccine, compared with the oral polio vaccine-only regimen. The costs <b>of</b> the <b>vaccines</b> were estimated for routine use and for the &# 8220;National Immunization Days&# 8221;, during when the oral polio vaccine is administered to children aged less than five years, independent <b>of</b> their <b>vaccine</b> status, and the strategic stock <b>of</b> inactivated polio <b>vaccine.</b> The presented estimated costs are of 2011. RESULTS The annual costs of the oral vaccine-only program (routine and two National Immunization Days) were estimated at US$ 19, 873, 170. The incremental costs of inclusion <b>of</b> the inactivated <b>vaccine</b> depended on the number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses,</b> presentation <b>of</b> the <b>vaccine</b> (bottles with single dose or ten doses), and number of &# 8220;National Immunization Days&# 8221; carried out. The cost of the regimen adopted with two <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> inactivated <b>vaccine</b> followed by three <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>vaccine</b> and one &# 8220;National Immunization Day&# 8221; was estimated at US$ 29, 653, 539. The concomitant replacement of the DTPw/Hib and HepB vaccines with the pentavalent vaccine enabled {{the introduction of the}} inactivated polio without increasing the number of injections or number of visits needed to complete the vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The introduction <b>of</b> the inactivated <b>vaccine</b> increased the annual costs <b>of</b> the polio <b>vaccines</b> by 49. 2 % compared with the oral vaccine-only regimen.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to verify the immune status against tetanus in students and workers exposed to risk and to ascertain whether a decennial booster is necessary. Antibodies against tetanus were measured in 1433 workers and students of Padua University (Italy). The enrolment criterion was the ability to provide a booklet of vaccinations released by a public health office. The influence of age, gender, the number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses,</b> and the interval since the last dose was determined. Ten years after the last dose, the majority of subjects (95. 0 %) displayed an antibody titre above the protective level (≥ 0. 10 IU/ml), and half of these (49. 1 %) had a long-term protective level (≥ 1. 0 IU/ml). According to our data, titre depends on both the number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> and the interval since the last dose (P< 0. 0001). Five <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> and an interval of at least 10 years since the last dose are predictive of a long-term protective titre in absence of a booster (1. 97 IU/ml). These data suggest that when primary series are completed, a decennial booster is unnecessary for up to twenty years. Furthermore, we recommend measuring the antibody level before a new booster is given to prevent problems related to overimmunization...|$|R

We evaluated the effect <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>dose</b> and each adjuvant on immunogenicity and efficacy in mice, and the effect <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>dose</b> {{with or without the}} AS 01 B adjuvant on the immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters. Efficacy was evaluated by challenge with wild-type virus at early and late time points (4 and 18 wk post-vaccination). A single <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> with or without adjuvant was poorly immunogenic in mice; a second dose resulted in a significant boost in antibody levels, {{even in the absence of}} adjuvant. The use of adjuvants resulted in higher antibody titers, with the AS 01 B-adjuvanted vaccine being slightly more immunogenic than the AS 03 A-adjuvanted <b>vaccine.</b> Two <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> WI-SARS with and without Adjuvant Systems were highly efficacious in mice.

Methods: A postal survey was conducted of parents and carers of students and identified, using school-program records, as incompletely vaccinated in a large regional area of northern NSW vaccinated during 2010. Information about additional HPV <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> received or reasons for non-completion were sought. Responses were analysed and records cross-checked against the National HPV Vaccination Program Register. Results: Of 660 parents or carers contacted, 207 (31. 4 %) responded. We found: 1) completion rates increased, an additional 122 / 207 (45. 2 %) students had completed all three doses of HPV through their general practitioner (GP); 2) under-notification of GP doses to the National HPV Vaccination Program Register was an issue with only 5 / 165 (3. 0 %) reported; 3) {{the main reason for}} non-completion was being unaware of the opportunity to catch-up at a GP.

Methods Well-functioning sentinel project immunization information systems (IIS) in Arizona (AIIS) and Michigan (MIIS) were used to calculate vaccination coverage among children aged 6 – 23 months during the 2004 – 05 influenza season. We calculated 2 measures of vaccination coverage: a) receipt of 1 or more <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> September 2004 -March 2005 and b) receipt of 2 or more doses (ie, fully vaccinated). We compared the dose administration distribution among children needing 1 and 2 doses and by provider type.

METHODS: The ESCALE study was a French national population-based case-control study conducted in France in 2003 and 2004 in order to investigate the role of infectious, environmental and genetic factors in four childhood neoplastic diseases (leukaemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and brain tumour). The controls were randomly selected from the French population and age and gender frequency matched with the cases. A total of 776 cases of AL (91 % of the eligible cases) and 1681 controls (71 % of the eligible controls) were included. In a specific standardized telephone interview, which was the same for both the cases and controls, each mother was asked to read out her child's complete vaccination record. RESULTS: No association between vaccination and the risk of childhood AL: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute myeloblastic leukaemia was observed. No relationship between the risk of leukaemia and the type <b>of</b> <b>vaccine,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> each <b>vaccine,</b> total number <b>of</b> injections, total number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> or number <b>of</b> early vaccinations was evidenced. No confounding factor was observed. CONCLUSION: The study did not show any evidence of a role of vaccination in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia...|$|R
40|$|Routine {{varicella}} vaccination {{with one}} dose {{for children of}} 11 to 14 months was recommended in Germany in 2004 to reduce disease incidence and severe complications. A country-wide varicella sentinel surveillance system was initiated in 2005 to detect trends of disease frequency and vaccine uptake and to evaluate the vaccination programme. A convenient sample of about 1, 000 paediatricians and general practitioners was recruited to report {{on a monthly basis}} on varicella cases by age groups seen in their practice, and on varicella <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> administered. Sentinel data from April 2005 to March 2009 show a reduction of 55 % of varicella cases in all ages; 63 % in the age group 0 - 4 years and 38 % in 5 - 9 year-olds. The number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> per reporting unit in all regions and physician groups increased during the same period. The number of reported cases as well as administered vaccines differed between physician groups and regions with different reimbursement policies. Where reimbursement was settled early and <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> were increasing varicella cases started to decrease early as well. Besides reimbursement policies the availability and vaccination schedules influenced vaccine uptake. Sentinel surveillance provided valid data on trends for varicella associated morbidity, vaccine uptake and the age distribution of cases. The results confirm that following the introduction of routine varicella vaccination, varicella morbidity started to decline in Germany...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLittle {{is known}} about the {{association}} between the initiation <b>of</b> hepatitis B <b>vaccine</b> (HB vaccine) at birth and completion <b>of</b> the HB <b>vaccine</b> and the national immunization program vaccine (NIPV) series in Fujian, China. MethodsA provincial survey, including children in the community and newborns in hospital, was conducted to evaluate coverage with a timely first <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> and the completion of three <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> and the NIPV series in 2013. A proportion of the samples was rechecked to investigate the relationship between the administration of a timely first <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> and completion <b>of</b> the HB <b>vaccine</b> series and the NIPV series (three <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine,</b> one <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> Bacillus Calmette–Guérin <b>vaccine,</b> three <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> oral poliomyelitis <b>vaccine,</b> three <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis <b>vaccine,</b> one <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> measles-containing <b>vaccine,</b> one <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> Japanese encephalitis attenuated live <b>vaccine,</b> and two <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> group A meningococcal polysaccharide <b>vaccine).</b> ResultsA total <b>of</b> 6589 subjects (including 3785 community children and 2804 hospital newborns) were included in this study; 97. 34 % of them received a timely first <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> (≤ 24 h after birth) and 99. 10 % and 88. 27 % completed the HB vaccine series and the NIPV series, respectively. Among the 1680 children from eight counties who were rechecked, those with a timely first <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> had higher completion rates <b>of</b> the HB <b>vaccine</b> series and the NIPV series than those with a delayed first <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> (99. 69 % and 88. 90 % vs. 83. 05 % and 79. 66 %, respectively; both p< 0. 001). Compared to those with a delayed HB <b>vaccine</b> first <b>dose,</b> the odds ratios for completing the HB vaccine series and the NIPV series among children who received a timely first <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> were 65. 96 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 21. 73 – 200. 25) and 3. 24 (95 % CI 1. 81 – 5. 81), respectively. ConclusionsCoverage with a timely first <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> is high in children in the community and newborns in hospital, and timely receipt of the first <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> HB <b>vaccine</b> is associated with an increased likelihood of completing the HB vaccine series and the NIPV series in Fujian, China...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of serum levels of antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs) after hepatitis B vaccination {{is currently the}} only simple test available to predict the decay of protection and to plan the administration of booster doses. A total <b>of</b> 3085 <b>vaccine</b> recipients <b>of</b> plasma-derived and recombinant vaccine have been followed for 10 years to determine the kinetics of anti-HBs production and to construct a mathematical model which could efficiently predict the anti-HBs level decline. The anti-HBs peak level was reached 68 days after the last <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> recombinant <b>vaccine</b> and 138 days after the last <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> plasma-derived <b>vaccines.</b> The age <b>of</b> vaccinees negatively influenced the anti-HBs levels and also the time necessary to reach the anti-HBs peak. A bilogarithmic mathematical model (log 10 level, log 10 time) of anti-HBs decay has been constructed on a sample <b>of</b> recombinant <b>vaccine</b> recipients and subsequently validated on different samples of recombinant or plasma-derived vaccine recipients. Age, gender, type <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> (recombinant or plasma-derived), number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> (three or four) did not influence the mathematical model of antibody decay. The program can be downloaded at the site: [URL] Introducing an anti-HBs determination obtained after the peak, the program calculates a prediction of individual anti-HBs decline and allows planning of an efficient booster policy...|$|R
