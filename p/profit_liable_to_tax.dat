40|$|In Sweden {{a person}} is either {{unlimited}} or limited <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax.</b> It is important to define this status since the consequence of being unlimited <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> according <b>to</b> chapter 3 § 8 Swedish income tax law (1999 : 1229) is imposed tax on every revenue from Sweden and overseas. When deciding the fiscal status Sweden uses the principle of domicile which makes {{the home of the}} taxable person important. Despite domilication in another country a person can be considered to have such bonds to Sweden that they still should be unlimited <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> here. During the development of the Swedish communal tax law (1928 : 370) the term essential linkage was introduced. There are numerous factors which can affect this assessment but in case-law some factors have been considered more important than others. Amongst these are residence which is adopted for year-round use and practice business operations here or being economical engaged here by having assets that, directly or indirectly, gives the beneficiary a vital influence in business operations. Concerning residences there are clear guidelines. By the inquiry of case-law in recent years you can draw the conclusion that permanent residences which are retained after migration always leads to essential linkage while secondary residences never does so. Regarding economical commitment the actual influence over a business operation is of importance for the assessment. A shareholding of ten percent does not lead to essential influence. An upper limit which directly leads to essential influence is not established. The opinion considering the relation between essential influence and prime linkage has prior to a decision made by the Swedish taxation committee been that one leads to the other. This is now uncertain...|$|R

50|$|The first {{document}} mentioning Borbeck {{dates back}} to 869, when Borthbeki, a small rural commune, was mentioned as one of nine communes around Essen Abbey which were <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax.</b> In 1288, princess-abbess Berta von Arnsberg bought probably mortgaged parts {{of the region and}} built the predecessor of Schloss Borbeck. By the 14th century, Schloss Borbeck had become the favorite residence of the princess-abbesses, which came along with a rise of prestige for the region. In 1339, princess-abbess Katharina von der Mark had Borbeck's old Romanesque church modified so the abbesses and their entourage could adequately attend mass.|$|R

5000|$|Assuming {{even just}} the lower {{estimate}} of £13 trillion on deposit in offshore accounts, if these assets earned an average 3% {{a year in}} income for their owners taxable at 30%, then the offshore funds would generate £121 billion in tax revenues. [...] However, keep in mind, these statistics assume that ZERO tax is paid (i.e. NO ONE pays any tax on their holdings), and that 100% of those deposits is notionally <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> which is not being paid, each of which seems a highly unlikely scenario. Projections are often predicated upon levying tax on the capital sums held in offshore accounts, whereas most national systems of taxation tax income and/or capital gains rather than accrued wealth.|$|R

40|$|Taxation of trusts {{based in}} common law {{countries}} {{is a complicated}} matter in Swedish law, mainly {{due to the lack}} of a trust concept in Sweden. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to come up with a well motivated answer to the question: who should be considered <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> from income stemming from real estate that constitutes trust property? The specific situation in each case decides. However, the taxation of the trustee in his or her capacity as legal owner of the trust property appears to be valid regarding the relevant statues concerning income tax. It can also be concluded that the Swedish regulation, both regarding hard and soft law is not optimized for stimulating real estate investment in the country. It is however hard to see any serious, enforceable alternatives. ...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish tax {{on income}} for persons who are {{unlimited}} <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> is based on his domicile and double taxation treaties between Sweden and other countries are based on his residence. In order to determine a person’s tax liability, the dwelling or home is of vital importance to determine where a person has his domicile and residence. For {{a person who has}} moved from Sweden, <b>to</b> be unlimited <b>tax</b> <b>liable</b> here, there must be an essential link. This link can be through previous residence in Sweden, the person is not a permanent residence in a foreign country, in possession of housing for year-around-use or in possession of house property. Sweden has concluded double tax agreements with other countries for the reason to prevent double taxation on the same income. When a taxpayer may be regarded as a resident in two states, the situation must be resolved to avoid that double taxation will arise. This is resolved according to the OECD model convention. The person shall be deemed to be a resident in that state where he has “a permanent home available to him”. The person is considered domiciled in Sweden if he doesn’t show a lack of such essential link, <b>to</b> the Swedish <b>tax</b> authority (Skatteverket). <b>To</b> determine whether the dwelling is to be considered as an essential link or not, many different factors is taken into account such as type of dwelling, use of dwelling, economic value, location, etc. Case law can give guidance on how a situation shall be resolved. A possession of a previous permanent residence appears in the most cases to be regarded as a strong connection to Sweden for the person <b>to</b> be unlimited <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax.</b> However, a year-around furnished house, which is not intended to be permanent, is not to be regarded as such a strong link. Neither a house intended for holiday use is to be considered to give any essential link...|$|R

(Other areas of modern London were then in Middlesex, Kent, Essex, etc., and are included in Domesday Book.) Most of Cumberland and Westmorland are missing. County Durham is missing because the Bishop of Durham (William de St-Calais) had the exclusive right <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> it; in addition, parts of north-east England were covered by the 1183 Boldon Book, listing areas <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> by the Bishop of Durham.
