40|$|The {{transportation}} noise phenomenon {{known as}} wear-type rail corrugation is a significant problem in railway engineering, that manifests as an undesirable periodic wear pattern on the contact surface of rails. Rail corrugations induce unwanted vibrations, noise and damage to vehicle and track systems. Currently the only reliable solution to corrugation is removal by grinding at significant expense to the railway operator. Recent research by the current authors has theoretically shown that uniformity in train <b>pass</b> <b>speeds</b> over a site enhances corrugation growth rate and that broadening the probabilistic <b>pass</b> <b>speed</b> distribution may be a possible method of mitigating corrugation growth. To further test these results and to quantify the expected performance, in this paper, field measured data from a site with recurrent corrugation is used to tune and validate both efficient analytical and more complex numerical corrugation growth models. In doing so, previously developed analytical predictions for growth rate under varying speed conditions are generalised to both tangent track and cornering conditions. Validation and comparison with more complex benchmarked numerical models and field measurements is therefore achieved. The effect of changing the field measured <b>pass</b> <b>speed</b> distribution is then investigated and results quantifying the expected reduction in corrugation growth rate lire presented. compared and discussed. Possible undesirable side-effects of implementing such a corrugation control strategy are also investigated...|$|R

The police {{have the ability to}} deploy roadblocks which has {{computer-controlled}} cop cars form a wall across the road, and spike strips which puncture the tires of a racers car, bringing it to a halt. Both tactics present weaknesses, specifically gaps in the blockade that can be used by a racer to avoid collisions with police cars, or tire punctures from a spike strip which is only deployed {{on one side of the}} road. The player may also listen to police radio chatter on the pursuits statuses, revealing to them the current locations of racers, police cars, as well as roadblocks and spike strips. The radio chatter also reveals reactions to specific events, such as a racers collision with a parked police car, as well as referencing the racers <b>passing</b> <b>speed</b> and the occurrence of the race itself ("It looks like the cars are racing!"). Furthermore, if a computer-controlled racers driving conduct proves to be more dangerous than that of the racers, the cops may relent their pursuit of the player and chase the AI instead.|$|E

40|$|Wear-type rail {{corrugation}} is {{a significant}} problem in the railway transport industry. Some recent work has suggested that speed control {{can be used as}} an effective tool to minimize the rate of corrugation growth. This has brought about the need to model corrugation growth under variable <b>passing</b> <b>speed.</b> Variable speed rail corrugation growth modelling normally consists of either numerical simulation of a sequence of varied speed wheel passes or direct integration of a probabilistic <b>passing</b> <b>speed</b> distribution function; both of which are computationally expensive. This paper investigates the use of the statistical moments of the speed probability density function to greatly improve the computational speed of variable speed corrugation growth models and compares results of changing standard deviation and skewness to numerical integration models. It also identifies the effects of individual statistical moments on corrugation growth to provide better insight into control methods. The new modelling method correlated well with the numerical integration models for small standard deviations in speed (less than 10 %) and highlighted a need to consider kurtosis in predicting the performance of speed control based corrugation mitigation schemes. For larger standard deviations in speed, higher than 4 th order effects need to be considered...|$|E

However, {{the impacts of}} lateral drift behavior, as well as variable lateral clearance maintaining behavior due to the variation of drift intensity, on mixed bicycle flow are not clear. This paper establishes a new cellular automata model to study typical characteristics of mixed bicycle traffic induced by lateral drift and its accompanying behavior. Based on derived positive correlation between <b>passing</b> <b>speed</b> and drift speed through survey, the occurrence probability of lateral drift {{and the degree of}} maintained lateral clearance are both introduced in accordance with the variance of <b>passing</b> <b>speed.</b> Then, in whole density region, firm conformity between simulation results and actual survey data is reached, which has seldom been achieved in previous studies. It is further verified that speed distortions in intermediate and high density region induced by assumption of constant lateral clearance requirements can be revised by introducing its variability characteristics. In addition, two contrastive impacts of lateral drift behavior are observed. That is, it causes speed fluctuation in low density while alleviating the speed fluctuation in relatively high density. These results are expected to be helpful to improve the simulation performance of mixed bicycle flow as well as depict more realistic vehicle-bicycle conflicts and so on...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—There {{are a lot}} of {{vehicles}} changing its lane unobservantly when passing a traffic bottleneck in China, which may affect other vehicles that drive according to the rules. Even the traffic features on the road may also be influenced. Based on the data that collected from the road, this paper firstly proposes that there are different lateral interferences among three lanes at the bus stop bottleneck, and then proves that significant velocity differences are existed among three adjacent lanes. Besides, as the lateral interference often occurs at the bottleneck, lateral parameters are added to help to analyze the traffic features of the urban bottleneck. Finally this paper confirms the hypothesis that velocity will decrease when lateral offsetis increasing under the same density level. The result also shows that though the increase of the road density is the main reason of low <b>passing</b> <b>speed</b> at the traffic bottleneck, the lateral position also influences the average velocity greatly.

Examples include, crashes that occur during the various phases of overtaking manoeuvres on high speed roads (pull out, pass, pull in) or where vehicles are passing bicycles on an adjacent travel path. The paper investigates a new option for measuring separation distance using inexpensive LASER distance measuring (LIDAR) devices. Six LIDAR devices were fitted to a vehicle and the accuracy of measurements to another vehicle during an overtaking manoeuvre were evaluated with off-the-shelf differential GPS technology. Data from the LIDAR devices was also used to calculate the <b>passing</b> <b>speed</b> and length of the overtaking vehicle, and the accuracy of these calculations was evaluated. Preliminary results show that the setup delivers results that are acceptable up to distances of 50 meters and at passing speeds up to 20 km/h. This inexpensive solution will facilitate research where separation distance in real traffic flow is an important consideration. Effective use of the technology should take into account possible weaknesses such as inaccurate device positioning and the potential for spurious data. J. R. R. Mackenzie and J. K. Dutschk...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of exercise-induced fatigue on soccer skills performed throughout simulated match play. Fifteen academy soccer players completed a soccer match simulation (SMS) including passing, dribbling, and shooting skills. Precision, success rate, and ball speed were determined via video analysis for all skills. Blood samples were obtained before exercise (preexercise), every 15 min during the simulation (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min), and 10 min into half-time. Preliminary testing confirmed test-retest repeatability of performance, physiological, and metabolic responses to 45 min of the SMS. Exercise influenced shooting precision (timing effect: P =. 035) and <b>passing</b> <b>speed</b> (timing effect: P =. 011), such that shots taken after exercise were 25. 5 ± 4. 0 % less accurate than those taken before exercise and passes in the last 15 min were 7. 8 ± 4. 3 % slower than in the first 15 min. Shot and pass speeds were slower during the second half compared with the first half (shooting: 17. 3 ± 0. 3 m/s vs 16. 6 ± 0. 3 m/s, P = 0. 012; passing: 13. 0 ± 0. 5 m/s vs 12. 2 ± 0. 5 m/s, P = 0. 039). Dribbling performance was unaffected by exercise. Blood lactate concentrations were elevated above preexercise values throughout exercise (time of sample effect: P <. 001). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that soccer-specific exercise influenced the quality of performance in gross motor skills, such as passing and shooting. Therefore, interventions to maintain skilled performance {{during the second half of}} soccer match play are warranted...|$|E
