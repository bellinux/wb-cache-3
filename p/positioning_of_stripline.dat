40|$|The SPS {{wideband}} transverse {{feedback system}} {{is being developed}} to control vertical beam instabilities arising from intensity dependent effects like electron cloud instability (ECI) and the transverse mode coupling instability (TMCI). As part of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project, a wideband kicker is necessary as a damper to control unstable modes within a bunch. Several types of kicker structures, including cavities, striplines, and slotted structures have been studied to evaluate the operating bandwidth, transverse shunt impedance, and beam coupling impedance. Studies and results from all structures are described below, including three potential paths to implement these structures as a wideband kicker system. A single, slotted-coaxial kicker of 1 m length provides substantial kick strength (integrated transverse voltage) over a bandwidth ranging from nearly DC to 1 GHz. An array of four 10 cm long striplines provides substantial kick strength from DC to 750 MHz. For a given amplifier power of 500 W, the array <b>of</b> <b>striplines</b> can provide twice the transverse detecting voltage as the slotted kicker for frequencies up to 200 MHz.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the design study of future linear colliders, the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) aims for electron-positron collisions with high luminosity at a nominal center-of-mass energy of 3  TeV. To achieve the luminosity requirements, predamping rings (PDRs) and damping rings (DRs) are required: they reduce the beam emittance before the beam is accelerated in the main linac. Several kicker systems are needed to inject and extract the beam from the PDRs and DRs. In order to achieve both low beam coupling impedance and reasonable broadband impedance matching to the electrical circuit, striplines have been chosen for the kicker elements. In this paper, we present the complete design <b>of</b> the <b>striplines</b> for the DR extraction kicker, since it is the most challenging from the field homogeneity point of view. The excellent field homogeneity required, as well as a good transmission of the high voltage pulse through the electrodes, has been achieved by choosing a novel electrode shape. With this new geometry, it has been possible to benefit from all the advantages that the most common shapes introduce separately. Furthermore, a detailed study of the different operating modes <b>of</b> a <b>stripline</b> kicker allowed the beam coupling impedance to be reduced at low frequencies: this cannot be achieved by tapering the electrodes. The optimum design <b>of</b> the <b>striplines</b> and their components has been based on studies of impedance matching, field homogeneity, power transmission, beam coupling impedance, and manufacturing tolerances. Finally, new ideas for further improvement of the performance <b>of</b> future <b>striplines</b> are reported...|$|R

40|$|An Interaction Point Collision Feedback System is {{necessary}} to achieve design luminosity at the future International Linear Collider (ILC). This is proposed to include a stripline beam position monitor (BPM) positioned 3 m from the Interaction Point (IP). The BPM is required {{to be able to}} measure the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the outgoing electron or positron beam with a resolution of 1 m. Prototype feedback systems have been built and tested at the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the USA (SLAC) and also at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at the High Energy Research Laboratory in Japan (KEK). The successful correction <b>of</b> <b>position</b> osets is demonstrated with the lowest latency achieved 24 ns, the best position resolution 4 m and the best correction ratio 23 : 1. To make the feedback system a more powerful tool, a digital processor is added. It raises the total latency of the feedback system to 140 ns. Its ability to perform algorithms is demonstrated with charge normalisation. Preliminary results indicate a resolution of 8 m and correction ratio 7 : 1. Backgrounds at the ILC comprise mainly electron-positron pairs from the beam-beam interaction. For the high luminosity 1 TeV accelerator parameters, 105 pairs are produced per bunch crossing. This is the worst case for ILC pair backgrounds. These pairs produce 5 105 particle hits on a <b>stripline</b> <b>of</b> the IP feedback BPM. In two experiments at End Station A (ESA) at SLAC, a stripline BPM was exposed to secondary particle backgrounds to determine if the particle hits degraded the ability <b>of</b> the <b>stripline</b> BPM to resolve micron-level position osets. The experiments agree that the worst ILC pair backgrounds degrade the resolution by less than 8. 5 nm (95 % confidence level). It is concluded that micron-level resolution will not be aected by the ILC pair backgrounds.
