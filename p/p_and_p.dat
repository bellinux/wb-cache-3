40|$|Piper {{species are}} used for spices, in {{traditional}} and processed forms of medicines, in cosmetic compounds, in cultural activities and insecticides. Here barcode analysis was performed for identification of plant parts, young plants and modified forms of plants. Thirty-six Piper species were collected and the three barcode regions, matK, rbcL and psbA-trnH spacer, were amplified, sequenced and aligned to determine their genetic distances. For intraspecific genetic distances, the most effective values for the species identification ranged from no difference to very low distance values. However, P. betle had the highest values at 0. 386 for the matK region. This finding {{may be due to}} P. betle being an economic and cultivated species, and thus is supported with growth factors, which may have affected its genetic distance. The interspecific genetic distances that were most effective for identification of different species were from the matK region and ranged from a low of 0. 002 in 27 paired species to a high of 0. 486. Eight species pairs, <b>P.</b> kraense <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> dominantinervium, <b>P.</b> magnibaccum <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> kraense, <b>P.</b> phuwuaense <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> dominantinervium, <b>P.</b> phuwuaense <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> kraense, <b>P.</b> pilobracteatum <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> dominantinervium, <b>P.</b> pilobracteatum <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> kraense, <b>P.</b> pilobracteatum <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> phuwuaense <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> sylvestre <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> polysyphonum, that presented a genetic distance of 0. 000 and were identified by independently using each of the other two regions.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a PCR procedure to amplify DNA for quick identification of the economically important species {{from each of the}} six taxonomic groups in the plant pathogen genus Phytophthora. This procedure involves amplification of the 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA gene and internal transcribed spacers (ITS) with the ITS primers ITS 5 and ITS 4. Restriction digests of the amplified DNA products were conducted with the restriction enzymes RsaI, MspI, and HaeIII. Restriction fragment patterns were similar after digestions with RsaI for the following species: <b>P.</b> capsici <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> citricola; <b>P.</b> infestans, <b>P.</b> cactorum, <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> mirabilis; <b>P.</b> fragariae, <b>P.</b> cinnamomi, <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> megasperma from peach; P. palmivora, <b>P.</b> citrophthora, <b>P.</b> erythroseptica, <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> cryptogea; <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> megasperma from raspberry <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> sojae. Restriction digests with MspI separated P. capsici from <b>P.</b> citricola <b>and</b> separated <b>P.</b> cactorum from <b>P.</b> infestans <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> mirabilis. Restriction digests with HaeIII separated P. citrophthora from P. cryptogea, P. cinnamomi from <b>P.</b> fragariae <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> megasperma on peach, P. palmivora from <b>P.</b> citrophthora, <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> megasperma on raspberry from <b>P.</b> sojae. <b>P.</b> infestans <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> mirabilis digests were identical <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> cryptogea <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> erythroseptica digests were identical with all restriction enzymes tested. A unique DNA sequence from the ITS region I in P. capsici was used to develop a primer called PCAP. The PCAP primer was used in PCRs with ITS 1 and amplified only isolates of <b>P.</b> capsici, <b>P.</b> citricola, <b>and</b> <b>P.</b> citrophthora <b>and</b> not 13 other species in the genus. Restriction digests with MspI separated P. capsici from the other two species.

40|$|The p 53 {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors, <b>p</b> 53, <b>p</b> 63, <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73, mediates both common and differential biological functions. While p 53 has its {{crucial role in}} tumor suppression, <b>p</b> 63 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 have essential functions in embryonic development and differentiation control. This dissertation describes the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis (ChIP -chip) to study the promoter specificity of <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73. A direct comparison of the promoter occupancy profiles of <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 was performed in the same cellular context, both at steady state and following hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. As expected, we found that <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 have overlapping <b>and</b> distinct promoter occupancy and target gene expression profiles under both conditions. Interestingly, HU appears to alter the promoter occupancy profile of p 73 more than that of p 53. Moreover, our results demonstrated that <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 are likely to associate with the same 250 bp genomic region in their overlapping promoters. Expression profiling in cells depleted for both <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 suggests that ̃ 10 % of the <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 binding sites show <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 - dependent transcriptional effects. Together with our motif analysis, our results suggest that <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 can also interact indirectly with the promoter-proximal region possibly via protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors. Chapter 1 introduces the common and differential functions of the <b>p</b> 53 family members <b>and</b> summarizes the current high-throughput technologies employed to identify protein-DNA interactions. Chapter 2 describes a small- scale comparison of <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 promoter occupancy profiles using the ChIP-DSL technology. Chapter 3 describes a detailed comparison of <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73 interactions with the promoter-proximal region using ChIP- coupled with the NimbleGen 1. 5 kb human promoter arrays. It also introduces a model-based algorithm and other bioinformatics tools for the identification and characterization of the in vivo binding sites of <b>p</b> 53 <b>and</b> <b>p</b> 73.
