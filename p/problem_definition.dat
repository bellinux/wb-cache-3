Because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population, the goal becomes finding a representative sample (or subset) of that population.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThis {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} complex adaptive system approach to propose effective <b>problem</b> <b>definitions</b> for <b>problems</b> {{that are hard}} to formulate, include conflicting opinions of stakeholders, and have hard to differentiate symptoms from the causes, that is, wicked problems. The traditional problem solving methods do not fully address the issues of the ambiguity and uncertainty associated with a wicked problem. The lack of clarity exposes wicked problems to perceptual biases resulting multiple mental models. These inherent characteristics of wicked problems require methods that are solely focused on identifying, defining, and evaluating discrepancies in perceptions. This dissertation proposes a framework, Quandary Translation Engineering, to address the unique challenges of defining a wicked problem. The framework, inspired from complex adaptive systems, utilizes the engineering method approach. The framework defines problem space as a way to capture the complexity of the wicked problem and creates an incremental and evolutionary model of the wicked problem. Next, the framework generates multiple possible <b>problem</b> <b>definitions</b> from the <b>problem</b> space. Finally, the framework provides measures for evaluating and selecting potential <b>problem</b> <b>definitions</b> from the pool of possible <b>problem</b> <b>definitions.</b> The framework is shown to be effective in defining, evaluating, and selecting <b>problem</b> <b>definitions</b> for wicked <b>problems</b> without relying on the completeness of data and any information about solutions. It was found that framework facilitates managers, decision makers, and analysts in modeling incomplete, vague, and conflicting information regarding a wicked problem. The proposed framework is applied to a Kansas strategic planning exercise for businesses in Kansas...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a framework for}} evaluating replica placement algorithms (RPA) for content delivery networks (CDN) as well as RPAs from other fields that might be applicable to current or future CDNs. First, the framework classifies and qualitatively compares RPAs using a generic set of primitives that capture <b>problem</b> <b>definitions</b> and heuristics. Second, it provides estimates for the decision times of RPAs using an analytic model. To achieve accuracy, the model takes into account disk accesses and message sizes, in addition to computational complexity and message numbers that have been considered traditionally. Third, it uses the "goodness" of produced placements to compare RPAs even when they have different <b>problem</b> <b>definitions.</b> Based on these evaluations, we identify open issues and potential areas for future research...|$|R
25|$|The draft {{acquisition}} goal is {{the description}} of the global goal that is to be achieved by starting procurement. It is inspired by the business needs or business strategy. It is similar, though simpler, to the concept of the project brief in PRINCE2. It is the first draft of the acquisition goal, containing at least a (short) <b>problem</b> <b>definition</b> and a (short) goal definition. The draft acquisition goal is meant to give the main reasons and the main goals to those people who will have to make the decision to actually start of the acquisition or not. It may thus also encapsulate items like a cost-benefit analysis, stakes & stakeholders and other items that will be further refined during the actual Acquisition Initiation.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} three novel {{contributions to}} knowledge engineering. First, we provide a structured approach {{for the development}} and adaptation of problem-solving methods. We start from very generic search strategies with weak data structures and add adapters that refine the states and state transitions of the search process and that add assumptions necessary to link the competence of a method with given <b>problem</b> <b>definitions</b> and domain knowledge. Second, we show how the usability-reusability trade-off of taskspecific versus task-independent problem-solving methods can easily be overcome by the virtual existence of specific methods. Third, we provide {{the concept of an}} integrated library combining reusable <b>problem</b> <b>definitions,</b> problem-solving methods, and adapters. 1 Introduction Problem-solving methods (PSMs) are used by most of the current knowledgeengineering frameworks (e. g.

What is the effect of different degrees of derusting of the steel (remaining corrosion scars, residual chloride) at the repair location on the corrosion behaviour of the reinforcement after the repair? How deep must the concrete excavation at the repair be in order to prevent reverse diffusion of chloride to the reinforcement in critial quantities?
