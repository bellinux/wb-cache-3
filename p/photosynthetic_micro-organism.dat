This {{can be achieved by}} engineering bioreceptive materials. Bioreceptivity is the susceptibility of a material to be colonised by living organisms. The aim of this research was to develop tiles made by sintering granular waste glass that were optimised for bioreceptivity of organisms capable of photosynthesis. Tiles were produced by pressing recycled soda-lime glass with a controlled particle size distribution and sintering compacted samples at temperatures between 680 and 740 °C. The primary bioreceptivity of the tiles was evaluated by quantifying colonisation by the algae Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), which was selected as a model <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>micro-organism.</b> Concentrations of C. vulgaris were measured using chlorophyll-a extraction. Relationships between bioreceptivity and the properties of the porous glass tile, including porosity, sorptivity, translucency and pH are reported. Capillary porosity and water sorptivity were the key factors influencing the bioreceptivity of porous glass. Maximum C. vulgaris growth and colonisation was obtained for tiles sintered at 700 °C, with chlorophyll-a concentrations reaching up to 11. 1 ± 0. 4 μg/cm 2 of tile. Bioreceptivity was positively correlated with sorptivity and porosity and negatively correlated with light transmittance. The research demonstrates that the microstructure of porous glass, determined by the processing conditions, significantly influences bioreceptivity. Porous glass tiles with high bioreceptivity that are colonised by photosynthetic algae have the potential to form carbon-negative façades for buildings and green infrastructure...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Microbial solar biofuels offer great prom-ise for future sustainable food, fuels and chemicals but {{are limited by}} low productivities and a requirement for large land areas to harvest sunlight. A 71 % increase in combined photosynthetic activity was achieved by illuminating both Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Ar-throspira (Spirulina) platensis from a single beam of simulated sunlight, divided using a dichroic mirror. Therefore, this technique is termed ‘dichroic beam-sharing’, in which the complementary action spectra of two different useful micro-organisms, belonging to green and purple groups, is exploited and allows a single beam of sunlight to be shared efficiently between separate photobioreactors. Because the action spectra of these two organisms are typical of large groups, this novel method could increase the produc-tivity of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> in the pro-duction of diverse commodities...|$|R

Both microalgal and cyanobacterial CCMs function to facil-itate CO 2 assimilation when Ci is limiting via active Ci uptake systems to increase internal Ci accumulation and carbonic anhydrase activity to provide elevated internal CO 2 concentrations through the dehydration of accumulated bicarbonate. These CCMs have been stud-ied over several decades, and details of the cyanobac-terial CCM function have emerged over recent years. However, significant advances in understanding of the microalgal CCM have been more recent. With the aid of mutational approaches and the availability of multiple microalgal genome sequences, an integrated picture of the functional components of the microalgal CCMs is emerging, together with the molecular details regarding the function and regulation of the CCM.

40|$|The role of {{microorganisms}} in microbialite formation remains unresolved: do they induce mineral precipitation (microbes first) {{or do they}} colonize and/or entrap abiotic mineral precipitates (minerals first) ? Does this role vary from one species to another? And what {{is the impact of}} mineral precipitation on microbial ecology? To explore potential biogenic carbonate precipitation, we studied cyanobacteria–carbonate assemblages in modern hydromagnesite-dominated microbialites from the alkaline Lake Alchichica (Mexico), by coupling three-dimensional imaging of molecular fluorescence emitted by microorganisms, using confocal laser scanning microscopy, and Raman scattering/spectrometry from the associated minerals at a microscale level. Both hydromagnesite and aragonite precipitate within a complex biofilm composed of photosynthetic and other microorganisms.

50|$|A closed {{ecosystem}} can {{be thought}} of as a mass balance between the major elements which are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus (CHONSP) which alone represent 95% of the mass to recycle. The conversion of waste elements to resources, which can be used by crewmembers can be achieved by two means: physiochemically or biologically. Physiochemical processes such as the Sabatier reaction would result in high efficiencies however a large amount of energy is required in terms of temperature and pressure. Whereas biologically, using photosynthesis, efficiencies are lower, however ambient temperatures and pressures can be used. Photosynthesis is the process whereby plants convert light energy into chemical energy of sugars and other organic compounds. The chemical reactions utilise carbon and water with the by-product of oxygen, released into the atmosphere. MELiSSA is partly based on these photosynthetic reactions: recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen. Higher plants (wheat, rice, salad) would be utilised to produce food for the crewmembers. <b>Photosynthetic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> would also be used to transform carbon dioxide into oxygen with the possibility of using the micro-organism of choice as part of the food intake, as an essential protein resource.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to estimate in vivo pigment composition and to retrieve absorption cross-section values, a∗, of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> using a non-invasive technique of reflectance spectrometry. To test the methodology, organisms from different taxonomical groups and different pigment composition were used (Spirulina platensis a Cyanophyta, Porphyridium cruentum a Rhodophyta, Dunaliella tertiolecta a Chlorophyta and Entomoneis paludosa a Bacillariophyta) and photoacclimated to two different irradiance levels: 25 μmol photon m− 2 s− 1 (Low Light, LL) and 500 μmol photon m− 2 s− 1 (High Light, HL). Second derivative spectra from reflectance were used to identify pigment in vivo absorption bands that were linked to specific pigments detected by high performance liquid chromatography. Whereas some absorption bands such as those induced by Chlorophyll (Chl) a (416, 440, 625 and around 675 nm) were ubiquous, others were taxonomically specific (e. g. 636 nm for Chl c in E. paludosa) and/or photo-physiological dependent (e. g. 489 nm for zeaxanthin in the HL-acclimated S. platensis). The optical absorption cross-section, a∗, was retrieved from reflectance data using a radiative transfer model previously developed for microphytobenthos. Despite the cellular Chl a decrease observed from LL to HL (up to 88 % for S. platensis), the a∗ increased, except for P. cruentum.

Micro-organisms within the device photosynthesise carbohydrates under illumination, and produce reductive equivalents (excess electrons) from both carbohydrate {{production and the}} subsequent carbohydrate break down. Redox mediators are utilised to shuttle electrons between the organism and the electrode. The mediator is reduced by the micro-organism and subsequently re-oxidised at the electrode. However this technology is {{in its early stages}} and extensive research is required for p-MFC devices to become economically viable. A basic p-MFC device containing a potassium ferricyanide mediator and the algae Chlorella vulgaris was assembled and tested. From these initial experiments it was realised that much more work was required to characterise cell and redox mediator activities occurring within the device. There is very little p-MFC literature dealing with cellular interaction with redox mediators, but without this knowledge the output of complete p-MFC devices can not be fully understood. This thesis presents research into the reduction of redox mediators by the micro-organisms, including rates of mediator reduction and factors affecting the rate. Both electrochemical and non-electrochemical techniques are used and results compared. Additionally, cellular effects relating to the presence of the mediator are studied; crucial to provide limits within which p-MFCs must be used. After basic characterisation, this thesis presents work into the optimisation of the basic p-MFC. Different redox mediators, photosynthetic species and anodic materials are investigated.

40|$|AbstractIn {{developing}} future fuels {{there is}} an opportunity to make use of advances in many fields of science and engineering to ensure that such fuels are sustainable in both production and utilization. One such advance is the use of synthetic biology to re-engineer <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> such that they are able to produce novel hydrocarbons directly from CO 2. Terpenes are a class of hydrocarbons that can be produced biologically and have potential as liquid transport fuels. This paper presents experimental studies on a compression ignition engine and spark ignition engine in which the combustion and emissions of 12 different terpenes that could potentially be produced by cyanobacteria were assessed as single components and blends with fossil diesel and fossil gasoline. The 12 terpenes were chosen to explore how small changes to the molecular structure of geraniol (a terpene most easily produced by cyanobacteria) impact on combustion and emissions. Furthermore, the toxicity of some of the best performing terpenes were assessed using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter, Synechocystis) as a prelude to a metabolic engineering programme. The compression ignition engine tests were carried out at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing, and the spark ignition engine tests were conducted at a constant spark timing and a constant lambda value of 1. Of the terpenes tested in the compression ignition engine, geranial and farnesene were found to be the best performing single component fuels in terms of combustion and emissions. In blends with fossil diesel, the presence of geranial or farnesene did not {{have a significant effect on}} combustion phasing up to a terpene content of 20 % (wt/wt), though levels of NOx and CO did increase. In the spark ignition engine experiments of terpene and fossil gasoline blends, citronellene and linalool were found to be soluble in fossil gasoline and combusted in a steady manner up to a terpene content of 45 % and 65 % (wt/wt) respectively. Of those terpenes with the most potential as either diesel or gasoline fuels, geraniol and geranial were found to be the most toxic to Synechocystis, with farnesene and linalool less toxic and citronellene having no detrimental effect. Addition of n-dodecane to the cultures was found to ameliorate the toxic effects of all five terpenes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObservations {{from the}} last decade suggest an {{important}} role of sea ice in the global biogeochemical cycles, promoted by (i) active biological and chemical processes within the sea ice; (ii) fluid and gas exchanges at the sea ice interface through an often permeable sea ice cover; and (iii) tight physical, biological and chemical interactions between the sea ice, the ocean and the atmosphere. <b>Photosynthetic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> in sea ice thrive in liquid brine inclusions encased in a pure ice matrix, where they find suitable light and nutrient levels. They extend the production season, provide a winter and early spring food source, and contribute to organic carbon export to depth. Under-ice and ice edge phytoplankton blooms occur when ice retreats, favoured by increasing light, stratification, and by the release of material into the water column. In particular, the release of iron - highly concentrated in sea ice - could have large effects in the iron-limited Southern Ocean. The export of inorganic carbon transport by brine sinking below the mixed layer, calcium carbonate precipitation in sea ice, as well as active ice-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes, could {{play a central role}} in the marine carbon cycle. Sea ice processes could also significantly contribute to the sulphur cycle through the large production by ice algae of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), the precursor of sulphate aerosols, which as cloud condensation nuclei have a potential cooling effect on the planet. Finally, the sea ice zone supports significant ocean-atmosphere methane (CH 4) fluxes, while saline ice surfaces activate springtime atmospheric bromine chemistry, setting ground for tropospheric ozone depletion events observed near both poles. All these mechanisms are generally known, but neither precisely understood nor quantified at large scales. As polar regions are rapidly changing, understanding the large-scale polar marine biogeochemical processes and their future evolution is of high priority. Earth system models should in this context prove essential, but they currently represent sea ice as biologically and chemically inert. Palaeoclimatic proxies are also relevant, in particular the sea ice proxies, inferring past sea ice conditions from glacial and marine sediment core records and providing analogues for future changes. Being highly constrained by marine biogeochemistry, sea ice proxies would not only contribute to but also benefit from a better understanding of polar marine biogeochemical cycles...|$|R
40|$|The secular cooling of {{the mantle}} {{and of the}} {{continental}} lithosphere trigger {{an increase in the}} area of emerged land. The corollary increase in weathering and erosion processes has major consequences for the evolution of Earth's external envelopes. We developed a physical model to evaluate the area of emerged land as a function of mantle temperature, continental area, and of the distribution of continental elevations. Our numerical results show that less than 15 % of Earth's surface consisted of emerged land {{by the end of the}} Archaean. This is consistent with many geological and geochemical observations. To estimate the secular cooling of the continental lithosphere, we combined thermo-mechanical models with eld observations. Our results, constrained by geological data, suggest that the Moho temperature has decreased by ~ 200 ºC over 2. 7 Ga in the Pilbara Craton. To evaluate the effect of continental growth on the evolution of the area of emerged land, we developed a model based on published thermal evolution models. Our results suggest that the area of emerged land was less than 5 % of Earth's surface in the Archaean, and that it does not depend on crustal growth. This allows to reconcile the evolution of oceanic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr with early crustal growth models. Continents are enriched in phosphorus, which is essential to the biosphere. The emergence of the continents would thus have triggered an increase in the production of oxygen by <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>micro-organisms,</b> possibly contributing to the oxidation of the atmosphere 2. 4 Ga ago. Le refroidissement seculaire du manteau terrestre et de la lithosphere continentale se traduit par l'augmentation de la surface de terres emergees.

Nos resultats numeriques montrent qu'a la fin de l'Archeen, moinsde 15 % de la surface terrestre etaient emergee, en accord avec nombre d'observations geologiques et geochimiques. Pour estimer le refroidissement seculaire de la lithosphere continentale, nous avons combine des modeles thermo-mecaniques avec des observations de terrain.

40|$|Les {{applications}} potentielles des cultures de microalgues et cyanobactéries en dépollution d'effluents dans des photobioréacteurs à membrane souffrent de performances limitées par un colmatage de l'élément filtrant dû en grande partie aux exopolysaccharides sécrétés par ces micro-organismes. Cette étude du laboratoire quantifie les effets de l'adsorption de ces polysaccharides sur des membranes organiques d'ultra et microfiltration tangentielle de matériaux et charges de surface différents. L'alginate de sodium est utilisé comme adsorbat modèle. Les membranes propres sont d'abord testées par une mesure de flux à l'eau pure, puis mises en contact avec une solution d'alginate durant un temps choisi. Le flux à l'eau pure des membranes après adsorption est ensuite à nouveau mesuré. La réduction relative du rayon de pore (ZEMAN, 1983) met en évidence l'effet de la mouillabilité et des charges superficielles. L'étude comparée de membranes d'ultra et microfiltration {{montre que}} cette réduction relative du rayon de pore augmente avec le seuil de coupure ou le diamètre de pore. L'effet de la concentration révèle aussi que la résistance hydraulique d'adsorption (MATTHIASSON, 1983) à l'équilibre évolue selon l'isotherme de LANGMUIR. Le modèle cinétique traduisant l'évolution de la résistance d'une membrane d'ultrafiltration proposé par BAKLOUTI et al. (1984), amélioré par AIMAR et al. (1988) puis discuté par RUIZ-BEVIÁ et al. (1997), est complété par un nouvel exposant agissant sur le facteur temps. La comparaison des résistances à l'écoulement de membranes de microfiltration avec celle d'une membrane d'ultrafiltration hydrophile neutre permet de dégager des critères de choix pour l'optimisation du fonctionnement d'un photobioréacteur à membrane utilisable en dépollution d'effluents. Potential applications of microalgae and cyanobacteria {{for treatment of}} wastewater effluents using membrane-photobioreactors suffer from limited performance due to fouling effects, mainly attributable to exocellular polysaccharides secreted by these micro-organisms. A membrane photobioreactor {{is defined as a}} process associating the culture of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> with a continuous separation by membrane filtration of the biomass and the water treated. The goal of the present laboratory-scale study was to quantify polysaccharide adsorption effects on organic membranes (ultra and microfiltration) characterised by different materials and surface charges. Sodium alginate was used as the "model adsorbate". Seven plane organic membranes were tested. The influence of membrane cut-off (or of pore diameters) {{as well as that of}} the material polyethersuphone (PES), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinilidene fluoride (PVDF) and of its properties (hydrophobicity, surface charges, …) were assessed. The study consisted of two parts : 1. the first part was concerned with the kinetics of alginate adsorption and the influence contact time and solute concentrations on the reduction of pore diameter (ZEMAN, 1983) or on the increase of hydraulic resistance (MATTHIASSON, 1983); 2. the second part dealt with adsorption equilibrium (formulations of LANGMUIR and FREUNDLICH). The study constituted the first step of a research program aimed at developing membrane photobioreactors for the treatment of specific industrial effluents. The fluid used to test the membranes was quality II pure water (ISO 3696 norm). Tangential velocities were set to 2. 5 m. s- 1, corresponding to a Reynolds number of 2500. To represent exopolysaccharides, we used alginic acid at concentrations of 1, 10 and 50 g, neutralised with sodium hydroxide at pH 9. New (or clean) membranes were first characterised through pure water flux measurements. J 0, the flux of pure water for a new membrane, was obtained (flowrate / unit of surface area), and then the membrane was kept in contact, for a definite duration, with the alginate solution. After adsorption and rinsing, the pure water flux was measured again. Ja, the pure water flux, was measured through the membrane after adsorption. Adsorption model at equilibrium:The effect of adsorption is quantified under the form of the relative pore size reduction as described by ZEMAN (1983) and included in the relation : ∆r / r= 1 - (Ja / Jo) 1 / 4. A variation of this quantification is that of the MATTHIASSON model (1983) applied to the pure water flux, based on DARCY's law expressing the relative value of the hydraulic resistance of the adsorbed layer Ra in relation to the intrinsic resistance of the membrane Rm : Ra / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1. To express adsorption phenomena at the solid/liquid interface of membranes, we used LANGMUIR's law together with MATTHIASSON's experimental observation (1983) : the relative resistance Ra / Rm due to adsorbed compounds is proportional to the mass "x" of solute adsorbed per unit of membrane surface area, x=Kx. Ra. If one assumes that the mass m of a homogeneous plane membrane per unit of membrane surface area is proportional to its adsorbing surface area Ω per unit of membrane surface area (m=Km. Ω), and if one combines the flux equations expressed by DARCY's and POISEUILLE's laws, then the result is m=K'm. Rm in a homogeneous membrane. Substituting x and m in LANGMUIR's law results in the equilibrium model Rae / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1 =a. c / (1 + bc) in which c=concentration of adsorbing solute; a and b are coefficients; and Rae is the resistance due to compounds adsorbed at equilibrium. Kinetic model: To show the evolution of membrane resistance with time, we suggest the introduction of an empirical exponent j over the time parameter in the AIMAR et al. model (1988). Results: The effect of changing the alginate concentration reveals that the hydraulic resistance of adsorption, at equilibrium, (MATTHIASSON, 1983) evolves according to LANGMUIR's isotherm. The relative decrease of pore radius ∆r / r in the presence of l g. l- 1 of sodium alginate shows that a quasi-plateau is obtained after two hours using the most hydrophobic membrane. The curves ∆r / r=f (t) for five membranes made of different materials, monitored during the transition phase before the plateau with common 1 g. l- 1 concentrations, reveal similar adsorption behaviour, characterised by the limiting common value ∆r / r= 0. 06 ± 0. 005. However, the uncharged hydrophilic membrane PAN 3038 stands out owing to a much lower ∆r / r value of 0. 09. This peculiar behaviour can also be observed in the influence of the alginate concentration: hydrophobic and charged hydrophilic membranes display a saturation effect with ∆r / r little affected by the increase of alginate concentration, whereas the uncharged hydrophilic membrane PAN 3038 displays a ∆r / r value three to six times lower with great sensitivity to concentration effects at concentrations below 10 g. l- 1. The model Rae / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1 =a. c / (1 + bc) is in agreement with the experimental results obtained with hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes. The proposed kinetic model shows that time dependence of R (t) does not seem to be linked to the nature of membranes. However, compared with concentration, R (c) is very sensitive to the nature of membranes. A comparative study of ultra and microfiltration membranes shows that the reduction in ∆r / r values increases with molecular weight cut-off (or pore diameter). Criteria for the choice of membranes: A comparative study of three polyacrylonitrile membranes reveals that membrane 3038 PAN (neutral) displays a very interesting, peculiar behaviour: its adsorption, expressed by ∆r / r or Rae/(Rae+Rm) is four to six times weaker than that of the other two. The surface charge of membranes seems to influence the intensity of adsorption in a significant way. Wetability also has a strong influence on adsorption. The sum of resistances Rae + Rm of ultrafiltration membrane 3038 PAN is only four times as great as those of hydrophobic microfiltration membranes. Experimentation already showed that, in the presence of microparticles, interactions between the layer of adsorbed alginate and microparticles will increase the likelihood of fouling of microfiltration membranes, decreasing their resistance down to the level of very little adsorbing ultrafiltration membrane IRIS 3038 (ROSSIGNOL et al., 1999). A culture system of marine microalgae in a membrane photobioreactor using ultrafiltration membrane IRIS 3038 PAN displayed a stable permeation flux during 6 weeks and easy regeneration, which meant adsorption was almost nil. The ability of some microalgae to assimilate ammonia nitrogen, nitrates and phosphates contained in waste water with excellent efficiencies (e. g., Phormidium bohneri: SYLVESTRE et al., 1996) allows one to consider using membrane photobioreactors in the treatment of home or industrial effluents. Other microalgae such as Chlorella salina (GARNHAM et al., 1992) are capable of fixing large amounts of heavy metals (Co, Mn, Zn, etc…); grown in membrane photobioreactors, they could depollute industrial effluents...|$|R
