40|$|Unbound base courses have a {{substantial}} influence on the load bearing behaviour of flexible highway constructions. Not enough {{is known about the}} stress-deformation behaviour of these courses, and this behaviour cannot be analysed correctly by calculation. First attempts have been made formulate material laws which describe the non-linear stress-deformation behaviour of the unbound base course materials. At present, however, {{it is not possible to}} state definitively how accurate these laws are or whether they are applicable in practice. The literature on this question was evaluated, the main emphasis being placed on the following areas: linear elastic and non-linear material laws for description of the material behaviour of TOB materials, presentation of various triaxial test installations, establishment of parameters for selected material models from the results of triaxial tests, comparison of computational results on the stress-deformation behaviour of unbound construction courses with measurement results from field studies which have been performed. It is necessary to determine <b>permissible</b> <b>stressing</b> characteristic values for the TOB materials. According to today's level of knowledge, triaxial tests are particularly well suited for establishment of these values.

For example, in Europe, structures are designed to conform with the Eurocodes: Steel structures are designed in accordance with EN 1993, and reinforced concrete structures to EN 1992. Australia, Canada, China, France, Indonesia, and New Zealand (among many others) utilise limit state theory in the development of their design codes.

50|$|This {{situation}} is magnified {{when the number}} of profiles available is restricted, which may explain the use of forms which are not theoretically optimal but which tend to subject the available profiles to the <b>permissible</b> <b>stress</b> σ (such as, for example, pylons for high-voltage electric lines or variable height truss bridges). For structures subject to pure bending, this also explains the use of flat plates of variable lengths added to the flanges of these I profiles to obtain the inertia or resisting moment required, with the greatest degree of accuracy. Conversely, the significant variety in the tubes available enables a relative deviation value c which is both smaller and more constant. They also cover a much wider range in both the lower and higher characteristic values. Since their geometric performance is practically identical to that of the I profiles, tubes are the most appropriate industrial solution in order to practically eliminate any increase in the volume indicator W. Nevertheless, practical issues of availability and corrosion may limit their use.|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point of the investigations {{presented in this paper}} is the simplified consideration of mean and residual stresses as well as the complete disregard of the complex failure mechanisms in the common fatigue standards and guidelines. An improved fatigue life assessment for welded components, which includes the crack initiation and propagation phase is the scope of this paper. The crack initiation phase is considered using the strain-life approach. The crack propagation life, starting from a technical crack of a depth of a = 0. 5 mm, is derived by the application of linear-elastic fracture mechanics. In this two-phase approach, the mean and residual stresses are considered by using damage parameters for the initiation phase and effective stress intensity factors for the propagation phase. With this approach, a better understanding can be obtained of the influence of mean- and residual stresses and their influence on the course (slope k and knee point Nk) of the S-N curve. With this information to hand, a more reliable fatigue assessment can be achieved than is possible with the common standards and guidelines.

The current design approach of the prestressed concrete sleeper relies on the <b>permissible</b> <b>stresses</b> over crosssectional area. Loading condition acting on railway sleepers is considered from axle burden and dynamic amplification factor. On the basis of Australian design of railway prestressed concrete sleepers, only service limit states are considered; however, the design challenge is to provide adequate resistance of certain cross sections to {{both positive and negative}} bending moments. In this paper, the service limit states functions are formulated taking into account the permissible compressive and tensile stresses at both initial and final stages, and applied positive and negative bending moments at railseat and middle sections. Random variables in the reliability analysis include railway track design parameters, axle load, material and geometrical properties, prestressing force and its losses, and model uncertainties regarded to the structural resistance and load effects. Statistical properties of related parameters are adopted from previous studies. Two analysis methods are used: first-order moment reliability method (FORM) and second-order moment reliability method (SORM). Sensitivity analyses of the reliability indices for flexural capacity according to the requirements of the limit states functions are also investigated, in order to evaluate the major influences of dynamic load factors, strengths of materials, track parameters, and model uncertainties...|$|R

Because of previous knowledge deficiencies, railway civil and track engineers {{have been aware of}} the conservative design methods for structural components in any railway track that rely on allowable stresses and material strength reductions. In particular, railway sleeper (or railroad tie) is an important component of railway tracks and is commonly made of prestressed concrete. The existing code for designing such components makes use of the <b>permissible</b> <b>stress</b> design concept, whereas the fiber stresses over cross sections at initial and final stages are limited by some empirical values.
