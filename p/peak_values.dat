25|$|The {{scope of}} {{application}} for DC capacitors is similarly diverse. Smoothing capacitors are used to reduce the AC component of fluctuating DC voltage (such as in power supplies for radio and television transmitters), and for high voltage testing equipment, DC controllers, measurement and control technology and cascaded circuits for generation of high DC voltage. Supporting capacitors, DC-filter or buffer circuit capacitors are used for energy storage in intermediate DC circuits, such as in frequency converters for poly-phase drives, and transistor and thyristor power converters. They {{must be able to}} absorb and release very high currents within short periods, the <b>peak</b> <b>values</b> of currents being substantially greater than the RMS values.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{effective}} method for low perming error of fluxgates is {{to enlarge the}} <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> of the excitation current, but large amplitude excitation will increase the power consumption. A narrow pulse excitation current with sufficient <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> can reduce perming error with low power consumption while increase {{the difficulty of the}} signal processing with low sensitivity. The perfected excitation waveform with high ratio of <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> to RMS value by careful excitation tuning is an efficient solution. This paper presents a novel circuit which can generate an excitation current waveform with high <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> and low RMS value for fluxgates. Different from the tuned excitation circuit, the proposed circuit is a combination of an integrator and a differentiator with the same squarewave input. The excitation signal is the sum of a triangle wave and a sharp narrow pulse signal. It is easy to adjust the <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> of the narrow pulses for perming error study and no careful tune adjusting is needed. Finally, in case of the fixed <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> of the narrow pulses, an improved excitation circuit with only two resistors, two capacitors and one amplifier is also presented in the paper. The experiment results show that 0. 5 nT perming error can be achieved for 10 mT shock...|$|R

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{usefulness}} {{in carrying out}} power calculations, listed voltages for power outlets (e.g., 120 V in the USA, or 230 V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not <b>peak</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Peak</b> <b>values</b> can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies V = VRMS × √2, assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120 × √2, or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts. A similar calculation indicates that the peak mains voltage in Europe is about 325 volts, and the peak-to-peak mains voltage, about 650 volts.|$|E
