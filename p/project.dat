The SEC alleges that Dargey diverted funds from the <b>project</b> for his own personal uses, including the purchase of his Bellevue home and gambling. The <b>project</b> was then transferred to a court-appointed receiver and later stripped of its EB-5 eligibility. In May 2016, the presiding judge approved a plan by two firms to buy out Dargey's share of the <b>project</b> and restart construction, pending approval from EB-5 investors; in October, the two companies signed an agreement to restart construction and re-brand the <b>project.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a {{report for the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the first}} attempt at creating a Central Valley <b>Project.</b> In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water <b>project,</b> but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley <b>Project</b> Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for the <b>project.</b> Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the <b>project.</b> This resulted in several transfers of the <b>project</b> between California and the federal government, and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the <b>project</b> started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of the <b>project</b> were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.|$|E

In addition, there were difficulties arising out of negotiations about technology transfer and production workshare, and a weak business case. STAe, having previously expressed doubts about returns on the <b>project,</b> in 1998 withdrew from the <b>project</b> out of the failure between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement; Airbus and AVIC would cancel the <b>project</b> in July that year.
