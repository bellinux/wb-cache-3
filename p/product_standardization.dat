40|$|AbstractIn India, herbal {{medicines}} {{are mainly}} {{based on the}} Ayurvedic system. The main drawback of traditional medicines {{is a lack of}} standardized <b>products.</b> <b>Standardization</b> of any herbal formulation is essential in order to assess the quality, purity, safety, and efficacy of drugs based on the analysis of their active properties. Testing of Ayurvedic preparations using scientific methodologies will add to quality and authenticity of the product. This article reports standardization parameters for Hutabhugādi cūrṇa (HC) used traditionally in the treatment of Agnimāndya (digestive impairment), Pāndu (anemia), Sopha (edema), and Ārsa (piles). The formulation was prepared as per Ayurvedic Formulary of India, and it was standardized by organoleptic characterization, macro–microscopic evaluation, physicochemical testing, and thin-layer chromatography/high-performance thin-layer chromatography profiling employing a standard methodology. Results of the experiments conducted provided diagnostic characteristics to identify and standardize the formulation prepared using official ingredients of HC. Based on the data obtained, a monograph on quality standards for HC is proposed. The monograph based on the present investigation results would serve as a document to control the quality of HC...|$|R
5000|$|Commodity {{computing}} (also {{known as}} commodity cluster computing) {{involves the use}} of large numbers of already-available computing components for parallel computing, to get the greatest amount of useful computation at low cost. It is computing done in commodity computers as opposed to in high-cost superminicomputers or in boutique computers. Commodity computers are computer systems - manufactured by multiple vendors - incorporating components based on open standards. Such systems are said to be based on commodity components, since the standardization process promotes lower costs and less differentiation among vendors' <b>products.</b> <b>Standardization</b> and decreased differentiation lower the switching or exit cost from any given vendor, increasing purchasers' leverage and preventing lock-in. A governing principle of commodity computing is that it is preferable to have more low-performance, low-cost hardware working in parallel (scalar computing) (e.g. AMD x86 [...] CISC) than to have fewer high-performance, high-cost hardware items (e.g. IBM POWER7 or Sun-Oracle's SPARC RISC). At some point, the number of discrete systems in a cluster will be greater than the mean time between failures (MTBF) for any hardware platform, no matter how reliable, so fault tolerance must be built into the controlling software.Purchases should be optimized on cost-per-unit-of-performance, not just on absolute performance-per-CPU at any cost.|$|R
40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} capital budgeting methods. Based on 115 {{responses from}} a cross-sectional survey and two approaches to contingency fit, this study produces three basic findings. First, both {{discounted cash flow}} (DCF) techniques and nonfinancial measures are widely used in capital budgeting. However, DCF techniques {{are more important than}} nonfinancial measures, and nonfinancial measures appear to serve as a partial substitute when DCF analysis is less efficient. Second, DCF techniques and nonfinancial measures are not unconditionally appropriate. Although the impact of firm strategy on capital budgeting methods is not supported by the present results, the study shows that <b>product</b> <b>standardization</b> affects both capital budgeting methods, as hypothesized. Firms with high <b>product</b> <b>standardization</b> tend to place more emphasis on DCF analysis, while firms with low standardization are more likely to focus on nonfinancial measures. Third, an appropriate fit under contingency theory between <b>product</b> <b>standardization</b> and the two capital budgeting methods is significantly associated with a firm's satisfaction with the capital budgeting process.

This research used purposive sampling method to collect data. The research population was manufacturing firms listed in BEI and major non listed firms located in Jawa Tengah and got 35 responses.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} for companies is {{to combine the}} high flexibility required to operate according to customer needs and wishes with {{the high level of}} efficiency required to stay competitive in terms of costs. Recent research on supply chain management suggests that companies in highly dynamic industries need not only to constantly develop their supply chain, but also simultaneously develop their product structure and their manufacturing process. In this paper we explore ways in which a company can create competitive advantage in a mature industry through a Build to Order Supply Chain. We carried out an in-depth case study covering (i) a global company producing and selling heavy industrial equipment, (ii) three of its industrial customers, each one representing different customer segments, and (iii) its two-level supply network. Based on the case study analysis, we propose that companies in a build-to-order environment can differentiate in two dimensions of performance: delivery time and the degree of product customization. There is a trade-off between the two dimensions: if the customer requires a highly customized product, it takes longer to engineer and make it, and vice versa. In order to deal with this trade-off in a way that benefits both the customer and the supplier, we propose a model to support the supplier’s decision making. The crucial elements of the model are early supplier involvement, <b>product</b> <b>standardization,</b> and a downstream order penetration point. Early involvement in product specification makes it possible to compete effectively in a time-sensitive customer segment and to develop <b>product</b> <b>standardization.</b> <b>Product</b> <b>standardization</b> makes it possible to move the order penetration point downstream. Further, downstream order penetration makes it possible to effectively differentiate by providing fast, flexible deliveries to customers. <b>Product</b> <b>standardization</b> allows simultaneously driving the process costs down. 1 (20) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of the idea}} of global village has caused similar lifestyles and ways of thinking everywhere. The similarity of customer needs {{in various parts of the}} globe is the main stimulus for <b>standardization</b> of <b>products</b> and/or services. <b>Standardization</b> of <b>products</b> and <b>standardization</b> of consumer behavior patterns have contributed to the creation of a new group of products - global products. Searching for global products by customers worldwide has a significant impact on the <b>standardization</b> of <b>products.</b> Global products are mostly purchased by young people, a cosmopolitan attitude to life. Globalization processes in the global economy significantly influenced the process of unification of the market, customer needs unification and unification of manufacturing products. The group of global products mainly include: (1) high-tech (high-technology products including computers), (2) high-touch (products with high emotional value including luxury jewelry, luxury clothing), (3) universal products most frequently purchased (including soft drinks, cigarettes), and (4) specialty products (such as building tools, medical equipment).
