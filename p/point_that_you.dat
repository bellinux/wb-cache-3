2500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics. Sounds praised the album on its release. Kevin Murphy wrote, [...] "Tinderbox romps and swoons {{with all the}} majesty of Dreamhouse", and added, [...] "it's a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette." [...] Jon Savage also hailed the record in Spin magazine: [...] "Its scope, ease, and assurance make it a good collection for the Banshees to relaunch themselves into the international market this spring. Carruthers fits in to the <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't {{know there was a}} change, and Budgie's drumming is superb. Apart from the singles [...] "Cities in Dust" [...] and [...] "Candyman" [...] (which perpetuates the Banshees' sinister view of childhood), the sparks fly on the crystal clear [...] "Cannons" [...] and the unsettling [...] "Parties Fall".|$|E
2500|$|Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read [...] "we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, {{leading up to the}} <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> betray her and do the most intimate act you can do with someone—murdering them in cold blood", he at first noted that [...] "on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical", but also noted that [...] "a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about [...] "murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents". He wrote [...] "nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship". He called her [...] "just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design" [...] and that [...] "this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote [...] "I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me".|$|E

Yes, you have--and more. For in four years, with a year still to spare, you have sold the 250,000 volumes, and 240,000 besides.|$|E

I have not seen my daughter since I heard of this madness--hear me out if you please, sir--since I heard of this madness, but her mother tells me that she is quite aware of that fact. Your coming to me with such a proposition is an absurdity if it is nothing worse. Now you must do one of two things, Mr. Saul. You must either promise me that this shall be at an end altogether, or you must leave the parish." ...|$|E

She had moreover at once gone on.

6000|$|The first I shall mention, is touched at in {{a letter}} which I {{received}} from one of you, gentlemen, about the highways; which, indeed, are almost everywhere scandalously neglected. I know a very rich man in this city, a true lover and saver of his money, who, being possessed of some adjacent lands, hath been at great charge in repairing effectually the roads that lead to them; and has assured me that his lands are thereby advanced four or five shillings an acre, by which he gets treble interest. But, generally speaking, all over the kingdom the roads are deplorable; and, what is more particularly barbarous, there is no sort of provision made for travellers on foot; no, not near this city, except in a very few places, and in a most wretched manner: whereas the English are so particularly careful in this <b>point,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may travel there an hundred miles with less inconvenience than one mile here. But, since this may be thought too great a reformation, I shall only speak of roads for horses, carriages, and cattle.[97] ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was good}} {{to see how the}} little knight, the most moral and calm of men, was {{compelled}} to receive Mr. Slang's stories and the frightened air with which, at the conclusion of one of them, he would venture upon a commendatory grin. His lady, on her part too, had been laboriously civil; and, on the occasion on which I had the honour of meeting this gentleman and Mrs. Walker, it was the latter who gave the signal for withdrawing to the lady of the house, by saying, [...] "I think, Lady Thrum, it is quite time for us to retire." [...] Some exquisite joke of Mr. Slang's was the cause of this abrupt disappearance. But, as they went upstairs to the drawing-room, Lady Thrum took occasion to say, [...] "My dear, in the course of your profession you will have to submit to many such familiarities on the part of persons of low breeding, such as I fear Mr. Slang is. But let me caution you against giving way to your temper as you did. Did you not perceive that I never allowed him to see my inward dissatisfaction? And I make it a particular <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should be very civil to him to-night. Your interests--our interests depend upon it." ...|$|E

'I have {{no means}} of judging how long you have been {{following}} this unhappy course; I had rather believe it is of recent adoption, but I {{do not know how}} to reconcile this idea with the magnitude of your demand, unless your downward progress has been more rapid than usual in such beginnings. It would, I fear, be quite vain for me to urge upon you all the arguments and reasons that ought to have been present to your mind, and prevented you from taking the first fatal step. I can only entreat you to pause, and consider the ruin and degradation to which this hateful vice almost invariably conducts its victims, and consistently with my duty as your guardian, everything in my power shall be done to extricate you from the embarrassments in which you have involved yourself. But, in the first place, I make it a <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> treat me with perfect confidence, and make a full, unequivocal statement of your proceedings; above all, that you explain the circumstances, occasioning your request for this large sum. Remember, I say, complete candour on your part will afford the only means of rescuing you from difficulties, or of in any degree restoring you to my good opinion.' ...|$|E

60|$|This {{brought on}} a {{tremendous}} tussle, for Mr. G. {{was of the}} same mind, and perhaps for {{the same sort of}} reason, as Joseph de Maistre, that contempt for Locke is the beginning of knowledge. All very well for De Maistre, but not for a man in line with European liberalism. I pressed the very obvious <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must take into account not only a man’s intellectual product or his general stature, but also (M169) his influence as a historic force. From {{the point of view of}} influence Locke was the origin of the emancipatory movement of the eighteenth century abroad, and laid the philosophic foundations of liberalism in civil government at home. Mr. G. insisted on a passage of Hume’s which he believed to be in the history, disparaging Locke as a metaphysical thinker.(292) “That may be,” said I, “though Hume in his Essays is not above paying many compliments to ‘the great reasoner,’ etc., to whom, for that matter, I fancy that he stood in pretty direct relation. But far be it from me to deny that Hume saw deeper than Locke into the metaphysical millstone. That is not the point. I’m only thinking of his historic place, and, after all, the history of philosophy is itself a philosophy.” To minds nursed in dogmatic schools, all this is both unpalatable and incredible.|$|E
