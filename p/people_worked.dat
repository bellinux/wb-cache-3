Up to 70 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> on the line, in addition to station employees. In 1932, the operations were rationalized, cutting costs from NOK426,000 to NOK310,000 per year. This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and replacing them with a clerk.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the legal}} {{right-of-way}} was cleared by January 1974, cold weather, {{the need to}} hire workers, and construction of the Dalton Highway meant work on the pipeline itself did not begin until March. Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first barrel of oil reached Valdez, {{tens of thousands of}} <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> on the pipeline. Thousands of workers came to Alaska, attracted by the prospect of high-paying jobs {{at a time when most}} of the rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E

5|$|At its peak, around 250 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> at the Chehalis plant, but {{operation}} gradually {{moved to}} the main Trek factory in Wisconsin. In 2001, a workforce of around 70 people produced 15,000 to 20,000 frames a year. In 2002, all production {{moved to the}} Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Bikes were still sold under the Klein name until around 2009 in Japan, but widespread distribution ceased circa 2007 in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Crawley {{was already}} a modest {{industrial}} centre {{by the end of}} the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories. In 1949, 1,529 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, filming {{moved to}} the Ciudad de la Luz {{audiovisual}} complex in Alicante, Spain. Shooting areas included the complex's large water tank, and a nearby beach. The complex was booked from August 22, 2011, through to December 10, 2011, and set construction occurred from August until late September. Approximately 250 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> on the three-month-long Spain shoot, generating over €1 million in the local economy. Filming also {{took place in the}} Wadi Rum valley in Jordan.|$|E

5|$|On {{a typical}} weekday, a {{combined}} total of 50,000 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> in the North and South Towers, with another 200,000 passing through as visitors. The complex was {{so large that}} it had its own zip code: 10048. The Windows on the World restaurant, located {{on top of the}} North Tower, reported revenues of $37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States. The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in movies, television shows, postcards, and other merchandise. The towers came {{to be seen as a}} New York City icon, much like the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|Time {{constraints}} prevented {{many elements}} from {{appearing in the}} final game. One such missing feature was a fatality system by which Spartans or Covenant leaders could inflict massive damage on large groups of units. Pottinger said that the animations, while interesting, did not mesh with the fast-paced combat of Halo Wars and raised balance concerns. Other elements based on Halo fiction did not work in a strategy game. Although more than 100 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> on the project, which cost {{tens of millions of}} dollars, a Covenant campaign was never realized {{because of a lack of}} manpower and money.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth. New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter {{in the direction of}} the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar's hideout in the caves.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{building}} the dam received {{an average of}} 80¢ an hour; the payroll for the dam was among {{the largest in the}} nation. The workers were mainly pulled from Grant, Lincoln, Douglas, and Okanogan counties and women were allowed to work only in the dorms and the cookhouse. Around 8,000 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> on the project, and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer. Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from the contractors. Orin G. Patch served as the chief of concrete. Construction conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} of his partial term in 1942, Chandler faced a challenge from former ally John Y. Brown, Sr. in the Democratic primary. As {{a result of}} his votes on the anti-lynching bill and the poll tax repeal, the Louisville chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored <b>People</b> <b>worked</b> against his re-election effort. During the campaign, Brown accused Chandler of abusing his power, including having a swimming pool installed at his home in violation of the federal rationing provisions implemented during World War II. Chandler invited the Truman Committee to investigate the installation of the pool; the committee found no violations of the federal rationing provisions. Chandler went on to defeat Brown and was easily re-elected in the general election over Republican Richard J. Colbert.|$|E

Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and many other people came to the scene in response to the pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived on the scene, as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the St. Lawrence facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,200 {{writers and}} specialists {{contributed to the}} encyclopedia, one fifth of whom were foreign experts in Bangladesh or experts working abroad. They are mostly academics, as well as specialists in districts and upazilas for {{locality}} inputs and people from professions and occupations. District and upazila cartography has been processed at the Geographic information system (GIS) and cartographic laboratory {{set up for the}} Banglapedia. A gazetteer group was created to focus on districts and upazilas. The fact that around 400 local intellectuals were charged with writing about their respective zillas and upazilas was described as a unique approach to information gathering. In addition, 250 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> in research management for seven years. A total of 2,000 scholars and technicians were involved. There were 270 full-time personnel on the project in all, with 35 to 40 people employed at any given time.|$|E
5|$|Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård {{started in}} 1920. The final cost {{estimate}} was NOK2.82 million {{and the plan}} was passed by Parliament on 20 July 1921, with construction commencing on 21 December. The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke. Between 200 and 250 <b>people</b> <b>worked</b> on the line during construction. Because of the recession, the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from Stavanger and nearly all had families to support. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård. The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.|$|E
