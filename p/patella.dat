5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating <b>patella.</b> This {{condition}} is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the <b>patella</b> runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E
40|$|Patellar {{luxation}} (PL) {{is one of}} {{the major}} hereditary orthopaedic abnormalities observed in a variety of dog breeds. When the <b>patellae</b> move sideways out of the trochlear groove, this is called PL. The PL score varies between dogs from normal to very severe. Reducing the prevalence of PL by breeding could prevent surgery, thereby improve welfare. Orthopaedic specialists differentiate between normal and loose <b>patellae,</b> where the <b>patellae</b> can be moved to the edge of the trochlear groove, considering scoring loose <b>patellae</b> as normal in the future. Loose <b>patellae</b> are considered acceptable for breeding so far by the breeding organization. The aim of this study was to analyse the genetic background of PL to decide on the importance of loose <b>patellae</b> when breeding for healthy dogs. Data are available from two dog breeds, that is Flat-coated Retrievers (n = 3808) and Kooiker dogs (n = 794), with a total of 4602 dogs. Results show that loose <b>patellae</b> indicate that dogs are genetically more susceptible to develop PL because family members of the dogs with loose <b>patellae</b> showed more severe PL. In addition, the estimated breeding values for dogs with loose <b>patellae</b> indicate that breeding values of dogs with loose <b>patellae</b> were worse than breeding values obtained for dogs with a normal score. Given these results, it is advised to orthopaedic specialists to continue to score loose <b>patellae</b> as a separate class and to dog breeders to minimize the use of dogs in breeding with a genetically higher susceptibility for P...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between joint mobility and chondromalacia <b>patellae</b> {{was reported in}} a prospective study. A total of 115 patients with chondromalacia <b>patellae</b> were compared with 110 healthy individuals without chondromalacia <b>patellae,</b> matched for age and sex, {{who served as a}} control group. The degree of joint mobility was scored on a scale of 0 – 9. The number of individuals with hypermobile joints and the total mobility scores were significantly higher in patients with chondromalacia <b>patellae</b> when compared to the control group (P< 0. 001). There were more hypermobile knees among knee joints with chon-dromalacia <b>patellae</b> when compared with the knees of the control group (P< 0. 01). Chondromalacia <b>patellae</b> were bilateral in 57 % of our patients. It occurred more frequently in the longer leg and was associated with quadriceps muscle wasting in 50 % of patients. Flat feet and backache were reported significantly more often in patients compared with the control group (P< 0. 05). It is concluded that hypermobility of the knee joint may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of chondromalacia <b>patellae.</b> KEY WORDS: Hypermobility, Chondromalacia <b>patellae.</b> THE first clinical description of joint hypermobility was attributed to Hippocrates in the 4 th century BC [1].

40|$|AbstractPurposeChondromalacia <b>patellae</b> is {{a common}} cause of {{anterior}} knee pain in young patients and can be detected noninvasively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the correlation between subcutaneous fat thickness around the knee joint on axial MRIs as {{a surrogate marker of}} obesity, with {{the presence or absence of}} chondromalacia <b>patellae.</b> MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of knee MRIs in 170 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria. Imaging was performed over a 12 -month period on a 1. 5 T MRI system with a dedicated extremity coil. Two radiologists experienced in musculoskeletal imaging assessed each examination in consensus for the presence or absence of chondromalacia <b>patellae</b> and graded positive studies from 0 (absent) to 3 (full cartilage thickness defect). Measurement of subcutaneous knee fat thickness was obtained on the medial aspect of the knee. ResultsMRI findings of chondromalacia <b>patellae</b> were present in 33 patients (19. 4 %), of which, there were 11 grade 1 lesions (33. 3 %), 9  grade 2 lesions (27. 3 %), and 13 grade 3 lesions (39. 4 %). The mean subcutaneous knee fat thickness was significantly higher in the chondromalacia <b>patellae</b> group for all grades compared with the normal group (P <. 001), and there was a significant correlation between subcutaneous knee fat thickness and grades of chondromalacia <b>patellae</b> (R = 0. 48 [95 % confidence interval, 0. 38 - 0. 68]; P <. 001).

5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose is to reduce friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the <b>patella</b> and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E

It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher.

5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating <b>patella,</b> is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened.

5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating <b>patella,</b> and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

Despite this academic distinction, the diagnosis of PFPS is typically made clinically, based only on the history and physical examination {{rather than on the}} results of any medical imaging. Therefore, it is unknown whether most persons with a diagnosis of PFPS have cartilage damage or not, making the difference between PFPS and chondromalacia theoretical rather than practical.

Lavoy Allen scored 17 points and had 13 rebounds for Temple Owls, but Duke increased their lead against the Owls with a second half run.|$|E
5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for <b>patella</b> luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E

The Jets opened the 2010 season with a 5–1 record despite the passing game being subpar as Sanchez struggled to accurately throw the football. Sanchez recorded his first career 300-yard passing game in a win over the Detroit Lions on November 7, 2010. At 10–4, the Jets faced the Chicago Bears on December 26, 2010 {{with a chance to}} clinch a playoff berth. Though Sanchez injured his shoulder in a victory over Pittsburgh the previous week, he started the game completing 24 of his 37 passes for a touchdown and an interception. However, the Jets were unable to defend the Bears' offense and subsequently lost the game 38–34 after a comeback drive was halted when Sanchez was intercepted. Due to a loss by the Jacksonville Jaguars that same day, the Jets clinched the playoff berth. Sanchez finished the season with 3,291 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.|$|E

5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), <b>patella,</b> stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the <b>patella,</b> which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
