40|$|AbstractThere {{has always}} been an {{interest}} in analyzing the effects of fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> the main macroeconomic variables such as GDP, inflation, interest rate, employment, but compared with the empirical literature on the effects of monetary <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> economic <b>activity,</b> fiscal <b>policy</b> has received less attention. With the recent economic recession fiscal policy was regarded with more interest since it was expected to be effective in economic recovery. An approach commonly used to estimate the effects of fiscal <b>policy</b> shocks <b>on</b> economic <b>activity</b> is based <b>on</b> vector autoregressive (VAR) models with different scheme of identification of the shocks. This paper analyzes the effects of a government expenditure shock and tax revenue shock <b>on</b> economic <b>activity</b> by applying a VAR methodology to Romanian data. For identification of fiscal policy shocks I first used a recursive approach (Cholesky decomposition) and second I apply the methodology proposed by Perotti (2002), based on Blanchard and Perotti (1999). The results obtained are consistent with other studies on emergent economies. The impact of fiscal shocks on macroeconomic variable is reduced and the fiscal multipliers are very small...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the second}} of two Bulletin {{articles}} on the transmission mechanism of New Zealand monetary policy. In the first article (Drew and Sethi 2007), we described this mechanism, detailing {{the process by which}} changes in the Reserve Bank’s primary monetary policy instrument, the Official Cash Rate (OCR), eventually influence the general level of prices. This article examines how certain aspects of the transmission mechanism have changed over time. Assessing these changes is especially topical given that, in the estimation of some commentators, the most recent period of monetary tightening has witnessed policy that has been less effective at dampening inflation than previously. We briefly review the case for these claims and catalogue evidence from several sources to show that the overall impact of monetary <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> <b>activity</b> and inflation has not obviously weakened, and that some intermediate links in the mechanism may have, in fact, strengthened over the past decade. ...|$|R
