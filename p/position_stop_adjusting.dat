40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} pegorming interim sample size reestimation based on the observed treatment difference in clinical trials. The approach combines the advan-tages of the group sequential and sample size reestimation methods and provides an efficient design for clinical trials. It provides flexibility but still maintains {{the integrity of the}} trial. To control the overall type I error level, a method is proposed to adjust the group sequential <b>stopping</b> boundaries <b>adjusted</b> for sample size reestimation and negative <b>stops.</b> The <b>adjusted</b> <b>stopping</b> boundaries are flexible to different rules of sample size reestimation and reuse the alpha values saved by negative stops. The adjustment is based on the exact type 1 error change and, therefore, the penalty for the type I error inflation due to such an interim reestimation is kept to a minimum. The eflciency of sample size reestimation without positive stops is compared with the group sequential method using unconditional power and expected sample size. All results are based on sufficient mathe-matical justifications...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{economical}} design of an X chart for a short-run production. The process mean starts equal to [mu] 0 (in-control, State I) and in a random time it shifts to [mu] 1 >[mu] 0 (out-of-control, State II). The monitoring procedure consists of inspecting a single item at every m produced ones. If the measurement of the quality characteristic does not meet the control limits, the process is <b>stopped,</b> <b>adjusted,</b> and additional (r- 1) items are inspected retrospectively. The probabilistic model was developed considering only shifts in the process mean. A direct search technique is applied to find the optimum parameters which minimizes the expected cost function. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed procedure. Short-run production On-line process control Process control for variables Markov chain...|$|R

40|$|A {{resilient}} soft liner (RSL) {{has been}} used in processed complete dentures but controlling its thickness has always been a challenge because of uneven reduction of the denture’s intaglio surface. Use of a thermoplastic vacuum-formed template and an endodontic K-file, as guides, for the reduction of a processed mandibular complete denture to receive RSL is described in the present report. A processed mandibular complete denture is prepared by reducing its borders and drilling holes in its surface. A thermoplastic sheet adapted to the intaglio surface and an endodontic K-file with rubber <b>stop</b> <b>adjusted</b> to the desired dimension are used as guides to the reduction procedure and allows intermittent measuring of the reduced areas. This technique helps in reducing the processed denture’s intaglio surface in a controlled manner thus maintaining the strength of the denture base and effectiveness of soft liner.
