The Chief of Defence of Norway declassified all military personnel from their <b>professional</b> <b>secrecy</b> regarding the incident.

40|$|Aim: Current Italian {{legislation}} obliges {{employers to}} prevent {{workers who are}} occupationally at risk or who perform jobs that may be hazardous for the safety or health of third parties from consuming alcohol. The LaRA Group has set out to assess whether the law fully safeguards {{the health and safety}} of both workers and third parties, without impinging upon the civil rights of workers. Method: A written document expressing agreement was produced following discussions between doctors, lawyers, bioethicists and social partners. Results: There are gaps and inconsistencies in current laws; the differences in local and regional provisions prevent authorities from applying a single strategy at national level. There should be a change in existing rules under which the employer’s obligation to enforce the ban on drinking alcohol in the workplace is enacted solely by the “competent” physician whose institutional role is to safeguard and promote health. Some occupational categories that are subject to a ban on alcohol drinking do not currently undergo health surveillance. For example, if road transport drivers are not exposed to a specific occupational risk foreseen under another law, they can be placed under health surveillance only in those regions where the local laws contemplate this type of control. In other cases, the practice of assessing the risk to third parties and providing for compulsory health surveillance in the Risk Assessment Document, is considered by some jurists to be a "consuetudo praeter legem" and therefore acceptable in a field not yet covered by a specific law, but to be "contra legem” or unlawful by other jurists. Moreover, the competent physician who uses a breathanalyser or tests for alcohol addiction faces an ethical dilemma, since by communicating the results to an employer or authorities responsible for the issuing of licenses, he may be violating his <b>professional</b> oath of <b>secrecy.</b> Furthermore, the emphasis placed on testing has induced companies and inspectors to overlook educational and rehabilitation aspects. It is essential to involve general practitioners, educators and specialist services in addressing the problems of alcohol abuse so as to inform/train, recover and rehabilitate. The few studies available indicate that the rules are poorly enforced and that non-compliance may go unobserved. Conclusions: The Group urges all employers to assess the risk for third parties caused by alcohol abuse and to devise a policy on alcohol. Controlling alcohol-related risks in the workplace calls for a better definition of the roles of Vigilance Bodies and Competent Physicians together with a shift from a reactive to a proactive attitude of all the parties involved...|$|R

6000|$|A day or {{two later}} it was known {{throughout}} the town that Zaidee Hooker had sued Adoniram Hotchkiss for breach of promise, and that the damages were laid at five thousand dollars. As in those bucolic days the Western press was under the secure censorship of a revolver, a cautious tone of criticism prevailed, and any gossip was confined to personal expression, and even then {{at the risk of}} the gossiper. Nevertheless, the situation provoked the intensest curiosity. The Colonel was approached--until his statement that he should consider any attempt to overcome his <b>professional</b> <b>secrecy</b> a personal reflection withheld further advances. The community were left to the more ostentatious information of the defendant's counsel, Messrs. Kitcham and Bilser, that the case was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "rotten," [...] that the plaintiff would be nonsuited, and the fire-eating Starbottle would be taught a lesson that he could not [...] "bully" [...] the law, and there were some dark hints of a conspiracy. It was even hinted that the [...] "case" [...] was the revengeful and preposterous outcome of the refusal of Hotchkiss to pay Starbottle an extravagant fee for his late services to the Ditch Company. It is unnecessary to say that these words were not reported to the Colonel. It was, however, an unfortunate circumstance for the calmer, ethical consideration of the subject that the Church sided with Hotchkiss, as this provoked an equal adherence to the plaintiff and Starbottle {{on the part of the}} larger body of non-churchgoers, who were delighted at a possible exposure of the weakness of religious rectitude. [...] "I've allus had my suspicions o' them early candle-light meetings down at that gospel shop," [...] said one critic, [...] "and I reckon Deacon Hotchkiss didn't rope in the gals to attend jest for psalm-singing."

40|$|In Brazil {{information}} about illegal hunting activities is rarely pursued {{because of a}} lack of legal mechanisms of confidentiality and <b>professional</b> <b>secrecy</b> that would assure legal rights to the researcher.
