40|$|AbstractThe Heartland Area Redwater Project (HARP) for CO 2 {{storage is}} {{investigating}} the technical and economic feasibility of injecting significant volumes of CO 2 into the large water-saturated portion of a huge Devonian reef that is capped by a comparatively small oil reservoir, nevertheless the third largest oil pool in western Canada. The reef has a total areal extent of nearly 600  km 2, is more than 1, 000 meters deep and is up to 275 meters thick. Based on the high water injectivity in the reef, the potential exists to inject sustainably in excess of 1, 000 tonnes of CO 2 per day per well in the aquifer portion of the reef. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>storage</b> capacity estimates for the aquifer are {{in the order of}} one gigatonne of CO 2.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the flavour profile and consumer acceptability of four sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) cultivars that differed in β-carotene content. Descriptive sensory profiles of the sweetpotato cultivars were determined using a sensory panel. Consumers in the Lake Zone of Tanzania comprised school children (n = 94) and mothers with preschool children (n = 59). Additionally, mothers gave acceptability scores for how they perceived their children’s acceptance. Traditional pale-fleshed (PFSP) and high-β-carotene orange-fleshed (OFSP) sweetpotato cultivars showed distinct differences in sensory profile. Mean consumer responses indicated that OFSP were more acceptable than PFSP; mothers differed from school children by giving higher acceptance scores. Mothers did not score the perceived acceptability for their preschool children different from themselves. Segmentation appeared to suggest three distinct patterns of consumer acceptability among school children and mothers. The majority gave high acceptability scores to both OFSP and PFSP. Those in the smaller second group gave higher scores to OFSP than to PFSP, while those (particularly school children) in the third segment gave lower scores to the OFSP cultivar Karote DSM. There was evidence that school children and mothers viewed the sweetpotato cultivars differently with respect to fibrous texture. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>storage</b> trial where the sweetpotato cultivars were kept for 12 weeks in pit structures indicated that the acceptability and sensory profile of the cultivars did not differ with storage...|$|E

The effects of <b>preliminary</b> chilling <b>storage</b> and thermal treatment (cooking and sterilisation) on the chemical constituents (lipids and non-protein nitrogen compounds) of the canned fish were analysed.

The technical and economical aspect related to capture and transportation for these cases have been investigated. As this is an ongoing study the results are <b>preliminary</b> and <b>storage</b> {{is yet to be}} assessed, only the storage location is known. The end goal of the project is to assess the feasibility of the identified CCS cases based on the final technical and economical evaluation.

The industrial cases that have been investigated in this assessment involve all the Nordic countries and cover a wide variation of CO 2 volume, distance between sources, number of sources and distance to storage. The capture costs, with the current assumptions, generally lie in the region of 40 - 50 EUR/ton and are mainly dependent {{on the size of the}} CO 2 emission source.

Results indicate that about 6 wt% H (corresponding to C{sub 60 }H{sub 48 }) {{can be added}} to and taken out of fullerenes. A model with thermally activated hydrogenation/dehydrogenation was developed. Activation energies were estimated to be 100 and 160 kJ/mole (1. 0 and 1. 6 eV/H{sub 2 }) for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, respectively; difference is interpreted as heat release during hydrogenation. The activation energies and hydrogenation heat may be modifiable by catalysts. <b>Preliminary</b> H <b>storage</b> simulations for a conceptually simple device were performed (a 1 -m long hollow metal cylinder with inner dia 0. 02 m filled with fullerene powders).

The simulation suggest that thermal management is essential for efficient H storage devices using fullerenes.

In the present work, the use of slurry ice was evaluated {{for the first time}} as a technological treatment prior to the canning processing of fish. Thus, sardine (Sardina pilchardus) specimens were stored in slurry ice for 2 and 5 days and then taken and subjected to canning. Quality assessment of the canned product was performed on the fish muscle and on the coating oil, in comparison with that of a parallel control batch previously stored in flake ice. Analyses included composition (water, lipid and NaCl contents), physical properties (firmness, cohesivity), volatile amine formation (total and trimethylamine), lipid oxidation development (anisidine value, polyene index, alpha-tocopherol content and Rancimat oxidative stability) and interaction compounds formation (fluorescence assessment).

FINDINGS:We describe the screening of 3 different readily available formulation media (sorbitol, sucrose and trehalose) for their ability to stabilise HIV- 1 Pr 55 gag VLPs during prolonged storage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done on VLPs stored at two different concentrations of the media at three different temperatures (4 degreesC, - 20 degreesC and 70 degreesC) over different time periods, and the appearance of the VLPs was compared. VLPs stored in 15 % trehalose at 70 degreesC retained their original appearance the most effectively over a period of 12 months.

40|$|Service {{discovery}} protocols {{address the}} problem of <b>preliminary</b> association or <b>storage</b> of services at specific service providers and, at a later stage, efficient lookup for providers responsible for demanded client's services. In mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) used for military applications, both the efficiency of service discovery protocols and the security of such protocols against adversaries are of crucial importance for the success of, say, battlefield operations. In this paper we consider a recently proposed lookup protocol that satisfies interesting efficiency properties by using an approach reminiscent of indirect-address storage techniques, and thus significantly different from other well-known flooding-type approaches. We observe that this protocol can be adapted to obtain a service discovery protocol in MANET. Specifically, we build an index system that matches services to their correspondent service agents; then servers register themselves to selected agents, and clients can efficiently retrieve the service information from the specific service agents. We then investigate the problem of securing the proposed protocol against Byzantine adversaries.

Transient climate ensembles are used as inputs to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrologic model to predict daily transient streamflow scenarios throughout the basin to 2050.

40|$|International audienceVariations {{of water}} {{stocks in the}} upper Zambezi river basin have been {{determined}} by 2 different hydrological modelling approaches. The purpose was to provide <b>preliminary</b> terrestrial <b>storage</b> estimates in the upper Zambezi for comparison with estimates derived from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE). The first modelling approach is GIS-based, distributed and conceptual (STREAM). The second approach uses lumped elementary watersheds identified and modelled conceptually (LEW). The STREAM model structure has been assessed using GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) a posteriori to determine parameter identifiability. The LEW approach could, in addition, be tested for model structure, because computational efforts of LEW are low. Both models are threshold models, where the non-linear behaviour of the Zambezi river basin is explained {{by a combination of}} thresholds and linear reservoirs. The models were forced by time series of gauged and interpolated rainfall. Where available, runoff station data was used to calibrate the models. Ungauged watersheds were generally given the same parameter sets as their neighbouring calibrated watersheds. It appeared that the LEW model structure could be improved by applying GLUE iteratively. Eventually, it led to better identifiability of parameters and consequently a better model structure than the STREAM model. Hence, the final model structure obtained, better represents the true hydrology. After calibration, both models show a comparable efficiency in representing discharge. However the LEW model shows a far greater storage amplitude than the STREAM model. This emphasizes the storage uncertainty related to hydrological modelling in data-scarce environments such as the Zambezi river basin. It underlines the need and potential for independent observations of terrestrial storage to enhance our understanding and modelling capacity of the hydrological processes. GRACE could provide orthogonal information that can help to constrain and further enhance our models. In the near future, other remotely sensed data sources will be used to force modelling efforts of the Zambezi (e. g. satellite rainfall estimates) and to identify individual storage components in the GRACE observations (e. g. altimeter lake levels and microwave soil moisture). Ultimately, this will create possibilities for state updating of regional hydrological models using GRACE...|$|R

In this paper, a cost assessment methodology based on scenario analysis is presented. A CO 2 source and sink database was built at Guangdong after detailed investigations on the point sources and sedimentary basins. Fifteen transport and five storage scenarios were defined and studied, respectively. Cost estimates based on these scenarios show that during its lifetime, the costs of both transport and storage depend {{on the amount of}} CO 2 processed. More CO 2 being processed will bring down the unit costs of both transport and storage. However, it was observed that there is a cost inflection point between the storage amount of 35. 2 and 52. 8 Mt/year, which means that as the storage amount increases, the storage cost will first decrease and then increase.

This conceptually simple change allows NDN networks to use {{almost all the}} Internet's well-tested engineering properties to solve not only communication problems, but also digital distribution and control problems. The functionality of the narrow waist in NDN is fundamentally different from that in IP: it uses consumer-driven data delivery with a stateful data forwarding plane, implements built-in data security, and provides support for the extensive use of in-network <b>storage.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> experience shows that NDN bridges the gap between applications and network transport, simultaneously simplifying the application development process and addressing some of the Internet's most pressing problems in security, scalability, and sustainability. At the same time, {{the realization of the}} NDN architecture faces a number of brand new challenges. For example, all data packets must be signed by the original producers and verified by their consumers, bringing up the need for providing secure, resilient, and scalable support for public key distributions. Furthermore, since NDN eliminates the translation from application names to IP addresses and routes consumer data requests using application data names directly, maintaining the scalability of the global routing system becomes another challenge. This dissertation addresses the above challenges in moving NDN from an architecture blueprint to the operational reality. We designed and implemented a prototype of NDNS, a completely distributed database system that largely mimics the structure of the DNS system in today's Internet but operates within the NDN architecture.

Cost-effective capture and storage of solar energy still remains a challenge facing broad-based implementation of this renewable technology. Work at the South African Research Chairs Initiatives (SARChI), Chair in Carbon Materials and Technology at the University of Pretoria is aimed at developing materials from cheap, local carbon sources for solar thermal applications. The focus is split on developing composites for both solar energy capture and thermal energy <b>storage.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> investigations are based on systems designed to provide heating needs like hot water through solar energy. Two different approaches to the capture of solar energy were explored. Firstly the use of carbon black and expanded graphite pressed discs and secondly the production of mesophase based graphitic foams. The carbon black discs demonstrated the ability to reach a peak collector temperature of around 70 °C whilst providing approximately 4 kW. hr per m 2 per day. The foam with the best capture had an efficiency calculated at around 95 %. This is based on measured incoming radiation converted into sensible heating of the water. Phase change materials present an efficient and innovative {{solution to the problem}} of thermal energy storage. These materials suffer from a major drawback due to their low thermal conductivity. Two alternatives were explored for enhancing this property. Firstly the direct incorporation of phase change material into expanded graphite was tested. A variety of loadings were explored. It was found that at low concentrations of 6 mass % the time required for the sample to undergo the phase transition could be reduced by 70 % for heating and 85 % for cooling.

Both options of storage in deep saline aquifer and in depleted hydrocarbon field were considered. The typical size envisioned for the pilot was 100 kt CO 2 per year. GéoCarbone-PICOREF initially focused on a "Regional Domain", ca. 200 × 150 km, in the Paris Basin. It was attractive for the following reasons: - detailed geological data is available, due to 50 years of petroleum exploration; - basin-scale deep saline aquifers are present, with a <b>preliminary</b> estimate of <b>storage</b> capacity {{which is at the}} Gt CO 2 level, namely the carbonate Oolithe Blanche Formation, of Middle Jurassic age, generally located between 1500 and 1800 m depths in the studied area, and several sandstone formations of Triassic age, located between 2000 and 3000 m; - several depleted oil fields exist: although offering storage capacities at a much lower level, they do represent very well constrained geological environments, with proven sealing properties; - several sources of pure CO 2 were identified in the area, at a flow rate compatible with the pilot size, that would avoid capture costs. 750 km of seismic lines were reprocessed and organized in six sections fitted on well logs. This first dataset provided improved representations of: - the gross features of the considered aquifers in the Regional Domain; - the structural scheme; - lateral continuity of the sealing cap rocks. An inventory of the environmental characteristics was also made, including human occupancy, protected areas, water resource, natural hazards, potential conflicts of use with other resources of the subsurface, etc. From all these criteria, a more restricted geographical domain named the "Sector", ca. 70 × 70 km, was chosen, the most appropriate for further selection of storage site(s). The geological characterization of the Sector has been as exhaustive as possible, with the reprocessing of additional 450 km of seismic lines, and the collection of a complete well-data base (146 petroleum wells). At this scale a relatively detailed characterization of the sedimentary layers could be done, in particular the formations potentially rich in aquifer units. For the Middle Jurassic carbonates observations were made on analogue sediments outcropping 150 km to the east of the Sector. A geological and numerical 3 -D representation of the whole sedimentary pile of the Sector area was built. It forms a basis for constructing grids used by codes able to simulate various processes induced by CO 2 injection (displacement of the fluids, pressure build-up and release, mechanical deformation, mineral interactions, control of the parameters used to check the local sealing efficiency, etc.). In parallel with that work on aquifers, GéoCarbone-PICOREF has access to all the petroleum data, including production data and reservoir modelling, of the Saint-Martin de Bossenay oil field, localized {{in the eastern part of}} the Sector. This was an opportunity to apply a comparable methodology and to test the capabilities of modelling codes to the specific case of a depleted hydrocarbon field, and to show some of the advantages of such a context with respect to a pilot-scale CO 2 injectio...|$|R
