Consequently, new technology must be created to make profits possible again. Furthermore, the remaining farmers are forced to sell their products at lower prices and if they want to remain competitive, they must get on the best treadmill too.

40|$|<b>Price</b> <b>squeeze</b> abuses {{lie at the}} {{crossroad}} {{between different}} forms of potentially anticompetitive conduct, {{as well as between}} antitrust law and regulation. The main question that has arisen in the academic debate and actual practice is whether a combination of a lawful wholesale price and a non-predatory retail price can be characterized as exclusionary conduct based on the analysis of the margin between the two prices. In the paper, we argue that {{there is no need for}} a separate <b>price</b> <b>squeeze</b> theory under antitrust law. Assuming that the costs of supplying an input to rivals and to internal downstream divisions do not differ, a <b>price</b> <b>squeeze</b> capable of excluding equally efficient competitors may arise only from upstream discrimination (discriminatory <b>price</b> <b>squeeze)</b> or downstream predation (predatory <b>price</b> <b>squeeze).</b> However, when the downstream division of the dominant firm is not a separate legal entity, distinguishing discriminatory and predatory price squeezes may turn out to be impossible, as internal transfer charges are absent in many concrete settings of vertical integration. In these cases, an analytical framework for the assessment of <b>price</b> <b>squeeze</b> cases can be useful, provided that it is intended as an operational tool aimed at detecting anticompetitive conduct of a discriminatory or predatory nature, which is not directly observable. Instead of mimicking regulatory tools and criteria, the analytical framework for the assessment of <b>price</b> <b>squeeze</b> cases should be construed in accordance with basic principles of competition law and traditional doctrines of antitrust liability. This approach strongly supports the application of principles on refusal to deal to <b>price</b> <b>squeeze</b> cases and the use of the equally efficient competitor test to ascertain whether a given pricing policy is anticompetitive...|$|E

The experience in all European cases considered in these studies shows the difficulty and complexity faced by regulators in implementing the imputation analysis. In the US some Courts have followed a different approach and some authors do not consider margin squeeze as an abuse by a dominant operator (see also Crandall and Singer (2007), Carlton (2008) and Sidak (2008)).

Can a <b>price</b> <b>squeeze</b> lead to falling market shares for the incumbent and rising market shares for the entrants?

Price squeezes have been a recognized but controversial antitrust violation for two-thirds of a century. We examine the law and economics of the <b>price</b> <b>squeeze,</b> beginning with Judge Hand 2 ̆ 7 s famous discussion in the Alcoa case in 1945.

This case, {{the most recent}} in a growing line of court of appeals decisions examining the antitrust implications of public utility rate structures, represents {{the first time a}} United States court of appeals has unequivocally stated that an antitrust action based upon a “price squeeze” could not be maintained against a utility whose wholesale and retail rates were both fully regulated. Town of Concord notwithstanding, the courts are far from agreeing whether investor-owned electric or natural gas utilities are immune from federal antitrust liability arising from rates approved by the appropriate state or federal regulators, nor have they been able to agree on the reasoning used to support a given answer. The Supreme Court has yet to grant certiorari and decide the issue.

40|$|The March 26 th price {{spike in}} Genesis Energy’s Huntly power station prices has {{focussed}} {{attention on the}} regulatory powers of the newly established Electricity Authority. The Authority’s weapon of choice, the Undesirable Trading Situation regime, allows them {{to intervene in the}} market and was applied in this case to reset prices retrospectively. The decision caused a storm of controversy in the media and numerous submissions, both for and against, from market players. The Authority has a mandate to regulate competition in the electricity markets and because of the overlapping jurisdiction, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Commerce Commission. How the two bodies interpret and apply their co-existing statutory obligations will be of great interest to businesses operating not just in the energy sector, but across the whole economy. For those in the electricity industry any indication as to how the Electricity Authority intends to regulate wholesale electricity markets will be crucial for implementing future market strategies and investments. The question for this paper will therefore be to assess the decision in light of these overlapping jurisdictions, the policy documents used to guide each decision maker, and the previous decisions which may have influenced or misled market players. Given the focus on efficiency in New Zealand’s competition law, particular attention will be paid to the economic history of theories of contestability, the total surplus standard, <b>price</b> <b>squeezes</b> and wealth transfers, and the interplay between static and dynamic efficiency. The conclusion will be that the March 26 th decision, although made under a very different legislative scheme to the Commerce Act, bears remarkable similarities to the general competition law. The decision applies a very similar remedy to the standard ECPR counterfactual analysis seen in s 36 prosecutions. The main difference between the two regimes is that the UTS provision is not applied punitively, reflecting a determination on the Authority’s part to maintain flexibility and restore orderly trading...|$|R
40|$|Notwithstanding {{assertions of}} greater {{harmonization}} and convergence between U.

In contrast, in a series of decisions in liberalized telecommunications markets, the EU courts, in applying an “as efficient competitor test,” have focused on the preservation of competitive rivalry as “equality of opportunity. ” This significantly broadens the potential liability for a margin squeeze in the European Union and reconstitutes EU competition law as a form of de facto regulation in liberalized markets. Faced with the uncertainty of this standard, the dominant firm has an incentive to avoid liability by raising its retail prices to the detriment of consumers. This article evaluates this divergence in the approach to the regulation of a <b>price</b> or margin <b>squeeze</b> in the United States and the European Union and traces these approaches to differing conceptions of dominant firm regulation, which in turn have informed different understandings of the regulation of a refusal to supply and the intersection of competition law with sector-specific regulation...|$|R

40|$|Recent rapidly {{rising and}} {{volatile}} energy commodities prices and financial price manipulation scandals {{have brought the}} pricing mechanisms of crude oil derivatives to the fore of both popular press and policy initiatives. Among {{the most important of}} such commodities is Brent Crude. Brent Crude and its complex of derivative products make Brent Crude potentially more opaque and thus susceptible to price manipulation than other commodities. In spite of the importance of Brent to the world economy and world energy prices, and its complex of derivative pricing, relatively little work has been done to explore the potential for, and evidence of, price manipulation in the Brent Crude complex. This paper seeks to address this lack by proposing a method to test whether <b>price</b> <b>squeezes</b> have occurred in Brent Crude. This paper builds on previous work which proposed an a priori test for evidence of manipulation and the theory of storage. Previous work (Barrera-Rey and Seymour 1996) posited that the very close-to-delivery end of the forward curve for Brent should not be simultaneously in contango and backwardation, while other work (Geman and Smith 2012) proposed using an econometric prediction and a model based on the theory of storage to detect manipulation in commodity markets. Our work builds on these approaches by developing a more detailed model of calendar spreads in the Brent Crude complex. In Brent, a particular area of potential manipulation is from the relatively illiquid and more opaque physical OTC forward market (where prices are ‘assessed’ by Platts during a short ‘window’ of time) and the more liquid ICE futures market. Our model relates prompt ICE futures calendar spreads to prompt-over-dated OTC forward spreads. The model then tests whether the a priori indicators of manipulation as suggested by Barrera-Rey and Seymour are statistically consistent with the process which drives spreads historically. We find that in most all cases, the indicated period of manipulation is statistically different. We further investigate whether other factors, such as liquidity (volume and open interest) or world oil market conditions (using WTI spreads) or other forward market conditions could be driving our results. The statistical difference is found to be invariant to the inclusion of these other explanatory variables. We conclude that the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of price manipulation and that the test provides a model and method for detecting such cases. ...|$|R
