40|$|Through {{studying}} the intersections of sanitation and segregation in Brooklyn, New York in the post-WWII era, this thesis reveals {{a web of}} willful white negligence that constructed a narrative that supports continued environmental injustices towards black Americans. As a result of housing discrimination, the lack of sanitation, and {{the political and social}} climate of the 1950 s, black neighborhoods in Brooklyn became dirtier with abandoned garbage. Institutional anti-black racism not only permitted and supported the degradation of black neighborhoods, but also created an association between black Americans and trash. In the present day, this narrative not only leads to the increased segregation of black Americans into dirty neighborhoods, but also justifies more environmental injustice in these vulnerable communities. Based on a case study of Brooklyn in the 1950 s, this thesis asserts that environmental injustices are more than just siting landfills and toxic sites proximate to vulnerable neighborhoods, but rather they are dependent on the creation and <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> narratives that <b>claim</b> minority communities are naturally predisposed to or deserving of living in dirty and unclean places...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the sternocleidomastoid muscle (M. SCM) after {{modified}} radical neck dissection (MRND). To evaluate postoperative functional outcome and life quality, clinical data of patients after neck dissection level I-V were analyzed and compared: 20 patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM to 20 patients without <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM. Matched-Pairs-design was performed previously to gain homogenization within the compared study groups. For assessment of the postoperative sternocleidomastoid function to evaluate its degree of atrophy, electromyography (EMG) was recorded. Patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM showed a significant higher range of head-neck-motion in active inclination to the opposite non-operation-site, passive inclination and passive rotation to the operation-site. Compared to patients without neck dissection as control group, patients without <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM showed significant limitation in head inclination and rotation. Patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM showed significant limitation only in head rotation. Shoulder mobility showing limitation in arm abduction and anteversion at the operation-site was significantly found in patients without <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM (95 %) compared to patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM (20 %). In 45 % of the patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM, the EMG recorded no signal in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, presumably due to ischemic atrophy of the muscle. Among these patients were those accordant patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM and limitation of shoulder mobility. 55 % of the patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM showed recorded signals of the M. SCM in the EMG. These patients also performed a significant higher range of head rotation at the non-operation site compared to those 45 % of the patients without EMG recorded signals in the preservated M. SCM. The evaluation of the general and head-neck specific life quality demonstrated no significant advantage of preservating the M. SCM. As a conclusion the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the M. SCM after neck dissection demonstrates an almost unlimited range of motion of the head, neck and shoulder, particularly when there is no postoperative muscle atrophy. Therefore, the <b>preservation</b> and conservation <b>of</b> the M. SCM in the context of neck dissection considering the onco-surgical principles should be aimed...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{technology}} has uncovered the significant problem of wrongful conviction in the United States. Australians {{tend to have}} great faith in our criminal justice system; however, innocent people have also been wrongly convicted in this country. As a society, we must never become complacent about our criminal justice system: we must continually address areas likely to be relevant to the incidence of wrongful conviction, and we need mechanisms for the proper review <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Following {{in the footsteps of}} Innocence Projects in the United States, Innocence Projects in Australia are emerging as a resource for the investigation <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> wrongful conviction with the aim of freeing innocent persons from incarceration. The majority <b>of</b> wrongful conviction <b>claims</b> will not involve DNA evidence, making the investigative work of Innocence Projects more complex and time-consuming, but also a task in which student resources are particularly valuable. To enhance the effectiveness <b>of</b> addressing <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> wrongful conviction, adoption of legislation or procedures is required. This would include changes requiring the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> evidence and expanded access to the courts of appeal for persons who have exhausted their one appeal prior to investigations uncovering evidence of innocence.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how the Indian system of personal laws ('the system') affects personal religious autonomy. It does so by considering what implications three major institutional features of the system, namely (a) the identification of individuals as members of religious groups by the state; (b) the application of personal laws ostensibly based on religious doctrine, as understood by the state, to these individuals and (c) the limited movement allowed between the different personal laws, and between a personal law and the general non-religious laws, have for the religious autonomy of those governed by the system. Several arguments in support of the system, including those that suggest that it might provide valuable recognition of the collective aspects of religious identity, support the proper functioning of religious groups and provide individuals with more options than they otherwise would have had, are considered. However the thesis concludes that contrary to what some who argue for the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the system <b>claim,</b> it has an adverse effect on religious autonomy. It misrecognises individuals and their religious understandings, it interferes with their personal integrity and it invades their privacy. The limited movement allowed by feature (c) above does not significantly mitigate the problems with system. Concerns relating to religious autonomy, this thesis thus finds, constitute an important set of objections to the system as it now functions. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R
