5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area <b>pre-loading</b> abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked so strange that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pre-loads</b> high in protein, as {{compared}} to carbohydrate and fat, produce greater satiety and reduce food intake after a fixed time interval. This study investigated the effect of macronutrient composition on spontaneous eating behaviour. On four separate occasions, 16 fasted, healthy, non-obese men, blinded to the true purpose of the study, consumed iso-energetic (approximately 3 MJ) yoghurt-based <b>pre-loads</b> of equivalent weight (approximately 0. 5 kg), high in fat (40 %) [HF], carbohydrate (60 %) [HC] or protein (29 %) [HP], and no <b>pre-load</b> in a randomized, single-blind fashion. Subjects ate at will from a selection of food items {{for the remainder of}} the day (7 h) with the time of food requests (h) and energy content (kJ) and macronutrient distribution (%) of food eaten recorded. The three <b>pre-loads</b> delayed the first spontaneous request for food by 1. 5 - 1. 8 h relative to no <b>pre-load.</b> Total spontaneous food intake was suppressed 29 % [HP], 20 % [HF] and 17 % [HC] by the <b>pre-loads.</b> Neither the amount of food eaten per spontaneous eating episode, nor the spontaneous eating frequency differed statistically following ingestion of the different <b>pre-loads</b> or no <b>pre-load.</b> In this study, in subjects who were free to choose when as well as how much they ate, a high-protein <b>pre-load</b> exerted similar effects on satiety as did iso-energetic high-fat and high-carbohydrate <b>pre-loads.</b> Rosalie Vozzo, Gary Wittert, Carmel Cocchiaro, Wen Chien Tan, Jane Mudge, Rob Fraser, Ian Chapma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{influences of}} a <b>pre-load</b> and vibration amplitude on driving {{performance of a}} surface acoustic wave (SAW) linear motor, and proposes a simulation model for the SAW linear mo-tor. In experimental results, maximum output force and {{maximum output power of}} the SAW linear motor depended on it’s <b>pre-load.</b> Optimum <b>pre-loads</b> for the maximum output force and for the maximum output power were both linear functions of the SAW linear motor’s vibration amplitude. No-load velocity of the SAW linear motor, however, decreased linearly with in-creasing <b>pre-load.</b> A new simulation model to explain these phenomena is proposed. There is a good agree-ment between the experimental and simulation results. I...|$|R
40|$|Rock bolts ensure {{structural}} stability for tunnels {{and many other}} underground structures. The <b>pre-load</b> on a rock bolt {{plays an important role}} in the structural reinforcement and it is vital to monitor the <b>pre-load</b> status of rock bolts. In this paper, a rock bolt <b>pre-load</b> monitoring method based on the piezoceramic enabled time reversal method is proposed. A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch transducer, which works as an actuator to generate stress waves, is bonded onto the anchor plate of the rock bolt. A smart washer, which is fabricated by sandwiching a PZT patch between two metal rings, is installed between the hex nut and the anchor plate along the rock bolt. The smart washer functions as a sensor to detect the stress wave. With the increase of the <b>pre-load</b> values on the rock bolt, the effective contact surface area between the smart washer and the anchor plate, benefiting the stress wave propagation crossing the contact surface. With the help of time reversal technique, experimental results reveal that the magnitude of focused signal clearly increases with the increase of the <b>pre-load</b> on a rock bolt before the saturation which happens beyond a relatively high value of the <b>pre-load.</b> The proposed method provides an innovative and real time means to monitor the <b>pre-load</b> level of a rock bolt. By employing this method, the <b>pre-load</b> degradation process on a rock bolt can be clearly monitored. Please note that, currently, the proposed method applies to only new rock bolts, on which it is possible to install the PZT smart washer...|$|R

25|$|Notable human dietary {{studies of}} {{experimentally}} induced scurvy {{have been conducted}} on conscientious objectors during WWII in Britain and on Iowa state prisoners in the late 1960s to the 1980s. These studies both found that all obvious symptoms of scurvy previously induced by an experimental scorbutic diet with extremely low vitamin C content could be completely reversed by additional vitamin C supplementation of only 10mg a day. In these experiments, there was no clinical difference noted between men given 70mg vitamin C per day (which produced blood level of vitamin C of about 0.55mg/dl, about 1/3 of tissue saturation levels) and those given 10mg per day. Men in the prison study developed {{the first signs of}} scurvy about 4 weeks after starting the vitamin C-free diet, whereas in the British study, six to eight months were required, possibly due to the <b>pre-loading</b> of this group with a 70mg/day supplement for six weeks before the scorbutic diet was fed.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{considered}} some of {{the smaller}} additions useful and others gimmicky. Critics appreciated the release's time-saving interface tweaks and overall pacing, but thought, for instance, that the vision camera integration added little to the game. While Electronic Gaming Monthly had wanted more development of the story, Mc Shea (GameSpot) was grateful that the story remained in the background of the game. [...] While Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that loading times had been improved, Geddes (IGN) considered them [...] "frustratingly long". Considering the previous game's slow start, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) thought that Trouble in Paradise did a better job of introducing the player to the world by <b>pre-loading</b> player gardens with animals, plants, and decorations, and offering a tutorial. He wondered whether the game went too far, from too slow to hyperactive.|$|E

40|$|Loss of <b>pre-load</b> with time, {{commonly}} known as ‘Relaxation’ is an established phenomena. Behaviour of a bolted joint depends upon the <b>pre-load</b> in the bolts in use, not the <b>pre-load</b> introduced by the mechanic. Loss of <b>pre-load</b> is expected due to the many factors such as embedment relaxation, gasket creep, elastic interactions, and vibration loosening or stress relaxation. In a gasketed joint, due to the gasket flexibility, relaxation is always substantial during preliminary passes, as 80 to 100 % loss is not uncommon in almost all the bolts, resulting in a dynamic behaviour. <b>Pre-load</b> in a gasketed joint is stabilized and retained to certain extent in the final passes only. In a non-gasketed joint, due to no gasket and no rotation its static behaviour is concluded. This paper highlights the factors affecting the amount of relaxation with time and presents important considerations that can reduce this. Both the {{short and long term}} relaxations are recorded and a ‘best fit’ model for relaxation behaviour is derived. </p...|$|R

500|$|Concurrent {{with these}} changes, Portal 2 became {{available}} for <b>pre-loading</b> on the Steam client. At this point, several journalists and players suspected that Portal 2 {{may have been}} unlocked early {{at the end of}} the countdown timer. This correlated with a separate puzzle embedded in messages sent by Newell to a number of gaming sites; the message suggested the [...] "early release" [...] of material and [...] "thirteen offsite chambers", seemingly referring to the independent games, as well as a message [...] "4/19/2011 7 AM == 4/15/2011 9 AM", again referencing the planned Portal 2 release date and the countdown timer. As April 15 drew near, about nine heavily involved players from the ARG appeared to disengage from the various chat rooms, leaving with the message [...] "There's a hole in the sky through which I can fly"a line used in early advertisements for Portal; when contacted by other players, these individuals remained coy and cryptic about their actions, appearing to have been [...] "infected" [...] by GLaDOS. It was later revealed that these players, contacted by Valve a few days prior, were invited to Valve's headquarters to be the first to play Portal 2.|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the relationship of the 'myocardial performance index' (MPI) to the beat-by-beat change in <b>pre-load</b> with static or unchanged contractile status. Methods: Eight anesthetized juvenile pigs were studied using direct measurement of the left ventricular pressure and volume. Transient inflation of a vena cava balloon catheter produced controlled <b>pre-load</b> alterations. Consecutive beats were analyzed, grouped for first, second, third, etc. during the <b>pre-load</b> alteration, and evaluated for the change in MPI during the same contractile status with a controlled <b>pre-load</b> alteration. Two pharmacologic inotropic interventions were also included to generate several myocardial conditions in each animal. Results: MPI demonstrated a strong linear relationship to the <b>pre-load</b> and after-load. MPI increased progressively during decreasing end-diastolic volume, mostly related to changes in ejection time. MPI was observed at the same level for three different myocardial function conditions (all eight animals), with a different relationship between MPI and <b>pre-load</b> noted for each observation. Conclusions: MPI is strongly load dependent, and can vary widely in value for the same contractile status if the load is varied. The use of this index in critically ill patients should be limited in this respect. Further work is needed to establish the relationship of MPI to load and contractile status...|$|R

40|$|Pre-operative {{end-systolic}} volume (ESV) is predictive of outcome after surgery for severe aortic regurgitation. ESV {{is influenced by}} body size and reflects function and afterload, but not <b>pre-load.</b> Left ventricular (LV) chamber size and function were measured in 40 patients (ages 10 to 64 years) by echocardiography before and 7 months after operation and expressed as z-scores in addition to simple indexing. A functional <b>pre-load</b> index, a marker of <b>pre-load</b> reserve, was calculated. Independent risk factors for post-operative LV dysfunction included higher post-operative ESV z-score (odds ratio [OR]: 3. 3, p = 0. 006) and lower functional <b>pre-load</b> index (OR: 0. 3, p = 0. 03). ESV per square meter had similar power to the ESV z-score. The ESV uncorrected for body size underestimated risk in smaller patients and overestimated risk in larger patients (p < 0. 002). <b>Pre-load</b> reserve is an independent risk factor for LV dysfunction after aortic valve surgery in patients with severe aortic regurgitation.
