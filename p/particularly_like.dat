5|$|The {{marriage}} proved difficult, as {{the couple}} did not <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> each other. There was a further dispute over Matilda's dowry; she was granted various castles in Normandy by Henry, {{but it was}} not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. It is also unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping Geoffrey's status deliberately uncertain. Soon after the marriage, Matilda left Geoffrey and returned to Normandy. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but the couple were finally reconciled in 1131. Henry summoned Matilda from Normandy, and she arrived in England that August. It was decided that Matilda would return to Geoffrey {{at a meeting of the}} King's great council in September. The council also gave another collective oath of allegiance to recognise her as Henry's heir.|$|E
5|$|An ala or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, ale <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in a good relationship with an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Henry rebuilt his {{alliance}} with Fulk of Anjou, {{this time by}} marrying Matilda to Fulk's eldest son, Geoffrey. The pair were betrothed in 1127 and married the following year. It is unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping his son-in-law's status deliberately uncertain. Similarly, although Matilda was granted a number of Normandy castles {{as part of her}} dowry, it was not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. Fulk left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine. The marriage proved difficult, as the couple did not <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> each other and the disputed castles proved a point of contention, resulting in Matilda returning to Normandy later that year. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but in 1131 the couple were reconciled. Much to the pleasure and relief of Henry, Matilda then gave birth to a sequence of two sons, Henry and Geoffrey, in 1133 and 1134.|$|E
25|$|Lin {{originally}} {{wanted the}} poet Yu Dafu {{to do the}} Chinese translation, but Yu had only completed the first section {{when he was killed}} by the Japanese in World War II. Lin did not <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> the first complete Chinese translation, which was done by 1941.|$|E
25|$|Macleod {{returned}} to the shadow cabinet under Home after the 1964 election. His remit of opposing steel nationalisation came to naught as given his tiny majority Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson did not proceed with this measure. Macleod’s speech opposing steel nationalisation had been trailed as his comeback to frontline politics, but in the event was a damp squib. Nigel Fisher wrote {{that it was the}} only really bad speech of his career. Macleod did not contest the first ever Conservative Party leadership election in 1965, but backed Edward Heath, whom he did not <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> but thought would be a better leader than Maudling. He expected to have received 40-45 votes had he stood.|$|E

500|$|After {{his term}} as {{governor}} ended, Gaston {{returned to his}} law practice. [...] His practice, established in 1865 with Harvey Jewell and Walbridge A. Field, was highly successful. [...] Gaston was known to not <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> criminal law, but he was acknowledged {{as one of the}} period's leading trial lawyers. [...] He served as President of the Boston Bar Association from 1880 to 1881. [...] He died in 1894, and is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a common}} theme was not purposefully {{established}} for the album, some journalists noted similar feelings of travel and adventure when listening to the record. Lindstrøm has recommended people listen while traveling, and believes his travels may have influenced the album: [...] "I don't <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> traveling, but I've realised that it's perfect for listening to whole albums... I'm sure the way I'm listening to music now ... {{has something to do}} with the music I'm writing." [...] The song titles were left [...] "open" [...] so [...] "the listener could make up his own story." ...|$|E
500|$|Watkins {{remembers the}} first time they saw the group: [...] "I saw Mark Fox. And then I saw these little girls {{skipping}} and running around. And they looked about thirteen. This can't be them. No way!". Nevertheless, the Spice Girls managed to impress them. They played a few of their tracks, but neither Watkins nor Wilson <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> them, except for a song the group wrote with Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, called [...] "Feed Your Love", which the duo thought was [...] "dark and cool". A songwriting session was booked within the next days.|$|E

500|$|After {{winning the}} Montreux award it seemed {{inevitable}} {{that the show}} would get a third series. At a Christmas party, a BBC executive expressed a wish for the ratings of a third series [...] "to go like Everest", indicating a steep slope with his hands. Bathurst replied, [...] "But, Everest goes down the other side..." [...] The show was not recommissioned. Moffat says {{that he had no}} idea for a third series anyway, as it would have been difficult to contrive how {{a group of people who}} did not <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> each other would get together so regularly.|$|E
500|$|... "Agua Mala" [...] {{was written}} by David Amann and was his second story for The X-Files after [...] "Terms of Endearment." [...] "Agua Mala" [...] went through several very {{different}} drafts. Amann was originally tasked with bringing back the character of Arthur Dales. His original story was of a monster loose in an abandoned gold mine. Frank Spotnitz, the show's executive producer, did not <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> {{the idea of a}} gold mine, but he enjoyed the concept of a monster loose in an enclosed space. Amann quickly decided to set the episode during a hurricane and feature a sea monster as the primary antagonist. Originally, the sea monster was blown onto dry land and crawled into the building, before Amann decided to re-write it as living water.|$|E
500|$|Because of Grossman's {{hostility to}} Hammond, Columbia paired Dylan with a young, African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson. Wilson recalled: [...] "I didn't even <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> folk music. I'd been {{recording}} Sun Ra and Coltrane ... I thought folk music {{was for the}} dumb guys. [...] played like the dumb guys, but then these words came out. I was flabbergasted." [...] At a recording session on April 24, produced by Wilson, Dylan recorded five new compositions: [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Talkin' World War III Blues", [...] "Bob Dylan's Dream", and [...] "Walls of Red Wing". [...] "Walls of Red Wing" [...] was ultimately rejected, but the other four were included in a revised album sequence.|$|E

5000|$|In politics, Codrington was a Liberal {{supporter}} of Viscount Palmerston. He <b>particularly</b> <b>liked</b> his leader's foreign policy. He was {{in favour of}} [...] "progressive reform" [...] and [...] "civil and religious liberty", but {{did not support the}} secret ballot.|$|R
50|$|Maskell <b>particularly</b> <b>liked</b> {{studying}} the internal anatomy of insects, {{probably due to}} his fascination with physiology and microscopy, and his work was also unique in that he studied immature stages {{of males and females}} as well as the mature females.|$|R
500|$|The episode's plot {{originated}} from one which Lan O'Kun submitted entitled [...] "Love Beyond Time and Space", although at one point, the episode was called [...] "Eye of the Beholder". O'Kun's script {{was on the}} verge of being cut from the show when it was handed to Tracy Tormé for re-writes. Tormé later described it as a [...] "no-lose" [...] situation as he felt that O'Kun's script was so bad anything would be an improvement. Tormé changed the script from O'Kun's serious outline to something more comedic, although he felt that a lot of the comedy elements were later removed before filming. He didn't like the overall result, saying [...] "I didn't <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> the episode when it first aired. It's still one of my least favourite shows that I've been involved with". Because of the work on the episode, Tormé was recruited as executive story editor.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "One of the very best, with the gags coming thick and fast. We <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> the spy camera concealed in Homer's massive stetson, Apu and Marge's trip to the Monster Mart, and 'Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?', possibly the cleverest song in the series. And the Christians harassing people at the Indian airport, and Homer's wastage of three questions, and James Woods' parting words to the Simpsons, and the footage of Apu doing a hummingbird impression..." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: [...] "The first episode to focus on Apu, this one works well. Our glimpses of Apu’s sleaziness and culture are entertaining, and the 'Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?' tune {{is one of the}} better musical numbers [...]" [...] Jacobson went on to say: [...] "Also count James Woods as one of the all-time best guest stars, which is likely why he gets many more lines than the average cameo voice." [...] Total Films Nathan Ditum named Woods' performance in the episode the 19th best guest appearance on The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|The colt {{arrived at}} Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on April 28, 2014. He was {{flown in from}} California, his first time on a plane, and {{traveled}} quietly. Once the plane landed, however, his travel idiosyncrasy was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp; Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground-based transportation. [...] Upon arrival at Churchill Downs, the horses entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given a special saddle cloth to wear while exercising on the track, identifying them as Derby contenders and including their name. [...] The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical error, with California misspelled as [...] "Califorina". He wore it the first day and then the track management obtained one with the correct spelling. Critics commented that bringing the horse in late and not giving him a full workout on the track was a mistake, but Sherman's strategy was backed by Lukas. [...] In {{the days leading up}} to the race, California Chrome galloped on the track, was walked in the saddling paddock, and schooled at the starting gate. Willie Delgado later remarked that the horse did not <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> that particular track, saying [...] "he never actually felt comfortable on it." ...|$|E

500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
500|$|In February 1991, Gamest {{magazine}} {{named her}} {{one of the top}} fifty characters in video games of 1990, placing her twenty-sixth on their list. UGO.com ranked her thirtieth on their [...] "Top 50 Videogame Hotties" [...] list, citing her as [...] "one of the most controversial video game characters to date." [...] Former Tips & Tricks executive editor Wataru Maruyama cited her design {{as an example of how}} an outfit is worn compared to its complexity can make a character memorable and stand out, stating [...] "to use a phrase I don’t <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> to use, she totally worked it." [...] She has also been a subject drawn by non-Capcom artists, such as Falcoon. GameDaily ranked her twenty-third on their [...] "Top 25" [...] list of their favorite Capcom characters, stating of the characters in Final Fight [...] "The Mad Gear gang is a feisty bunch, and we could've picked anyone from the list ... Instead, we selected Poison". GamesRadar named {{her one of}} twelve Street Fighter related characters they wished to see in Super Street Fighter IV, arguing that her status should not be an issue against her inclusion and that the character deserved another stand-alone appearance of her own. Later, GamesRadar included her in the list of [...] "The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years". Joystiq named her their favorite character of the Final Fight series, stating that her [...] "hypersexualized appearance and random flipping" [...] made the character memorable, and that the controversy over her gender made the character even more so.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Bart the Mother" [...] finished 58th {{in the ratings}} for the week of September 21–27, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 7.4, translating to 7,355,600 households. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, called it {{one of her favorite}} The Simpsons episodes, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute". The Toronto Suns Bruce Kirkland wrote that [...] "Bart the Mother" [...] was one of the [...] "classic episodes" [...] of the series' tenth season. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood wrote, [...] "We <b>particularly</b> <b>like</b> the moral dilemma at the end, as underlined by Lisa, regarding the eventual culling of the lizards that will need to take place. A good romp, this one, with some nice laughs at Homer's expense." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said, [...] "The show generates decent heart as it shows Bart’s attempts to make up for his misbehavior. The show becomes reasonably enjoyable if not especially memorable." [...] Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters named the tenth season of The Simpsons the series' [...] "first significant dip in quality, a step away from its golden era [...] with broader gags and more outlandish plots". However, Hassenger enjoyed [...] "Bart the Mother", and wrote, [...] " [...] explores the show’s sweet and dark sides simultaneously as Bart, remorseful after killing a bird, tries to care for orphaned eggs that turn out to hold ravenous lizards." [...] DVD Town's James Plath described [...] "Bart the Mother" [...] as an episode that viewers would either love or hate, because of Bart's rare moments of soul searching, and he found the episode to be a memorable one.|$|E
