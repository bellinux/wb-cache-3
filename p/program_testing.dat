40|$|The semi-adaptive testing procedure, which {{consists}} of a <b>program</b> <b>test</b> for preliminary measurement and a conventional group test for accurate measurement, is proposed. The <b>program</b> <b>test</b> is a short form of the stratified adaptive test with eight pages, each of which contains seven items of diverse difficulty. Each subject is to be tested individually, at first, by the <b>program</b> <b>test</b> and then, to be given an edition of conventional test chosen among nine editions from the easier to the more difficult one. The obtained scores of the <b>program</b> <b>test</b> are used in deciding the appropriate level of difficulty for each edition. Sixty pupils from the first graders to the sixth graders are tested by this semi-adaptive testing procedure, and {{the efficiency of the}} procedure is analyzed in terms of various aspects.
