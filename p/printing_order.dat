Despite the $50 retail price, unexpectedly high demand caused the initial printing of 12,500 copies to sell out in two weeks, and the publishers to triple their projected second <b>printing</b> <b>order</b> to 16,500. Many Christmas purchasers bought gift certificates for the coming printing and some extant copies were resold for over twice the retail price.|$|E
5000|$|Avallone {{has been}} {{prolific}} at writing movie and TV tie-ins, {{more than two}} dozen, beginning with 1963's The Main Attraction. His most successful tie-in {{was the first of}} the Man From U.N.C.L.E. tie-in novels, The Thousand Coffins Affair. Despite its success, ironically, Avallone said that he'd gotten a rotten deal from the publisher on the project. [...] "I did it for a flat fee of $1,000 with a handshake deal to do the rest of the series," [...] said Avallone in a 1989 interview. [...] "Then Ace double-crossed everybody and they got follow-up writers to do the others. They sold it to 60 foreign countries, and it stayed in print until 1970. Every copy of the book says April, 1965 - there's no record of a <b>printing</b> <b>order</b> or anything - but they had five printings in the first three months! Everything to worked right in The Thousand Coffins Affair and it sort of set the pattern for all kinds of TV spy books. I was very satisfied with it, and despite the monetary beating I took, it did get me a lot of work down through the years.". [...] Avallone said he faced some minor editorial restrictions on the U.N.C.L.E. book, at the studio's insistence. The villainous organization of the book, Golgotha, was described by Avallone as being German. [...] "MGM insisted on making them Russians -- and of course this is 1964, the height of the Cold War," [...] he said.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{chemical}} analysis and molecular imaging of questioned documents in a non/minimal-destructive manner {{is important in}} forensic science. Here, we demonstrate that solvent-free gold-nanoparticle-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry is a sensitive and minimal destructive method for direct detection and imaging of ink and visible and/or fluorescent dyes printed on banknotes or written on questioned documents. Argon ion sputtering of a gold foil allows homogeneous coating of {{a thin layer of}} gold nanoparticles on banknotes and checks in a dry state without delocalizing spatial distributions of the analytes. Upon N 2 laser irradiation of the gold nanoparticle-coated banknotes or checks, abundant ions are desorbed and detected. Recording the spatial distributions of the ions can reveal the molecular images of visible and fluorescent ink printed on banknotes and determine the <b>printing</b> <b>order</b> of different ink which may be useful in differentiating real banknotes from fakes. The method can also be applied to identify forged parts in questioned documents, such as number/writing alteration on a check, by tracing different writing patterns that come from different pens. © 2010 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} consumer {{awareness of}} the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions contribution to climate change makes it interesting for companies to communicate their environmental performance by using GHG emissions as an indicator, for example by calculating and communicating the carbon footprint of their products. This master’s thesis is performed as a case study, calculating carbon footprints of products produced by Elanders Sverige AB, a company within the printing industry. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop a carbon footprint calculating tool that could be used to calculate the carbon footprint of a specified <b>printing</b> <b>order.</b> It is mainly intended to be used by production planners at Elanders Sverige AB in order for them to be able to make environmentally informed decisions. A second aim of this thesis has been to study the implementation of carbon footprint in the printing industry. The choice of method for carbon footprint calculations is discussed as well as possibilities and obstacles with calculating carbon footprint for printed matter. The carbon footprint calculations in this study are performed according to PAS 2050 : 2008. No aggregated final result is presented; instead the resulting emissions connected to production and transport of input materials to the printing process, operations in the printing house, transportation of the final printed product to customer and end-of-life are placed in a database from where a carbon footprint of a specific <b>printing</b> <b>order</b> can be calculated. A company specific tool has been created that calculates the carbon footprint by using the database and user input parameters. The calculator is developed to be easy to use and still have a high enough level of complexity of the resulting carbon footprint. The production of electricity purchased for pulp production and production of fillers and binders are identified as examples of uncertain parameters. A carbon footprint calculator is appropriate to use in the printing industry compared to for example calculations for standard products, due to the fact that the printed products varies but also because several suppliers are used for the same input materials to one printing company. This is the case for paper, which also has a largely varying amount of emissions connected to its lifecycle depending on paper type. The conclusion can also be drawn that the printing company has little direct control of the emissions connected to their products, as generally only a small share of the emissions are originating from the operations within the printing house. On the other hand the printing company has large potential to affect the carbon footprint of their products through informed purchase decisions...|$|E

40|$|Although Full Color (FC) High Definition (HD) Additive Manufacturing (AM) {{machines}} {{are available on}} the market today, a FC HD Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) printer has yet to enter the competitive FFF market. Leapfrog, a FFF printer manufacturer, holds a patent that allows the application of coating on 3 D printed FFF filament after it has been deposited. In this thesis work a prototype has been realized that serves as proof of the FC HD FFF concept and forms the basis of the commercial product which will be launched in the near future. Using inkjet technology high development costs can be avoided if existing coating devices are used in the machine. The challenges are to achieve a maximum outer surface coating of the 3 D printed object and minimize {{the time it takes to}} coat a 3 D printed object. This time is increased dramatically by applying a coating layer after every 3 D printed layer compared to no coating. Using the prototype machine several coating methods have been explored of which the most promising method is perpendicular coating. Here, after 3 D printing a layer, droplets are jetted onto the outward facing surface of the object. The total coating time is minimized by grouping contours which can be coated in one swath and sorting the order in which groups are coated. The grouping is done by formulating and solving a bin packing problem. Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and First Fit Decreasing (FFD) are compared and used to solve the problem, achieving more than 80 % time reduction compared to no grouping on test models. A minimal movement time between all the groups is found by solving a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The state of the art solver Concorde (CC) is compared to a Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic. A movement time reduction of 55 % up to 85 % is achieved compared to the standard 3 D <b>printing</b> <b>order</b> on the test models. CC gives a maximum improvement of 2. 3 % over NN. The perpendicular coating method will be used to coat the filament. A significant total print time reduction is possible by grouping. MILP can have a hard time finding a solution for certain data sets, therefore FFD is preferred. For movement time reduction, a 2. 3 % performance increase by CC generally means that printing times are reduced by seconds. This is negligible considering 3 D printing a layer generally takes minutes making NN a suitable heuristic for solving the TSP.

40|$|It {{has been}} known that {{apparent}} trapping percentages caused by changing printing sequence (or <b>printing</b> <b>order)</b> affect the color appearance of the overprint areas. However, no other studies in the past were done in a standard color measurement system- that is the CIE system. This thesis was conducted {{in order to learn}} how the selected printing sequences yellow- magenta-cyan-black, black-cyan-magenta-yellow, yellow-magenta-cyan-black, and cyan-magenta-yellow-black- of a monotack process ink yield the color gamuts on the CIE LAB color space. Since the two sequences: yellow-magenta-cyan-black and cyan-magenta-yellow-black, were recommended to be adopted as standard sequences for SWOP inks, this reseach attempted to prove that these sequences printed by a web-offset press yielded the similar color gamut on the CIE LAB color space. How the abovementioned selected printing sequences affected the changes in the apparent trapping percentages were also studied. The color differences between the color patches printed by changing printing orders and those of the ideal inks were calculated and compared with one another in order to find out whether the overprint colors visually differed from one another or not. Moreover, how the trapping changed the color appearance of the print from what was expected in terms of hue angles and chroma shifts were studied. Last but not least, the colorimetric trapping percentages were also studied. It can be concluded from the findings that the changes of ink sequence of the monotack ink in the web-offset printing caused the wet-trapping percentages change. Thus caused the hue angle and chroma shifts which resulted in different color gamuts. It was proved that the two sequences yellow-magenta-cyan-black and cyan-magenta-yellow-black did not have the similar color gamut on the CIE LAB color space; they produced visually different green. The relationships between ink trapping percentages and visually different color appearance in this study can be explained as follows. It is found that the trapping of yellow over magenta did not yield different color appearances from the trapping of magenta over yellow. The trapping of cyan over yellow yielded different color appearances from the trapping of yellow over cyan, but the trapping of cyan over magenta did not yield different color appearances from the trapping of magenta over cyan. The densitometric apparent trapping percentages calculated from the Preucil 2 ̆ 7 s equation failed to explain the relationships between the red trapping and the color difference of the red printed patches from the red ideal ink. The colorimetric trapping percentages using the Preucil’s concept was proved invalid. Larger sample sizes and other ink sequences are recommended for the next study...|$|E
