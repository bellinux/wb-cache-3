5000|$|The {{oxidation}} process spoils most food, {{especially those}} with a high fat content. Fats quickly turn rancid when exposed to oxygen. Antioxidants prevent or inhibit the oxidation process. The most common antioxidant additives are ascorbic acid (vitamin C [...] ) and ascorbates. Thus, antioxidants are commonly added to oils, cheese, and chips. Other antioxidants include the phenol derivatives BHA, BHT, TBHQ and <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate.</b> These agents suppress the formation of hydroperoxides. Other preservatives include ethanol and methylchloroisothiazolinone.|$|E
50|$|Antioxidants {{are often}} used as {{preservatives}} in fat-containing foods to delay the onset or slow the development of rancidity due to oxidation. Natural antioxidants include ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols (vitamin E). Synthetic antioxidants include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), TBHQ, <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> and ethoxyquin. The natural antioxidants tend to be short-lived, so synthetic antioxidants are used when a longer shelf-life is preferred. The effectiveness of water-soluble antioxidants is limited in preventing direct oxidation within fats, but is valuable in intercepting free radicals that travel through the aqueous parts of foods. A combination of water-soluble and fat-soluble antioxidants is ideal, usually in the ratio of fat to water.|$|E
5000|$|Warmed-over flavor can be {{prevented}} {{by the addition of}} preservatives to processed meat.

Nitrites, a curing agent for meat, may prevent the development of warmed-over flavor by preventing the release of iron during cooking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} investigation, effect of <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate,</b> a free radical scavenger, was studied on {{germination}} of Vigna radiata seeds {{to verify the}} role of active oxygen species in the regulation of seed germination. <b>Propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> inhibited germination and such inhibition was not due to osmotic effect as verified by the treatment with sucrose solution of similar concentrations. Treatments were also effective {{in a similar way}} on water uptake and growth kinetics of isolated embryonic axes. Increasing duration of pretreatment with <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> also retarded seed germination as well as water uptake and growth of axes proportionately. Conversely, incubation in water followed by treatment with <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> caused inhibition of germination immediately after the transfer. Same pattern was noted in case of water uptake and growth kinetics of isolated axes. When the seeds were simultaneously treated with <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> and hydrogen peroxide, germination was restored to a great extent. Such recovery, though to a far lesser extent, was also found with ethylene (in the form of ethrel) given simultaneously with <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate.</b> No added effect was found when seeds were treated with both ethylene and hydrogen peroxide together in presence of <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate.</b> However, recovery effect by these combined treatments was not reflected in case of water uptake and growth kinetics of isolated axes...|$|E

The effects of arginine salts were compared with those of sodium or guanidine salts, indicating that the ability of anions to modulate the <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> solubility is independent of the cation. Comparison of transfer free energy of <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> between sodium and arginine salts indicates that the interaction of <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> is more favorable with arginine than sodium.

The rate of increase in size of colonies developed by heated cells was slower than that of unheated cells, and the presence of antioxidants in recovery agar enhanced this effect. Heat-stressed cells also had increased sensitivity to ethanol. Incubation temperatures of 15, 21, 30, and 37 degrees C for enumerating unheated cells had no significant effect on the numbers of colonies formed on unsupplemented recovery agar; however, incorporation of 100 micrograms of BHA, 200 micrograms of TBHQ, or 1, 000 micrograms of <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> per ml into agar resulted in significant decreases in the number of colonies formed by heated cells at various incubation temperatures. The detrimental effects of TBHQ and <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> on repair of heat-injured cells are apparently expressed at a temperature higher than that observed for BHA.

This study was designed to investigate the factors related to glomerular endothelial cell proliferation and glomerular angiogenesis and assess the effect of <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> on preventing these disorders in diabetic rats. We found that glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular mesangial matrix expansion, and albuminuria were significantly increased in DN rats. CD 31 + endothelial cells significantly increased in glomerulus of diabetic rats. Double immunofluorescence staining showed some structurally defective vasculus tubes in glomerulus. Real-time PCR and western blot demonstrated the glomerular eNOS expression remained at the same level, while remarkable decreased NO productions and suppressed eNOS activities were observed in diabetic rats. Treatment with <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> improved glomerular pathological changes, reduced endothelial cell proliferation, decreased albuminuria, and restored eNOS activity, but did not alter eNOS expression. These data suggest that endothelial cell proliferation and immature angiogenesis may be the contributors to progression of DN. <b>Propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> is a potential novel therapeutic agent on prevention of diabetic nephropathy...|$|E

In the dark stomata remained closed under treatments with ethylene and <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate</b> but opened widely in the presence of H 2 O 2 and AgNO 3. The opening effect was largely unaffected by supplementing the treatment with Na-vanadate (PM H + ATPase inhibitor) and tetraethyl ammonium chloride (K + -channel inhibitor) except that opening was significantly inhibited by the latter in presence of H 2 O 2. On the other hand, H 2 O 2 could not override the closing effect of ethylene at any concentrations while a marginal opening of stomata was found when Ag NO 3 treatment was given together with <b>propyl</b> <b>gallate.</b> CaCl 2 treatment opened stomata in the darkness while LaCl 3 maintained stomata closed.
