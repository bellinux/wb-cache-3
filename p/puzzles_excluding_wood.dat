We note {{that there is a}} trade-off between sequestration and alternative uses of forests such as bioenergy and timber production. A dynamic and probabilistic cost-minimization model is developed, which includes fossil fuel use within the EU Emissions Trading System and forest management in the EU- 27 countries. The results suggest that if policy makers wish to meet emissions targets with 80 % certainty, this goal will be eight times more expensive than when they were unconcerned with uncertainty. Policy makers’ risk attitudes affect forest management strategy primarily through the inclusion of wood products, where potential carbon emissions reductions are high but also highly uncertain. <b>Excluding</b> <b>wood</b> products from a climate strategy can be expensive if policy maker are insensitive to uncertainty...|$|R

Iannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious communities.

In effect, people were more willing to participate in a church that has more stringent demands on its members.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s, {{national}} building regulations in many European countries restricted {{the use of}} timber frames {{for the construction of}} multi-storey buildings. Regulations that stipulated the choice of material in construction <b>excluded</b> <b>wood,</b> {{as a result of a}} number of devastating fires in cities at the end of the 19 th century. As a consequence, no development of multi-storey timber housing took place and other materials such as steel and concrete were used. However, extensive research has shown that material-neutral building regulations are preferable and, for more than two decades, function-based regulations have now become common in many countries, and this has contributed to an increase in the construction of multi-storey timber buildings. In Scandinavia, as one example, the development since the mid- 1990 s of multi-storey timber buildings can be described as a success story, but there are also many other countries that show a positive development in timber construction. There is a great market potential for the use of wood in all types of buildings employing a combination of digital design and CNC processing.

The {{results are presented}} at the European, national and (where possible) regional level. Results concerning carbon stocks, and fluxes of Net Ecosystem Production and Net Biome Production for whole-tree biomass (<b>excluding</b> <b>wood</b> products and soils) were derived from a detailed European forest resource database and converted to carbon using biomass conversion factors. Uncertainties and differences from other estimates are discussed. Based on these detailed national forest inventory data, the estimated carbon stock in whole-tree biomass for the European forest, excluding Russia and the Newly Independent States, amounts to 6. 15 PgC. The annual sink before harvest is estimated at 217 TgC and the sink after harvest is estimated at 77 TgC. The variations in stocks and fluxes throughout Europe are large, with the largest carbon stocks and the largest sinks in Atlantic and Central Europe (regions with abundant precipitation and a not too extreme temperature or drought regime).

40|$|Purpose: Lignin is a {{by-product}} of wood pulping that is normally used as fuel on-site (black liquor), but also has some applications {{in the field of}} new biomaterials. This study focuses on the life cycle inventory of lignin originating from the kraft pulping process, for polymer applications. The system boundary includes lignin precipitation from black liquor, washing, and drying, but excludes subsequent application-specific compatibilization modifications. Lignin transportation is considered to rely exclusively on trucking. Methods: This work is based on the ecoinvent v 2. 2 database and the IMPACT 2002 + impact assessment method. Special attention is given to the net effect of lignin precipitation on the mass and energy balances of the kraft process. Because the kraft black liquor supply will far exceed the demand for non-fuel uses for the foreseeable future, it is considered appropriate to use either the marginal variation method of physical allocation or a system boundary expansion. Consequently, the system boundary includes natural gas as a substitute fuel (when applicable) but <b>excludes</b> <b>wood</b> harvesting and the pulping process. Results and discussion: The main impacts of kraft lignin come from the natural gas subsystem (fuel substitution and drying) despite a significantly cleaner combustion than for black liquor. Other significant contributors include the production of carbon dioxide for precipitation, sulfuric acid for washing, and sodium hydroxide to make up for sodium losses, all of which have some improvement potential. Conclusions: The environmental profile of kraft lignin tends to be preferable to synthetic organic compounds of similar molecular complexity because its initial transformation chain is relatively energy efficient. It is thus an environmentally sound choice for polymer applications as long as nearunity substitution ratios can be achieved without requiring compatibilization modifications that are too environmentally intensive and without affecting other stages of the product life cycle. In particular, the end-of-life performance depends on long-term lignin sequestration. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Stickies {{refer to}} tacky {{contaminants}} in recovered paper, <b>excluding</b> <b>wood</b> extractives. Stickies originate from adhesives, ink binders and coating binders. Stickies {{able to pass}} a sieve of 100 or 150 μm (depending on standard) are called micro stickies, whereas the particles retained on the screen are called macro stickies. Dissolved and colloidal stickies are called secondary stickies. There are standard methods for macro stickies, but a standard method measuring {{the total amount of}} stickies is lacking. Furthermore, the size distribution, and nature of stickies in the sense if they are free particles or agglomerated with some other substances, has not been previously known. The information on the removal of stickies in different unit operations was also not known very well except for macro stickies. The aim of this thesis was thus to develop an analysis method for the total amount of stickies, determine the size distribution and nature of stickies, and find ways to better remove stickies in the deinking process. Extraction with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with Size Exclusion Column (SEC) was used here to separate hydrophobic polymers (stickies) from the pulp suspension. An Evaporating solvent Light Scattering (ELS) detector was utilized to quantify the polymers after SEC. This analysis procedure was used in this thesis to measure stickies. Fractionation of pulp before the analysis was carried out if information of different-sized stickies was desired. The majority of stickies are micro stickies. A significant, although lower, portion of stickies are macrostickies, especially {{in the beginning of the}} deinking process. The dissolved and colloidal phase was found to contain wood extractives, and only trace amounts of stickies. Flotation is very effective in stickies removal. Ink and micro stickies were removed nearly equally in flotation, because they both are hydrophobic and are both in an optimal size range for removal in flotation. Ink measurements may be used for estimating the trends of stickies removal in flotation. The stickies removal in flotation may be enhanced by optimizing the pulper chemistry...|$|R

40|$|From a biophysical perspective, {{woody biomass}} {{resources}} are {{large enough to}} cover a substantial share of the world's primary energy consumption in 2050. However, these resources have alternative uses and their accessibility is limited, which tends to decrease their competitiveness with respect {{to other forms of}} energy.

In this study we consider the question from the perspective of energy wood supply curves, which display the available amount of woody biomass for large-scale energy production at various hypothetical energy wood prices. These curves are estimated by the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), which is a global partial equilibrium model of forest and agricultural sectors.

However, {{the structure of the}} xylophagous food web remains unclear for saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps, but fungi are believed to play an important role, both in direct and indirect nutritional acquisition and production of volatile chemicals. In the first study of its kind this thesis explores the importance of volatiles in host-searching behaviour and role of fungi in oviposition choice and larval nutrition, using three endophytic fungi, Stereum hirsutum, Stereum gausapatum and Eutypa spinosa, and two tree species Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, in early stage decay. Newly designed traps, <b>excluding</b> <b>wood</b> visual stimuli, provided the first evidence of wood-fungal volatile attraction by saproxylic wood-boring beetles, including primary and secondary xylophages, and their parasitoid wasps. Expanding on these results, the importance of fungi was further demonstrated through oviposition choice in field logs by two polyphagous cerambycid species. Ovipositing within or 20 mm from their preferred fungal species plug, females chose abiotic conditions suitable for sustaining fungal growth, suggesting a larval nutritional benefit. Further investigation, using one of the cerambycid species above, corroborated, via olfactometry, that volatiles from the preferred wood-fungal combination were attractants to gravid females, and induced ovipositor probing within the olfactometer. In addition, GC-EAG found six volatile compounds provoked an antennal response, including a monoterpene, two sesquiterpenes, an alkane and a ketone. Most importantly olfactometry and GC-EAG showed gravid females were unresponsive to wood or favored fungus presented singly. The result are discussed herein. In conjunction with the volatile only field trap experiment, a novel method to promote fungal only volatiles, by autoclaving the wood prior to sub-culturing, was trialed. GC-MS comparative analysis showed disparity between agar sub-cultured, autoclaved wood and natural wood with fungi, volatiles. This suggests that genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases are regulated according to carbohydrate source, nutritional availability, oxygen and metal ions, supporting the variations observed. These results are discussed herein with regard to xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps. The principal findings of this thesis are that wood-fungal interaction volatiles of the ephemeral early decay stage provide important olfactory host resource cues for saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps. Fungi, and particular, endophytic fungi, were shown to be a key component of the early stage xylophagous food web through volatile production, and as nutritional support evidenced by oviposition choice, olfactometry, GC-EAG and GC-MS analysis. This thesis has opened a new, exciting and important area of research with the potential to radically improve conservation management and employ a more holistic approach. These insights bring together the disparate research conducted individually on wood decay fungi, saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid waspsImperial Users onl...|$|R

40|$|Located in {{southwest}} Turkey, {{not far from}} the seacoast, the natural caves of Öküzini and Karain B were inhabited by prehistoric populations during the Late Glacial and beyond. The Epipalaeolithic populations left traces of different occupation phases dated between 16. 560 ± 180 uncal BP (18. 200 - 17. 400 cal BC) to 12. 130 ± 100 uncal BP (14. 400 - 11. 800 cal BC) in Öküzini, around 15. 000 uncal BP in Karain B. The topic of this research was to examine the macrobotanical remains associated with the Epipalaeolithic occupations, with the underlying aims to acquire insights about the economy of these communities and their use of the environmental resources. A first research paper addresses the issue of plant macroremain identification, in particular the identification of „thick shelled“ plant remains. Morphological comparison with the range of potential species and present geographical distribution made it possible to refine the determination to a double species: Amygdalus orientalis or A. graeca. These plants could grow in the surroundings of the sites on rocky slopes or sandy hills and had to be collected during late summer. All wild Amygdalus seeds are toxic, so that their use as food can be disputed. However, through examination of the detoxification possibilities, nutritional properties and ethnographic analogies for the use of wild almonds, we {{came to the conclusion that}} the seeds probably played a notable role in the diet of the Epipalaeolithic population of southwest Anatolia. A comparison with further published prehistoric “nutshell” finds from the Near East supports a long and widely distributed tradition of wild almond use. The analyses of the whole plant macroremain assemblages (<b>excluding</b> <b>wood</b> charcoals) identified at least 18 taxa and “categories” of remains, mainly carbonised. The importance and the role of the plants – particularly in the diet and their bearing on the seasonality of occupation of the sites – have been evaluated with quantitative and qualitative data. Nuts (principally Amygdalus, wild almond), fruits (principally Pyrus, wild pear), bulbs, roots or tubers (underground storage organs) seem to have occupied a particularly important place in these communities during all Epipalaeolithic phases, at the expense of small-seeded plants. The attested plants would have provided carbohydrates, lipids and micronutrients complementing well the meat diet. The cost of acquisition of the major plant resources was estimated: nuts and underground storage organs were generally considered as high ranked resources, providing a resource easy to gather and to process for a high calorific return. The almonds had a higher cost of acquisition. Their richness in fats and their availability at the onset of the winter season however could justify the additional work required for their detoxification. Judging from the seasonality indices of the plants and ungulate fauna at Öküzini, the cave could have been inhabited periodically in all seasons, but particularly in spring and autumn. A third paper presented the use of firewood and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction using anthracological and other environmental data. The diversity of fuel wood used was moderate and at both sites Acer (maple), Amygdalus (wild almond) and Fraxinus (ash) were the most common and important taxa. Secondary taxa were composed of Maloideae, Pyrus (wild pear), Prunus (wild plum), Quercus (cadufoliate oak), and Rhamnus/Phillyrea (buckthorn/mock privet). No chronological changes were observed. The major difference between both caves was the presence of hygrophilous and mesophillous taxa in Öküzini, whereas Coniferous wood was more common in Karain B, leading to the interpretation of an opportunistic exploitation of the surroundings of each site. Despite the poverty of the Late Glacial vegetation, there was no indication of use of alternative fuel material. These Epipalaeolithic populations seem to have responded to shortages rather through mobility than intensification. The anthracological results have been integrated to present-day knowledge of the environment of southwest Anatolia in an attempt to reconstruct the local vegetation. Among the different models of optimal foraging, the diet breadth model predicts that the resource a forager chooses from an available set of resources depends on their efficiency rank and abundance in the environment. Knowing from former investigations what plant resources were collected by the Epipalaeolithic populations from Öküzini and Karain B, we used this model to estimate the richness of the various classes of plant resources in the environment of the sites. An exploitation of high ranked plant resources, the nuts and the roots, bulbs or tubers, instead of small seeds, probably reflected their good availability in the environment. On the other hand, although the pattern of fuel use did not show any indices of wood scarcity, the reconstruction of the vegetation resulted in an environment not particularly rich in plant resources. The density of population being low, we suppose that the Epipalaeolithic populations living in this region adapted to their natural conditions in moving regularly their camps...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Texas Agricultural Extension Service Rangeland Ecology and Management Program Unit (TAEX-RLEM) initiated the Rangeland Resource Survey in 1997 to evaluate the success of the Unit in educating and satisfying Texas agricultural operators. The survey addressed demographics, knowledge of rangeland, and satisfaction with TAEX. Recipients included agricultural landowners and current TAEX clientele, with the null hypothesis that all operators had the same knowledge of rangeland and level of satisfaction with TAEX. The survey was mailed to 3200 Texas landowner and TAEX clientele across the state (<b>excluding</b> the Piney <b>Woods)</b> and most likely reflected the Texas agricultural operator population; 1058 surveys (33 %) were returned usable for analysis. The major findings of this analysis were as follows: Extension clientele and participants scored higher on the knowledge section of the survey including brush management, grazing management, and general rangeland questions and utilized more management practices compared to landowners and non- participants, respectively. All questions reflected specific teaching points of TAEX- RLEM. Participants who operated ranches, owned larger acreage, attended programs more than twice in 12 months, and utilized TAEX for brush and/or grazing management information scored higher on brush, grazing, and general rangeland questions compared to participants who operated other operations, owned smaller acreage, attended two or less programs, or did not utilize TAEX for brush/grazing management information. All respondent categories indicated that they relied on TAEX for agricultural information more than any other agency. Responses indicated that 88. 7 % of landowners will use TAEX in the future, along with 91. 8 % of clientele and 99. 1 % of participants. Respondent categories indicated a range of 93. 4 % (landowners) to 98. 8 % (participants) would recommend TAEX to others.
