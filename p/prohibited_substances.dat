5|$|Inhaling a xenon/oxygen mixture {{activates}} {{production of}} the transcription factor HIF-1-alpha, which may lead to increased production of erythropoietin. The latter hormone is known to increase red blood cell production and athletic performance. Reportedly, doping with xenon inhalation {{has been used in}} Russia since 2004 and perhaps earlier. On August 31, 2014, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) added xenon (and argon) to the list of <b>prohibited</b> <b>substances</b> and methods, although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet been developed. In addition, effects of xenon on erythropoietin production in humans have not been demonstrated, so far.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{applications}} of the western blot technique include its use by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). [...] Blood doping is the misuse of certain techniques and/or substances to increase one's red blood cell mass, which allows the body to transport more oxygen to muscles and therefore increase stamina and performance. [...] There are three widely known substances or methods used for blood doping, namely, erythropoietin (EPO), synthetic oxygen carriers and blood transfusions. Each is prohibited under WADA's List of <b>Prohibited</b> <b>Substances</b> and Methods.|$|E
2500|$|A shame {{campaign}} is a tactic in which particular individuals are singled {{out because of}} their behavior or suspected crimes, often by marking them publicly, such as Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. In the Philippines, Alfredo Lim popularized such tactics during his term as mayor of Manila. On July 1, 1997, he began a controversial [...] "spray paint shame campaign” {{in an effort to}} stop drug use. He and his team sprayed bright red paint on two hundred squatter houses whose residents had been charged, but not yet convicted, of selling <b>prohibited</b> <b>substances.</b> Officials of other municipalities followed suit.

Victory Tilly's owner and breeder Hans-Gunnar Tillander of Stall Tilly got hugely disappointed by this affair and, as a consequence, opted to sell all his racing horses.

2500|$|In {{response}} to rising {{drug use among}} young people and the counterculture movement, government efforts to enforce prohibition were strengthened in many countries from the 1960s onward. Support at an international level for the prohibition of psychoactive drug use became a consistent feature of United States policy during both Republican and Democratic administrations, {{to such an extent}} that US support for foreign governments has often been contingent on their adherence to US drug policy. Major milestones in this campaign include the introduction of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1971 and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in 1988. [...] A few developing countries where consumption of the <b>prohibited</b> <b>substances</b> has enjoyed longstanding cultural support, long resisted such outside pressure to pass legislation adhering to these conventions. Nepal only did so in 1976.|$|E
