5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E
5|$|There is a <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> wild flowers, {{including}} mountain everlasting, spring squill and eyebright {{as well as}} {{the ubiquitous}} heather. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa Stour are a Special Area of Conservation. The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, {{sphagnum}} moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are <b>profusions</b> <b>of</b> wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|R
50|$|The late Victorian {{and early}} Edwardian children's book market was flooded by {{inexpensive}} small format books with <b>profusions</b> <b>of</b> illustrations {{made possible by}} technological advances in colour reproduction. The publishing firm of Frederick Warne & Co. wanted to compete in this lucrative market and chose to publish Peter Rabbit after receiving an enthusiastic endorsement from their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. The illustrations were reproduced by the then-new Hentschel three-colour process which favoured a painterly rather than a linear style and was kinder to watercolours than chromolithography.|$|R

5|$|Maribojoc {{had five}} {{intricately}} carved Neo-Gothic retablos {{in the sanctuary}} and transepts. Striking features of the retablo were the presence of arches, crockets, Mudéjar stars and the <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> carving. The whole retablo was probably completed in January 7, 1934 as a project of the Comité de Obras during the term of Father Quiterio Sarigumba (P.Q.S.) as seen on the inscription in {{the upper reaches of}} the central retablo. An older retablo, built from 1616 to 1692, predated the church.|$|E
5|$|Steep {{contacts}} between the thick basal breccia of Mount Silverthrone and older crystalline rocks of adjacent peaks {{suggest that the}} breccia {{is part of a}} caldera-fill succession. The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and a <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> dikes within the breccia—but not in adjacent country rock—provide further evidence of the Silverthrone Caldera. Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{quantities}} of copper objects, triangular terracotta cakes, seals, small terracotta jars with <b>profusions</b> <b>of</b> gold, silver, bronze and other ornaments were found.

[...] A belt containing 36 carnelian beads was found, proof of highly skilled workers being settled in the area.Archeologists believe that findings of gold and silver ornaments, {{as well as the}} usage of stone at the village indicate some of the residents were well to do. This site is well excavated one and a total of 240,000 vessels and shreds were collected and tabulated.|$|R
40|$|This study {{involved}} {{the examination of}} 1, 006 chest x-ray films of workers from the industries devoted to shipyard welding, stone grinding, and refractory crushing in southern Okayama prefecture. Of the reviewed films, analysis was focused on subjects with a <b>profusion</b> rate <b>of</b> 0 / 1 as well as pneumoconiotic subjects (exhibiting <b>profusion</b> rates <b>of</b> 1 / 0 or greater) in order to discover cases in the beginning stages. One-hundred-and-seventy-four films illustrated a <b>profusion</b> rate <b>of</b> 0 / 1 or greater, and the proportion <b>of</b> this <b>profusion</b> rate was revealed to be highest in shipyard welders. Even some workers under 40 years of age {{were found to have}} already developed pneumoconiosis. Of these 1, 006 subjects, 30 volunteers permitted us to measure their personal dust exposure concentrations. The measured concentration of the shipyard welders' dust exposure (respirable dust; 3. 3 86. 3 mg/m 3, total dust; 7. 5 - 117. 0 mg/m 3) was higher than those of the other 2 industries. Statistical differences among the industries were observed in the respirable dust concentrations. A statistically significant positive correlation was demonstrated between the working duration in dusty environments and the rate <b>of</b> <b>profusion.</b> The present findings suggest the need for taking adequate measures in Okayama in order to prevent workers from developing, or to help retard the progression of, pneumoconiosis. </p...|$|R
500|$|Potter {{declared}} the tale her next favorite to The Tailor of Gloucester. The pictures {{are some of}} the most beautiful Potter ever created, especially the <b>profusions</b> <b>of</b> flowers in the doorways and garden plots. [...] The colors in the illustrations are not the muted browns and greens the reader expects in a Potter illustration, nor are they the contrasting colors such as the muted reds and blues Potter uses occasionally to give her illustrations a splash of color. Instead, the colors are bright oranges, violets, and yellows seldom seen in her other books. Even Ribby's lilac dress and Duchess's black mane illustrate Potter's concern for color in this book.|$|R

5|$|The second barcarolle, {{dedicated}} to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, {{and points to the}} influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 {{in the middle of the}} piece.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished.|$|E

5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done much {{in recent years to}} make country rock a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} the <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> passing. Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times for a total gain of one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, three interceptions, and a touchdown. He rushed six times for -43 yards because sacks are counted as runs for negative yardage. Texas also was hurt by penalty yardage. The Longhorns' nine penalties for 91 yards are both Texas bowl-game records.|$|E

Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E

While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a <b>profusion</b> <b>of</b> wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E
