40|$|Copyright © 2014 Entomological Society of America. In the Azores archipelago, a {{significant}} proportion of buildings are infested with the urban exotic drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis (Walker), causing major economical and <b>patrimonial</b> <b>losses.</b> This work aims to understand the potential spread of this termite species in the Azores and estimate the costs for both treatment and reconstruction of infested buildings in the entire archipelago. A maximum entropy niche modeling process was used to determine the potential occurrence of the species on each island. Different scenarios were built using independent global and regional incidence and environmental data. Both projections reveal the same pattern. Generally, the probability of occurrence is higher near the coast line, where, in Azores, the majority of the towns and villages are located. We also predict that the infestation has potential to spread to yet unaffected towns and islands. It is estimated that the cost of treating all currently infested buildings in the archipelago is € 51 million, while reconstruction of the same buildings would rise the costs to € 175 million. We predict that the absence of a control strategy will cause a further expansion of the pest to more localities in the Azores. An estimate to future scenarios implies higher costs, with treatment and rebuilding values rising up to eight times the current values...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{physiological}} and economical {{impacts of the}} roadside trees pruning. The management of the roadside trees requires special care. Several factors interact with their growth and development, many trees presenting decay. In addition of aesthetic impact, this decay leads to high pruning costs, or even costs of replacing trees, and serious risk of tree fall. Although the situations {{are more and more}} complicated, an increasing lack in trees monitoring is observed. Due to neglected plantations, overpruning is very often adopted, although researchers have demonstrated for several years the damage of this practice. An economic study is here proposed and concerns a walkway of common limes (Tilia X europaea L.). It constituted a landscape reference mark of high patrimonial value. Trees were topped and their crowns were overpruned. The comparison of costs between crown thinning at regular intervals and topping shows a ratio of one to two or more and a <b>patrimonial</b> value <b>loss</b> of trees of nearly 85 /. Customer education and teaching managers are the best ways to stop drastic pruning, due only to easier alternative and a lack of professionalism...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of capital or non-indemnity insurance, the insurer {{undertakes}} to pay to the insured a specified amount, or periodical amounts, upon the happening of the event insured against: for example, R5,000 if the insured dies or loses a limb. This is generally non-patrimonial loss. On the face of it, the contract does not purport to indemnify the insured against <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{indemnity}} insurance, the contract between the parties provides that the insurer must indemnify the insured for <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss</b> suffered as the proximate result of the occurrence of the event insured against. It is uncertain whether the event insured against (like fire or theft, for example) will actually occur, but it obviously must before loss can be quantified.|$|E

The objective-reasonableness test may be satisfied by looking at the foreseeability of such an injury. There are six established principles: ...|$|E
50|$|Damage - {{finally the}} conduct must have {{resulted}} {{in some form of}} loss or harm to the claimant {{in order for them to}} have a claim. This damage can take the form of <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss</b> (a reduction in a person's financial position, such as is the case where the claimant incurred medical expenses) or non-patrimonial damages (damages that cannot be related to a person's financial estate, but compensation for something like pain and suffering).|$|E
50|$|In {{an action}} for damages alleged to {{have been caused by}} the defendant's negligence, culpa arises, for the {{purposes}} of liability, only if a diligens paterfamilias in the position of the defendant not only would have foreseen the reasonable possibility of his conduct injuring another in his person or property and causing him <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss,</b> but would also have taken reasonable steps to guard against such an occurrence, and if the defendant failed to take such steps.|$|E
50|$|The condictio furtiva is used {{in cases}} where {{property}} has been stolen, in order to recover the <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss.</b> The action is available only against the thief, {{but it may be}} brought by all persons with a lawful interest in the property. It is essential, however, that the claimant be the owner or have the lawful interest at all relevant times: that is, the interest must exist {{at the time of the}} theft and must still endure at the time the action is instituted.|$|E
50|$|One obvious {{prerequisite}} for liability {{in terms of}} the law of delict is that the plaintiff must have suffered harm; {{in terms of the}} Aquilian action, that harm must be patrimonial, which traditionally meant monetary loss sustained due to physical damage to a person or property. Now, however, <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss</b> also includes monetary loss resulting from injury to the nervous system and pure economic loss. A plaintiff may claim compensation both for loss actually incurred and for prospective loss, including, for instance, the loss of earning capacity, future profits, income and future expenses.|$|E
50|$|Prof. Soysa's {{appeal to}} the Court of Appeal was dismissed, however the quantum of damages was reduced as under the Common Law of Sri Lanka which is Roman Dutch law, damages could only be awarded for <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss.</b> The Supreme Court allowed Prof. Soysa's appeal setting aside {{judgments}} of both lower courts. In a landmark judgment heavily critical of {{the decisions of the}} lower courts, the Supreme Court held that causation was not established on a balance of probabilities by the plaintiff. The defendant was also allowed costs of action, which she declined to accept.|$|E
50|$|Delictual {{remedies}} {{offer the}} owner compensation or damages for {{interference with the}} exercise of his rights of ownership. Most often the delict is a wrongful alienation resulting in financial loss. Delictual remedies are appropriate where physical restoration of the property is impossible: that is, where the property has been lost or destroyed or damaged, {{in which case the}} owner is entitled to be compensated for his <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss.</b> Three delictual remedies are relevant to the law of property: the condictio furtiva, the actio ad exhibendum and the actio legis Aquiliae. They are all personal remedies rather than real ones.|$|E
5000|$|The delictual inquiry [...] "is {{in fact a}} loss-allocation exercise, the {{principles}} and rules of which are {{set out in the}} law of delict." [...] The classic remedy for a delict is compensation: a claim of damages for the harm caused. If this harm takes the form of <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss,</b> one uses the Aquilian action; if pain and suffering associated with bodily injury, a separate action arises, similar to the Aquilian action but of Germanic origin; finally, if the harm takes the form of injury to a personality interest (an injuria), the claim is made in terms of the actio injuriarum.|$|E
50|$|The {{court found}} it could accept, from what {{different}} writers had {{written on the}} subject, {{that the right to}} compensation for pure <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss</b> was recognized in the Roman law in certain limited cases, although this right was still relative to a thing or a corpus. It could also accept that in the Roman-Dutch law compensation for pure <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss</b> was awarded in certain cases, indicating that Aquilian liability was extended beyond the Roman-law boundary of damage to property. In whatever manner the decisions of the different judges in the Appellate Division in Herschel v Mrupe were interpreted, it appeared to the court to be clear that the existence of such a right in South African law had not been rejected by the Appellate Division; on the contrary, it was recognized. The unsatisfactory state of affairs which had existed in South African law since the Herschel case, the differing judgments in provincial divisions subsequent thereto, and the attitude of both the appellant and the respondent in the Appellate Division in the present case that such a right exists, were sound reasons, the court found, for a judgment now to be given recognising or rejecting the existence of such a right in the common law. The birthpangs of such a right of action had endured so long, the court held, that the time had arrived, perhaps even with a Caesarean section, to bring the child into the world. Pursuing the metaphor, the court foretold {{that it would be a}} problem child, but that, with the necessary love and especially discipline, it could play a useful role in legal life.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the two}} major delictual actions derived from Roman law (the actio legis Aquiliae for <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss</b> and the actio iniuriarum for sentimental damages in cases of libel) do not provide for the recovery of immaterial damages flowing from injury to the human body. This action for pain and suffering which forms part and panel of modem South African law {{has its roots in}} other legal systems. This article aims to trace its moral philosphical origins with reference to the views of Thomas of Aquino, authors of manuals used during confession and the sixteenth-century Spanish philosophers, as well as their influence on the important Roman-Dutch author, Hugo de Groot.

40|$|The {{so-called}} “wrongful life” {{action is}} a widely debated topic in South Africa and abroad. In South Africa academic discourse escalated after Stewart v Botha 2007 6 SA 247 (SCA). The recent Western Cape decision of the High Court in C J H v The Kingsbury Foetal Assessment Centre (Pty) Ltd case number 4872 / 2013 (WCC) 24 April 2014 and the subsequent appeal to the Constitutional Court in that matter call {{for a review of}} the development of our common law regarding the child’s remedy in delict to ensure that it is in line with our Constitution. As the Kingsbury matter was decided at exception stage, the record was such that the Constitutional Court granted leave to amend the particulars of claim, referred the matter back and provided guidance to the High Court to reconsider the merits. This contribution recommends a new stance on the child’s remedy in light of the direct and indirect application of our Constitution, applicable international law and last but not the least, the Children’s Act 38 of 2005. It is recommended that this delictual remedy should rid itself of its inappropriate name and take its rightful place within the framework of our generalised law of delict. The facts of each case will then determine whether only <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss</b> or patrimonial and non-patrimonial loss should be claimed. The National Research Foundation[URL] La...|$|E
40|$|This inaugural {{lecture on}} the law of delict draws {{attention}} to a branch of South African private law which has been profoundly influenced by academic writings. In a preliminary historical survey it is pointed out that the foundations of our law of delict are firmly embedded in Roman law and its further development on the Continent, namely the ius commune. Attention is, however, drawn to the fact that concepts gleaned from the English law of torts have over a prolonged period infiltrated the realm of our common law rules of delict, ultimately resulting in a truly South African law of delict. In this context it is pointed out that any attempt to purge this field of our law of its English elements would be futile. The modern tendency to simplify the basis of all claims pertaining to patrimonial damages by declaring it to be Aquilian in nature is subjected to criticism; it is submitted that the modern researcher is confronted mainly by four problems in his quest for the true basis of delictual liability in cases involving <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss,</b> namely: that principles of the law of delict are scattered throughout the pages of the Corpus luris Civilis, that principles of delict and crime are intermingled throughout our common law literautre, that {{little is known about the}} true contents of the old authorities which form the basis of research and, finally, that none of the old authorities extensively treats what may be termed "general principles" of delict. The study of delict by means of the so-called "elementological process" is scrutinized,. In the first place different academic approaches to the elements of delict are afforded, followed by an exposition of instances in which our courts have followed this modern aproach. In conclusion some remarks are made in regard to tuition of this extremely challenging subject. It is pointed out that historical and comparative research in this field are of utmost importance, and that in this respect our law faculties must be regarded as the last bastion of basic legal research in South AfricaItem was scanned at 300 dpi.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{will explore}} the revolutionary progression {{in the provision}} of monetary damages and the availability thereof due to the change in South Africa’s legal system from Parliamentary sovereignty to Constitutional supremacy after the enactment of the final Constitution in 19961. The Constitution of South Africa brought with it the concepts of justification and accountability as the Bill of Rights enshrines fundamental rights and the remedies for the infringement of same. The available remedies for the infringement of a fundamental right flow from two sources, being either from the development of the common law remedies in line with the Bill of Rights or alternatively from Section 38 of the Constitution, which provides for a remedy which provides ‘appropriate’ relief. The question that will be raised in this dissertation is, ‘does appropriate relief include an award of delictual damages?’ or a question related thereto ‘is an award of monetary damages an appropriate remedy?’ The motivation for this dissertation arises from the plethora of case law, especially in the Eastern Cape, that has come to the fore in the last sixteen years, highlighting the injustice of cancellations of social assistance grants and the non-payment of such in South Africa’s social security system, as well as the precedent that was set by our Constitutional Court and Supreme Court in remedying that injustice. The central case to this dissertation is that of Kate v Member of Executive Council for Department of Welfare, Eastern Cape 2005 1 SA 141 SECLD; Member of Executive Council, Department of Welfare, Eastern Cape v Kate 2006 (4) SA 478 (SCA), which is generally regarded as having {{paved the way for the}} granting of monetary damages for the infringement of an individual’s constitutional right as same require legal protection. Firstly the past approach to damages will be explored in relation to South Africa’s common law, being the Roman-Dutch law. The common law Aquilian action is the focal point of this dissertation in relation to the common law in that the granting of damages for the infringement of an individual’s social assistance right (being a specific constitutional right framed within the 1996 Constitution) results in pure <b>patrimonial</b> <b>loss</b> which in our common law system was remedied by the actio legis Aquilae. In delict, an award of damages is the primary remedy, aimed at affording compensation in respect of the legal right or interest infringed. After the common law system of damages has been explored, this dissertation will then examine the changes that have developed therefrom, and largely shaped by the current state of disorganization in the National Department of Welfare coupled with the all encompassing power of the final Constitution. The final Constitution provides the power, in section 38 of the 1996 Constitution, for the court to award a monetary remedy for the breach of a constitutional right. The question, however, is “does the award of monetary damages not merely throw money at the problem, whereas the purpose of a constitutional remedy is to vindicate guaranteed rights and prevent or deter future violations?” The battle for domination between the common law approach and the constitutional approach to damages is witnessed as the two systems eventually amalgamate to form an essentially new remedy, unique to South Africa. South Africa’s new system is aligned with the Constitution as the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and underpins the awarding of all damages and, especially, the awarding of constitutional damages. For the sake of completeness, alternatives to monetary damages will also be canvassed in this dissertation. It is hoped that the reader will, in the end, realize that the final Constitution is the supreme law of the land and as such dictates the manner and form in which damages are provided. If such provision is not in alignment with the Constitution, it will be declared invalid. The flexibility of our common law is put to the test, yet it is found to be adaptable to the ever-developing boni mores of society exemplified in the embracing constitutional principles and the production of this new remedy. The courts develop the common law under section 39 (2) of the Constitution in order to keep the common law in step with the evolution of our society and the ever changing nature of bonos mores.
