2500|$|<b>Pinterest's</b> earlier {{terms of}} service ambiguously {{asserted}} ownership of user content.

25|$|<b>Pinterest</b> has a {{notification}} system that copyright holders {{can use to}} request that content {{be removed from the}} site. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) safe harbor status of <b>Pinterest</b> has been questioned given that it actively promotes its users to copy to <b>Pinterest,</b> for their perpetual use, any image on the Internet. <b>Pinterest</b> users cannot claim safe harbor status and as such are exposed to possible legal action for pinning copyright material. Because <b>Pinterest</b> allows user to transfer information, intellectual property rights come to play. Pinterest's system is in line with Nicolas de Condorcet's view that the public’s interest in knowledge trumps the author’s property rights.|$|E

50|$|In October 2013, Chou {{attended}} the annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, where she became {{curious about the}} issue of female representation in technology companies, and decided to gather data to assess the severity of the issue. This led her to write a blog post urging technology companies to disclose the numbers of women they had in technical roles. To facilitate sharing of the responses she received, Chou set up a repository on code-sharing site GitHub which allows anyone to submit a pull request. Within a week, the repository had statistics on over 50 firms, and by January 2016, it had statistics on 250 firms.

5000|$|Some {{social media}} sites have greater {{potential}} for content that is posted there to spread virally over social networks. This is an analogy {{to the concept}} of a viral infectious disease in biology, some of which can spread rapidly from an infected person to another person. In a social media context, content or websites that are [...] "viral" [...] (or which [...] "go viral") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing controversial content (e.g., Kim Kardashian's nude photos that [...] "broke the Internet" [...] and crashed servers) or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and re-shared by huge numbers of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content - for example, Twitter's retweet button, <b>Pinterest's</b> pin function, Facebook's share option or Tumblr's reblog function. Businesses have a particular interest in viral marketing tactics because such a campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the [...] "viral" [...] reposting itself makes the news) for {{a fraction of the cost}} of a traditional marketing campaign (e.g., billboard ads, television commercials, magazine ads, etc.). Nonprofit organizations and activists may have similar interests in posting content online with the hopes that it goes viral. The social news website Slashdot, sometimes has news stories that, once posted on its website, [...] "go viral"; the Slashdot effect refers to this situation.|$|R
