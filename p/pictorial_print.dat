60|$|Then {{came the}} little bit of Socialism, very {{sensible}} and very quietly put. 'How can we have fine art when the worker is condemned to monotonous and mechanical labour in the midst of dull or hideous surroundings, when cities and nature are sacrificed to commercial greed, when cheapness is the god of Life?' In old days the craftsman was a designer; he had his 'prentice days of quiet study; and even the painter began by grinding colours. Some little old ornament still lingers, here and there, on the brass rosettes of cart-horses, in the common milk-cans of Antwerp, in the water-vessels of Italy. But even this is disappearing. 'The tourist passes by' and creates a demand that commerce satisfies in an unsatisfactory manner. We have not yet arrived at a healthy state of things. There is still the Tottenham Court Road and a threatened revival of Louis Seize furniture, and the 'popular <b>pictorial</b> <b>print</b> struggles through the meshes of the antimacassar.' Art depends on Life. We cannot get it from machines. And yet machines are bad only when they are our masters. The printing press is a machine that Art values because it obeys her. True art must have the vital energy of life itself, must take its colours from life's good or evil, must follow angels of light or angels of darkness. The art of the past is not to be copied in a servile spirit. For a new age we require a new form.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith {{increasing}} research {{advances and}} clinical trials of visual prostheses, {{there is significant}} demand {{to better understand the}} perceptual and psychophysical aspects of prosthetic vision. In prosthetic vision a visual scene is composed of relatively large, isolated, spots of light so-called “phosphenes”, very much like a magnified <b>pictorial</b> <b>print.</b> The utility of prosthetic vision has been studied by investigators in the form of virtual–reality visual models (simulations) of prosthetic vision administered to normally sighted subjects. In this review, the simulations from these investigations are examined with respect to how they visually render the phosphenes and the virtual–reality apparatus involved. A comparison is made between these simulations and the actual descriptions of phosphenes reported from human trials of visual prosthesis devices. For the results from these simulation studies to be relevant to the experience of visual prosthesis recipients, it is important that, the simulated phosphenes must be consistent with the descriptions from human trials. A standardized simulation and reporting framework is proposed so that future simulations may be configured to be more realistic to the experience of implant recipients, and the simulation parameters from different investigators may be more readily extracted, and study results more fittingly compared...|$|E
40|$|A {{successful}} {{restoration of}} vision should allow the blind to look, {{to see and}} to understand. The engineering of a microelectronic vision prosthesis {{has come a long}} way over the last forty years, but the understanding of how the restored form of vision would be interpreted and functionally applied to everyday living has made little progress until recent times. Prosthetic vision is not what most people think it would be; it is a visual scene composed of relatively large, isolated, spots of light so-called "phosphenes", very much like a magnified <b>pictorial</b> <b>print.</b> This thesis dissertation seeks to obtain a complete survey of the visual description of phosphenes from the human trial reports in the literature, simulate it, obtain a measure of the functional capacity of such visual perception, and explain the measured performance against design aspects of phosphene presentation, human perception, cognition and behaviour. Specifically, "visual acuity" (VA) was assessed on normally sighted subjects (N= 15) administered with "simulated prosthetic vision". VA is a functional measure of vision highly correlated to many daily activities. Aggregating the results from the study with the other VA studies in prosthetic vision, it is shown that in general, the density of the phosphene field determines the affordable VA; however, design aspects relating to the phosphene field lattice (0. 03 10 gMAR with the hexagonal lattice as opposed to a square lattice) and image processing routines (0. 15 10 gMAR at optimised settings) can be further fine-tuned to improve VA performance. Significant performance improvement also arose from learning (0. 13 10 gMAR over ten visitations) and visual scanning adaptation (0. 20 10 gMAR with a circular scanning strategy). Performance improvements are likely related to various preferences and perceptual preferences of the human visual system. A rehabilitation program targeting the appropriate behavioural adaptation coupled with image processing routine optimised for image comprehension should provide a vision prosthesis recipient with the best functional experience to restored vision...|$|E

Bassett {{began his career as}} a printer, moving to Chicago manage the <b>Pictorial</b> <b>Printing</b> Company in 1874. He moved to Hinsdale with his wife in 1887 and began cultivating roses as a hobby. In 1888, he created a hybrid rose known as the American Beauty rose in his greenhouse. He co-founded Bassett & Washburn, which became the first florist to distribute the rose. Commercial horticulture was a relatively new field as Americans had only gained significant disposable income late in the 19th century. One of their largest clients was the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, who purchased the roses for use in their dining cars. The company was the largest employer in Hinsdale in 1900. Bassett retired in 1907, passing the business to his son-in-law, and moved to Pasadena, California in 1910.

One of the roses he planted and cultivated as the American Beauty rose, which he had acquired from Washington. The rose inspired Bassett to form a company to distribute the rose to florists.Bassett's operation was a fast success, and in 1893, he brought in his son-in-law Charles L. Washburn as a business partner. The roses were popular as they were very large and could be bred as cut flowers. Bassett & Washburn opened an office and store in Chicago and cultivated the plants in Hinsdale. Bassett was also an automobile enthusiast and owned {{one of the first}} cars in the Chicago area. By 1900, the greenhouses employed 85 men on a 40 acre site. Bassett & Washburn succeeded in partnering with the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad, who used the roses on their dining cars. The company was also among the first to distribute Lawson and Richmond roses. Bassett retired from Bassett & Washburn in 1907 and turned the company over to Washburn. He stayed in Hinsdale for three more years until moving to Pasadena, California in 1910. Washburn maintained his printing interests with the <b>Pictorial</b> <b>Printing</b> Company until 1916.

The accompanying exegesis examines the place of my work within the contextual framework of related knowledge. The exegesis explores two main contextual notions. Firstly, the position of dolls' clothing play as a hegemonic tool in the process of learning to construct identity through self-presentation. This reflects on the practice of enculturing in girls the ability not just to do, but to observe oneself whilst doing. Secondly, the role of garments and fabric as liminal² markers at the transitional space between interior and exterior, domestic and public, self and not-self. My analysis is centered on the creation of original pieces of clothing. The garments are questioned by the issues explored in this exegesis. The research makes an original contribution to the body of knowledge {{by the nature of the}} creative work, and its analysis involving contemporary theoretical debate on the nature of fashion. ¹ Sublimation printing is a method of chemically bonding ink to a polyester or acrylic surface such as fabric, using extremely high heat and pressure.
