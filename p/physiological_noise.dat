A common class of {{correction}} methods model noise from peripheral measures, such as ECGs or pneumatic belts. However, <b>physiological</b> <b>noise</b> correction has not emerged as a standard preprocessing step for fMRI data yet due to: (1) the varying data quality of physiological recordings, (2) non-standardized peripheral data formats and (3) the lack of full automatization of processing and modeling physiology, required for large-cohort studies. New methods We introduce the PhysIO Toolbox for preprocessing of physiological recordings and model-based noise correction. It implements a variety of noise models, such as RETROICOR, respiratory volume per time and heart rate variability responses (RVT/HRV). The toolbox covers all intermediate steps − from flexible read-in of data formats to GLM regressor/contrast creation − without any manual intervention.

40|$|Abstract Background Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} (NIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging {{technique that}} recently {{has been developed}} to measure the changes of cerebral blood oxygenation associated with brain activities. To date, for functional brain mapping applications, there is no standard on-line method for analysing NIRS data. Methods In this paper, a novel on-line NIRS data analysis framework taking advantages of both the general linear model (GLM) and the Kalman estimator is devised. The Kalman estimator is used to update the GLM coefficients recursively, and one critical coefficient regarding brain activities is then passed to a t -statistical test. The t -statistical test result is used to update a topographic brain activation map. Meanwhile, a set of high-pass filters is plugged into the GLM to prevent very low-frequency noises, and an autoregressive (AR) model is used to prevent the temporal correlation caused by <b>physiological</b> <b>noises</b> in NIRS time series. A set of data recorded in finger tapping experiments is studied using the proposed framework.

Functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is typically based upon the correlations of the low-frequency fluctuation of fMRI signals. Reproducible spatial maps in the brain have also been observed using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in resting-state. However, {{little is known about the}} influence of the ALFF on the functional connectivity measures. In the present study, we analyzed resting-state fMRI data on 79 healthy old individuals. Spatial independent component analysis (ICA) and regions of interest (ROIs) based connectivity analysis were first performed to obtain measures of functional connectivity. ALFF maps were also calculated. First, voxel-matched inter-subject correlations were computed between back-reconstructed IC and ALFF maps. For all the resting-state networks, there was a consistent correlation between ALFF variability and network strengths (within regions that had high IC strengths). Next, inter-subject variance of correlations across 160 functionally defined ROIs were correlated with the corresponding ALFF variance. Several of these ROIs and their connections to other regions were more likely to correlate with its own regional ALFF. These regions were mainly located in the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, insula, basal ganglia, and thalamus. These associations may suggest a functional significance of functional connectivity modulations.
