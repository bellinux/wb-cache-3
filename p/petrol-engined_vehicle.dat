50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{powered by a}} {{rear-mounted}} four-stroke engine, manufactured by Peugeot themselves. The engine's two cylinders were mounted in parallel {{and not in the}} V-format used for the company's first <b>petrol-engined</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The engine was mounted behind the driver and his (or, at least in principle, her) passenger above the rear axle. A maximum output of between 3 and 5 hp was delivered to the rear wheels via a chain-drive mechanism.|$|E
40|$|The Light Duty Inter-Laboratory Correlation Exercise has {{conducted}} testing at 9 test laboratories in the EU, Korea and Japan {{in order to}} demonstrate the practicality, robustness, repeatability and reproducibility of the particle emissions measurement techniques proposed by the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The exercise involved testing 16 light duty vehicles including 6 diesels equipped with wall-flow Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs), 6 conventional diesel vehicles, 3 direct injection petrol engined vehicles and one conventional, multi-point injection <b>petrol-engined</b> <b>vehicle.</b> A DPF equipped Peugeot 407 was tested at all participating laboratories to allow the inter-laboratory reproducibility of measurements to be assessed. The DPF equipped vehicles tested included 2 light goods vehicle derivatives (a Mercedes Vito and a Mazda Bongo). Vehicles were tested over multiple repeats of the EU regulatory Type 1 emissions test. Measurements of solid particle number emissions, particulate mass and regulated gaseous emissions were taken over each test. In addition to particle number measurements made with a Golden System circulated between laboratories, particle number measurements were made with several alternative systems to compare the performance of different measurement systems.

50|$|Belhaven built {{steam and}} <b>petrol-engined</b> <b>vehicles</b> from 1908 at their 'Belhaven Engineering and Motors' works in Wishaw Scotland. The petrol-powered, chain driven lorries (trucks) {{initially}} used Tyler engines, then latterly Aster units.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{frequently}} claimed that Richard Lovell Edgeworth created a caterpillar track. It {{is true that}} in 1770 he patented a [...] "machine, that should carry and lay down its own road", but this was Edgeworth's choice of words. His own account in his autobiography is of a horse-drawn wooden carriage on eight retractable legs, capable of lifting itself over high walls. The description bears no similarity to a caterpillar track. Armoured trains appeared in the mid-19th century, and various armoured steam and <b>petrol-engined</b> <b>vehicles</b> were also proposed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{details the}} vivid {{memories}} of the author’s childhood in the fishing port of Grimsby, shortly after the Second World War. It {{was a time of}} shortages, overcrowding, improvisation and cannibalisation of anything that could be re-used. In time it became a period of reconstruction but not without its upheavals and difficulties. It begins in the ‘old town’ of workers’ small terrace houses, typically in a poor state of repair. Then it moves to the ‘new’ council estates. Similarly, the narrative also begins with a ‘Victorian’ technology of steam, coal and horses with very few <b>petrol-engined</b> <b>vehicles</b> and moves to the very beginnings of early consumer society. The principal analytic content of the paper concerns the status of what is clearly a ‘personal history’ – if that is not too great a contradiction – or as the author suggests: my story. The obvious ‘critical’ response – {{that it could have been}} otherwise – is contrasted against the suggestion that this story is a non-negotiable foundation of the author’s identity and that this ‘critical’ response is not appropriate. Some of the interdisciplinary options thrown up by this problem are considered...|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only <b>petrol-engined</b> <b>vehicles</b> in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The first {{cars were}} licence-built Kriéger {{electric}} <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Petrol-engined</b> models followed in 1908 with 3685 cc engines, but few were made. In 1914 the company merged with Hansa to become Hansa-Lloyd Werke AG. Most {{of the cars}} made by the new company were sold as Hansa with the Hansa-Lloyd name attached to commercial vehicles only. Nevertheless, two cars, the 4-litre Treff AS and the 8-cylinder 4.6-litre Trumpf AS were badged as Hansa-Lloyds. The company was integrated in the Borgward group after the purchase of Hansa by Carl F. W. Borgward in 1929, and car production ceased.|$|R
