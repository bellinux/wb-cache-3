The large numbers of deaths have been {{attributed}} to a variety of factors including wounds suffered during the battle, disease and the trauma of sailing port-to-port from Galle to Batavia. In addition, the Portuguese accused the Dutch of poisoning some prisoners by mixing their rice with chunambo or the lime of the <b>pearl</b> <b>oyster</b> shell. However, historian Paul E.

We found: (i) that <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> cleared plankton {{at a rate that}} was positively related to plankton biovolume, (ii) that nanoflagellates were the main source of carbon for the <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters,</b> and (iii) that the quantity and origin of carbon filtrated by <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> was highly dependent on the concentration and composition of plankton.

500|$|A pearl {{is created}} in the mantle of a mollusk when an {{irritant}} particle is surrounded by layers of nacre. Although most bivalves can create pearls, oysters in the family Pteriidae and freshwater mussels in the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae are {{the main source of}} commercially available pearls because the calcareous concretions produced by most other species have no lustre. Finding pearls inside oysters is a very chancy business as hundreds of shells may need to be pried open before a single pearl can be found. Most pearls are now obtained from cultured shells where an irritant substance has been purposefully introduced to induce the formation of a pearl. A [...] "mabe" [...] (irregular) pearl can be grown by the insertion of an implant, usually made of plastic, under a flap of the mantle and next to the mother-of-pearl interior of the shell. A more difficult procedure is the grafting of a piece of oyster mantle into the gonad of an adult specimen together with the insertion of a shell bead nucleus. This produces a superior, spherical pearl. The animal can be opened to extract the pearl after about two years and reseeded so that it produces another pearl. <b>Pearl</b> <b>oyster</b> farming and pearl culture is an important industry in Japan and many other countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans.|$|E

40|$|This chapter focuses {{the most}} {{important}} factors affecting <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> as individual factors. <b>Pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> in their natural environment experience the simultaneous effects of a wide array of environmental factors. Food, almost inevitably, is a major environmental factor. <b>Pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> filter feed on suspended particulate matter (SPM), consisting mainly of bacteria, microalgae, suspended organic matter, and inorganic particles. Particle size, density, composition, and digestibility affect the nutritional value of the SPM. Optimum densities of microalgae are in the 10 - 100 × 10 cells/mL range. As in all poikilotherms, ambient temperature profoundly influences <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> through its effects on MR and related processes, such as respiration and feeding rates. Small diatoms are the predominate food of Akoya <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> in some Japanese and Korean pearl farming areas. Quantity of food is also {{a major factor in the}} physiological condition, metabolic function, growth, and survival of <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters.</b> Studies of the influence of temperature on metabolic and related physiological processes of bivalves have shown that there is usually an optimum temperature or narrow temperature range for each species at which there is maximum MR, growth rate, and survival. Water currents are very important in bringing food and oxygen to <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> and carrying away their wastes; however, strong currents may be deleterious by increasing suspended inorganic matter, interfering with filtering and preingestive processes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> {{have been}} found to secrete nacre and form pearls with good quality and {{significant}} commercial interest. However, the transcriptomic and genomic resources for <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> are still limited. To improve this situation, transcriptome sequencing was conducted from four species of <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters</b> with Illumina HiSeq (TM) 2000. There were four gigabase-scale transcriptomes for four species of <b>pearl</b> <b>oysters,</b> 26. 3 million reads with 2. 37 gigabase base pairs (Gbp) in Pinctada fucata, 26. 5 million reads with 2. 39 Gbp in Pinctada margaritifera, 27. 0 million reads with 2. 43 Gbp in Pinctada maxima, and 25. 9 million reads with 2. 33 Gbp in Pteria penguin, respectively. After sequence assembly and blastx alignment, the numbers of annotated unigenes a parts per thousand yen 200 bp were 33, 882 in P. fucata, 30, 666 in P. margaritifera, 26, 420 in P. maxima, and 29, 928 in P. penguin.

When I hardly look at the articles, and make no offer for them, they seem incredulous, and, as if fearing they have misunderstood me, again offer them, and declare what they want in return--knives, or tobacco, or sago, or handkerchiefs. I then have to endeavour to explain, through any interpreter who may be at hand, that neither tripang nor <b>pearl</b> <b>oyster</b> shells have any charms for me, and that I even decline to speculate in tortoiseshell, but that anything eatable I will buy--fish, or turtle, or vegetables of any sort. Almost the only food, however, that we can obtain with any regularity, are fish and cockles of very good quality, and to supply our daily wants it is absolutely necessary to be always provided with four articles--tobacco, knives, sago-cakes, and Dutch copper doits--because when the particular thing asked for is not forthcoming, the fish pass on to the next house, and we may go that day without a dinner. It is curious to see the baskets and buckets used here. The cockles are brought in large volute shells, probably the Cymbium ducale, while gigantic helmet-shells, a species of Cassis, suspended by a rattan handle, form the vessels in which fresh water is daily carried past my door.
