50|$|The {{characterization}} of the benefit to risk ratio of drugs is in the focus of her scientific work. In 1999 Schäfer-Korting published the monograph: “The Benefit/Risk-Ratio: A Handbook of the Rational Use of Potentially Hazardous Drugs“, together with Hans Christian Korting. Topical glucocorticoids with increased benefit to risk ratio such as <b>prednicarbate</b> form a paradigm in the context. Currently, she is particularly interested in signal transduction in various tissues looking for innovative active pharmaceutical ingredients especially for skin disease. Here {{the focus is on}} sphingosine-1-phosphate and the corresponding receptor. In terms of developing new drugs the pro-drug concept is of particular relevance. As early as in the stage of developing new active ingredients also the possibilities of creating adequate formulations is considered. With cutaneous drug treatment liposomes and nano-structured lipidic carriers are considered particularly interesting. To reduce the number of animal experiments in the context of toxicologic investigations animal-sparing types of experimentation are developed using skin models.|$|E
40|$|Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), {{thermogravimetry}}/derivative thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) {{and infrared}} spectroscopy (IR) techniques {{were used to}} investigate the compatibility between <b>prednicarbate</b> and several excipients commonly used in semi solid pharmaceutical form. The thermoanalytical studies of 1 : 1 (m/m) drug/excipient physical mixtures showed that {{the beginning of the}} first thermal decomposition stage of the <b>prednicarbate</b> (T (onset) value) was decreased in the presence of stearyl alcohol and glyceryl stearate compared to the drug alone. For the binary mixture of drug/sodium pirrolidone carboxilate the first thermal decomposition stage was not changed, however the DTG peak temperature (T (peak DTG)) decreased. The comparison of the IR spectra of the drug, the physical mixtures and of the thermally treated samples confirmed the thermal decomposition of <b>prednicarbate.</b> By the comparison of the thermal profiles of 1 : 1 prednicarbate:excipients mixtures (methylparaben, propylparaben, carbomer 940, acrylate crosspolymer, lactic acid, light liquid paraffin, isopropyl palmitate, myristyl lactate and cetyl alcohol) no interaction was observed...|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of combined use of creams Prednicarbum and synthetic tannin (phenol-methanal-of urea-polycondensate) in the treatment of exacerbation of atopic dermatitis in children. Material and methods: 50 children, 1 to 12 years, with atopic dermatitis with the exacerbation of the skin process different degrees of severity. Results: In children with mild localized form of atopic dermatitis after the monotherapy whith cream synthetic tannin, noted a marked clinical improvement up to 7 days of treatment. The noted expressive positive dynamics of the skin process and reduction of objective symptoms during the first days after of combination treatment with Prednicarbatet cream and synthetic tannin, also after combination therapy <b>Prednicarbate</b> and moisturizing cream in mode of step therapy. Conclusions: The combined application of <b>Prednicarbate</b> cream and phenol-methanal-of urea-polycondensate increases the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment of atopic dermatitis, which can reduce the duration of use of topical corticosteroids and reduce the risk of adverse reactions in children with moderate and severe course skin process. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{recent years}} inhibitors {{directed}} against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have evolved as effective targeting cancer drugs. Characteristic papulopustular exanthemas, often described as acneiform rashes, are the most frequent adverse effect associated with this class of novel cancer drugs and develop in > 90 % of patients. Notably, the rash may significantly compromise the patients' quality of life, thereby potentially leading to incompliance as well as dose reduction or even termination of the anti-EGFR therapy. Yet, an effective dermatologic management of cutaneous adverse effects can be achieved. Whereas various case reports, case series or expert opinions on the management of EGFR-inhibitor (EGFRI) induced rashes have been published, data on systematic management studies are sparse. Methods Here, we present a retrospective, uncontrolled, comparative study in 49 patients on three established regimens {{for the management of}} EGFRI-associated rashes. Results Strikingly, patients' rash severity improved significantly over three weeks of treatment with topical mometason furoate cream, topical <b>prednicarbate</b> cream plus nadifloxacin cream, as well as topical <b>prednicarbate</b> cream plus nadifloxacin cream plus systemic isotretinoin. Conclusions In summary our results demonstrate that EGFRI-associated rashes can be effectively managed by specific dermatologic interventions. Whereas mild to moderate rashes should be treated with basic measures in combination with topical glucocorticosteroids or combined regiments using glucocorticosteroids and antiseptics/antibiotics, more severe or therapy-resistant rashes are likely to respond with the addition of systemic retinoids. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this work, TG/DTG and DSC {{techniques}} {{were used to}} the determination of thermal behavior of <b>prednicarbate</b> alone and associated with glyceryl stearate excipient (1 : 1 physical mixture). TG/DTG curves obtained for the binary mixture showed a reduction of approximately 37 degrees C to the thermal stability of drug (T(dm/dt- 0) (Max) (DTG)). The disappearance of stretching band at 1280 cm(- 1) (nu(as) C-O, carbonate group) {{and the presence of}} streching band with less intensity at 1750 cm(- 1) (nu(s) C-O, ester group) in IR spectrum obtained to the binary mixture submitted at 220 degrees C, when compared with IR spectrum of drug submitted to the same temperature, confirmed the chemical interaction between these substances due to heating. Kinetics parameters of decomposition reaction of <b>prednicarbate</b> were obtained using isothermal (Arrhenius equation) and non-isothermal (Ozawa) methods. The reduction of approximately 45 % of activation energy value (E(a)) to the first step of thermal decomposition reaction of drug in the 1 : 1 (mass/mass) physical mixture was observed by both kinetics methods.

40|$|Immunosuppressive {{drugs are}} gererally poorly soluble in water, {{which is a}} {{limiting}} factor of bioavailability. This requires {{the development of new}} strategies for enhancing the solubility. Nanoemulsions and other nanoparticles are suitable for incorporating these immunosuppressive agents to apply them for a topical route. Positively and negatively charged nanoemulsions were made by high pressure homogenisation, the physical and chemical stability was investigated and also liberation and penetration were checked. The positive charged was induced by phytosphingosine (PS) and the negative charge by myristic acid. PS as a native constituent of the skin has the advantage of being non-toxic. Only Eutanol G was suitable for solving PS without any precipitation. With this oil positively charged nanoemulsion were made by high pressure homogenisation due varying the process parameters homogenisation temperature (25 and 50 °C), homogenisation pressure (300, 500 and 700 bar) and number of cycles (3, 5, 8 and 10 cycles) homogenization time (1 - 10 min) respectively. The determination of the drug content in the nanoemulsions revealed a clear relation between the process parameters and the drug content. The next step was optimizing the composition by varying the constituents of the nanoemulsion phytosphingosine (0, 3 – 0, 7 %), Eutanol G (10 – 20 %), lipoids (soybean- and eggyolk phospholipids), lipoid E 80 (0, 5 – 3 %) and Tween 80 (0, 5 – 3 %). Homogenizing negatively charged nanoemulsions was the next step, followed determining the drug release and also the penetration into excised human skin. Applying the negatively charged nanoemulsion 14 % were released after 24 h, while this amount was 9. 5 % after applying the positively charged nanoemulsion. The amount of <b>prednicarbate</b> and his metabolites penetrating into the skin after applicating negatively charged nanoemulsions was 1 % and 1. 4 % for the positively charged formulation. The therapy of inflamed skin diseases occurs generally with topical corticosteroids. Because of side effects, especially skin thinning, alternative drugs are desired. Besides the corticosteroids there are other immunosuppressive drugs, e. g. calcineurin inhibitors. In this work besides <b>prednicarbate</b> everolimus and sirolimus were homogenized to positively charged nanoemulsions by varying the parameters temperature, pressure, and number of cycles and homogenisation time, respectively. With only a few exceptions all formulations were stable for at least 14 days, even after storage at 40 °C. Unfortunately the drug was degraded after high pressure homogenizing...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pimecrolimus cream 1 % is a non-steroid, {{selective}} {{inflammatory cytokine}} inhibitor indicated for atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective: To compare {{the safety and}} efficacy of pimecrolimus cream 1 %-based treatment versus conventional therapy in adults with moderate AD. Methods: Patients were randomized to receive pimecrolimus cream 1 % (n = 62) or vehicle (n = 68) at the first signs/symptoms of AD, for 24 weeks as required. A moderately potent topical corticosteroid (<b>prednicarbate</b> 0. 25 % cream) was allowed in both groups to treat flares. Results: Corticosteroids were required on fewer days in the pimecrolimus group, compared with the vehicle group (9. 7 vs. 37. 8 %, p < 0. 001). Furthermore, 59. 7 % of pimecrolimus-treated patients experienced no flares during the study period, compared with 22. 1 % of vehicle-treated patients (p < 0. 001). Pimecrolimus cream 1 % was well tolerated throughout the study. Conclusion: For adults with moderate AD, pimecrolimus cream 1 % is well tolerated, reduces the incidence of flares, reduces/eliminates corticosteroid use, improves long-term disease control and enhances the patients’ quality of life.

40|$|In {{the field}} of topical {{application}} without or with little systemic side-effects to reach anti-inflammatory or anti-androgeneous effects, nanoparticles as carriers for drugs as beta-methason- 17 -valerate, <b>prednicarbate,</b> prednisolone, RU 58841 -myristate or cyproterone ac-etate have proven to enhance the transdermal delivery. This enhancement is closely con-nected to {{the interaction of the}} drug molecules with the lipid carrier systems, i. e. incorpo-ration into the carriers or attachment to their surfaces. Whereas the techniques to measure the penetration profiles in the cutaneous region of the skin are well established in the case of fluorescence microscopy applied to thin slices of epidermis or being established in the case of multiphoton microscopy to monitor this fluorescence, the methods for the investi-gation of the type of interaction between drugs and carrier systems are relatively new: In the case of electron spin resonance the sample volumes have to be restricted to capillary sizes to avoid parelectric losses in the microwave cavities, {{in the case of the}} novel method of parelectric spectroscopy we are free from such restrictions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Budesonide, {{a marker}} for {{corticosteroid}} allergy, is a 1 : 1 mixture of 2 diastereomers, the R and S, {{present in all}} commercial formulations. Budesonide is said to cross-react with group B substances through the R and S diastereomer and some group D substances only through the S diastereomer. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cross-reactivity pattern between the R and S diastereomers and 4 potentially cross-reacting substances, 2 from group B and 2 from group D. METHODS: By patch testing 10 patients hypersensitive to budesonide with a serial dilution of budesonide, the R and S diastereomer, triamcinolone acetonide, amcinonide, <b>prednicarbate,</b> and hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate. RESULTS: Nine of 10 patients reacted to budesonide and the S diastereomer. Seven of 9 to the R diastereomer. Each of the 9 patients with S diastereomer allergy reacted to the group B and/or group D substances. Five patients reacted to triamcinolone acetonide, not to 1. 0 % but only to 0. 0010 % and 0. 00010 %. CONCLUSION: The R and S diastereomers can induce positive patch test reactions in budesonide-hypersensitive individuals. The potential of budesonide to cross-react with substances from group B and D might {{be explained by the}} presence of the 2 diastereomers. When patch testing with triamcinolone acetonide, much lower concentrations than recommended should be used. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In the {{treatment}} of mild to medium severe atopic dermatitis a new formulation proved to be highly efficient. The formulation {{is based on a}} combination of microsilver and nanolipid carriers (NLC) incorporated into an o/w cream and a lotion. A theory of action was proposed, the formation of silver-NLC complex (sNLC). In this study this theory was proven, and based on this new mechanism two new approaches for dealing with AD are suggested to distinctly improve AD treatment, i. e. increasing efficiency, reducing drug exposure and reducing side effects. The antimicrobial silver ions adsorb onto the surface of the negatively charged NLC (=sNLC complex). The sNLC as nanoparticles are highly adhesive to skin and bacterial surfaces, leading to a locally high concentration of silver ions killing the bacteria, much more effective than silver alone. The NLC restore the distorted skin barrier. Based on this a new two-step approach is suggested: (1) "treatment-supportive consumer care" by restoring the normal skin condition (NLC for barrier restoration plus synergistic antibacterial silver-NLC complex) and (2) "drug-loaded consumer care AD formulations". i. e. incorporating drugs into the NLC of this consumer care formulation. NLC incorporation makes the drugs more effective (penetration enhancement) and simultaneously exploits the skin normalization ability of the skin care sNLC formulation, future drug candidates being <b>prednicarbate</b> and tacrolimus...|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory skin disease resulting from excessive stimulation of immune cells. Traditionally, {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) have been implicated in the progression of inflammatory diseases, but several opposing observations suggest the protective role of ROS in inflammatory disease. Recently, we demonstrated ROS prevented imiquimod-induced psoriatic dermatitis through enhancing regulatory T cell function. Thus, we hypothesized AD might also be attenuated in elevated levels of ROS through tissue hyperoxygenation, such as by hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) or applying an oxygen-carrying chemical, perfluorodecalin (PFD). Elevated levels of ROS in the skin have been demonstrated directly by staining with dihydroethidum as well as indirectly by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO). A murine model of AD was developed by repeated application of a chemical irritant (1 % 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene) and house dust mite (Dermatophagoide farinae) extract on one ear of BALB/c mice. The results showed treatment with HBOT or PFD significantly attenuated AD, comparably with 0. 1 % <b>prednicarbate</b> without any signs of side effects, such as telangiectasia. The expressions of interleukin- 17 A and interferon-γ were also decreased in the AD lesions by treatment with HBOT or PFD. Enhanced expression of IDO and reduced level of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α, in association with increased frequency of FoxP 3 + regulatory T cells in the AD lesions, might {{be involved in the}} underlying mechanism of oxygen therapy. Taken together, it was suggested that tissue hyperoxygenation, by HBOT or treatment with PFD, might attenuate AD through enhancing skin ROS level...|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{and chronic}} hand eczema (CHE) are common chronic diseases and their therapy {{might be a}} challenge. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the only drug that has been approved for systemic treatment of severe atopic dermatitis {{as well as for}} atopic hand eczema. Since the end of 2008 alitretinoin (9 -cis retinoic acid, 9 -cis RA) is licensed for any type of moderate and severe chronic hand eczema which is no longer responsive to topical treatment. Within the present dissertation the immunological changes of peripheral lymphocytes were examined during the therapy with CsA and 9 -cis RA in patients with AD or with CHE. First, the prescription profile of physicians in private dermatology practices regarding topical treatment of CHE were analysed for the period 2007 – 2010. The data show that topical corticosteroids are most often prescribed according to the Guideline for Management of hand eczema. The most frequently prescribed substances were betamethasone followed by mometasone furoate, <b>prednicarbate,</b> clobetasol and methylprednisolone aceponat. The data of immunological changes during a systemic therapy show that low-dose but not high-dose therapy with CsA leads to a partial inhibition of the production of proinflammatory interleukin- 2, which might be the reason for the induction and expansion of regulatory T cells in AD patients under CsA treatment. Systemic therapy with alitretinoin decreases the T cell-depended IL- 17 production as well as the frequency of the plasmablasts and the immunoglobulins E, A and M in the serum of patients with CHE. A significant decrease of regulatory T cells in peripheral blood and an increase of these cells was measured in lesional skin of patients after successful treatment. These experimental studies have shown that low-dose cyclosporine A as well as a systemic alitretinoin therapy led to measurable immunological effects in treated patients, which might lead to clinical remission also after discontinuation of treatment in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pimecrolimus cream (Elidel®, SDZ ASM 981), a non-steroid {{inhibitor}} of inflammatory cytokines, {{is effective}} {{in the treatment of}} atopic dermatitis (AD). We assessed whether early treatment of AD signs/symptoms reduces the need for topical corticosteroids. Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus cream 1 % in the long-term management of adult AD. Methods: 192 adults with moderate to severe AD were randomised (1 : 1) for twice daily (b. i. d.) treatment of early signs or symptoms of AD with either pimecrolimus cream 1 % or vehicle cream (control group) to prevent progression to flares. Treatment was given as needed for 24 weeks. In the event of flares, a moderately potent corticosteroid (<b>prednicarbate</b> 0. 25 % cream) was permitted as rescue medication in both groups. The percentage of days on which a topical corticosteroid was used to treat disease flares was the main outcome measure. Results: Corticosteroid medication was used on 14. 2 % (95 % confidence interval, CI: 8. 3 – 21. 1) of the days of the 24 -week treatment period in the pimecrolimus group and on 37. 2 % (95 % CI: 30. 4 – 44. 0) of the days in the control group (p < 0. 001). In total, 44. 8 % (43 / 96) of patients in the pimecrolimus group did not experience a flare compared with 18. 8 % (18 / 96) of patients in the control group. The median time to first flare was 144 days in the pimecrolimus group and 26 days in the control group (p < 0. 001). Pimecrolimus treatment was also associated with improvement in signs and symptoms of AD, pruritus, patients’ self-assessment and quality of life. Conclusions: Pimecrolimus cream 1 % b. i. d. is an effective, well-tolerated, long-term treatment for AD in adults, substantially reducing the number of flares compared to a conventional therapy and consequently reducing or eliminating the need for corticosteroid treatment.
