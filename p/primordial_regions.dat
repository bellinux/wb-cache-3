Both leaf surfaces undergo a series of similar changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics, but the upper surface more quickly achieved the characteristic response. Imaging of fluorescence showed an individual developing leaf has four regions differing in kinetics, but these regions do not coincide with areas of increasing relative growth rate. Two of these regions lie at the leaf edge and their divergent kinetics may be related to structural and physiological features present at this position. A third area with different kinetics, in the basal region of the leaf, is spatially consistent with <b>primordial</b> <b>regions</b> that are clonal during development.

40|$|AbstractThe bone {{morphogenetic}} protein (BMP) family ligand decapentaplegic (Dpp) plays critical {{roles in}} wing vein development during pupal stages in Drosophila. However, how the diffusible Dpp specifies elaborate wing vein patterns remains unknown. Here, we visualized Dpp distribution in the pupal wing {{and found that it}} tightly reflects the wing vein patterns. We show that Dpp is directionally transported from the longitudinal veins (LVs) into the posterior crossvein (PCV) <b>primordial</b> <b>region</b> by the extracellular BMP-binding proteins, short gastrulation (Sog) and crossveinless (Cv). Another BMP-type ligand, glass bottom boat (Gbb), also moves into the PCV region and is required for Dpp distribution, presumably as a Dpp–Gbb heterodimer. In contrast, we found that most of the Dpp is actively retained in the LVs by the BMP type I receptor thickveins (Tkv) and a positive feedback mechanism. We provide evidence that the directionality of Dpp transport is manifested by sog transcription that prepatterns the PCV position in a Dpp signal-independent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that spatial distribution of Dpp is tightly regulated at the extracellular level by combination of long-range facilitated transport toward the PCV and short-range signaling by active retention in the LVs, thereby allowing diffusible ligands to form elaborate wing vein patterns...|$|R

I completed two strontium injection trials and a survey of juvenile steelhead from various steelhead hatcheries. The two trials measured Sr:Ca ratios in otoliths in response to injections and the survey measured the natural variation in Sr:Ca ratios in otoliths of juvenile hatchery steelhead in response to the natural variation. In 2003, adult female Wallowa River, Oregon O. mykiss, were captured at the hatchery and evenly divided between a control group and two treatment groups. These females received an intraperitoneal injection of 1 cc/ 500 g of body weight of a physiologically isotonic solution (0. 9 % saline) containing concentrations of 0 (control), 1000, or 5000 parts per million (ppm) of strontium chloride hexahydrate (SrCl{sub 2 }* 6 H{sub 2 }O). Females were housed in a single outdoor tank until spawned artificially, and a distinct external tag identified each female within each treatment group. In 2004, female steelhead were captured throughout the duration of the adult returns to the Umatilla River basin and injected with 0, 1000, 5000, or 20, 000 -ppm strontium. In both trials, progeny of fish treated with strontium had significantly higher Sr:Ca ratios in the <b>primordial</b> <b>region</b> of their otoliths as measured using an electron wavelength dispersive microprobe. There was no difference in fertilization rates of eggs and survival rates of fry among treatment groups. Progeny from treated mothers were on average larger than progeny of untreated mothers. The Sr:Ca ratios in otoliths collected from various populations of steelhead were greater than the control values measured in both injections studies. This study suggests that the marking technique works and the utility for such a technique could be used for empirical observations in determining the relative fitness of progeny of adult hatchery origin fish that spawn naturally. The variation in Sr:Ca ratios found among steelhead hatcheries suggests that care must be taken if the technique is employed where fish from more than one hatchery could potentially be involved...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{reported}} on N-body simulations of the large-scale {{structure of the}} Universe starting from non-Gaussian initial conditions in a Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Three multiplicative models are considered where the peculiar gravitational potential is obtained by performing a nonlinear transformation on a Gaussian random field: while keeping the standard form for the initial power spectrum, this procedure provides highly nonrandom phases. The resulting distributions in space and velocity are analyzed by different statistical tests and compared with {{the evolution of a}} standard Gaussian model with the same initial amplitude. It is found that both the clustering dynamics and the present texture are mostly sensitive to the sign of the initial skewness of mass fluctuations. In particular, models characterized by a substantial predominance of <b>primordial</b> underdense <b>regions</b> (negative skewness) evolve toward a cellular structure with large correlation length and enhanced peculiar motions. The results suggest that the Cold Dark Matter scenario can succeed in reproducing structures, on large scales if the random-phase hypothesis is abandoned...|$|R

40|$|The D/H {{enrichment}} {{observed in}} Saturn’s satellite Enceladus is {{remarkably similar to}} the values observed in the nearly-isotropic comets. Given the predicted strong variation of D/H with heliocentric distance in the solar nebula, this observation links the <b>primordial</b> source <b>region</b> of the nearly-isotropic comets with the formation location of Enceladus. That is, comets from the nearly-isotropic class were most likely fed into their current reservoir, the Oort cloud, from a source region near the formation location of Enceladus. Dynamical simulations {{of the formation of}} the Oort cloud indicate that Uranus and Neptune are, primarily, responsible for the delivery of material into the Oort cloud. In addition, Enceladus formed from material that condensed from the solar nebula near the location at which Saturn captured its gas envelope, most likely at or near Saturn’s current location in the solar system. The coupling of these lines of evidence appears to require that Uranus and Neptune were, during the epoch of the formation of the Oort cloud, much closer to the current location of Saturn than they are currently. Such a configuration is consistent with the Nice model of the evolution of the outer solar system. Further measurements of the D/H enrichment in comets, particularly in ecliptic comets, will provide an excellent discriminator among various models of the formation of the outer solar system...|$|R

40|$|The {{time-scale}} {{over which}} and modality by which young stellar objects (YSOs) disperse their circumstellar discs dramatically influences the eventual formation {{and evolution of}} planetary systems. By means of extensive radiative transfer (RT) modelling, we have developed {{a new set of}} diagnostic diagrams in the infrared colour-colour plane (K-[24] vs. K-[8]), to aid with the classiffication of the evolutionary stage of YSOs from photometric observations. Our diagrams allow the differentiation of sources with un-evolved (primordial) discs from those evolving according to different clearing scenarios (e. g. homologous depletion vs. inside-out dispersal), as well as from sources that have already lost their disc. Classification of over 1500 sources in 15 nearby star-forming regions reveals that approximately 39 % of the sources lie in the <b>primordial</b> disc <b>region,</b> whereas between 31 % and 32 % disperse from the inside-out and up to 22 % of the sources have already lost their disc. Less than 2 % of the objects in our sample lie in the homogeneous draining regime. Time-scales for the transition phase are estimated to be typically a few 10 ^ 5 years independent of stellar mass. Therefore, regardless of spectral type, we conclude that currently available infrared photometric surveys point to fast (of order 10 % of the global disc lifetime) inside-out clearing as the preferred mode of disc dispersal.

40|$|The {{sequencing}} {{of the chicken}} MHC led to the identification of two open reading frames, designated B-NK and B-lec, that were predicted to encode C-type lectin domains. C-type lectin domains are not encoded in the MHC of any animal described to date; therefore, this observation was completely unexpected, particularly given that the chicken has a "minimal essential MHC. " In this study, we describe the initial characterization of the B-NK and B-lec genes, and show that they share greatest homology with C-type lectin-like receptors encoded in the human NK complex (NKC), in particular NKR-P 1 and lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT 1), respectively. In common with NKR-P 1 and LLT 1, B-NK and B-lec are located {{next to each other}} and transcribed in opposite orientation. Like human NKR-P 1, B-NK has a functional inhibitory signaling motif in the cytoplasmic tail and is expressed in NK cells. In contrast, B-lec contains an endocytosis motif in the cytoplasmic tail, and like LLT 1, is an early activation Ag. Further analysis leads us to propose that there are four subgroups of C-type lectin-like receptors in the NKC, which arose as a result of duplication events. Moreover, this analysis suggests that the NKC may be considered a fifth paralogous region, and therefore shares an ancient common origin with the MHC. This provides evidence that C-type lectin-like receptors were present in the preduplication, <b>primordial</b> MHC <b>region,</b> and suggests that an original function of MHC molecules was for recognition by NK cell receptors encoded nearby...|$|R
40|$|The {{direct repeat}} region in Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} complex strains {{is composed of}} multiple direct variant repeats (DVRs), {{each of which is}} composed of a 36 -bp direct repeat (DR) plus a nonrepetitive spacer sequence of similar size. It has been shown previously that clinical isolates show extensive polymorphism in the DR region by the variable presence of DVRs, and this polymorphism has been used in the epidemiology of tuberculosis. In an attempt to better understand the evolutionary scenario leading to polymorphic DR loci and to improve strain differentiation by spoligotyping, we characterized and compared the DNA sequences of the complete DR region and its flanking DNA of M. tuberculosis complex strains. We identified 94 different spacer sequences among 26 M. tuberculosis complex strains. No sequence homology was found between any of these spacers and M. tuberculosis DNA outside of the DR region or with any other known bacterial sequence. Although strains differed extensively in {{the presence or absence of}} DVRs, the order of the spacers in the DR locus was found to be well conserved. The data strongly suggest that the polymorphism in clinical isolates is the result of successive deletions of single discrete DVRs or of multiple contiguous DVRs from a <b>primordial</b> DR <b>region</b> containing many more DVRs than seen in present day isolates and that virtually no scrambling of DVRs took place during evolution. Because the majority of the novel spacer sequences identified in this study were confined to isolates of the rare Mycobacterium canettii taxon, the use of the novel spacers in spoligotyping led only to a slight improvement of strain differentiation by spoligotyping...|$|R

40|$|The {{difference}} in density {{profiles of the}} contributions from different density peaks to dark matter halos results in certain expectations about the Milky Way's stellar halo. We cut our simulated halo stars into two populations: those forming before/during the last major merger, and those accreted after the last major merger. The former population are more centrally located at z= 0, while stars forming in low mass late forming proto-galaxies are spread through the halo. A {{difference in}} observed binding energy distinguishes these two populations. We look at possible chemical abundance signatures of the two populations. We also show that galaxies forming in isolated low sigma peaks will form from primordial material. Thus, even though the oldest stars are centrally concentrated as they originated in the early collapsing, densest <b>regions,</b> <b>primordial</b> stars would be found distributed throughout the halo.

Experimental techniques were developed to grow crystals virtually free of melt and fluid inclusions since both {{have been found to}} cause profound problems in previous work. This is a particularly important issue for the analysis of noble gases in crystals that have very low {{partition coefficients}} relative to coexisting melt and fluid phases. The preferred partitioning values obtained for the ol-melt system for He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe are 0. 00017 (13), 0. 00007 (7), 0. 0011 (6), 0. 00026 (16), and 0. 0006 ((- 6)) ((+ 9)), respectively. The respective cpx-melt partition coefficients are 0. 0002 (2), 0. 00041 (35), 0. 0011 (7), 0. 0002 (2), and 0. 0002 The data confirm the incompatible behaviour of noble gases for both olivine and clinopyroxene but unlike other trace elements these values show little variation {{for a wide range of}} atomic radius. The lack of dependence of partitioning on atomic radius is, however, consistent with the partitioning behaviour of other trace elements which have been found to exhibit progressively lower dependence of D-min/melt(i) on radius as the charge decreases. As all noble gases appear to exhibit similar D-min/melt(i) values we deduce that noble gases are not significantly fractionated from each other by olivine and clinopyroxene during melting and fractional crystallisation. Although incompatible, the partitioning values for noble gases also suggest that significant amounts of primordial noble gases may well have been retained in the mantle despite intensive melting processes. The implication of our data is that high primordial/radiogenic noble gas ratios (He- 3 /He- 4, Ne- 22 /Ne- 21, and Ar- 36 /Ar- 40) characteristic of plume basalt sources can be achieved by recycling a previously melted (depleted) mantle source rather than reflecting an isolated, non-degassed <b>primordial</b> mantle <b>region...</b>|$|R

In this picture, protogalaxies were assembled a few stars {{at a time and}} were only gradually contaminated by the first heavy elements because primordial supernovae preferentially expelled them into low density voids, away from the sites of mergers. However, the large computational boxes required to form the halos from cosmological initial conditions in these models prevent them from resolving the true fate of the supernova remnants. We present one-dimensional calculations of Population III supernovae in both neutral halos and <b>primordial</b> H II <b>regions</b> that resolve the flows over all relevant spatial scales. Our models indicate that the cycle of stellar birth, H II region formation, and second star formation within a halo may have been punctuated by prompt star formation in the supernova remnant.

The chemical signatures and luminosity functions of such galaxies would be very different from those in the current paradigm, and observations by JWST and ALMA may soon discriminate between these two formation pathways.

Previously, family studies in two shark species showed that classical class I (UAA) and class II genes are genetically linked. In this study, we show that proteasome genes LMP 2 and LMP 7, shark-specific LMP 7 -like, and the TAP 1 / 2 genes are linked to class I/II. Functional LMP 7 and LMP 7 -like genes, as well as multiple LMP 2 genes or gene fragments, are found only in some sharks, suggesting that different sets of peptides might be generated depending upon inherited MHC haplotypes. Cosmid clones bearing the MHC-linked classical class I genes were isolated and shown to contain proteasome gene fragments. A non-MHC-linked LMP 7 gene also was identified on another cosmid, but only two exons of this gene were detected, closely linked to a class I pseudogene (UAA-NC 2); this region probably resulted from a recent duplication and trans-location from the functional MHC. Tight linkage of proteasome and class I genes, in comparison with gene organizations of other vertebrates, suggests a primordial MHC organization. Another nonclassical class I gene (UAA-NC 1) was detected that is linked neither to MHC nor to UAA-NC 2; its high level of sequence similarity to UAA suggests that UAA-NC 1 also was recently derived from UAA and translocated from MHC.
