50|$|Martinez {{was held}} by INS until after the {{decision}} in 2005. Benitez was <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> to family sponsors, two days after his case was heard by the Supreme Court, October 15, 2004.|$|R
50|$|During Gardner's time in Alcatraz, {{his wife}} {{divorced}} him. He worked and supervised at the mat shop with Ralph Roe and they planned an escape, but Gardner was <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> in 1938 after his {{appeal for clemency}} was approved.|$|R
50|$|He became infamous in Rarotonga when he in 1992 {{set fire}} to the {{building}} block encompassing Ministry of Justice, Cook Islands Post Office and Telecom which were all badly damaged. Angene was sentenced to 13 years jail for arson but <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Ishikawa was <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> {{from prison}} in 1994. Along with his supporters, he is still seeking a fair retrial {{and the chance to}} clear his name. [...] "I want the label of murderer, which is bearing so heavily on me, removed", Ishikawa said in 2002.|$|R
50|$|All 11 {{members of}} the gang were later arrested, and all were <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> by 1971, except for one member, who died in prison. Despite ongoing efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local authorities, only $58,000 of the initial $2.7 million stolen was ever recovered.|$|R
500|$|Despite his conviction, Logan's {{attorneys}} {{tried to}} appeal to the courts, with the one-hundred year prison sentence being unanimously upheld by a three-judge judicial panel on June 15, 2004. However, in their decision, the panel granted him the possibility of <b>paroled</b> <b>release</b> after fifty years. However, more than a year later, on September 7, 2005, the conviction was overturned by the Maryland Court of Appeals and Logan was awarded a second trial. The judiciary determined that the investigators had acted with impropriety in the process of obtaining of Logan's confession to the murders by violating Logan's Miranda rights, and by deliberately misleading him in order to obtain a confession. The court also determined that the judiciary's selection process of jurors for the trial had not been rigorous enough and had thus been conducted improperly.|$|R
25|$|After being {{captured}} by US forces he was {{handed over to}} the Yugoslav authorities {{at the end of the}} war, and although sentenced to 20 years imprisonment following a trial in October 1947, he was soon <b>paroled,</b> then <b>released</b> in March 1953. Neuhausen died on 14 April 1966 in Munich, West Germany.|$|R
50|$|After {{being in}} prison for over twenty years, Luther is <b>paroled</b> and <b>released.</b> He begins roaming around his hometown, killing people by eating off their heads. Luther invades a farm, where he holds {{a mother and her}} {{daughter}} captive. Eventually, he is shot dead by the mother while inside the farm's chicken coop.|$|R
2500|$|However, since Peter Milano's <b>paroled</b> <b>release</b> in 1991, he {{took back}} {{control of the}} {{weakened}} family. The Los Angeles family since made moves into Las Vegas with the Buffalo crime family. The family made headlines again {{with the murder of}} Chicago Outfit associate Herbert [...] "Fat Herbie" [...] Blitzstein by Buffalo and Los Angeles family associates in 1997. Blizstein had a lucrative loan shark and auto insurance fraud business the two families moved in to take over. This caused a great deal of scrutiny from the FBI on both families. Members like Stephen Cino and Alfred Mauriello were convicted on related charges along with other associates who cooperated with officials to receive a reduced sentence, putting the L.A. crime family on its last leg. By the 1990s the L.A. family was estimated to have 20 official members.|$|R
50|$|However, as {{with other}} <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> sexual offenders, {{there are a number}} of {{conditional}} aspects to Capill's release. He will be required to report to a parole officer when dealing with accommodation and employment concerns and will experience restricted mobility and autonomy in those contexts. He is forbidden from communicating with his former victims and associating with anyone under sixteen unless there are approved adult caregivers in the vicinity.|$|R
50|$|While {{some believe}} {{he should be}} <b>paroled,</b> his <b>release</b> is widely opposed. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg {{recently}} publicized his opposition to parole Muntaqim. He states: “Anthony Bottom's crime is unforgivable, and its consequences will remain forever with {{the families of the}} police officers, as well as {{the men and women of}} the New York City Police Department.” Councilman Charles Barron, a self-described black revolutionary, is one of Muntaqim’s active advocates.|$|R
50|$|In January 1992, Koskotas {{was convicted}} of forgery and sentenced {{to five years in}} prison. In November 1994 he was found guilty of {{embezzlement}} and forgery and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> from prison on March 16, 2001 after serving 12 years of his 25-year sentence. Koskotas is barred from leaving the country and was ordered to report to an Athens police precinct twice a month.|$|R
50|$|Following {{his victory}} at Canada Alamosa, Captain Bethel Coopwood <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> all the {{captured}} men without arms, only retaining as prisoners Captain John H. Minks, the wounded Second Lieutenant Matias Medina, and John Morrin, a wounded teamster, as prisoners on his march {{back to his}} base at Camp Robledo. From Alamosa Coopwood marched his force along the river road with the captured property taken to the place known as E Company Grove, and encamped for the night.|$|R
50|$|Considered to {{be a model}} prisoner, Fugate was paroled in 1976 {{after serving}} 17 years. She lived for a time in the Lansing, Michigan area after being <b>paroled.</b> Following her <b>release,</b> Fugate worked as a {{janitorial}} assistant and a medical technician, and has since retired.|$|R
25|$|The British held Scott as a {{prisoner}} of war. They considered Irish-American prisoners of war British subjects and traitors, and executed 13 who were captured at Queenston Heights. The British <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> Scott in {{a prisoner}} exchange. Upon release, Scott returned to Washington to pressure the Senate to take punitive action against British prisoners of war {{in retaliation for the}} British executions. The Senate wrote a bill after this urging, but President James Madison believed the summary execution of prisoners of war unworthy of civilized nations, and so refused to enforce the act.|$|R
50|$|On March 19, Urrea {{had quickly}} {{advanced}} and surrounded 300 {{men of the}} Texian Army on the open prairie, near La Bahia (Goliad). The two-day Battle of Coleto ensued, with the Texians holding their own on the first day. However, the Mexicans received overwhelming reinforcements and heavy artillery. In this critical predicament, Fannin {{and the majority of}} the men voted to surrender the Texian forces on March 20. Led to believe that they would be <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> into the United States, they were returned to the fort at Goliad, now their prison.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, parole {{officers}} supervise offenders that have served a prison term, but who have subsequently been <b>paroled,</b> or <b>released</b> from prison under supervision; this {{decision is made}} after the review and consideration of an inmate's case by a warden, parole board or other parole authority. Parolees are essentially serving the remainder of their prison sentence in the community. However, some jurisdictions are modifying or abolishing the practice of parole and giving post-release supervision obligations to a community corrections agent, often generically if imprecisely {{referred to as a}} probation officer.|$|R
5000|$|Judd hired famed San Francisco defense {{attorney}} Melvin Belli. Belli needed an Arizona-licensed attorney to help him, so he hired Larry Debus. Arizona Governor Jack Williams agreed to sign for Judd's release {{as long as}} the meeting was kept [...] "hush, hush". However, in the following days, Belli called a press conference calling for the immediate release of Judd, forcing Debus to fire Belli to prevent him from {{getting in the way of}} Judd's <b>release.</b> Judd was <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> on December 22, 1971 after two years of legal wrangling.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the group}} of traffickers {{involved}} who were subsequently pursued, three were killed by police, and others were sentenced to prison. After their incarceration, anger was expressed through Rio's media when two of the traffickers were <b>paroled</b> on work <b>release</b> at which point they fled. Both have since been recaptured.|$|R
50|$|In 1864 two Confederate prisoners, Wash (Washington) Barker and Pomp Dennis, were <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> at Liberty, Missouri to {{the owner}} of a {{steamboat}} bound up the Missouri for the Montana goldfields. Steamboats had to make frequent refueling stops for wood to heat the boilers, but from Yankton, Dakota Territory to Fort Benton, Montana Territory (a distance of well over a thousand river miles), hostile Indians controlled most of the country. The Indians had burned the few existing wood yards and steamboats had to stop and cut wood as they went. Rebel soldiers like Barker and Dennis could work their way to the Montana Territory, by chopping fuel along the way.|$|R

5000|$|As if {{the ordeal}} of the Bataan Death March and the horrific {{conditions}} at Camp O'Donnell were not enough, many surviving American POWs were sent off on [...] "hell ships" [...] to do forced hard labor in Japan, Manchuria, Korea and Taiwan, among others, {{until the end of}} the war. Those that were too weak, were incarcerated in various POW camps across the Philippines. Filipino POWs that survived O'Donnell were more fortunate, as they were eventually <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> by the Japanese. All were made to sign waivers that they would not join any resistance movements. Nonetheless, many did continue to fight the Japanese and joined the underground and various guerrilla organizations.|$|R
50|$|In 1974 while {{stationed}} in Germany he killed a 13-year-old boy, James McClister, {{the child of}} American expatriates, and was court-martialed and convicted of manslaughter and larceny (he claimed that the boy's death {{was the result of}} an accident on a moped which he had stolen.) He was sentenced to four years of prison at Fort Leavenworth. Maust requested not to be <b>paroled,</b> but was <b>released</b> in 1977 despite his wishes.|$|R
50|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath the Minutemen headquarters in the Berthold Mansion was searched and shuttered by Federal forces. The Minutemen who had been captured at Camp Jackson (about 50% of the militiamen had escaped the Federal forces) were briefly detained at the St. Louis Arsenal. All members gave their oath not {{to take up arms}} against the Federal Government until <b>paroled,</b> and were <b>released</b> on May 11, 1861.|$|R
50|$|Transferred {{as part of}} Jubal Early's {{command to}} the Army of the Valley, the battery participated in Early's raid on Washington, {{fighting}} in numerous engagements, including Monocacy and Cedar Creek. Captain Massie was mortally wounded in September 1864, and Capt. Charles G. Snead led the remaining artillerymen for {{the balance of the}} war. The unit became defunct, {{along with the rest of}} the Army of the Valley, after their capture at the close of the Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia on March 2, 1865. After capture, they were marched to Stephensons Depot. They were then loaded onto box cars and shipped north to Baltimore, Maryland. Their final destination was Fort Delaware Prison. Members were <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> between June 21 and 22, 1865.|$|R
40|$|Mental health challenges, {{substance}} use disorders, and HIV/AIDS disproportionately affect Black people in correctional settings. Culturally responsive practice and equitable policy is predicated upon research that explores the burden, prevalence, and mortality of these public health concerns {{on the health}} and social well-being of African Americans in the correctional setting. This paper has three sections: (1) mental health; (2) substance abuse; and (3) HIV/AIDS. Each section summarizes current treatment issues unique to correctional settings, and provides recommendations for enhancing programs and policy {{to meet the needs}} of Black people who have been arrested, detained, incarcerated, <b>paroled,</b> or <b>released.</b> Further, we make recommendations for how interdisciplinary researchers and health care/treatment providers can engage in science-guided advocacy to address these issues and reduce related disparities experienced by people of African ancestry...|$|R
50|$|When he {{eventually}} {{came out of}} the mountains in the spring, he said the miners had abandoned him and he had nearly starved. However, because he looked surprisingly healthy and first asked for whiskey rather than food, suspicions began to arise. Five bodies that showed signs of cannibalism were found southeast of Lake City at the foot of Slumgullion Pass, and Packer was arrested and held in the Saguache jail, but escaped. He fled to Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he remained until 1883 when he was again arrested and brought to Lake City for trial. He was convicted of killing one of the five men and sentenced to be hanged. The Colorado Supreme Court reversed the conviction in 1885, but the following year Packer was retried, convicted again, and sentenced to 40 years. He was <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> in 1901.|$|R
5000|$|Due to Williams's excesses, Fred Rose {{stopped working}} with him. Also, the Drifting Cowboys {{were at the}} time backing Ray Price, while Williams was backed by local bands.

5000|$|Although {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor in 1941 led Pelley to disband the Silver Legion, he {{continued}} to attack the government in his magazine, Roll Call, which alarmed Roosevelt, Attorney General Francis Biddle, and the House Un-American Activities Committee. After stating in one issue of Roll Call that the devastation of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was worse than the government claimed, Pelley was arrested at his new base of operations in Noblesville, Indiana, and in April 1942, {{he was charged with}} 12 counts of high treason and sedition. One charge was dropped, but he was tried in Indiana and convicted of the other eleven, mostly for making seditious statements and also for obstructing military recruiting and fomenting insurrection within the military. Pelley was sentenced to 15 years in prison. After serving eight years, he was <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> in 1950. While still incarcerated, he was also one of 30 defendants in the [...] "Mass Sedition Trial" [...] of Nazi sympathizers, which resulted in a mistrial after the death of the judge, Edward C.

5000|$|Mohammed Ali Hammadi {{was arrested}} in 1987 in Frankfurt, Germany (then West Germany), while {{attempting}} to smuggle liquid explosives, {{two years after the}} TWA Flight 847 attack. In addition to the West German charge of illegal importation of explosives, he was tried and convicted of Stethem's 1985 murder and was sentenced to life in prison. However, he was <b>paroled</b> and <b>released</b> by German officials on December 20, 2005, and returned to Lebanon. There has been speculation that his parole was granted as part of a covert prisoner swap, in exchange for the release of Susanne Osthoff. Taken hostage in Iraq a month prior, Osthoff was released the week of Hammadi's parole. On February 14, 2006 the United States formally asked the Lebanese government to extradite Mohammed Ali Hammadi for Stethem's murder. On February 24, 2006, he appeared as well on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list, under the name Mohammed Ali [...] "Hamadei" [...] (sic). He was among the second group of indicted fugitives to be named by the FBI to the list.|$|R
50|$|McDuff {{was one of}} 20 former {{death row}} inmates and 127 murderers to be <b>paroled.</b> After being <b>released,</b> {{he got a job}} at a gas station making $4 an hour while taking a class at Texas State Technical College in Waco. Within three days of his release, it is widely {{believed}} that he began killing again. The body of 31-year-old Sarafia Parker was discovered on October 14, 1989, in Temple, a town 48 miles south of Waco along the I-35 corridor. McDuff was not charged with this crime. However, he was soon returned to prison on a parole violation for making death threats to a youth in Rosebud.|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} {{baseline}} data on recently <b>released</b> <b>paroled</b> {{men who are}} homeless (N 5 157), residing in a residential drug treatment program, and enrolled in a longitudinal study to examine personal, developmental, and social correlates of parolees who are homeless and who have committed serious violent offenses. Having experienced childhood sexual abuse,poor parental relationships, and early-onset incarceration (prior to 21 years of age) were important correlates of serious violent crimes. These findings highlight the need for interventions that address offenders' prior adult and childhood victimization and suggest that policies for reentering violent offenders should encompass {{an understanding of the}} broader family contexts in which these patterns of maltreatment often occur. © 2012 Springer Publishing Company...|$|R
2500|$|FLQ members practised {{propaganda}} of {{the deed}} and issued declarations {{that called for}} a socialist insurrection against oppressors identified with [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] imperialism, {{the overthrow of the}} Quebec government, the independence of Quebec from Canada and the establishment of a French-speaking Quebecer [...] "workers' society". It gained the support of many left-leaning students, teachers and academics up to 1970, who engaged in public strikes in solidarity with FLQ during the October crisis. After the kidnapping of Cross, nearly 1,000 students at Université de Montréal signed a petition supporting the FLQ manifesto. This public support largely ended after the group announced they had executed Laporte, in a public communique that ended with an insult of the victim. Nonetheless, they continued to receive the support of other far-left organizations such as the Communist Party of Canada and the League for Socialist Action. The KGB, which had established contact with the FLQ before 1970, later forged documents to portray them as a CIA false flag operation, a story that gained limited traction among academic sources before declassified Soviet archives revealed the ruse. By the early 1980s, most of the imprisoned FLQ members had been <b>paroled</b> or <b>released.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the American Civil War {{began in}} 1861, Owen entered the Union Army as a {{lieutenant}} colonel. He {{was promoted to}} colonel after the battles of Rich Mountain, Greenbrier River, and Cheat Mountain. On February 24, 1862, Owen was placed in command of four thousand Confederate prisoners of war at Camp Morton in Indianapolis. The regulations that Owen wrote placed much of the disciplinary authority {{in the hands of}} the Confederate sergeants. Owen provided the prisoners with books and allowed them to form glee clubs, theatrical groups, and sports teams. Owen created a camp bakery to be staffed by the prisoners; the money saved would be used to provide additional supplies and food for the prisoners. Despite these privileges, Owen strictly enforced the restrictions on mail and visitors. On May 26, 1862, Owen left Camp Morton as his regiment had been transferred to a battle position. When Owen's regiment was captured at Munfordville, Confederate General Simon Bolivar Buckner personally thanked Owen for his kind treatment of the Camp Morton prisoners. Owen's regiment was quickly <b>paroled</b> and <b>released.</b> Owen led his regiment through other battles, including Vicksburg, Jackson, and Bayou Bourbeux, until late in 1863.|$|R
