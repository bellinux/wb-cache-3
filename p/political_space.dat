However, the PEMA and POA, which require permits to be obtained before public meetings and assemblies can be held, were enacted pursuant to exceptions to these rights. Article 14(2)(a) provides that Parliament may by law restrict the right to free speech to protect, among other things, Singapore's security and public order, and to prevent incitement to any criminal offence. Under Article 14(2)(b), the right of assembly may also be limited for public order reasons. As Speakers' Corner was intended to increase avenues available for the exercise of free speech, the pieces of subsidiary legislation regulating the venue were issued to provide that public speaking and demonstrations there are not subject to the PEMA and POA if the conditions specified in the subsidiary legislation are complied with. Speakers' Corner has been criticized as a token gesture, though others have pointed to its use by civil society activists as evidence that it has widened the <b>political</b> <b>space</b> in Singapore.|$|E

This gave <b>political</b> <b>space</b> to Islamists who previously lost overwhelmingly, allegedly due to massive rigging, in the 1983 state elections. In 1986, Shah decided to construct a mosque within the premises of an ancient Hindu temple inside the New Civil Secretariat area in Jammu to be made available to the Muslim employees for 'Namaz'. People of Jammu took to streets to protest against this decision, which led to a Hindu-Muslim clash. On his return to Kashmir valley in February 1986, Gul Shah retaliated and incited the Kashmiri Muslims by saying Islam khatrey mein hey (trans. Islam is in danger). As a result, communal violence gripped the region, in which Hindus were targeted, especially the Kashmiri pandits, who later in the year 1990, fled the valley in large numbers. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged.|$|E

25|$|What is now {{described}} as Parthian art {{since the end}} of the 19th century, was not known as such a century ago. Palmyra since that time has had numerous sculptures sent to Europe. They depict men and women in robes, richly decorated with numerous jewels, and often represent the ruins of a city often associated with romantic literary sources in conjunction with Queen Zenobia. However, no separate term was found here for the art created, but they were considered a local variant of Roman art. The excavations at Dura Europos since inception and especially since the early decades of the 20th century have provided many new discoveries. The classical archaeologist and director of the excavations, Michael Rostovtzeff, realized that the art of the first centuries AD in Palmyra, Dura Europos, and also in Iran and its other territories followed the same principles. He labeled this art work as Parthian art. The widespread use of this art, even beyond the limits of Parthian empire, however, raised the question of whether this art was truly suitable to label Parthian, which is according to Schlumberger usually affirmed in research, as it was probably influenced by the art of the Parthian capital of Ctesiphon. Nevertheless, the designation of artistic creation of the Parthian Empire and the affected areas in which the research is inconsistent and scrutinized. Authors often avoid the term Parthian art, preferring instead to name the art work on the cultural and <b>political</b> <b>space.</b> Daniel Schlumberger affirmed the notion of Parthian art in one of his most important works about the Hellenized Orient (in the original: L'Orient Hellénisé, appeared in Germany in the World of Art series). However, the book covers not only Parthian art, but also Greek art in the Orient in general. Hans Erik Mathiesen titled his work the Parthian sculpture: Sculpture in the Parthian Empire in which he studies art from cities such as Palmyra. Likewise, Trudy S. Kawami called her work to Statues in Iran: Monumental Art of the Parthian period of Iran, while Malcolm Colledge wrote his book Parthian art clearly as Parthian art to strictly define a designation of Parthian art.|$|E

2500|$|The PAP, the {{dominant}} political party in Singapore and UMNO the null dominant political party in Malaysia had two differing competing political ideologies. The PAP led by Lee Kuan Yew adopted non-communal politics whereby {{it called for}} equality for all regardless of race or religion whereas UMNO led by Tunku Abdul Rahman, who advocated {{for the provision of}} special rights for the bumiputeras indigenous Malays in Malaysia. These ideological differences were important and crucial factors causing social and political tensions from 1963 until the point of separation of Singapore from Malaysia. [...] One of the conditions imposed by Tunku Adbul Rahman was Singapore’s interference in Malaysian politics and federal elections. The relationship between UMNO and PAP began to sour when the PAP won 37 seats in the elections that were conducted five days after the merger with Singapore. The Singapore Alliance Party which was supported by UMNO and had hoped to receive the support from the local Malay community fielded its 42 candidates with all failing to win even a single seat. The UMNO saw these results as threatening as these candidates were contesting in Malay dominated areas and yet they were defeated by the PAP. Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP instead of abiding to the request made by Tunku Abdul Rahman of not interfering in Malaysia’s federal elections, fielded some of its candidates to contest in the 1964 Federal elections in April as an attempt to portray itself as a Malaysian political party as well. Eventually, PAP did win one seat which was seen as an intrusion into Malaysia’s <b>political</b> <b>space</b> and a threat to the provision of special rights to the Malays. Tunku viewed this defeat as a humiliating blow to the credibility of UMNO. [...] Lee Kuan Yew's intentions of creating a Malaysian Malaysia advocating for equal treatment and opportunities for all races was viewed with suspicion and hostility. In an attempt to safeguard Malaysia’s political interest and to sway the Singaporean Malay’s support towards UMNO, Malaysia began to launch anti-PAP campaign through the publication of news in using newspapers and political rallies.|$|E

40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceIn {{the shadow}} of a French national narrative which demonises and rejects local specificities, highly differentiated territorial <b>political</b> <b>spaces</b> have been created, shaped by the dynamics of identity, decentralisation, and public policy. This book analyses regions as loose and flexible <b>political</b> <b>spaces,</b> in which institutionalisation is far from being a one-way process. A variety of actors contribute to the upward, downward and horizontal dynamics which make up these spaces. Institutionalising regional space comprises three dimensions: institutionalisation as a result of cultural, social and political mobilisation; via the implementation of policies for territorial justice and decentralisation; and finally via the deployment of a system of regional governance. This analysis of regional power in France paints a picture of a controversial central state undergoing fundamental changes, and of a decentralised republic at a crossroads. It is essential reading for students and researchers working on issues of territorial governance and decentralisation in France and more widely in Europe...|$|R
