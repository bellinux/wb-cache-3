50|$|Myths abound {{that the}} spire of the {{original}} church steeple protrudes from the water when the Happy Valley reservoir's capacity is low, and that the town exists, submerged in the depths. This is incorrect, as all buildings were demolished and all salvageable materials — primarily fruit trees and vines — sold off before the area was flooded. Staff responsible for the site {{at the time of}} the rumoured church sightings explain that a <b>pump</b> <b>frame</b> was then installed in the location in question which was visible at low water. At any rate, maps of pre-reservoir land parcels show that the location {{of the original}} church was not next to the 'scour' tower, but rather under the present dam wall, opposite the current church at the Candy's Road/Chandler's Hill Road junction. Between 2002 and 2004, the Reservoir was drained when it underwent a major renovation as part of A$22 million rehabilitation project aimed at enhancing the Reservoir to meet guidelines of best practice for dam management. With the lowering of the water level during renovations exposing the original Happy Valley township for the first time, archaeologists took the opportunity to excavate the site. Very little was found apart from scattered bricks and the foundations of several buildings of which only the Post Office was identified.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to understand the steady and the unsteady flow field at the exit of an automotive torque converter pump with a view towards improving its performance. The measurements were conducted in a stationary frame of reference using a high frequency response five-hole probe and the data were processed to derive the flow properties in the relative (<b>pump)</b> <b>frame</b> of reference. The experimental data were processed at three different operating conditions: maximum efficiency point, design point and near-stall point. The unsteady values of flow properties (pressure, velocity and flow angles) were divided into five components: mean, periodic, blade aperiodic, revolution aperiodic and unresolved components...|$|E
40|$|Electroosmotic flow (EOF) pumps with {{flow rates}} {{on the order of}} 1 ml/min have been {{designed}} and fabricated. These pumps use EOF to propel liquid solutions in a compact system with no moving parts.

The machine will not operate properly {{if it does not}} use the appropriate foundation to support static and dynamic loads. The Terzaghi and Meyerhof methods were used in static analysis to measure the settlement in the pile group and soil bearing capacity. The frequency, damping, and vibration amplitude of the vibration that occur in a vertical and horizontal vibration, and the vibration rocking were calculated by using the trial error method for dynamic analysis. Modelling frame foundation machine is the main focus in this research. The result shows that the most effective foundation dimension for cooling water <b>pump</b> machine is <b>frame</b> foundation type with the pile cap dimensions of 9. 8 m x 4 m x 1. 5 m; column of 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m x 1 m and slab of 9. 8 m x 4 m x 0. 3 m, and using the piles with a diameter of 0. 35 m, length of 21 m and the spacing between the piles is about 2. 45 m.

40|$|Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) {{conducted}} {{an evaluation of}} previously recorded historic site 41 BX 784 in central Bexar County on March 13, 2006 for Rosillo Creek Development Ltd. of Laredo, Texas. This action was initiated by a request from the City of San Antonio, Office of Historic Preservation. The Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division has no jurisdiction in this project; therefore, an antiquities permit was not required. This site was recorded by Leonard K. Voellinger of Espey, Houston & Associates, Inc. (now PBS&J) in 1987 as the Richard Hild farm which was occupied during {{the early part of}} the 20 th century (circa 1903) until 1987. At the time of this survey the investigators observed two water troughs, two cisterns, a tank (earthen pond) and associated wood <b>frame</b> <b>pump</b> house, three concrete slabs, and seven rubble piles representing two house sites and five ancillary structures. Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. recommended additional work at this site to determine its eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. This site was found by BVRA to be virtually destroyed with only five intact or partially intact features present. These are the pump house, a rectangular water trough, a sandstone and mortar retaining wall, a sandstone and mortar feature of unknown function, and a metal cattle guard. The cinder block cistern noted by Voellinger is no longer present, and the piles of wooden rubble from bulldozed structures are also absent. Based on the evidence observed by BVRA, site 41 BX 784 is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. No further work is recommended, and construction should be allowed to proceed as. planned.

40|$|In this thesis, spectroscopic and {{structural}} properties of homogeneous para-hydrogen crystals and diatomic molecules embedded in rare gas crystals are explored by theoretical means. The agreement with experimental signatures indicates {{the suitability of}} the chosen quantum and classical methods to accurately describe the various low-temperature physical and chemical problems investigated at the laser laboratory. A novel explanation of band structures in Raman and IR spectra is given for CO in Ar. Rotational transition rules are found to dictate the spectral broadening of infrared and Raman band structures {{as a function of}} temperature. The results show that after photodissociation of matrix-isolated formaldehyde, the formation of intermolecular complex CO-H$_ 2 $ becomes energetically unfavourable in the cage of Ar lattice atoms. The molecular photodissociation products, CO and H$_ 2 $, rotate in lattice sites of varying angular hindrance. An extensive analysis of long-lived electronic coherences is performed for I$_ 2 $ in Xe. Quantum beats in time-resolved CARS spectra are reproduced with the help of computed potentials. The predicted 2 D (time and frequency) representations of the CARS signals and simulated resonance Raman intensity modulations are shown to complement the demonstration of electronic coherence observed as vibronically resolved absorption spectra. The doublet in resonance Raman progression is assigned to molecular iodine residing in two lattice sites of different geometry. The rapid line broadening of the other peak with increasing vibrational quantum number is explained by coupled rotation-translation dynamics in the crystal site that supports reorientations of the molecular axis. The other site fixes the orientation and maintains longer vibrational coherence. An analytical model for quantum and polarization beat frequencies in the CARS spectra are presented for CN in Xe. The rotational coherences in the ground and electronic states are studied numerically and a predictive control scheme for the detection and emergence of interferences is introduced. Nonadiabatic molecular alignment is considered as the underlying mechanism in excitation and probing of rotons in para-hydrogen crystals. The relative orientation between the laboratory <b>frame</b> (<b>pump</b> polarization) and the crystal axes is shown to dictate the roton dynamics observed through the pump-probe optical Kerr effect spectroscopy. The numerical results suggest a control over the spatial composition of the rotons by changing the laser beam focus along the surface plane of the crystal...|$|R
