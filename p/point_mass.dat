The device's design was based on Asus' Eee Pad MeMO ME370T tablet that had been showcased at the conference. Following a hectic four-month development period during which the device was modified to reach a US$199 price <b>point,</b> <b>mass</b> production started in May. It was unveiled at the Google I/O annual developer conference on June27, when it also became available for pre-order through Google Play. Shipping commenced in mid-July 2012 to Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, before the tablet was progressively released in other regions. Google expanded the Nexus 7 lineup in October 2012 {{with the introduction of}} 32 GB versions, available in Wi-Fi–only and HSPA+ cellular-ready varieties.|$|E

The first test of Newton's theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798. It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's Principia and approximately 71 years after his death.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{characterize}} {{limits for}} orthogonal Szegö polynomials of fixed degree k, {{with respect to}} certain measures on the unit circle which are weakly convergent to a sum of m<k <b>point</b> <b>masses.</b> Such measures arise, for example, as a convolution of <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> with an approximate identity. It is readily seen that the underlying measures in two recently-proposed methods for estimating the m frequencies, θj, of a discrete-time trigonometric signal using Szegö polynomials are of this form. We prove existence of Szegö polynomial limits associated with a general class of weakly convergent measures, and prove that for convolution of <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> with the Poisson kernel, which underlies one of the recently-proposed methods, the limit has as a factor the Szegö polynomial {{with respect to a}} related measure, which we specify. Since m of the zeros approach the eiθj, this result uniquely characterizes the limit.

Since we are assuming circular motion, let r(t) = R·ur, where R is a constant (the radius of the circle) and ur is the unit vector pointing from the origin to the <b>point</b> <b>mass.</b> The direction of ur is described by θ, the angle between the x-axis and the unit vector, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. The other unit vector for polar coordinates, uθ is perpendicular to ur and points in the direction of increasing θ. These polar unit vectors can be expressed in terms of Cartesian unit vectors in the x and y directions, denoted i and j respectively: and uθ depend on θ, and so in general have non-zero time derivatives.|$|E

The effect of discrete <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> and patches of distributed masses attached at {{the periphery of the}} plate on free and forced vibration behavior of a spinning disc has been investigated. Discrete <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> and distributed patch masses have been placed at higher strain regions to look into its influence on the natural frequencies, mode shapes and response of the plate to external excitation. Results for eight and sixteen <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> and patches on the vibration characteristics have been compared. It has been observed that discrete patches and <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> have significant influence on the modal frequencies and these can also act as dynamic vibration absorbers in reducing vibration of a spinning disc.

25|$|The arms of spiral galaxies rotate {{around the}} galactic centre. The {{luminous}} mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the centre to the outskirts. If luminous mass {{were all the}} matter, then we can model the galaxy as a <b>point</b> <b>mass</b> in the centre and test masses orbiting around it (similar to the solar system). From Kepler's Second Law, we expect that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the centre, similar to our solar system. This is not observed.

25|$|Note {{that while}} bound orbits of a <b>point</b> <b>mass</b> or a spherical {{body with a}} Newtonian {{gravitational}} field are closed ellipses, which repeat the same path exactly and indefinitely, any non-spherical or non-Newtonian effects (such as caused by the slight oblateness of the Earth, or by relativistic effects, thereby changing the gravitational field's behavior with distance) will cause the orbit's shape to depart from the closed ellipses characteristic of Newtonian two-body motion. The two-body solutions were published by Newton in Principia in 1687. In 1912, Karl Fritiof Sundman developed a converging infinite series that solves the three-body problem; however, it converges too slowly to be of much use. Except for special cases like the Lagrangian points, no method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies.|$|E

40|$|We {{look for}} {{differential}} equations satisfied by the generalized Jacobi polynomials which are orthogonal on the interval [- 1, 1] {{with respect to}} the classical weight function for the Jacobi polynomials together with <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> at both endpoints. In the special symmetric case that both parameters are equal and also the two <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> are equal we find all differential equations of spectral type satisfied by these symmetric generalized ultraspherical polynomials. We show that if the <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> are positive only for nonnegative integer values of the parameter there exists exactly one differential equation of spectral type which is of finite order. By using quadratic transformations we also obtain differential equations for some related sets of generalized Jacobi polynomials. In these cases we find finite order differential equations even though one of the parameters is not equal to an integer. Comment: 25 page...|$|R

500|$|In {{science and}} mathematics, the Dirac delta function, or [...] function, is a {{generalized}} function, or distribution that was historically {{introduced by the}} physicist Paul Dirac for modelling the density of an idealized <b>point</b> <b>mass</b> or point charge, as a function that is equal to zero everywhere except for zero and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one. As there is no function that has these properties, the computations that were done by the theoretical physicists appeared to mathematicians as nonsense, until the introduction of distributions by Laurent Schwartz, for formalizing and validating mathematically these computations. This amounts, in particular, to define Dirac delta function as a linear functional, which maps every function to its value at zero. The Kronecker delta function, which is usually defined on a discrete domain and takes values 0 and 1, is a discrete analog of Dirac delta function.|$|E
