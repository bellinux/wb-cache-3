40|$|Hydrogenases {{catalyze}} the reversible reaction 2 H+ +  2 e-↔H 2 with an {{equilibrium constant}} that {{is dependent on}} the reducing potential of electrons carried by their redox partner. To examine the possibility of increasing the <b>photobiological</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> within cyanobacterial cultures, we expressed the [FeFe] hydrogenase, HydA, from Clostridium acetobutylicum in the non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus sp. 7942. We demonstrate that the heterologously expressed hydrogenase is functional in vitro and in vivo, and that the in vivo hydrogenase activity is connected to the light-dependent reactions of the electron transport chain. Under anoxic conditions, HydA activity is capable of supporting light-dependent hydrogen evolution at a rate >  500 -fold greater than that supported by the endogenous [NiFe] hydrogenase. Furthermore, HydA can support limited growth solely using H 2 and light as the source of reducing equivalents under conditions where Photosystem II is inactivated. Finally, we demonstrate that the addition of exogenous ferredoxins can modulate redox flux in the hydrogenase-expressing strain, allowing for greater hydrogen yields and for dark fermentation of internal energy stores into hydrogen gas...|$|E
40|$|A {{challenge}} for <b>photobiological</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> gas (H 2) {{as a potential}} biofuel is to find suitable electron-donating feedstocks. Here, we examined the inorganic compound thiosulfate as a possible electron donor for nitrogenase-catalyzed H 2 production by the purple nonsulfur phototrophic bacterium (PNSB) Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Thiosulfate is an intermediate of microbial sulfur metabolism in nature and is also generated in industrial processes. We found that R. palustris grew photoautotrophically with thiosulfate and bicarbonate and produced H 2 when nitrogen gas was the sole nitrogen source (nitrogen-fixing conditions). In addition, illuminated nongrowing R. palustris cells converted about 80 % of available electrons from thiosulfate to H 2. H 2 production with acetate and succinate as electron donors was less efficient (40 to 60 %), partly because nongrowing cells excreted the intermediary metabolite α-ketoglutarate into the culture medium. The fixABCX operon (RPA 4602 to RPA 4605) encoding a predicted electron-transfer complex is necessary for growth using thiosulfate under nitrogen-fixing conditions and {{may serve as a}} point of engineering to control rates of H 2 production. The possibility to use thiosulfate expands the range of electron-donating compounds for H 2 production by PNSBs beyond biomass-based electron donors...|$|E

30|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} evaluation of algal species has been orchestrated by the US Department of Energy’s Aquatic Species Program (ASP) to develop microalgae {{as a source of}} biodiesel [29]. Over 3, 000 strains of microalgae have been isolated from ponds and seas. Cellular oil content varies with growth phases [39]. The cells of the chlorophyte microalga Parietochloris incise synthesize almost twice as many triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the stationary phase than in the exponential growth phase [40]. Although microalgae have a high level of biodiversity, only a few species can be subjected to genetic manipulation [41]. The algae with the best developed genetic toolbox are the unicellular green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [42]. It is a well-established model organism for the study of various cellular processes such as photosynthesis, flagella, starch metabolism, and <b>photobiological</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> [42]. Like many other algal species, C. reinhardtii can accumulate significant amount of oil when subjected to unfavorable environmental conditions [43 - 47]. C. reinhardtii {{has proven to be a}} useful model organism to study the improvement of biodiesel production by microalgae [48, 49]. It is unicellular and stays as haploid during most of its life cycle [42], thus it is particularly useful in the context of a forward genetic approach, because the mutant phenotype can be observed during the first generation and does not need to reach a diploid homozygous stage [50]. The freshwater green microalgae P incise enhances not only its production of TAG under nitrogen starvation but also the production of arachidonic acid, a valuable nutraceutical [51]. Green algae including Spirogyra sp. and Chlorococum sp. have been shown to accumulate high levels of polysaccharides both in their complex cell walls and as starch [4]. This starch can be used for bioethanol production. Bioethanol production from algae shows significant potential due to their low percentage of lignin and hemicelluloses as compared to other lignocellulosic plants [52]. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are also able to directly produce biohydrogen through photofermentation in an anaerobic process involving oxidation of ferredoxin by the hydrogenase enzyme [53].|$|E
40|$|The {{decreasing}} {{availability of}} fossil energy stocks and the eventuality of tragic climate changes caused by greenhouse gases lead {{to search for}} alternative renewable energy sources. Biological hydrogen might be one promising renewable energy carrier. A specific and restricted group of microalgae developed the ability to produce hydrogen based on an oxygen-sensitive hydrogenase enzyme coupled to the photosynthetic pathway, acting as a putative valve for excess electrons in conditions where other electron acceptors are scarce. The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii {{is widely regarded as}} a model organism for various biological processes, especially for photosynthesis. Moreover, the capacity of Chlamydomonas hydrogenase is claimed as the highest recorded in literature. Less than twenty years ago, a group of American scientists designed a new approach for sustained <b>photobiological</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> based on a two-stage protocol that temporally separates photosynthetic O 2 evolution from the H 2 production phase (Melis et al., 2000). The transition occurs upon sulfur deprivation of the culture and leads to an operating continuous production for several days, opening new possibilities in the aim of an economically rentable bioproduction. For these reasons, hydrogen photoproduction in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been extensively examined in the last decade as extension of photosynthesis research entailing the understanding of hydrogen metabolism in microalgae (for reviews, see Hankamer et al., 2007; Ghirardi et al., 2009; Ghysels and Franck, 2010). Despite the attractive trait of generating a renewable fuel from nature’s most plentiful resources, i. e. light and water, the physiological significance of such oxygen-sensitive enzyme coupled to oxygenic photosynthesis has been poorly investigated with the exception of some old studies (Kessler, 1973; Schreiber and Vidaver, 1974). In this work, hydrogenase implication in photosynthetic reactivation from dark and anoxic environment is investigated. In {{the first part of the}} work, by analyzing several strains affected in hydrogen metabolism (e. g. nda 2 -RNAi (Jans et al., 2008), pfl 1 (Philipps et al., 2011), dum 11 (Dorthu et al., 1992)), we show that the PSII–dependent photosynthetic electron flow upon dark to light shift is linearly related to the activity of hydrogenase, both for short and long-terms adaptation (Publication I). In agreement with this conclusion, a hydrogenase-deficient strain for the HydEF maturation factor (hydef, Posewitz et al., 2004) shows peculiar chlorophyll fluorescence induction kinetics after adaptation to dark and anoxia. Based on these findings, a novel imaging screening method is developed, allowing rapid identification of strains impaired in hydrogen metabolism. Compared to existing screens (for review, see Hemschemeier et al., 2009), our protocol is remarkably fast, sensitive and non-invasive. At this stage, application of this new screening method allowed us to isolate several hydrogenase-deficient strains, among which one was impaired for the hydrogenase maturation protein HydG (hydg- 2 mutant). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii might frequently encounter period of dark and anoxia in its natural habitat, especially during the night when the microbial community respires the available oxygen. In the second part of my work, the physiological importance of hydrogenase is investigated in the context of photosynthesis induction at the onset of light upon anoxia. In such conditions, the plastoquinone pool is known as being overreduced. This triggers the process of state transitions which is described as allowing the redistribution of light capture between both photosystems to manage the redox poise of the photosynthetic pathway (for review, see Lemeille and Rochaix, 2010). We therefore revisit the impact of both state transitions and hydrogenase activity on the reactivation of photosynthetic electron flow (Publication II). Here we show that, in presence of hydrogenase, photosynthesis reactivation is slightly faster in stt 7 mutant locked in state 1 (Depege et al., 2003) compared to wild type which is in state 2. However, photosynthesis reactivation is delayed in hydef stt 7 - 9 double mutant compared to hydef mutant. This indicates that, in a hydrogenase-deficient context, state 2 promotes photosynthesis reactivation. Considered for a long time as being tightly interconnected (Finazzi et al., 1999; Finazzi et al., 2002; Finazzi and Forti, 2004), state transitions and PSI-CEF have recently been revealed as unrelated to each other (Takahashi et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the increasing of PSI antenna size in state 2 could even though enhance the PSI-CEF rate, in an indirect way, by enhancing PSI energy capture (Cardol et al., 2009; Alric, 2014). This reasonably raises the question of a possible involvement of PSI-CEF in photosynthesis induction. This possibility is further studied in the third and last part of the work. Thanks to mutants devoid of PSI-CEF (i. e. pgrl 1 mutant (Tolleter et al., 2011)) and hydrogenase activity (i. e. hydg- 2 mutant (Publication I)), we investigate the role played by PSI-CEF along with hydrogenase during photosynthesis reactivation during a shift from dark anoxia to light (Publication III). Herein, we demonstrate that Calvin cycle reactivation is proton gradient-dependent, most likely due to ATP requirement for carbon dioxide fixation. By measuring the PSI/PSII efficiency ratio during the re- illumination period, we point out the physiological occurrence of PSI-CEF within the first minutes of ilumination. We therefore propose a schematic model that assesses the electron flow through hydrogenase, PSI-CEF and Calvin cycle in function of the illumination period in all studied strains. Although lack of PSI-CEF does not appear to be essential for cell survival, photosynthesis reactivation is delayed in pgrl 1 mutants. We also isolate a pgrl 1 hydg- 2 double mutant and demonstrate that the combination of both defects prevents any photosynthetic activity and strongly impairs growth. This highlights the importance for algae to keep both pathways in the course of evolution, being critical for the survival of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in its natural environment...|$|E
