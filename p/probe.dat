5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space <b>probe</b> believed lost. The damaged <b>probe</b> was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the <b>probe</b> to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the <b>probe</b> gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia <b>probe</b> and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} years, the telescope {{was used to}} track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 <b>probe.</b> The telescope was also used to send commands to the <b>probe,</b> including the one to separate the <b>probe</b> from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the <b>probe</b> was eight million miles away. It also received data from the <b>probe,</b> being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface.

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{influence of}} quantum <b>probing</b> on an object is studied. Here, quantum <b>probing</b> {{is understood as}} a pre-measurement based on a non-demolition interaction, which records some information of the <b>probed</b> object, but does not change its energy state when both the <b>probing</b> apparatus and the <b>probed</b> object are isolated from the environment. It is argued that when the <b>probing</b> apparatus and the <b>probed</b> object are immersed in a same equilibrium environment, the <b>probing</b> can affect the effective temperature of the object or induce a quantum isothermal process for the object to transfer its energy. This thermodynamic feature {{can be regarded as}} a witness of the existence of quantum <b>probing</b> even if the quantum <b>probing</b> would not disturb the object if the environment were not present.

5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar <b>probe</b> flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the <b>probe</b> made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the <b>probe</b> had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the <b>probe</b> arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Several {{condensed}} matter experiments involve {{scattering of}} an experimental <b>probe,</b> such as X-ray, optical photons, neutrons, etc., on constituents of a material. The choice of scattering <b>probe</b> {{depends on the}} observation energy scale of interest. Visible light has energy {{on the scale of}} 1 electron volt (eV) and is used as a scattering <b>probe</b> to measure variations in material properties such as dielectric constant and refractive index. X-rays have energies of the order of 10 keV and hence are able to <b>probe</b> atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density.|$|E
50|$|CISH also {{differs from}} FISH in the <b>probes</b> {{that are used}} {{as well as in}} the overall method. There are many {{different}} types of FISH <b>probes</b> available, such as repeat <b>probes,</b> <b>probes</b> that detect specific genes or telomeres, and <b>probes</b> that detect chromosomal abnormalities. In contrast, there is a limited variety of commercially available CISH <b>probes,</b> including <b>probes</b> that bind the centromere of chromosomes 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 18, X, and Y as well as gene-specific <b>probes</b> for cancer-related genes, such as HER-2, EGFR, MYC, and TOP2A. Despite the limited variety of available CISH <b>probes,</b> they are generally more cost-effective than FISH <b>probes.</b> With regard to the overall method, FISH can be performed using direct labelling—fluorochromes are attached to the probes—or indirect labelling—the <b>probes</b> are labelled with biotin or digoxigenin which are then detected using fluorescently-labelled streptavidin or antibodies, respectively. CISH is performed using indirect labelling in which antibodies or streptavidin are conjugated to enzymes such as HRP or alkaline phosphatase (AP).|$|R
40|$|Methods {{employing}} 35 S-, biotin-, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) -labeled DNA <b>probes</b> {{were compared}} {{for the detection}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the liver. The results demonstrate that: 1) HBV can be detected reliably only by the use of radiolabeled <b>probes,</b> whereas methods employing nonradioactive <b>probes</b> obviously are not sensitive enough for this virus. The use of 35 S-labeled <b>probes</b> shortens the exposure times considerably in comparison to tritiated <b>probes.</b> 2) Biotin-labeled <b>probes</b> are of limited value for in situ hybridization on liver tissues because the presence of endogenous avidin-binding activity often leads to false positive results. 3) Brd-Urd-labeled <b>probes</b> are a useful alternative to biotinylated <b>probes</b> {{for the detection of}} CMV.

In this paper, we attempt to study differentspectrum <b>probing</b> mechanisms and evaluate a performance metriccalled the <b>probing</b> delay, i. e., how quickly a <b>probing</b> mechanismcan detect a channel change. We find that randomization in theprobing strategy does affect the <b>probing</b> delay. Specifically, in theindependent sensing scenario, periodic <b>probing</b> indeed achievesthe smallest <b>probing</b> delay.

5|$|The Lovell Telescope {{was used}} to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In terms of American space probes, the {{telescope}} tracked Pioneer 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958, Pioneer 3 in December 1958, and Pioneer 4 in March 1959.

50|$|This {{technique}} {{relies on}} traceroute-like <b>probing</b> on the IP address space. These <b>probes</b> report back IP forwarding paths to the destination address. By combining these paths one can infer router level topology {{for a given}} POP. Active <b>probing</b> is advantageous in that the paths returned by <b>probes</b> constitute the actual forwarding path that data takes through networks. It is {{also more likely to}} find peering links between ISP's. However, active <b>probing</b> requires massive amounts of <b>probes</b> to map the entire Internet. It is more likely to infer false topologies due to load balancing routers and routers with multiple IP address aliases. Decreased global support for enhanced <b>probing</b> mechanisms such as source-route <b>probing,</b> ICMP Echo Broadcasting, and IP Address Resolution techniques leaves this type of <b>probing</b> in the realm of network diagnosis.|$|R
40|$|Optical <b>probes</b> used in {{velocimetry}} measurements {{have typically}} been individual <b>probes</b> that collect data {{for a single}} diagnostic at a single point.

40|$|Problem {{determination}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important tasks in managing distributed systems. <b>Probing</b> (both at the transaction and network levels) has been widely used for assessing compliance with Service Level Agreements and locating problems in distributed systems. However a <b>probing</b> scheme which uses a fixed set of regularly scheduled <b>probes</b> can be expensive in terms of the number of synthetic transactions needed, especially for the task of problem determination. This paper introduces an active <b>probing</b> scheme to reduce the number of <b>probes</b> needed. Our key idea is to divide the problem determination task into two steps. We first use a relatively small number of fixed, regularly scheduled, <b>probes</b> for detecting that a problem has occurred. In the second phase, once occurrence of a problem is detected, additional <b>probes</b> are issued on-the-fly to acquire additional information until the problem is localized. We develop algorithms for selecting an optimal set of <b>probes</b> for problem detection and choosing which <b>probes</b> to send next based on what is currently known. We demonstrate through both analysis and simulation that the active <b>probing</b> scheme can greatly reduce the number of <b>probes</b> and the time needed for localizing the problem when compared with a non-active <b>probing</b> scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Past {{research}} on probing-based network monitoring provides solutions based on preplanned <b>probing</b> which is computationally expensive, is less accurate, and involves a large management traffic. Unlike preplanned <b>probing,</b> adaptive <b>probing</b> proposes to select <b>probes</b> in an interactive manner sending more <b>probes</b> to diagnose the observed problem areas and less <b>probes</b> in the healthy areas, thereby significantly {{reducing the number}} of <b>probes</b> required. Another limitation of most of the work proposed in the past is that it assumes a deterministic dependency information between the <b>probes</b> and the network components. Such an assumption can not be made when complete and accurate network information might not be available. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop network monitoring algorithms that can localize failures in the network even in the presence of uncertainty in the inferred dependencies between <b>probes</b> and network components. In this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis tool with following novel features: (1) We present an adaptive <b>probing</b> based solution for fault diagnosis which is cost-effective, failure resistant, more accurate, and involves less management traffic as compared to the preplanned <b>probing</b> approach. (2) We address the issues that arise with the presence of a non-deterministic environment and present <b>probing</b> algorithms that consider the involved uncertainties in the collected network information. ...|$|R
40|$|Sequence-specific {{detection}} of nucleic acids has been intensively {{studied in the}} field of molecular diagnostics. In particular, the detection and analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is crucial for the identification of disease-causing genes and diagnosis of diseases. Sequence-specific hybridization <b>probes,</b> such as molecular beacons bearing the fluorophore and quencher {{at both ends of the}} stem, have been developed to enable DNA mutation detection. Interestingly, DNA mutations can be detected using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide <b>probes</b> with only one fluorophore.
