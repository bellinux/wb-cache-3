5000|$|The Wright Etch is a <b>preferential</b> <b>etch</b> for {{revealing}} {{defects in}} <100> and <111> oriented, p- and n-type silicon. It {{was developed by}} Margaret Wright Jenkins in 1976 while working {{in research and development}} at Motorola Inc. It was published in 1977. [...] This etchant reveals clearly defined oxidation-induced stacking faults, dislocations, swirls and striations with minimum surface roughness or extraneous pitting. These defects are known causes of shorts and current leakage in finished semiconductor devices (such as transistors) should they fall across isolated junctions. A relatively low etch rate (~1 micrometre per minute) at room temperature provides etch control. The long shelf life of this etchant allows the solution to be stored in large quantities. The present report summarizes the highlights of the Wright etch. For a detailed discussion of observation and findings, please consult the original article.|$|E
5000|$|The Wright etch {{consistently}} produces well-defined etch {{figures of}} common defects on silicon surfaces. This attribute {{is attributed to}} the interactions of the selected chemicals in the formula. Robbins and Schwartz [...] described chemical etching of silicon in detail using an HF, HNO3 and H2O system; and an HF, HNO3, H2O and CH3COOH (acetic acid) system. Briefly, the etching of silicon is a two-step process. First, the top surface of the silicon is converted into a soluble oxide by a suitable oxidizing agent(s). Then the resulting oxide layer {{is removed from the}} surface by dissolution in a suitable solvent, usually HF. This is a continuous process during the etch cycle. In order to delineate a crystal defect, the defect area must be oxidized at a slower or faster rate than the surrounding area thereby forming a mound or pit during the <b>preferential</b> <b>etch</b> process.|$|E
30|$|The first {{method for}} the non-lithographic {{preparation}} of ultra-dense line arrays was originally proposed by Natelson et al. [7]. It is essentially {{based on the}} sequential alternate deposition of two films A and B characterized by {{the existence of a}} <b>preferential</b> <b>etch</b> for one of them (say, A). After cutting at 90 °, polishing, and controlled etching of A, one eventually gets a mold that {{can be used as a}} mask for imprint lithography (IL). Actually IL is a contact (rather than proximity) lithography; what is non-lithographic is uniquely the way used for the preparation of the mask. The first practical application of this idea was provided by Melosh et al. [8] who prepared a contact mask for IL with pitch of 16 nm by growing on a substrate a quantum well via molecular beam epitaxy, cutting the sample perpendicularly to the surface, polishing the newly exposed surface, and etching selectively the different strata of the well.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} here a novel {{electrochemical device}} for direct mlcromachlnlng of a semiconductor substrate by guiding an ultramlcroelectrode tip in a predeflned pattern above the surface. Currently, {{the technology for}} the fabrication of electronic devices is based on mlcrollthography, and the sizes of the pattern are limited by the wavelengths of the optical source used in irradiation. More recently, some laser-lnduced direct etching techniques in both the gas and liquid phase have also been investigated (1 - 3). An alternative technique to form a <b>preferential</b> <b>etched</b> pattern in solution was initiated in this laboratory by utilization of a scannin...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus is {{incorporated}} into single crystal diamond during epitaxial growth at higher concentrations on the (111) crystallographic surface {{than on the}} (001) crystallographic surface. To form n+-type regions in diamond for semiconductor devices it is beneficial to deposit on the (111) surface. However, diamond deposition is faster and of higher quality on the (001) surface. A <b>preferential</b> <b>etch</b> method is described that forms inverted pyramids on the (001) surface of a substrate diamond crystal, which opens (111) faces for improved phosphorus incorporation. The preferential etching occurs on the surface in regions where a nickel film is deposited. The etching is performed in a microwave generated hydrogen plasma operating at 160 Torr with the substrate temperature {{in the range of}} 800 - 950 °C. The epitaxial growth of diamond with high phosphorus concentrations exceeding 1020 cm- 3 is performed using a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition process. Successful growth conditions were achieved with a feedgas mixture of 0. 25 % methane, 500 ppm phosphine and hydrogen at a pressure of 160 Torr and a substrate temperature of 950 - 1000 °C. The room temperature resistivity of the phosphorus-doped diamond is 120 - 150 Ω-cm and the activation energy is 0. 027 eV...|$|E
