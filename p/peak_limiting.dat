5000|$|The F760X 'Compex' limiter {{was made}} up of three main parts; a compressor, limiter and a 'noise reducing' expander/gate. All of these parts could be used {{separately}} or together for well controlled sound limiting. This combination came about from client feedback. From the feedback ADR designed and built the first units, these were labelled as F760X-RS (RS meaning rack-mount stereo). Later modifications were made and another version was released with a better, ergonomically designed, front panel. This later model was labelled as the 'Compex'.The 'Compex' limiter provided <b>peak</b> <b>limiting</b> with a multi-ratio, variable threshold compressor. Ratio settings ranged from 1:1 to 20:1 and there were controls for threshold and release time. The inclusion of an expander/gate provided attenuation of the gain during pauses in the audio signal to reduce noise caused by compression; the expander/gate could also be used for special 'punchy' effects, favoured on drum and percussive sounds. Noise gates were often criticised at the time for 'hunting' around the threshold point. The 'Compex' used clever hysteresis around the gate, this was important to stop unpredictable opening and closing of the gate; the open threshold was higher than the close threshold.The gain reduction controlled by the 'Compex' was monitored from two meters located {{to the right of the}} front panel. There were two light indicators; a red light lit when the signal level reached its peak, and when in expand mode a green light was lit. There were a set of lights for each channel, depending if the unit was the stereo or mono version.There were some different models of the 'Compex' available; one of these included a smaller console module named the F760-N. This version was built without the expander/gate, it later had an expander/gate added and was then known as the F760X-N. There is also a rare version called F760X-RS/T. One of the visible differences are the VU-meters, which got the brand [...] "Audio & Design Recording LTD." [...] and if you look on the rear, there you can see the type.The [...] "T" [...] stands for transformer, which are said to add harmonics to the sound.The [...] "T" [...] version was mainly used in broadcasting stations, mainly because of its SNR and headroom. ADR also built an F760 version for the Helios mixing consoles.|$|E

A range of strategies by which EV charging and electrified heating could be controlled in order to minimise household peak demands were tested including off-peak load shifting, fast and slow vehicle charging, demand limited charging and heating, and bi-directional battery operation. The simulation results indicate that in all cases, electrical energy use was more than doubled compared to a base case with no EV or electric heating. The peak demand also increased substantially. The most effective strategy to limit peak demand, whilst also minimising the impact on end user comfort and EV availability, was to control the heat pump operation and vehicle charging using a demand limit, this restricted the rise in absolute peak demand to 46 % above that of the base case.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT In this work we present a method to achieve loudness enhancement of an audio mixture by using relative po-larities in a multi-track context in order to reduce crest factor 1. To our knowledge, this is a novel perspective, 1 It is widely accepted that loudness perception correlates with a signal’s root mean square (RMS) value, while peak value has little bearing. This means that a signal with a lower peak-to-RMS level (usu-ally termed crest factor) will be louder than a counterpart with a larger but there are several approaches that address polarity in a multi-track context (but not for loudness optimization) and many works that focus on crest factor minimization, normally to enhance loudness (but do so based on mixed signals, rather than multi-track content). In this section we will briefly review these past approaches. One should note that the use of polarity during the mix-value, if peak values are made equal...|$|E

Fracture is the consequence of two concurrent physical phenomena. On one side, a low permeability material does not allow a fast fluid pressure diffusion, therefore high pressures concentrate in a limited region in the neighborhood of the injection point, leading to a concentrated damage for the material. On the other side a high permeability material facilitates the diffusion of the fluid pressure on a larger volume and the reduction of the pressure <b>peaks,</b> <b>limiting</b> the extension of the damage.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether South African free to air television and radio broadcast audio contains loudness fluctuations that fall outside previously determined limits of listener comfort. This is a relevant aim as consumers often complain about loudness fluctuations in broadcast audio (e. g. “why are the commercials so loud?”). Loudness is an inherently subjective phenomenon that is not only subject to differences in human perception from day to day, but also more specifically by the frequency content, localisation, spatialisation and duration of the audio stimulus. Traditional audio level meters only measure the audio signal or digital samples, and do not take any of these psychoacoustic phenomena into consideration. Broadcast audio has traditionally been regulated by specifying the permitted maximum level (PML) of the signal to avoid overloading the transmitter or over- modulation the broadcast signals. While this is necessary to keep the transmission inside the technical dynamic range of the medium, it does not correspond to the perceived loudness of these signals. With the addition of power dynamic range processing techniques, content producers and broadcasters were now able to raise the average level (and correspondingly the perceived loudness) without affecting the permitted maximum level or the peak level of the signal. Broadcasts were still compliant, but subjectively louder. As this process has not been done uniformly across various stations, and various types of audio, fluctuations occur both between stations, and between different segments on the same station. These fluctuations are the cause of listener complaints. There has been a move in international regulators and broadcasters to make a paradigm shift from peak normalisation to loudness normalisation of broadcast audio content. Limited, to no adoption, of this new paradigm in South African broadcasting is evident. This study provides baseline data of the status quo of South African free to air broadcast audio to investigate whether it contains problematic fluctuations, and therefore whether a move from peak to loudness normalisation could possibly have a positive effect. The study found that generally radio broadcasts suffered from greater and more problematic loudness fluctuations compared to television. Televisions broadcasts differed enough from station to station to cause inter-station loudness fluctuations outside previously determined limits for listener comfort, but not intra-station fluctuations. SABC 2 was found to be the loudest and SABC 3 the softest at this particular testing high-site. Radio broadcasts contained a large proportion of inter-station fluctuations, and while it varied considerably from station to station, each station contains some proportion of intra-station fluctuations. Advertisements were found not to be the loudness programme segment type. It was found that the following segments types were generally the softest to the loudest: talking, advertisements, links (interstitials) and music. Ikwekwezi FM was found to be the loudest station by far, with Lotus FM the softest, with a very wide difference of 13. 7 LU between their integrated station loudness values. The vast majority of broadcast audio was found to have a loudness range appropriate to the intended platform, but perhaps limited to the range appropriate the lowest common denominator, resulting in signals with high to extreme levels of dynamic compression and <b>peak</b> <b>limiting.</b> The study also provided much greater levels of detail of the nature and extent of all loudness fluctuations, especially for radio loudness data. Additionally, ‘zap testing’ methodology was tested to simulate real-life inter-station fluctuation scenarios, and also found to be an efficient method for extrapolating overall station loudness for a larger set of stations. Finally, the study recommends the paradigm shift from peak to loudness normalisation for all audio content producers and distributors in the country, and suggests the EBU R 128 recommendation as the most viable starting point.
