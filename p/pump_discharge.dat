50|$|In {{the mineral}} industry, {{or in the}} {{extraction}} of oilsand, froth is generated to separate the rich minerals or bitumen from the sand and clays. Froth contains air that tends to block conventional pumps and cause loss of prime. Over history, industry has developed different {{ways to deal with}} this problem. In the pulp and paper industry holes are drilled in the impeller. Air escapes {{to the back of the}} impeller and a special expeller discharges the air back to the suction tank. The impeller may also feature special small vanes between the primary vanes called split vanes or secondary vanes. Some pumps may feature a large eye, an inducer or recirculation of pressurized froth from the <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> back to the suction to break the bubbles.|$|E
5000|$|The air escapes {{through the}} <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> nozzle whilst the fluid drops {{back down and}} is once more entrained by the impeller. The suction line is thus {{continuously}} evacuated. The design required for such a self-priming feature has an adverse effect on pump efficiency. Also, {{the dimensions of the}} separating chamber are relatively large. For these reasons this solution is only adopted for small pumps, e.g. garden pumps. More frequently used types of self-priming pumps are side channel and water ring pumps. Another type of self-priming pump is a centrifugal pump with two casing chambers and an open impeller. This design is not only used for its self-priming capabilities but also for its degassing effects when pumping twophase mixtures (air/gas and liquid) for a short time in process engineering or when handling polluted fluids, for example when draining water from construction pits.|$|E
50|$|Discharge {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes {{the majority of the}} fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a venturi), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.|$|E

50|$|Water {{from the}} lake is {{routinely}} pumped to municipal consumers via pipeline. The river outlet works, located {{on the east side}} of the dam, handle this function. A separate intake leads to three conduits (each 15 feet m diameter), which terminate in a stilling basin, which has a single pipe leading to the three variable-capacity centrifugal <b>discharge</b> <b>pumps.</b> The <b>pumps</b> <b>discharge</b> into a surge tank at the Atoka Lake, 18 miles km away, via a concrete pipe that is 5 feet m diameter.

50|$|Since {{the output}} {{pressure}} of a centrifugal pump {{varies with the}} square of the speed, pressure can be controlled accurately by controlling the speed of the pump. For example: a pump runs at 1785 RPM during shutoff with an output pressure of 204 PSI and a suction pressure of 0 PSI. If the speed of the motor is reduced by 10% to 1607 RPM, the new output pressure becomes 165 PSI. This in turn enables the Variable Speed Controller to maintain a perfectly flat <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> curve until the full rating of the pump is reached. Further, the variable speed controller adjusts for varying suction pressure - as in the following example: a city water supply of 65 PSI drops to 26 PSI while flowing. The variable speed drive will speed up to adjust for the sudden drop in pressure and slow down again when it is not needed - all the while maintaining a constant total discharge pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Vickers {{pioneered the}} use of common rail {{injection}} in submarine engines. Vickers engines with the common rail fuel system were first used in 1916 in the G-class submarines. It used four plunger pumps to deliver a pressure of up to [...] every 90 degrees of rotation to keep the fuel pressure adequately constant in the rail. Fuel delivery to individual cylinders could be shut off via valves in the injector lines. Doxford Engines used a common rail system in their opposed-piston marine engines from 1921 to 1980, where a multi-cylinder reciprocating fuel pump generated a pressure of approximately , with the fuel being stored in accumulator bottles. [...] Pressure control was achieved {{by means of an}} adjustable <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> stroke and a [...] "spill valve". Camshaft-operated mechanical timing valves were used to supply the spring-loaded Brice/CAV/Lucas injectors, which injected through the side of the cylinder into the chamber formed between the pistons. Early engines had a pair of timing cams, one for ahead running and one for astern. Later engines had two injectors per cylinder, and the final series of constant-pressure turbocharged engines were fitted with four injectors per cylinder. This system was used for the injection of both diesel oil and heavy fuel oil (600cSt heated to a temperature of approximately 130 °C).|$|E
