5000|$|The first Nelson-Bowlus glider was the Nelson Bumblebee with a pod-and-boom {{fuselage}} two-seat <b>powered</b> <b>sailplane</b> NX1955. The Bumblebee in 1945-46 {{was built}} with a Righter O-45 16-hp four-cylinder engine. The prototype Bumblebee had a fully retractable tricycle landing gear, operated manually by the pilot. The nose gear was steerable with miniature shimmy dampeners and a lock. The rear wheels {{had a special}} cam action {{so that they could}} be tucked away in the fuselage at the proper angle. The rear wheels also had independent internally expanding brakes, designed by Bowlus, which facilitated taxiing on the ground. The high pitch sound of the engine caused Bowlus and Nelson to name it the [...] "Bumblebee." [...] A three-gallon gas tank fed the pusher type engine allowing it to fly {{for an hour and a}} half under full throttle, cruising at 75 mph. Tests were made which determined the engine was under-powered, producing about 16 horsepower at 3500 rpm, not enough for adequate flight, although Bowlus claimed it would climb 300 feet per minute to an altitude suitable for soaring. The men decided to build a suitable engine of their own design from scratch that was used for the later production models. Their new motor generated 25 horsepower, just enough power for takeoff and a slow climb.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{objective}} was to design an unmanned aerial vehicle that was capable of stable, autonomous flight. A fixed wing aircraft was chosen to simplify some of the flight characteristics and avoid some of the challenges found in rotary wing machines. Two aircraft were tested: a large and heavy gasoline powered aircraft and a smaller and much lighter electric <b>powered</b> <b>sailplane.</b> An autopilot was implemented into both platforms that would fly the aircraft and allow the measurement of flight vehicle characteristics. A link with the vehicle was created by installing a radio modem that allowed communication between the autopilot and a ground computer. This allowed updates to the controllers PID feedback loops to change flight characteristics and made the recording of flight parameters possible. This would be useful later {{in the analysis of}} data. To control the vehicle remotely, a ground computer was used that ran systems monitoring software. It also allowed the programming of flight plans to the autopilot. Combining these systems together proved successful and stable flight was achieved in both aircraft. By using the same autopilot in both vehicles, it wa...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{and dynamic}} soaring are two {{techniques}} commonly used by birds to extract {{energy from the}} atmosphere. This enables them to reduce, energy used during flight and increases their endurance. The thermal soaring technique involves extraction of energy from thermal updrafts and in dynamic soaring energy is extracted from wind shear. These techniques are investigated in this thesis using point mass and non-linear 6 DoF models of an unmanned <b>powered</b> <b>sailplane.</b> The key challenges of autonomous thermal soaring are the ability to identify remote thermal activity using on-board sensors and to position correctly in a thermal. In dynamic soaring, a real-time fuel saving trajectory generation technique along with a trajectory following control system is needed. A hand held IR camera {{was used to assess}} the feasibility to observe hot spots associated with thermals. The thermal positioning capability was demonstrated in a 6 DoF model using a positioning algorithm. The inverse Dynamics Virtual Domain (IDVD) technique was used to generate real-time trajectories for dynamic soaring applications using a point mass model of a powered unmanned sailplane and the fuel saving trajectories were validated using a high fidelity 6 DoF model and a classical controller. An important outcome of the research is the fact that energy saved during dynamic soaring flight was also realized due to a sinusoidal manoeuvre using reduced thrust. In this manoeuvre the kinetic energy is converted into potential energy by gaining altitude and by reducing airspeed. Then initial values of altitude and speed are gained by loosing the altitude. In this process a horizontal distance is travelled by using reduced thrust. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
