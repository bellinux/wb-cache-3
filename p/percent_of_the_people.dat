5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already been spent on buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E
5|$|The Eichmann Sonderkommando was a {{task force}} headed by Adolf Eichmann that arrived in Budapest on 19 March 1944, {{the same day that}} Axis forces invaded Hungary. Their task was to take a direct role in the {{deportation}} of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The SS-Sonderkommandos enlisted the aide of antisemitic elements from the Hungarian gendarmerie and pro-German administrators from within the Hungarian Interior Ministry. Round-ups began on 16 April, and from 14 May, four trains of 3,000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres from the gas chambers. Between 10 and 25 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> on each train were chosen as forced laborers; the rest were killed within hours of arrival. Under international pressure, the Hungarian government halted deportations on 6 July 1944, by which time over 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had died.|$|E

25|$|Members of {{the group}} call {{themselves}} Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five {{percent of the world}} in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest.|$|E
25|$|The skyrocketing {{inflation}} was a hardship on {{the few people}} who had fixed incomes—but 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages were usually in arrears and declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships of their families.|$|E

25|$|In March 1944, Germany {{occupied}} Hungary which {{extended the}} Holocaust into that country. Wiesel was 15, and he with his family, {{along with the}} rest of the town's Jewish population, were placed in one of the two confinement ghettos set up in Máramarossziget (Sighet), the town where he had been born and raised. In May 1944, the Hungarian authorities, under German pressure, began to deport the Jewish community to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where up to 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were exterminated on arrival.|$|E
25|$|There are 52 {{languages}} and dialects in the province, with Tagalog being spoken {{by more than}} 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> Languages native to the islands are Cuyonon (26.27 percent), and Palawano (4.0 percent). Hiligaynon is also present at 19 percent. Before mass immigration to Palawan by various groups of people from Southern Tagalog, Illocandia, and Central Luzon, Cuyonon was an established lingua franca amongst many of it's native peoples, i.e. the Agutaynen, Cagayanen, Tagbanua, Palawan, and others. The usage of Cuyonon significantly dropped during {{the approach of the}} new millenium being replaced by the now majority Tagalog.|$|E
25|$|Islam, {{which came}} after Hinduism, {{strengthened}} the status structure of this traditional religious pattern. More than 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Java are Muslims, {{on a broad}} continuum between abangan (more traditional) and santri (more modernist). The Muslim scholar of the writ (Kyai) became the new religious elite as Hindu influences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal priesthood, but the Dutch colonial government established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese pesantren (Islamic schools), The Kyai perpetuated {{the tradition of the}} resi. Students around him provided his needs, even peasants around the school.|$|E

25|$|Public {{support for}} the strike was {{relatively}} strong. Unscientific polls of commuters by newspapers and television stations showed {{support for the}} train drivers. A scientific poll conducted by Infratest Dimap for the public-service broadcaster ARD found that 61 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> support the workers. Of 1,003 people surveyed, 47 percent said Deutsche Bahn was {{to blame for the}} strike, while only 25 percent fingered GDL. Nevertheless, the ARD poll found that public support for the union had slipped by five percentage points since mid-October. A second poll for the public opinion company Forsa for the newspaper Bild showed only 45 percent of the public supported GDL.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 1970, the {{municipal}} council voted {{to establish a}} limited company to finance the bridge. Askøybrua AS was founded with a share capital of NOK775,000 and owned by {{the municipal}}ities of Askøy, Laksevåg, Åsane, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, Hordaland County Municipality and Rutelaget Askøy–Bergen—the latter who operated all the islands bus routes and the ferry. During the council meeting, representatives for the municipal administration commented that 85 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> from Askøy who worked outside the municipality worked in the city center of Bergen; they were transported quickly with ferries which were not hampered by congestion. Should a bridge be built, {{it would only be}} able to be financed if people traveled using the bridge, and therefor terminating the ferry, even though it provided a superior service, was proposed.|$|E
25|$|The {{bystander}} {{effect was}} first {{demonstrated in the}} laboratory by John M. Darley and Bibb Latané in 1968 after they {{became interested in the}} topic following the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most replicable effects in social psychology. In a typical experiment, the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates. An emergency situation is staged and researchers measure how long it takes the participants to intervene, if they intervene. These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping, often by a large margin. For example, Bibb Latané and Judith Rodin (1969) staged an experiment around a woman in distress. 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt, but when there were other people in the room only 40 percent offered help.|$|E

25|$|By November 1985 {{the first}} {{category}} - the larger cities and approximately 20 percent of the counties (mainly in the more developed coastal and southeastern areas of China) had achieved universal 9-year education. By 1990 cities, economically developed areas in coastal provincial-level units, and {{a small number of}} developed interior areas (approximately 25 percent of China's population) and areas where junior middle schools were already popularized were targeted to have universal junior-middle-school education. Education planners had envisioned that by the mid-1990s all workers and staff in coastal areas, inland cities, and moderately developed areas (with a combined population of 300 million to 400 million people) would have either compulsory 9-year or vocational education and that 5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in these areas would have a college education - building a solid intellectual foundation for China.
