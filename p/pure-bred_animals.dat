40|$|Frequencies of polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171 of the {{prion protein}} (PrP) gene were studied in 1207 {{pure-bred}} and cross-bred Italian Biellese rams, a small ovine breed of about 65 000 head in Italy. Aside {{from the five}} most common alleles (VRQ, ARQ, ARR, AHQ and ARH), the rare ARK allele was also found, with the highest frequency reported so far in an ovine breed (2 · 5 %). ARK/ [...] - genotypes had a total frequency of 4 · 9 %. The resistance-associated ARR allele was seen at a low frequency (8 · 3 %). Only 1 · 4 % of animals examined had a resistant ARR/ARR PrP genotype. Semi-resistant (ARR/ARQ, ARR/ARH and ARR/AHQ) PrP genotypes had a total frequency of 12 · 6 % and PrP genotypes {{that are associated with}} high scrapie susceptibility (e. g. VRQ/VRQ and ARQ/ARQ) had a total frequency of 81 · 1 %. Statistical analysis comparing PrP allele frequencies between <b>pure-bred</b> and cross-bred <b>animals</b> showed that the ARR allele occurred at a significantly lower frequency in pure-bred rams. Furthermore, comparison of PrP allele frequencies between pure-bred rams over 18 months of age and those below 18 months of age showed a significant decrease in the ARR allele in breeding rams over 18 months of age. Based on these results, breeding for scrapie resistance in the Biellese breed will {{have to take into account}} the low frequency of the ARR allele, which also seems to be subject to negative selection by farmers. Further investigation is required to understand whether the ARK allele is also associated with resistance to transmissible spongiform encephalopathie...|$|R

50|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{testing of}} the Custer State Park herd have shown that 6% of the animals have bovine DNA traits and Dr Derr from Texas A&M University, who lead a study into bison genetics, conceded that the ‘hybrid’ animals tested were at least 15-20 generations from the {{original}} base stock and those animals contained only 0.003% bovine DNA. This herd was started in 1901 with {{a relatively small number}} of animals (<30). At the time, all these animals were believed to be pure through analysis of the physical phenotype but at least one animal with some bovine DNA must have been included in the original herd. Since the herd was formed, no new animals have been introduced and in this closed genetic pool, bovine DNA influences have not exceeded 6%, despite numerous generations of animals having passed. It is not yet known why this bovine DNA has not influenced a greater proportion of the herd nor a higher percentage of bovine DNA having survived, but one theory is that <b>pure-bred</b> <b>animals</b> with bovine influence do not grow to be as competitive as full-blood animals and are less likely to become dominant herd bulls. Therefore, the hybrid animals bulls are less likely to reproduce in the wild than pure animals, limiting the spread of bovine DNA within the herd.|$|E
40|$|The {{dairy farmers}} in Iran {{are faced with}} milk price {{distortion}} due to the market imperfection. To measure an unbiased farm-specific efficiency, prices should be adjusted in an imperfect market. To examine this issue, a shadow-price profit frontier was applied {{to a sample of}} 860 Iranian small intensive dairy farms surveyed in 2005 - 06 in order to calculate profit efficiency of individual dairy farmers. This adjusted measure was then compared with that of unadjusted measure that assumes undistorted market. A multiple general linear model (GLM) technique was applied to the data to examine the multiple effects of <b>pure-bred</b> <b>animals,</b> and the used farm capacity on profit efficiency indices. The mean value of adjusted profit efficiency was 0. 40, significantly different from the latter measure, i. e. 0. 72, revealing overstating efficiency by ignoring imperfect structure of market. The difference between the figures is attributed to an index of market efficiency that was estimated of 46 % in average. The number of <b>pure-bred</b> <b>animals</b> in the herd was found to affect the profit efficiency indices. Regardless of their characteristics, all the farms can gain from correcting the distortion in milk market, where small and average- sized farms are domain farms in the country. profit efficiency, dairy farms, Iran, Agribusiness, Livestock Production/Industries, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods, C 31, N 55, Q 12,...|$|E
40|$|In April of 1961 an {{outbreak}} of a severe and frequently fatal respiratory disease was observed among swine on a farm belonging to the O'Grady brothers 1 near La Plata, Argentina. Outbreaks of respiratory disease occurring {{at the same time}} in swine on two other O'Grady farms were not observed personally, but were stated to be similar to the one seen. A total of some 4000 swine were distributed on the three separate farms and during a period of about 5 weeks approximately 260 of the animals died. Most of the deaths were among animals weighing 50 to 115 pounds, but a small number of adult hogs also succumbed. Deaths occurred among both cross-bred and <b>pure-bred</b> <b>animals,</b> and among both hog cholera-vaccinated and unvaccinated swine. The outbreak seen was observed at a time when it had either almost run its course or when an effective therapy had been at last instituted. The seemingly successful treatment was a terramycin preparation known as TM 10 (Chas. Pfizer and Company, Inc., New York), which was fed to the swine in the proportion of 500 gm of TM 10 to each 150 kg of ground grain. In individua...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to monitor and {{evaluate}} the impact of internal factors on the production and quality of milk in a herd of montbeliarde cattle. The hypothesis was that worse results of reproduction adversely affect milk production. Data collection took place on a farm Osičky agricultural company Agrodružstvo Lhota pod Libčany for the period from 1. 1. 2010 to 31. 12. 2015. The file was obtained 1 849 standard lactations completed in this period. The source of data for evaluation of milk production, milk quality and reproductive performance of cows were cards, program Farmsoft from Farmtec used to herd management and output data from the inspections {{carried out by the}} utility Chovservis Inc. residing in Hradec Kralove. A statistically highly significant difference (P 0, 05), based on correlations may have an adverse effect on the percentage of fat and protein at a higher incidence of mastitis expected. The influence of the proportion of blood Montbeliarde breed was statistically proven only on the amount of milk and protein in kg per lactation, but still <b>pure-bred</b> <b>animals</b> came out the best in all of the indicators except for milk production fat percentage. From comparison of the calving showed that his herd performance increases every year, the quality of milk as the fat content in % but conversely decreases. For the month of calving has been shown to influence the percentage of fat and protein at a significance level of P< 0, 001, the quantity of milked milk (P< 0, 01) and the amount of produced protein in kg per lactation (P< 0, 05). The hypothesis that impaired reproduction results negatively affecting milk production has not been confirmed. It was found to influence reproduction indicators on production and quality of milk, but this influence in a positive direction. The negative effect was demonstrated only for the length of the interim influence on protein content in %. Overall, the level of flock assessed as very good, but there are many indicators of production and reproduction that is necessary with respect to the potential of improving the breed...|$|E
