40|$|Model Predictive Control (MPC) has {{recently}} found wide acceptance {{in the process}} industry, but the existing design and implementation methods are restricted to linear process models. A chemical process involves, however, severe nonlinearity which cannot be ignored in practice. This paper aims to solve this nonlinear control problem by extending MPC to nonlinear models. It develops an analytical framework for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), and also offers a third-order Volterra series based nonparametric nonlinear modelling technique for NMPC design which relieves <b>practising</b> <b>engineers</b> from the need for first deriving a physical-principles based model. An on-line realisation technique for implementing the NMPC is also developed. The NMPC is then applied to a Mitsubishi Chemicals polymerisation reaction process. The results show that this nonlinear MPC technique is feasible and very effective. It considerably outperforms linear and low-order Volterra model based methods. The advantages of the approach developed lie not only in control performance superior to existing NMPC methods, but also in relieving <b>practising</b> <b>engineers</b> from the need for deriving an analytical model and then converting it to a Volterra model through which the model can only be obtained {{up to the second}} order...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{a subject}} of education, Ethics in Engineering is very {{different}} from other topics in engineering curricula. Students find it difficult to see how an ethics course could improve their engineering skills. Therefore, {{it is important to keep}} the ethics courses closely connected with their engineering education. One practical approach that might stimulate the interest of students is to start with practical questions. Why should we be interested in professional ethics? Who benefits and how from there being a high ethical level in the engineering profession? These ‘phenomenological ’ questions immediately lead to important practical aspects of professional ethics that should not be ignored by any <b>practising</b> <b>engineer.</b> The students can realise that professional ethics is not just academic interest in eternal religious or metaphysical concepts but part of the hard core of the profession. Following this idea, an introductory course on professional ethics can be started with the observation that, for a respectable profession, ethical and moral legitimacy is as important as the scientific basis of knowledge and skills. This is why, in the 19 th century, the first codes of conduct were written. In the turmoil of today’s global business world, a high level of professional morality is more important than ever...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} a rigid {{foundation}} resting near a slope or cut is a problem commonly experienced in engineering practice. Some of the major examples of this problem include mobile phone towers, bridge abutments and basement construction of high [...] rise buildings. This project illustrates the use of explicit finite difference software (FLAC) to analyse the behaviour exhibited by the slope due to loading. The purpose {{of this research was}} to create a comprehensive set of design charts for the footing on slope problem. These design charts use nondimensional axes in order to allow the <b>practising</b> <b>engineer</b> to better visualise trends that exist due to the various dimensions of the problem. The FLAC model used to obtain results for use in the design charts was validated against a number of available solutions. These included Upper Bound [...] Lower Bound, and physical model solutions. Extensive parametric studies were conducted into the effect of the H/B, D/B, Strength, Surcharge and Stability Number Ratios. A number of illustrated examples were prepared to enable easy use of the design charts created for this project. These allow the user to learn the skills necessary to obtain the bearing capacity of a given footing on slope using the design charts. These examples increase the value of the design charts to practicing engineers greatly. In addition to the studies conducted for the smooth foundation case, used for creating the design charts, analysis into the case of a rough soil [...] footing interface was conducted. The results from this analysis were that the smooth soil-foundation interface case is conservative and provides a lower bearing capacity than the rough soil-foundation interface cas...|$|E
40|$|Major {{earthquakes}} {{are rare}} in Switzerland; {{but when they}} occur the consequences can be disastrous. Comparative {{studies have shown that}} {{over a longer period of}} time the seismic risk is the most important natural risk in Switzerland. So far only rough estimates could be made, more precise statements on the actual seismic risk in a certain city or city quar-ter with a certain building population are not available. For this reason the Swiss Seis-mological Service (SED) and the Institute of Structural Engineering (IBK) launched a joint project “Earthquake Scenarios for Switzerland ” with the goal to elaborate risk sce-narios. For that purpose the effect of an earthquake on actual existing buildings has to be known. In the present doctoral thesis a method is developed which allows the assessment of the seismic vulnerability of a larger number of existing buildings using an engineering ap-proach, but which at the same time requires only a limited time expenditure. Unrein-forced masonry buildings and reinforced concrete buildings as well as combinations of those two building types are dealt with and five different damage grades according to the European Macroseismic Scale are defined. One focal point is the evaluation of unrein-forced masonry buildings. The application of this new method to 87 two- to six-storey buildings in a small target area in Basel shows, that for a seismic input according to the Swiss Standard SIA 160 (return period of 400 years) more than half of the buildings are expected to be very heavily damaged or destroyed. With this thesis the development of a very efficient method has been achieved which is orientated towards the <b>practising</b> <b>engineer.</b> In addition this new method suggests to think about the improvement of the existing procedures for the seismic design of new unrein-forced masonry buildings...|$|E

40|$|Even {{though many}} major {{industrial}} companies are embracing the concepts {{and principles of}} sustainable development (SD) and sustainability, {{the challenge of the}} applying these in a practical sense, either in plant design or as part of day-to-day operations, is not trivial. The high-level nature of sustainable development concepts and principles, such as the ICMM 10 sustainable development principles[1], do not translate easily into workable activities, making it difficult for the <b>practising</b> <b>engineer</b> to understand whether his or her actions or decisions are making a contribution, or even in accord, with the goals of sustainable development. Recognising these serious shortcomings, the Co-operative Research Centre for Sustainable Resource Processing (CSRP) has undertaken a major research project to address these deficiencies in the current design and operation of industrial processing plants. There is, in fact, a wide range of opportunities that can contribute to Sustainable Development (SD) throughout the conceptualisation, development, operation and eventual decommissioning of industrial projects. While several organisations have their own SD tools that can, to a degree, help identify these opportunities, they are largely ad hoc and lack the necessary thoroughness to defensibly value these opportunities. The key goal of the CSRP research project is to produce a holistic, systematic and rigorous process to capture, record and evaluate SD opportunities against a chosen sustainability framework (e. g. five capitals or triple bottom line). This mechanism is called SUSOP® (Sustainable Operations) and is being developed through an iterative process, with significant interest, encouragement and input from industry players involved in both the operational and design phases of resource processing projects. This paper presents an overview of the SUSOP® development process, focusing on its capability to incorporate SD considerations at each phase of an engineering project development...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A set of finite element computer programs has been written for the settlement analysis of structures founded on normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soft clays. The programs take into account nonlinear material stress-strain behaviour and creep. Analyses may assume 'undrained' and 'drained' conditions and fully coupled consolidation analyses are also possible. The 'modified' Cam clay model has been used with some modification to model nonlinear material stress-strain behaviour and a phenomenological creep relationship to model creep behaviour. The author's programs have been-tested against another, fully tested, finite element package and also against closed form solutions where they exist. Sensitivity {{of the results of}} creep analyses in response to possible variations in the determination of the values of the creep parameters has also been studied. Results of a combined creep and consolidation analysis of a flexible strip footing. indicate the relative importance of creep displacements with respect to the consolidation settlements which are difficult to separate in practice. A review is made of the main nonlinear models of soil behaviour available to the <b>practising</b> <b>engineer.</b> The main techniques within the finite element method that are used to implement such nonlinear soil models are also reviewed and the 'initial strain' method chosen for use in the computer programs developed. The author's programs have been used to calculate displacements and excess pore pressures resulting from the construction of a trial embankment built at Cubzac-les-Ponts in France and compared to the measured in-situ values. In the conclusions an appraisal is made of the soil model developed by the author and the nonlinear finite element solution technique used. Also, the results of analyses using the computer programs and the accuracy {{of the results of the}} analyses of the trial embankment are summarised. The author's computer programs are explained and listed in the form of appendices...|$|E
