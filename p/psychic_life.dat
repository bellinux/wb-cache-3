25|$|In 1905, Sigmund Freud {{presented}} {{his theory of}} psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses. In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of <b>psychic</b> <b>life,</b> and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{title of the}} mystery (Ten Little Niggers) has long been abandoned as offensive in English-speaking countries {{and a number of}} others. Some critics have opined that Christie's {{original title}} and the setting on [...] "Nigger Island" [...] (later changed to [...] "Indian Island" [...] and [...] "Soldier Island", variously) may be integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, argues Alison Light, [...] "could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate." [...] Unlike novels such as Heart of Darkness, [...] "Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatised, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into <b>psychic</b> <b>life</b> as early as the nursery. If her story suggests {{how easy it is to}} play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Freud's {{analysis}} {{of the dynamics of}} Life and Death was mistaken, according to Brown, since Freud's discovery of the ultimate identity of the two instincts implied that there is no necessary antagonism between Eros and Thanatos: they exist in harmony at a deeper level of <b>psychic</b> <b>life</b> and aggression was therefore not inevitable. Brown believed that the death instinct need not be externalized in the form of aggression if [...] "men could recapture the original undifferentiated harmony of Life and Death." [...] Brown therefore {{called for an end to}} the [...] "repression of death" [...] that perpetuated aggression. People had to learn [...] "how to die" [...] or, more concretely, to learn [...] "how to grow old." [...] Robinson calls Brown's argument [...] "daring", and stresses that it is a very different solution to the problem of aggression than that proposed by Marcuse, since it was a psychological solution that involved adopting a new attitude toward death and did not involve political or economic revolution. Robinson compares Brown and Marcuse's treatment of Reich: both criticize him for [...] "misrepresenting the problem of repression as one of genital sexuality" [...] and advocated polymorphous perversity instead, but Brown again provided an exclusively psychological argument.|$|E

Never was a more satisfactory Sending. On the next day there were no kittens, and the next day and all the other days were kittenless and quiet. The people murmured and looked to the Old Man of the Mountains for an explanation. A letter, written on a palm-leaf, dropped from the ceiling, but every one except Lone Sahib felt that letters were not what the occasion demanded. There should have been cats, there should have been cats,--full-grown ones. The letter proved conclusively {{that there had been a}} hitch in the Psychic Current which, colliding with a Dual Identity, had interfered with the Percipient Activity all along the main line. The kittens were still going on, but owing to some failure in the Developing Fluid, they were not materialised. The air was thick with letters for a few days afterwards. Unseen hands played Gluck and Beethoven on finger-bowls and clock-shades; but all men felt that <b>Psychic</b> <b>Life</b> was a mockery without materialised Kittens. Even Lone Sahib shouted with the majority on this head. Dana Da's letters were very insulting, and if he had then offered to lead a new departure, there is no knowing what might not have happened.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to know emotion {{regulation}} {{strategies and}} religious coping of inmates in Clas II A women’s prison of Bulu Semarang. Staying at detention center or prison definitely makes someone stress and automatically influences to their social <b>life,</b> health-physics, and <b>psychic.</b> Moreover for new inmates (unrecidivist), the {{effect can be}} worse. The new athmosphere of the jail can make them feel meaningless, useless, bore, and give up. It means they get both of physics and psychology punishment. Therefore the inmates {{should be able to}} control their emotion and be adaptive in their ‘new live’. This ability is called emotion regulation. Surely, the good ability will help them to face many kinds of stressors in their life. This study describes emotion regulation strategies and religious coping of women inmates because as known in most of the society, the women are more sensitive than the men. The method of this research is qualitative. The Informants of this study are inmates of Clas II A women’s prison of Bulu Semarang which taken by random system. The researcher finds that the inmates will be easier to face stressors if they have good-emotion regulation, such as having positive thinking and controlling their attitude and feeling. But if they can not regulate their emotion well, they will be easy to feel anxiety, depression and distress. They are also will be more aggresive. In another hand, if they choose to use positive religious coping when they are in difficulty that they will be closer to Allah, belief, calmness and optimistic facing their future. While the other inmates who have lower religious, or they do not believe in God and His help, they will be easy to feel worry, depression, aggressive, thankless, unsatisfied to Allah and the scholar suggestion, so their quality of <b>life,</b> <b>psychic</b> and social <b>life</b> are worse than the first party...|$|R

These beautiful and inspiring teachings are extraordinarily pure, for these times, and given directly by the most spiritually advanced beings, which is extremely rare. The teachings are not a religion but are presented for all people, regardless of their beliefs, in a down-to-earth, clear, and simple way. They address truth, spiritual laws, love, responsibility, spiritual progress, <b>psychic</b> phenomena, <b>life</b> on earth and in the spirit realms, and many related subjects.

40|$|Psychosocial {{studies is}} a putatively ‘new’ or {{emerging}} field {{concerned with the}} irreducible relation between <b>psychic</b> and social <b>life.</b> Genealogically, it attempts to re-suture a tentative relation between mind and social world, individual and mass, internality and externality, norm and subject, and the human and non-human, through gathering up and re-animating largely forgotten debates that have played out {{across a range of}} other disciplinary spaces. If, as I argue, the central tenets, concepts and questions for psychosocial studies emerge out of a re-appropriation of what have become anachronistic or ‘useless’ concepts in other fields – ‘the unconscious’, for instance, in the discipline of psychology – then we need to think about transdisciplinarity not just in spatial terms (that is, in terms of the movement across disciplinary borders) but also in temporal terms.

In the real world human behaviour also has a psychic aspect. In a typical psychological analysis institutions must promote the integration of different parts of a personality.

40|$|Increasing social {{mobility}} is the ‘principal goal’ of the British Government's social policy (Cabinet Office, 2011 : 5). However, while policy perspectives present mobility as an unambiguously progressive force, {{there is a}} striking absence of studies looking at the impact of mobility on individuals themselves. Drawing on 39 lifecourse interviews with upwardly mobile respondents drawn from the UK Cultural Capital and Social Exclusion Project (CCSE), this paper examines how mobility affects the <b>psychic</b> and emotional <b>life</b> of the individual. More specifically, it examines how mobility influences social, familial and intimate relationships, {{as well as the}} ontological coherence of the self. Following Bourdieu's (2004 : 127) description of his own upward trajectory, the paper argues that the concept of a divided habitus, or habitus clivé, may be particularly useful for understanding some iterations of the contemporary mobility experience, particularly its most long-range forms. Such a concept, it argues, helps explain how the emotional pull of class loyalties can entangle subjects in the affinities of the past, and why – despite prevailing political rhetoric – upward mobility may remain a state that not everyone unequivocally aspires to...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepine anti-anxiety {{agents are}} the most widely {{prescribed}} psychotherapeutic drugs in the United States today. Recent evidence, however, suggests that their use may be decreasing. METHODS: We examine the population prevalence and correlates of use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics at the Duke site of the NIMH-sponsored Epidemiologic Catchment Area project. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis of use patterns for the drugs revealed demographic predictors similar to those reported in previous studies: increased likelihood of use by the elderly, Whites, women, the less educated, and the separated or divorced. Use is also associated with symptoms of <b>psychic</b> distress, negative <b>life</b> events, use of health care services, and diagnoses of affective disorder, agoraphobia with panic, and panic disorder. Age, sex, race, education, and marital status remain associated with non-hypnotic benzodiazepine use in a logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate analyses of these data indicate that when potential confounding factors are controlled, age, sex, race, education, and marital status are significantly related to benzodiazepine anxiolytic use but the effects of sex and education are mediated by intervening variables. Implications of these findings are discussed particularly in relation {{to high levels of}} use in the elderly...|$|R
