5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} purple liquid forming the word 'JANET'. Jackson is then shown {{sitting on top of}} a planet in outer space, wearing a {{bodysuit}} adorned with jewelry, long <b>ponytail,</b> <b>and</b> mask. Various asteroids and dancers mounting planets in black latex attire and helmets are shown. Jackson flips her ponytail, revealing her face as cosmic dust is tossed about. Several dancers leap to other planets as Jackson descends to a cratered surface, performing abstract choreography with two dancers. Jackson jumps to another setting, shown in slow motion as the audio is filtered, landing on a white liquid surface with a crimson atmosphere. Backed by eight dancers, Jackson performs the song's choreography as various objects crash into the liquid. Jackson and the dancers fall into the liquid, with Jackson reemerging in a red catsuit. Jackson then performs a dance routine with six glowing spheres. The final sphere ascends upward as fourteen white liquid objects explode.|$|E

25|$|Fujishima was {{responsible}} for designing eight characters including Ogami and Sakura, along with formal and casual clothes, and accessories. The supporting cast was designed by Hidenori Matsubara. Matsubara also helped with general animation. As the character concepts had been firmly established before the design stage, Fujishima was able to create the characters with ease, creating them so players could easily understand {{what was going through}} their minds. Due to the game's Taishō period setting, Fujishima needed to stop himself from adding anachronistic elements such as fasteners. Hiroi made character sheets for each character, which Fujisaka used to create each character and their various designs, noting Sumire as a character whose personality was communicated through her clothes. Each character had distinct traits, such as a <b>ponytail</b> <b>and</b> hakama kimono for Sakura, so Kujishima simply combined these elements with his own design ideas. The Taishō period meant that Fujishima could combine traditional Japanese clothing with Western accessories such as shoes, allowing the female characters an otherwise improbable range of movement. His design for each main protagonist—from Ogami to the Flower Division members—directly mirrored Hiroi's concepts for them. The Flower Division's battle dress was modeled after tuxedos, and compared by Kujishima with the costumes of the Takarazuka Revue.|$|E

2500|$|Traction {{alopecia}} {{is caused}} by adding too much strain on the hair on one's head. [...] Tight <b>ponytails</b> <b>and</b> other styles that require added tension to the hair are often what cause this disease. [...] It can also occur on the face {{in areas where the}} hair is often styled. Plucking or waxing one's eyebrows frequently, for example, can yield suppressed hair growth in the area.|$|R

500|$|The housemates {{participated in}} a future-related task during week twelve, in which Sophie and Rodrigo learned a robotic dance routine to Daft Punk's song [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" [...] and Lisa and David left the House with {{instructions}} to have photographs taken {{by members of the}} public in front of three London landmarks whilst dressed as aliens. While they were away, the rest of the housemates attempted {{to break out of the}} House and Big Brother responded by reducing the £100,000 prize fund to zero, later announcing that the housemates would be given a chance to win back the money over the course of the next few days. As Siavash refused to nominate, Big Brother allocated his nominations to Charlie and Sophie and Marcus and Siavash were put up for eviction. On Day 85, Siavash accepted the offer of £10,000 towards the prize fund for exchanging his clothes with an outfit provided by Big Brother and the Housemates received a £20 cheque after requesting a mystery prize from the weekly shopping list. Later that day, Marcus rejected Big Brother's offer of £15,000 to shave his <b>ponytail</b> <b>and</b> the group turned down the chance to win £1,500 by swimming 1,500 lengths of the pool. On Day 86, Rodrigo won £6,000 towards the prize fund by correctly guessed the regional locations of three animals after listening to a series of sound effects. Later that day, Marcus was evicted with 64.0% of the public vote.|$|E

40|$|A general {{continuum}} {{theory for}} {{the distribution of}} hairs in a bundle is developed, treating individual fibers as elastic filaments with random intrinsic curvatures. Applying this formalism to the iconic problem of the ponytail, the combined effects of bending elasticity, gravity, and orientational disorder are recast as a differential equation for the envelope of the bundle, in which the compressibility enters through an “equation of state. ” From this, we identify the balance of forces in various regions of the ponytail, extract a remarkably simple equation of state from laboratory measurements of human <b>ponytails,</b> <b>and</b> relate the pressure to the measured random curvatures of individual hairs...|$|R

2500|$|Half-Life {{director}} Gabe Newell {{coined the}} name [...] "Gordon Freeman" [...] during {{a conversation with}} the game's writer Marc Laidlaw in his car. It included a homage to the physicist and philosopher Freeman Dyson. Newell disliked Laidlaw's proposed name, [...] "Dyson Poincaré", which also included the surname of Henri Poincaré. The texture for Gordon's head was [...] "too big of a job for just one person", so Valve designers combined references from four people. An earlier model of Gordon, known as [...] "Ivan the Space Biker", had a full beard that was subsequently trimmed. Other iterations of Gordon's concept featured different glasses, a <b>ponytail,</b> <b>and</b> a helmet.|$|E
2500|$|Some fans {{initially}} {{thought that}} a walker Carol killed {{in the beginning of}} the episode was a zombified Andrea, a major character who was killed off in the third season finale. However, Laurie Holden (who portrayed Andrea) disproved this as did Nicotero, who felt that it would have not been an appropriate conclusion for Andrea and explained that the walker was portrayed by the wife of the director of photography, Michael Satrazemis. Several fans also believed that the crazed man Glenn freed, who was swiftly killed, was Negan, a primary antagonist of the graphic novels, although this was also disproved by Gimple, who noted that Negan does not have a <b>ponytail,</b> <b>and</b> Nicotero, who said: ...|$|E

5000|$|Retro fashion {{refers to}} fashion from 1940-1990. Retro fashion is a {{clothing}} style which consists in wearing clothes {{commonly used in}} the past.

Examples are leather handbags from the 1950s, [...] "bell-bottom jeans", Poodle skirts, big sunglasses, fedoras, funky jackets (commonly Adidas Classics) and shoes, small neckties, chiffon scarves, sport equipment, etc. Makeup may also {{play a part in}} feminine retro fashions, with focal points being heavily-lined eyes and bright red lipstick; hairstyles such as pompadours, <b>ponytails,</b> <b>and</b> ducktails may be adopted, as well as styles that model film stars of the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R

5000|$|An {{illustration}} {{of the lack of}} a single universal Sharia is the fact that its proponents do not agree on one.

2500|$|On February 24, 2010, Dawn Brancheau, {{a female}} 40-year-old trainer with 16 years of {{experience}} at the park, died in another incident involving Tilikum. SeaWorld's head of animal training said that during a rubdown after the show, Tilikum pulled the trainer into the water by her <b>ponytail,</b> <b>and</b> she drowned. Eyewitness trainers and audience members, however, stated that Tilikum dragged her into the water by her left forearm, {{near the end of}} the show. The autopsy report said she died from drowning and traumatic injuries, including removal of her scalp. This was the third time since being first put on public display that Tilikum has been involved in a human death. By February 27, SeaWorld Orlando whale shows resumed with trainers practicing increased caution and not joining the whales in the water. SeaWorld announced they have invited experts from outside marine parks and aquariums to review SeaWorld's handling of killer whales and also Tilikum specifically. On August 23, 2010, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined the park US$75,000 for three infractions, two of which were directly related to this incident. One related citation was designated as [...] "willful" [...] and was [...] "committed with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for employee safety and health". The other related citation was a [...] "serious" [...] violation relating to a missing safety rail at Shamu Stadium. At the time of the fine, SeaWorld called OSHA's findings [...] "unfounded". Later hearings revealed that SeaWorld had concealed an earlier incident when another whale, Ikaika, had bitten a trainer in 2006. During a hearing where SeaWorld continued its challenge of OSHA's findings, former SeaWorld trainer Jeff Andrews - being presented as an expert - stated his opinion that the victim died as a result of a mistake she had made while near the water. He continued that he did not agree that Tilikum showed [...] "aggressive behavior" [...] during the incident. On May 31, 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch cited SeaWorld for two violations in the death of the trainer and fined the company a total of $12,000. The final decision was issued on June 11, 2012.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1970s, {{women have}} worn their {{hair in a}} wide variety of fairly natural styles. In the 1980s, women pulled back their hair with scrunchies, {{stretchy}} ponytail holders made from cloth over fabric bands. Women also often wear glittery ornaments today, as well as claw-style barrettes used to secure <b>ponytails</b> <b>and</b> other upswept or partially upswept hairstyles. Today, women and men can choose from a broad range of hairstyles, but they are still expected to wear their hair in ways that conform to gender norms: in much of the world, men with long hair and women whose hair doesn't appear carefully groomed may face various forms of discrimination, including harassment, social shaming or workplace discrimination. This is somewhat less true of African-American men, who wear their hair in a variety of styles that overlap with those of African-American women, including box braids and cornrows fastened with rubber bands and dreadlocks.|$|R

When her sister was killed by Raven in Escape Velocity by falling on one of Raven's katanas, Verity was bound and gagged and taken captive by Raven, but freed by another unknown H.O.P.E member. She was distorted and tried to avenge her sister by killing Raven, but failed. Although she was killed when she fell from a cable car in Escape Velocity, she was brought back as a half robot half human and she changed her name to Ghost. The scientists at H.O.P.E. enhanced her body by fusing her flesh with cybernetic implants and they made her armor that could not be penetrated by Raven’s katanas. Even with these enhancements, she was eventually killed when Raven cut off her head in Rogue.|$|R
