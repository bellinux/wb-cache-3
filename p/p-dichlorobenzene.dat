Health Concerns Moth repellents are pes�cides used to kill the larvae of clothes moths and/or carpet beetles. These insects lay their eggs on fabric and other tex�les, and when hatched, their larvae feed on organic ma�er trapped within the fibers, chewing away to leave gapping holes in favorite sweaters or clothing.

Reactions of chloroarene complexes (1 a–d) with 2 -alkyl phenylsulphonylacetonitrile (2 a,b) {{in the presence of}} K 2 CO 3 in DMF at room temperature {{led to the formation of}} complexes 3 a–d and 4 a,c,d in good yields. The use of alkylated phenylsulphonylacetonitriles as nucleophiles in the reactions with the <b>p-dichlorobenzene</b> complex (1 e) allowed the formation of the disubstituted complexes (5, 6). Photolytic demetallation provided an efficient {{route to the}} liberation of the arylated phenylsulphonylacetonitriles 7 a–d, 8 a,c,d, 9, and 10. Keywords: chloroarene, phenylsulphonylacetonitrile, nucleophilic substitution...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new, {{simple and}} {{selective}} spectrophotometric method {{has been developed}} for the determination of trace amount of 1, 4 dicholorobenzene (<b>p-dichlorobenzene</b> or PDCB). This method {{is based on the}} formation of golden yellow coloured mixed complex of PDCB with N-PBHA (N-Phenyl benzo hydroxamic acid). The molar absorptivity of PDCB – NPBHA complex in chloroform at the absorption maxima of 443 nm was calculated to be 9. 355 X 105 litre mol- 1 cm- 1. The system obeyed Beer’s law between 0. 0121 – 0. 0512. Most of the foreign ions do not interfere in the proposed method. The method has been successfully applied for the determination of trace analysis of PDCB in industrial waste water with Relative standard deviation was found to be 1. 44 %...|$|E
40|$|The membrane-active {{antibiotic}} valinomycin {{has become}} an important model compound for studying selective ion transport in biological and synthetic membranes. This paper reports results of the first complete Raman spectroscopic study of uncomplexed valinomycin in the solid state. Splittings in the ester and amide C=O stretch regions of valinomycin samples recrystallized from n-octane, CCl 4, CHCl 3, CH 3 (CH 2) 2 Cl, CH 3 COCH 3, or CH 3 CN indicate a structure resembling that obtained by x-ray crystallography. However, valinomycin recrystallized from <b>p-dichlorobenzene</b> and p-dioxane exhibits a considerably different structure. Comparison is made with the Raman spectra of model compounds {{in order to facilitate}} the identification of valinomycin vibrations. These results are extended to valinomycin solutions in an adjoining publication...|$|E
