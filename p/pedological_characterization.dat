40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{provision}} of research information by <b>pedological</b> <b>characterization</b> of soil units of Morogoro District, Tanzania. Three soil units were selected coupled with field reconnaissance survey. Soil pedons were characterized at Kiziwa (KZW-P 1), Mkambarani (MKA-P 1) and Fulwe (FUL-P 1). Pedons were observed to be formed from in-situ weathering of granitic rocks under ustic moisture and iso-hyperthermic temperature regimes. Thirteen soil samples were described and analyzed for physica-chemical and mineralogical properties. KZW-P 1 and FUL-P 1 had red dark brown sandy clay and gravely clay (MKA-P 1) top soils overlaying mainly clayey subsoil. Both pedons indicate clay eluviation-illuviation as a dominant pedogenic process with slightly acidic condition and P< 7 except FUL-P 1 with 23. 8 mg/kg P in top soils. Organic carbon {{is low in}} both pedons while total N is low to very low. CEC values for both pedons are 33. 8, 26. 4 and 27 cmol(+) /kg respectively. CIA values indicates intermediate to strong level of weathering. In USDA Soil Taxonomy and the FAO-UNESCO soil classification system, Soils were classified as: Kiziwa Ultisols (Alisols), and Inceptisols (Cambisols) for Fulwe and Mkambarani, reflecting their differences in potentials and constraints and hence use and management. The results reflects variations in soil characteristics both vertically and laterally so as to account for spatial linkages within the landscape...|$|E

For that was studied the geological, geomorphological, pedological, morphometric, and land use characteristics and the suitability of the basin. The geological and geomorphological features could be obtained through analysis of thematic maps from MINEROPAR. The <b>pedological</b> <b>characterization</b> was generated based on pre-existing data using the software SPRING v. 5. 0. 6. The basin area is about 41. 3 km 2 and is situated on the rocks of the Formação Serra Geral and on the morphostructural subunits Terceiro Plateau do Paraná and the Plateau de Fóz do Iguassu, both members of the Paraná Sedimentary Basin morphostructural unit. The relief predominantly is soft wavy (51, 64 % of the area between 3 and 6 % slope), with altitude ranging from 263 m to 467 m maximum, with an average elevation of 361 m and a width of 204 m. According to the classes of land use identified in the study area, {{it is observed that}} 24, 83 % of total catchment area are earmarked for agriculture, and pasture, forest and urban areas occupy 45, 14 %, 20, 72 %, 9, 31 % of total basin area, respectively. The agricultural suitability of the basin is good most of the basin, reaching a rate of 75 % could be verified concordant of land use. Pages: 1303 - 131...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{environmental}} land characterization {{is essential}} for technical and financial planning, for both the scientific {{point of view and}} technological application. This work aimed at the physiographic and <b>pedological</b> <b>characterization</b> and eucalyptus productivity mapping at Itatinga Forest Sciences Experimental Station (southeastern Brazil), using geographic information systems in order to identify possible cause-effect relationships between forest productivity and soil attributes. The digital cartographic dataset was structured as follows: as primary source of data, aerial photograph and field survey were used and, as a secondary source, topographical, geological and land use occupation maps were used. For mapping wood productivity at age six (MAI 6, Mean Annual Increment), inventory data of permanent plots (same species, provenance and age) were used, which were obtained from Eucalyptus grandis plantations. Using simple linear correlation and backward stepwise multiple regression analysis, the dependent variable (MAI) was related with physical and chemical characteristics of the soils. Two standards of contour curves were identified, one with close curves, narrow and surrounding the drainage network, in the steeper and lower altitude areas; the other, with spaced contour lines, in the areas of higher altitude and with plane relief. Six types of soils were characterized as being highly related to the physiographic patterns of the area: loamy sandy to sandy clayey Typic Hapludox (LVAd, 47. 5 %), clayey Rhodic Hapludox (LVd 1, 33. 4 %), sandy clay Rhodic Hapludox (LVd 2, 6 %), clayey Rhodic Hapludox (LVdf, 9. 1 %), Entisols (G, 3. 4 %) and Fluvents soil (RY, 0. 6 %). There were large variations in wood productivity in the Eucalyptus grandis plantations, characterized in six classes, ranging from 26 to 52 m(3) ha(- 1) yr(- 1). These productivity changes were strictly related to soil mapping units. Through multiple regression analysis, we found that clay and organic matter contents were the attributes which most strongly explained the productivity differences...|$|E

40|$|Near-surface {{heterogeneities}} produce diffractions {{in common}} offset ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{data from the}} Gnangara Groundwater Mound, north of Perth, Western Australia. These diffracted wavefields can be enhanced and show a dispersion pattern if they propagate along a waveguide caused by a low velocity surface layer, such as moist sand on top of dry sand. Until now, GPR waveguide dispersion has been analyzed and inverted using common midpoint data. Using numerical modeling, we demonstrate that the same dispersion information can also be recovered from a diffracted electromagnetic wavefield recorded with common offset geometry. Frequency-slowness analysis of shallow diffractions in common offset GPR field data reveals high resolution dispersion curves. Inverting picked dispersion maxima to modeled curves (i. e., modal wave propagation in waveguide layer) allows estimation of waveguide height and velocities of waveguide and the underlying material. Data analysis in the frequency-wavenumber domain provides an alternative technique for extracting dispersion curves. Preliminary results validate this approach, which could be favorable in large-scale applications due to minimal processing requirement and inherent yet adjustable spatial averaging. The differences between waveguide parameters recovered from two surveys appear {{to be consistent with}} seasonal changes in moisture content and lateral changes due to variations in depositional environment. Our approach presents a new method to quantify the shallow dielectric permittivity structure of the subsurface from common offset gathers—the most commonly acquired type of GPR data. Potential applications of this method include estimation of shallow moisture distribution, early target identification for unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection, concrete slab <b>characterization,</b> <b>pedological</b> investigations, or planetary exploration...|$|R

The assessment of soils corn growth potential has been conducted in four selected pedons namely; Uyole, Mbimba, Inyala and Seatondale. Pedological, physical, chemical characterization and an attempt to develop the pedotransfer functions were done. The {{results show that the}} soils have deep to very deep sola, subangular blocky structures, evidence of pedogenic clay movement, fine to coarse texture, bulk density ranged from 0. 79 to 1. 46 g/cm 3, pH ranged from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline, cation exchange capacity ranged from 16. 0 to 36. 4 cmol (+) /kg, percent base saturation ranged from 20. 3 to 121. 6 %, organic carbon from 0. 13 to 1. 52 % and total N ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 11 %. Extractable P ranged from 0. 71 to 12. 5 mg/kg. Soil classes were Alfisols, Ultisols and Andisols according to USDA Taxonomic classification; and, Luvisols and Paeozems according to FAO world reference base soil classification system. The soils have shown low to medium fertility. Fertilizer application is required to supplement productivity. Three pedotransfer functions were developed for prediction of cation exchange capacity cmol (+) /kg, available water holding capacity (mm/m) and % soil organic carbon using the small data set available. The functions indicated good statistical power, a great potential of using large data set for precise prediction. Corn productivity indices were established through <b>pedological</b> <b>characterization</b> and soil classification that resulted in the following ratings: 72, 56, 62 and 48 for Uyole, Mbimba, Inyala and Seatondale respectively.

"Megalithic biographies”: {{cycles of}} use and closure" of the XVII World UISPP Congress, celebrated in Burgos. Archaeological {{excavations}} carried out in Galicia (NW of Iberia) during the last 15 years, have shown that megalithic barrows had a complex and long-standing life. Not {{only in terms of}} later uses and reuses (something that has been already acknowledged in bibliography since many years) but also in terms of construction and ‘megalithic’ use. Today, we can assume that barrows life was not so simple as: construction, use and abandonment. Rather, barrows could be easily compared, for instance, to Christian churches, that once build up were permanently used and rebuild, their ‘form’ becoming either the expression or the result of a permanent negotiation between social and materialization processes. In this contribution, we review the empirical data from different well characterized barrows, such as Romea (with recognizable phases of rebuilding or use dating to 5920 – 5660 calBP, 5320 – 5030 calBP and 4970 – 4790 calBP) and Forno dos Mouros (with a long time-span punctuated in 6510 - 6300 calBP and 5070 - 4850 calBP). From these data, we propose a hypothetical sequence of specific periods of building, use and rebuilding which we relate to social processes occurring on increasingly complex and progressively more unequal communities, even with changing individual identities. This hypothesis is contrasted with a large collection of C 14 dates of Galician megaliths. Based on this, we propose that the traditional assumption of a continuous monumental activity from ca. 6, 500 to 4, 500 cal. BP should be revised since a discontinuous series of building activity and use is a more likely explanation for the chronologies. Activity seems to have been circumscribed to particular periods of monumental building, interspersed with long periods of inactivity, perhaps not shorter than a few centuries (200 - 300 years). We suggest that this interpretation may also apply to other megalithic European regions. Therefore, the research agenda on Megalithism should incorporate this topic in future investigations as it may demand a change in excavation strategies. In order to reconstruct the formation processes, we propose a methodological approach aiming to implement the techniques of stratigraphic excavation and the chemical and <b>pedological</b> <b>characterization</b> of the sediments in megalithic archaeological contexts. Ultimately, our proposal is to treat barrows as paleoenvironmental archives. N...|$|E
40|$|The {{talk was}} {{given at the}} EU Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) of Geel, where a {{collaboration}} is on going {{for the evaluation of}} Sr isotope abundance ratios in combination with multi-elemental analysis in the framework of the TIPIPAPA project. Apulia, Campania and Sicily are the typical Regions producing early potatoes in Italy; Potatoes produced in these two Regions are characterized by valuable quality and are not only sold in Italy, but also exported in EU (UK and Germany); Agricultural unions asked for the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) labelling of early potatoes from Apulia, Campania and Sicily in order to protect their typical regional products; Authenticity and geographical origin of early potatoes from Apulia and Sicily need to be ensured to avoid frauds. The general aim of TIPIPAPA project is to give an answer to the need of a procedure for characterization and traceability of some early potato varieties from typical production Regions from south Italy. Aim of the research “Soil's mineralogical and geochemical characterization” leaded by Prof. Paola Adamo is to find a pool of soil-related markers which are reliable indicators for south Italy early potato geographical origin in order to avoid frauds. Main research activities are:•	Climatic and <b>pedological</b> <b>characterization</b> of the typical production areas of early potato in Apulia and Sicily•	Chemical, physical, mineralogical and geochemical characterization of soil from the selected production areas•	multi-element and Sr-isotope ratio analyses on soil and potato samples in order to find soil-related indicators of potato's geographical originIn particular we are interested to collaborate with the IRMM of Geel for the evaluation of Sr isotope abundance ratios in combination with multi-elemental analysis as a possible tool to study the geographical origin of early potato. Sr mass fractions in plants are dominated by the Sr isotopic composition of labile cations in the soil, which are themselves influenced by bedrock, soil water properties and atmospheric inputs. Biological processes, whether involved in plant or animal metabolism, seem not to significantly fractionate Sr isotopes. Sr isotope ratios are expected not to undergo seasonal or annual variations. Sr isotope ratio may be a good indicator of geographical origin, provided that different lithologies exist within regions from which plants were cultivated. Mineral and trace metal composition of vegetables {{is a reflection of the}} bioavailable and mobilized elements present in the underlying soils in which plants grow. Mineral and trace element availability, depend on several soil properties (soil pH, humidity, porosity, clay and humic complexes, mineralogy, geochemistry, etc.). Mineral and trace element composition of vegetables may provide unique markers characterizing geographical origin. A single element's concentration or mass fractionation usually is not able to distinguish between samples coming from close regions with similar geological properties. Complementary analytical parameters have to be considered, evaluating isotope ratios for more elements and/or analysing major and trace elements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceModeling soil {{biogeochemical}} processes is in a deadlock due to {{two major}} limitations: 1. Since {{most of the}} biogeochemical processes occur in the soil-water film at surface of solids which compose the hierarchical and aggregated soil structure, coupling biogeochemical models with existing soil water representations is not possible at the process scale without a new paradigm that takes into consideration soil structure and its interaction with soil water. 2. Current <b>pedological</b> mapping and <b>characterization</b> methods do not provide the required soil information and data that are needed for scaling the processes from their scale within the soil to the landscape levels. Such information includes i) delineation of primary soil map units and ii) the functional characteristics which allow for modeling soil internal thermodynamic state that controls the bio and geochemical processes in soil. The new concept of pedostructure and its thermodynamic characterization had lead to a new paradigm for soil water modeling and characterization. This new paradigm provides systematic methodologies for addressing the two challenges introduced above. The physically based soil structure water computer model, Kamel, was built using this paradigm then offers the possibility of 1) coupling disciplinary models (e. g. the organic matter transformation, transport and mineralization) with the soil structure hydro-functioning, at the scale of processes in soil, and 2) integrating results from the local scale in the soil medium to the field scale. In this communication, we present the model Kamel which is available though a dedicated website, along with KamelSoil, a translator of the easily available soil information into pedostructure parameters for Kamel...|$|R
