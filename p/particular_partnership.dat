40|$|The {{notion that}} {{effective}} relationships between groups improve coordination, cooperation and consequently performance has considerable appeal {{in a broad}} range of contexts. In <b>particular,</b> <b>partnerships</b> are viewed as critical organizational mechanisms enabling information systems groups and their clients within organizations to utilize existing information technology investments already in place and to tap the potential offered by information technologies. This paper proposes a theoretical model drawing from socio-cognitive theory, highlighting a convergence in perspectives on key issues between the groups as the mechanism underlying partnerships. Data from a survey of 671 managers on both sides of IS-User relationships in multiple firms provides support for the model and the hypothesized relationship between convergence in perspectives and the performance of IS groups. In particular, the results suggest that a convergent assessment of the perspectives of IS groups by Users significantly enhances the performance of IS groups.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{importance}} of ‘partnership’ and ‘policy networks’ in the new contemporary governance of rural areas. We use these notions to contextualize the representation of, and policy response to the particular issue of homelessness in the rural service centre of Taunton in Somerset. Here <b>particular</b> <b>partnership</b> networks have been brokered by the local authority which bring together {{a wide range of}} business, voluntary and community interests with a stake in the homelessness issue. Strong pre-existing discourses of homelessness in Taunton characterize the issue as one of a town centre problem of ‘beggars, vagrants and drunks’. We offer evidence from the local press to suggest that these discourses have been persistently peddled by particular interests in the town. New forms of partnership were inevitably embroiled with the pursuit of these existing discourses, and contrary voices were unable to redefine existing social relations within policy networks. The evidence from Taunton suggests that where partnership merely involves attempts to repackage existing resources, it seems unlikely that it will fulfil some of the more optimistic claims for a more pluralist form of governance in the local arena...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study {{sought to}} deepen current {{understandings}} of collaboration and lead-ership {{in the context of}} partnerships between diverse universities, schools, and communi-ties. Using a critical epistemological perspective, the project specifically attempted {{to learn more about the}} processes employed by one <b>particular</b> <b>partnership</b> in the Western United States. To inform this process evaluation, the study’s conceptual framework was rooted in tenets of Paulo Freire’s (1970) concept of dialogue. Specifically, the {{study sought to}} reveal the extent to which the Freirean dialogical tenets of humility, faith, hope, and crit-ical thinking were embodied in this collaborative process. Research Methods: Qualitative case study. Data Collection and Analysis: Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 17 participants, 25 observations, and analysis of relevant documents and archival data. After a process of open and axial coding, the findings were deductively analyzed using tenets of Freire’s (1970) dialogue. Findings: The findings suggested that although the partnership’s participants appeared to have intentions that were closely aligned with the tenets of dialogue, various factors inhibited the actual process from evolving as one that was comprehensively dialogical. Conclusions: It is asserted that in educational partnerships between diverse individu-als and organizations, the onus is on those who occupy traditional leadership positions to ensure that equal participative opportunities are afforded to all interested parties.

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new way to rate {{individual}} duplicate bridge players, which we believe is superior to the masterpoint system currently used by the American Contract Bridge League. This method measures only a player’s current skill level, and not how long or how frequently he has played. It is based on simple ideas from the theory of statistics and from linear algebra, and should be easy to implement. One particular issue which can occur within any system proposing to rate individual players using results earned by partnerships is what we call the “nonuniqueness problem”. This refers to the occasional inability for data to distinguish who is the “good player” and who is the “bad player” within <b>particular</b> <b>partnerships.</b> We prove that under our system this problem disappears if either (a) a certain “partnership graph” has no bipartite components, or if (b) every player is required to participate in at least one individual game. Finally, we present some data from a bridge club in Reno, NV. They show that even if (a) and (b) do not hold, our system will provide (unique) ratings for most players...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Conventional natural {{resource}} management {{has struggled with}} effectively addressing dynamically complex {{natural resource}} issues. Many organizations structured in the rational-analytical paradigm of resource management are becoming increasingly aware that new management approaches are needed. Particularly in a rapidly changing environment, organizational learning is important for promoting an organization's ability to adapt and shift to new approaches for natural resource management. The purpose {{of this research was}} to understand what organizational structures and processes inhibit or facilitate opportunities for organizational learning when addressing complex resource problems. Because partnerships are increasingly being employed as a method of organizing in natural resource management, I conducted a comparative case study approach of two resource management partnerships in Oregon's Willamette Valley the Willamette Restoration Initiative and the West Eugene Wetlands. Data were triangulated from three qualitative data sources: interviews, organizational documents, and participant observation. Findings reveal that how the case study partnerships and its members frame complex natural resource issues has a strong influence on organizational learning. In <b>particular,</b> <b>partnership</b> members who frame their work using positive, social, and dynamic orientations foster their ability to continuously learn when addressing issues of dynamic complexity. These individual and group frames promote learning in part through their influence on the development of inclusive, reflective, and place-based organizational processes and organic organizational structures. How individual and group frames are established, maintained, and altered is an important consideration for promoting learning within natural resource management partnerships. Furthermore, organizational learning in these partnerships was comprised of individual learning embedded into partnership routines and memory as well as emergent learning resulting from a process of social construction. Organizational practices directed toward both individual and team learning therefore need to be fostered in natural resource partnerships addressing dynamically complex problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD is to draw {{together}} two very different strands of rural geography, namely: young people and partnerships. Partnerships and young people {{have been the subject}} of growing debate and, although there is interest in both areas, there has been little work carried out that combines the two to date. The aim of this thesis is to address that gap by studying one <b>particular</b> <b>partnership,</b> part of whose remit was to address issues and concerns of the rural young. Young people, despite initiatives such as youth councils, and youth fora, still operate in the shadows of the decision-making process and, as such, do not enjoy full participation; they are occupying a world in which adults still make decisions on their behalf. This is exacerbated by the fact that the decisions that are made are done so from an adult, rather than a young person’s, perspective. Considered from this position all young people, not just those in groups considered to be socially disadvantaged, are excluded by virtue of their youth and their powerlessness in an adult world. Partnerships, that is a group of public, private and voluntary actors working to a shared goal or goals, should have the capacity to overcome this lack of participation, as a significant portion of the partnership rhetoric is based upon integrating voices from the ‘top’ and the ‘bottom’. Hailed as the new form of governance, such collaborative partnerships are being increasingly utilised to deliver goods and services that were previously the exclusive domain of local government. Nevertheless, in their turn, partnerships are also vulnerable to issues of power, conflict and accusations of ineffective working practices. The thesis examines these two disparate groups through a study of one such partnership. However, despite the emphasis on ‘bottom-up’ input, this <b>particular</b> <b>partnership</b> did not have direct representation from the young. This compromised not only its ability to draw young people’s voices into political debate, but also problematised, from a research point of view, the ability to gauge how effective integrative approaches really are. This was overcome by drawing on action research as a methodology which, in effect, situated the researcher between both parties; on the one hand, acting, as far as an adult can, as a ‘voice’ for the young, and on the other, as a researcher, in a position to follow the partnership and gauge the success of integrative approaches to policy-making. Through a combination of focus group discussions and self-completed questionnaires, key findings are: although young people do not see themselves as deprived, they experience exclusion through a paucity of rural services that is exacerbated by their geographical position along a continuum of rurality; young people are not a homogeneous group - although incremental differences in age may be small, the physical and social needs of a 12 year old or a 14 year old are significantly different which, when overlooked by planners, results in the creation of inappropriate facilities; young people exercise power over each other through their own social codes and practices that excludes some groups either socially or spatially; that there is a considerable amount of intergenerational suspicion that is embedded in the cultural practices of adult/child relations. These findings, and more, were reported to the partnership, which, although unable to implement change itself, was able to provide a springboard from which to broadcast the concerns of the young and one particular concern, inadequate transport, was eventually brought into policy recommendations. The results suggest that, although the effectiveness of the partnership was hampered by the fluidity of its membership and the delay in creating a strategic framework, it was its ability to network, during and even post-partnership, that was its greatest strength. The thesis concludes with suggestions for further research...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Health {{systems in}} many low-income {{countries}} remain fragile, {{and the record}} of human resource planning and management in Ministries of Health very uneven. Public health training institutions face the dual challenge of building human resources capacity in ministries and health services while alleviating and improving their own capacity constraints. This paper reports on an initiative aimed at addressing this dual challenge through {{the development and implementation}} of a joint Masters in Public Health (MPH) programme with a focus on health workforce development by four academic institutions from East and Southern Africa and the building of a joint teaching platform. METHODS: Data were obtained through interviews and group discussions with stakeholders, direct and participant observations, and reviews of publications and project documents. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. CASE DESCRIPTION: The institutions developed and collaboratively implemented a ‘Masters Degree programme with a focus on health workforce development’. It was geared towards strengthening the leadership capacity of Health ministries to develop expertise in health human resources (HRH) planning and management, and simultaneously build capacity of faculty in curriculum development and innovative educational practices to teach health workforce development. The initiative was configured to facilitate sharing of experience and resources. DISCUSSION: The implementation of this initiative has been complex, straddling multiple and changing contexts, actors and agendas. Some of these are common to postgraduate programmes with working learners, while others are unique to this <b>particular</b> <b>partnership,</b> such as weak institutional capacity to champion and embed new programmes and approaches to teaching. CONCLUSIONS: The partnership, despite significant inherent challenges, has potential for providing real opportunities for building the field and community of practice, and strengthening the staff and organizational capacity of participant institutions. Key learning points of the paper are: *the need for long-term strategies and engagement; *the need for more investment and attention to developing the capacity of academic institutions; *the need to invest specifically in educational/teaching expertise for innovative approaches to teaching and capacity development more broadly; and *the importance of increasing access and support for students who are working adults in public health institutions throughout Africa.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a review of literature examining the barriers and facilitators in integrating health in spatial planning at the local, mainly urban level, through appraisals. Our literature review covered the UK and non UK experiences of appraisals used to consider health issues in the planning process. We were able to identify four main categories of obstacles and facilitators including first the different knowledge and conceptual understanding of health by different actors/stakeholders, second the types of governance arrangements, in <b>particular</b> <b>partnerships,</b> in place and the political context, third the way institutions work, the responsibilities they have and their capacity and resources and fourth the timeliness, comprehensiveness and inclusiveness of the appraisal process. The findings allowed us to draw some lessons on the governance and policy framework regarding the integration of health impact into spatial planning, in particular considering {{the pros and cons of}} integrating health impact assessment (HIA) into other forms of impact assessment of spatial planning decisions such as environmental impact assessment (EIA) and strategic environment assessment (SEA).

40|$|Partnership’ {{has become}} a buzzword in {{development}} circles. The term is used to describe almost any relationship that pools the resources of different actors to address societal challenges and concerns. Because it encompasses such {{a broad range of}} perspectives, the contention of this thesis is that partnership can only be fully understood in relation to practice. A critical assessment of a selection of my research publications is used to explore how partnership is interpreted in different contexts, why and by whom, and to what extent it might offer possibilities for achieving social progress. This review finds that partnership can be construed as both a structure and a process, and as {{a means to an end}} and an end in itself. Attention thus needs to be given to its instrumental value as a development tool and to its intrinsic worth in cementing social capital. Consideration is given to connections between these different forms of partnership and other development ‘solutions’; the complex interplay between external, organisational and individual drivers for multi-stakeholder collaboration, and evidence for the benefits of working in this way. This analysis reveals that it is hard to judge the effectiveness of partnership due to the complexity of different levels of interaction; lack of clarity on goals and motivations for partnering; and, because process-related results generally emerge in the long term, attribution is a challenge. It is thus suggested that assessments of partnership might more usefully focus on methodologies that enhance its potential to generate individual and societal value. The attributes of such ‘transformational’ arrangements, and how these compare with other collaborative connections, are examined using a typology that builds upon a transactional-transformational partnership continuum. Further investigation into the nature of stakeholder participation, and related power dynamics, indicates that partnership can both promote and embody social progress when participation is carefully facilitated by ‘partnership brokers’; embedded in sociohistoric contexts, and based upon open-ended dialogue processes that seek to comprehend different points of view rather than change them. In order to explore this potential more fully, as well as continued research into <b>particular</b> <b>partnership</b> experiences and possible alternatives, more imaginative exchanges of knowledge about working in this way are recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of campus-community partnerships have, in recent years, {{been well documented}} (Harkavy, 1996; Holland, 2004; Maurrasse, 2001). However, there still exists little research on university/arts partnerships beyond narratives of campus organizations or departments working with community organizations on short term arts projects to either beautify the neighborhood or educate and entertain children (Dean, 1999; Hunt, 1999, Zemel, 1999). ^ In 1990 the Baltimore Theatre Project and the Theatre Department of Towson University established a 2 ̆ 2 collaborative affiliation 2 ̆ 2 (Arnoult, 1992, pp. 57) which continues today. Effective and fruitful collaborations between universities and professional arts organizations, which are not bound by strict contractual arrangements, are few. Some models exist in which the institutions share resources, for example, a building, {{as is the case}} for Princeton University and The McCarter Theatre Company and Syracuse University and Syracuse Stage. In both cases, professional not-for-profit companies grew out of university programs. However, both The Baltimore Theatre Project and the Towson Theatre Department maintain separate facilities, budgets, programs, and staff, thus, the heart of the collaboration lies within the personal relationships and specific programs and initiatives. Considering the longevity of this <b>particular</b> <b>partnership,</b> it provides a ready source of information regarding the process and {{benefits of}} such collaborations. The research questions guiding this qualitative inquiry are: (1) what was the process of developing and maintaining this partnership—particularly through multiple leadership changes? (2) What have been the expected, unexpected and unmet outcomes of the partnership? (3) Can this partnership {{serve as a model for}} other similar organizations considering such a relationship? ^ Kanter 2 ̆ 7 s (2002) five phases of development for business relationships provided the conceptual framework for exploring the development, process and outcomes of this affiliation. Kanter (2002) argues that businesses move through relationships much like people, from courtship to engagement, housekeeping, getting along and finally to accommodation—a phase in which each partner realizes the partnership has produced internal changes. ^ Data for this study was gathered through interviews with participants from both The Baltimore Theatre Project and Towson University. Questions pertained to the development, management and outcomes of the partnership. Additional data was gathered from institutional documents. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{information}} literacy {{is not a}} new one but it has attracted increased attention {{as a result of the}} digital information explosion. At the Durban University of Technology Library, Information literacy (IL) is offered in various forms by librarians. Unfortunately it has not enjoyed the accreditation or value that it deserves across all academic disciplines. There have however been a few success stories that have proven that IL contributes productively to the holistic development of learners. One such success story is the collaboration between the Library and the Industrial Engineering Department in embedding Information literacy into the curriculum. What started off as a pilot study between the library and the department, gained momentum to the point that is has successfully been integrated into the formal academic offering of the department. A major contributor to the success of this initiative was the relationships that were forged between the librarians and the academics. Ivey (2003) identified behaviours that contribute to successful collaborative teaching partnerships, which were prevalent at DUT and this provided the assurance of a winning formula. Librarians and academics designed learning events and material that brought together discipline specific content that integrated information literacy skills as part of the learning process. This then ensured that learners benefitted from the synergy between these 2 departments. This paper will talk to that <b>particular</b> <b>partnership</b> and outcomes of this initiative.
