The main character, though outwardly successful, still struggles to understand meaning in his life, exploring <b>personal</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in the post-modern, developed world. Though intelligent and well read, Perowne feels he has little influence over political events.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{intrinsic}} satisfactions derived from the recycling of household solid waste materials. Data from 107 respondents to a mail-back questionnaire were subjected to factor analysis and analysis of variance. The results indicate that people derive a series of separate and distinct satisfactions from both recycling and reusing materials. The satisfactions were quite specific, involving, for example, frugality and participation. These findings suggest that our understanding of why people bother to conserve resources may be improved by investigating the <b>personal</b> <b>satisfactions</b> derived from environmental stewardship behavior...|$|R

25|$|Older adults {{continue}} to report {{high levels of}} <b>personal</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in their friendships as they age, {{and even as the}} overall number of friends tends to decline. This satisfaction is associated with an increased ability to accomplish activities of daily living, as well as a reduced decline in cognitive abilities, decreased instances of hospitalization, and better outcomes related to rehabilitation. The overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{the rise}} of {{phenomenology}} and humanistic psychology led to renewed interest in self-esteem.

Psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the <b>personal</b> <b>satisfaction</b> of a person with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.|$|E

40|$|Despite over {{a decade}} of intense {{research}} we know surprisingly little about what encourages people to adopt and maintain an ecologically compatible lifestyle. The purpose {{of this research was}} to understand the types of motives people have to conserve natural resources during their daily activities. Data from 263 respondents to a mail-back questionnaire were subjected to dimensional analysis and analysis of variance. Three sets of scales were examined in detail: behaviors, satisfactions, and motivations. The results indicate that people have a variety of motives for conserving resources and derive a series of distinct satisfactions from both recycling and reusing materials. The findings support the notion of a strong relationship between intrinsic motivation and everyday conservation behavior. These findings suggest our understanding of why people conserve resources may be improved by investigating intrinsic motivation and the <b>personal</b> <b>satisfactions</b> derived from environmental stewardship behaviors. ...|$|R

He sees {{beauty in the}} minutiae of everyday life, videoing {{as much as he}} can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was [...] "an entire life behind things"; he feels that [...] "sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in." [...] Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the [...] "cultural dross", has [...] " [...] the radiant splendor of the created world" [...] to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world. Lester only forswears <b>personal</b> <b>satisfaction</b> at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family [...] "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with [...] "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen the world as it is.|$|E

To make the profession more appealing, practice was standardized, as was the curriculum. Entry and exit criteria were established, and the American Occupational Therapy Association advocated for steady employment, decent wages, and fair working conditions.

2500|$|Liang {{argues that}} the concept of [...] "author" [...] is tied to the notion of {{copyright}} and emerged to define a new social relationship— the way society perceives the ownership of knowledge. The concept of [...] "author" [...] thus naturalised a particular process of knowledge production where the emphasis on individual contribution and individual ownership takes precedence over the concept of [...] "community knowledge". Relying on the concept of the author, copyright {{is based on the assumption}} that without an intellectual property rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create, and that artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive. Liang challenges this logic, arguing that [...] "many authors who have little hope of ever finding a market for their publications, and whose copyright is, as a result, virtually worthless, have in the past, and even in the present, continued to write." [...] Liang points out that people produce works purely for <b>personal</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> or even for respect and recognition from peers. Liang {{argues that the}} 19th Century saw the prolific authorship of literary works in the absence of meaningful copyright that benefited the author. In fact, Liang argues, copyright protection usually benefited the publisher, and rarely the author.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Scruggs {{was getting}} bored with {{repetition}} of the classic bluegrass fare. [...] By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, [...] "I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own <b>personal</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> because if I don't, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. [...] Flatt was not happy with some of this material — he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying [...] "I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.|$|E
2500|$|Vincent {{was also}} spotted mid-air by Deryl Stone, a Chief Ranger for the National Park Service. Stone {{reported}} seeing Vincent grab his parachute after landing and run {{to a nearby}} car, which quickly drove away. However, authorities were able to detain two men on the ground who had been videotaping the jump. Stone said 37-year-old Ronald Carroll and 27-year-old Robert Weinzetl, both St. Louis residents, were found with a wireless communication headset and a video camera, {{as well as a}} still camera with a telephoto lens. The two were also charged with two misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and commercial photography in a national park. Vincent later turned himself in and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. However, he eventually accepted a guilty plea deal in which he testified against Carroll and Weinzetl, revealing that the two consented to recording the jump during a meeting of all three on the day before his stunt occurred. Federal magistrate judge David D. Noce ruled on January 28, 1993, that Carroll had been involved in a conspiracy and was guilty of both misdemeanor charges; the charges against Weinzetl had been dropped by federal attorneys. In his decision, Noce stated, [...] "There are places in our country where the sufficiently skilled can savor the exhilaration and <b>personal</b> <b>satisfaction</b> of accomplishing courageous and intrepid acts, of reaching dreamed-of heights and for coursing dangerous adventures," [...] but added that other places are designed for [...] "the exhilaration of mere observation and for the appreciation of the imaginings and the works of others.

40|$|Purpose – Many {{have applied}} {{the concept of}} {{congruence}} or fit {{in the context of}} person-organization, person-environment and person-person relationships and interactions. However, despite the significance of customer-employee interactions and relations in a services context, no research has investigated the effects of congruence between a customer's self-concept and employee-image on important relational outcomes such as relationship satisfaction, loyalty to employees and satisfaction towards service provider. The paper aims to fill this gap in the literature and to investigate the effects of self-employee congruence on customer satisfaction via the mediating effects of <b>personal</b> interaction, relationship <b>satisfaction</b> and loyalty to employees. The paper also seeks to investigate the links among <b>personal</b> interaction, relationship <b>satisfaction</b> and loyalty towards employees. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a causal modelling approach and proposes a conceptual model after an extensive review of the literature related to consumer behaviour, organizational behaviour, relationship marketing and services marketing. The paper is based on a sample of 203 customers of bank users in Nigeria who completed a self-administered questionnaire. The paper uses confirmatory factor analysis and SEM to analyse and confirm the conceptual model proposed in this research. Findings – The paper demonstrates that self-employee congruence is an important antecedent of <b>personal</b> interaction, relationship <b>satisfaction</b> and loyalty to employees each of which is in turn positively linked to customer satisfaction towards the service provider. Research limitations/implications – The paper discusses implications for service marketers and for retail banking sector and highlights the significance of self-employee congruence for service design and delivery, advertising strategies and suggests future research directions. Originality/value – The paper is first of its kind to discuss the effects of perceived similarities between customers and employees on some important relational constructs such as <b>personal</b> interaction, relationship <b>satisfaction,</b> loyalty towards employees and towards customer satisfaction...|$|R
