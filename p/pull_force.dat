For a drum with a 31cm (12.2in) playing surface, this equates to an overall <b>pull</b> <b>force</b> of around 455kg (1,000lb), or 15,000newton per meter(N/m) of tension.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon was}} {{modified}} with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable <b>pull</b> <b>force,</b> a wooden buttstock that folds {{to the right}} side of the weapon and a heavy-duty bipod, mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the handguard when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical iron sights and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6×40) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after remounting. The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing) and a cleaning kit. Recent production models feature synthetic plastic furniture and a skeletonized metal stock.|$|E
40|$|Objectives The aims of {{this study}} were to {{quantify}} tug-back by measuring the <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> and investigate the correlation of clinical tug-back <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> with in vitro gutta-percha (GP) cone adaptation score using micro-computed tomography (µCT). Materials and Methods Twenty-eight roots from human single-rooted teeth were divided into 2 groups. In the ProTaper Next (PTN) group, root canals were prepared with PTN, and in the ProFile (PF) group, root canals were prepared using PF (n = 14). The degree of tug-back was scored after selecting taper-matched GP cones. A novel method using a spring balance was designed to quantify the tug-back by measuring the <b>pulling</b> <b>force.</b> The correlation between tug-back scores, <b>pulling</b> <b>force,</b> and percentage of the gutta-percha occupied area (pGPOA) within apical 3 mm was investigated using µCT. The data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation analysis, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test. Results Specimens with a strong tug-back had a mean <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> of 1. 24 N (range, 0. 15 – 1. 70 N). This study showed a positive correlation between tug-back score, <b>pulling</b> <b>force,</b> and pGPOA. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in these factors between the PTN and PF groups. Regardless of the groups, pGPOA and <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> were significantly higher in the specimens with a higher tug-back score (p < 0. 05). Conclusions The degree of subjective tug-back was a definitive determinant for master cone adaptation in the root canal. The use of the tug-back scoring system and <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> allows the interpretation of subjective tug-back in a more objective and quantitative manner...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{subject of}} this paper is to define a {{reliability}} of the test for the estimation of basic kinematics and mechanical characteristics of <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> in swimmers measured by the method of tethered swimming with maximum intensity of 60 seconds. The sample was composed of 10 categorized senior age swimmers. All swimmers were specialists in sprint and middle distance crawl techniques (50, 100, 200 and 400 m). Testing was administered by tensiometric probe with the hardware-software logistics support by test-retest method. Kinematics characteristics were given in two variables (AVG STROKE 60 TS Time – average stroke duration and AVG HZ 60 TS – realized stroke frequency) while <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> characteristics were given in five variables (AVG F max 60 TS – average of maximum <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> (peaks) of individual strokes, AVG F min 60 TS – average of minimal <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> of the individual strokes, AVG F 60 TS – average of <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> of the individual strokes, AVG Imp F 60 TS – average of impulses of <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> of the individual strokes and AVG RFD 60 TS – average rate of force development of the <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> in individual strokes. On the basis of the obtained results we can conclude that the given estimation method is generally valid on the level of Crombach's alpha = 0. 8694, is generally reliable on the level of Spearman-Brown's rtt = 0. 9722 (97. 22 %) and is generally factor valid on th...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of a partially directed walk model of a polymer which at one end is tethered to a sticky surface and {{at the other end}} is subjected to a <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> at fixed angle away from the point of tethering. Using the kernel method, we derive the full generating function for this model in two and three dimensions and obtain the respective phase diagrams. We observe adsorbed and desorbed phases with a thermodynamic phase transition in between. In the absence of a <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> this model has a second-order thermal desorption transition which merely gets shifted by the presence of a lateral <b>pulling</b> <b>force.</b> On the other hand, if the <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> contains a non-zero vertical component this transition becomes first order. Strikingly, we find that, if the angle between the <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> and the surface is below a critical value, a sufficiently strong force will induce polymer adsorption, no matter how large the temperature of the system. Our findings are similar in two and three dimensions, an additional feature in three dimensions being the occurrence of a re-entrance transition at constant <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> for low temperature, which has been observed previously for this model in the presence of pure vertical pulling. Interestingly, the re-entrance phenomenon vanishes under certain pulling angles, with details depending on how the three-dimensional polymer is modeled...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{forces are}} {{involved}} in the process of slab rollback. Two forces acting against each other at the interface of the two subducting plates exert forces against one another. The subducting plate exerts a bending force (FPB) that supplies pressure during subduction, while the overriding plate exerts a force against the subducting plate (FTS). The slab <b>pull</b> <b>force</b> (FSP) is caused by the negative buoyancy of the plate driving the plate to greater depths. The resisisting force from the surrounding mantle opposes the slab pull forces. Interactions with the 660-km discontinuity cause a deflection due to the buoyancy at the phase transition (F660). [...] The unique interplay of these forces is what generates slab rollback. When the deep slab section obstructs the down-going motion of the shallow slab section, slab rollback occurs. The subducting slab undergoes backward sinking due to the negative buoyancy forces causing a retrogradation of the trench hinge along the surface. Upwelling of the mantle around the slab can create favorable conditions for the formation of a back-arc basin.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally {{fibre optic}} cables were pulled through cable ducts {{in the same way}} as other cables, via a winch line.

40|$|Studies of whole-organism {{performance}} {{are central to}} understanding the links between animal behaviour, morphology, and fitness. Invertebrates have been popular models for studies of behaviour, {{although there have been}} few detailed studies of their whole-organism performance, links between performance and morphology, or trade-offs amongst different performance dimensions. In the present study, we investigate four facets of whole-organism performance (running speed, climbing speed, endurance, and <b>pulling</b> <b>force)</b> in males of a jumping spider (Servaea incana). We consider links between these performance traits and their association with three morphological measures expected to influence maximum performance capacity: body size, relative leg length, and relative body mass (condition). Running speed, climbing speed, and <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> were all positively related, suggesting that selection for one may positively effect all. By contrast, endurance capacity decreased with running and climbing speed, suggesting an evolutionary trade-off. Associations amongst performance measures cannot be explained solely as correlates of morphology: large size was associated with greater running speed, climbing speed, and <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> but not with endurance; relative leg length was associated with <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> but not other performance traits; relative mass was associated with climbing speed and endurance but not running speed or <b>pulling</b> <b>force.</b> 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform a comprehensive review of psychophysically determined maximum acceptable pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces.</b> Factors affecting pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> are identified and discussed. Recent studies show a significant decrease (compared to previous studies) in maximum acceptable forces for males but not for females when pushing and pulling on a treadmill. A comparison of pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> measured using a high inertia cart with those measured on a treadmill shows that the pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> using high inertia cart are higher for males but are about the same for females. It is concluded that the recommendations of Snook and Ciriello (1991) for pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> are still valid and provide reasonable recommendations for ergonomics practitioners. Regression equations as a function of handle height, frequency of exertion and pushing/pulling distance are provided to estimate maximum initial and sustained forces for pushing and pulling acceptable to 75 % male and female workers. At present {{it is not clear whether}} pushing or pulling should be favored. Similarly, it is not clear what handle heights would be optimal for pushing and pulling. Epidemiological studies are needed to determine relationships between psychophysically determined maximum acceptable pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>forces</b> and risk of musculoskeletal injuries, in particular to low back and shoulders.

40|$|Purpose For the {{application}} of less invasive robotic neurosurgery to the resection of deep-seated tumors, a prototype system of a force-detecting gripper with a flexible micromanipulator and force feedback to the operating unit will be developed. Methods Gripping force applied on the gripper is detected by strain gauges attached to the gripper clip. The signal is transmitted to the amplifier by wires running through the inner tube of the manipulator. Proportional force is applied on the finger lever of the operating unit by the surgeon using a bilateral control program. A <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> experienced by the gripper is also detected at the gripper clip. The signal for the <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> is transmitted in a manner identical to that mentioned previously, and the proportional torque is applied on the touching roller of the finger lever of the operating unit. The surgeon can feel the gripping force as {{the resistance of the}} operating force of the finger and can feel the <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> as the friction at the finger surface. Results A basic operation test showed that both the gripping <b>force</b> and <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> were clearly detected in the gripping of soft material and that the operator could feel the gripping <b>force</b> and <b>pulling</b> <b>force</b> at the finger lever of the operating unit. Conclusions A prototype of the force feedback in the microgripping manipulator system has been developed.
