5|$|Agar.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} online action game {{created by}} Matheus Valadares. Players control a cell in a map representing a <b>petri</b> dish. The {{goal is to}} gain as much mass as possible by eating agar and cells smaller than the player's cell, while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cell(s). The name comes from the substance agar, used to culture bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his death}} (which {{according}} to persistent but unfounded legend {{was caused by}} a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon <b>Petri</b> and Kaikhosru Sorabji. From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and brought it back into the repertoire.|$|E
5|$|In 1250, {{relics of}} St. James {{were brought to}} the church and its {{dedication}} was changed. It was usually known in contemporary documents as S. Jacobus de Portico, where the Porticus in medieval Rome was the covered passage linking Saint Peter's with the Tiber (Porticus Sancti <b>Petri).</b>|$|E
5|$|No prototypes for the {{painting}} are known in Sweden, and while {{the painting}} is occasionally associated with the Danube school, much about its stylistic and iconographic history remains to be investigated. A possible stylistic prototype is the illustrated Bible of Erhard Altdorfer (brother of the more famous Albrecht Altdorfer). Begun in 1530, it {{was inspired by the}} works of Cranach and Dürer, but also renewed the genre by combining commonplace details with an undertone of approaching disaster. In particular, Altdorfer's apocalyptic illustrations for the Revelation to John deliver an evangelic message {{similar to that of the}} Vädersolstavlan. Historical documents show that Olaus <b>Petri,</b> who commissioned the painting, combined biblical quotations related to the Apocalypse with the painting hanging in the church. Copies of Erhard Altdorfer's apocalyptic woodcuts may have been available in Stockholm through the German merchant Gorius Holste who lived by Järntorget square and who was a friend of both <b>Petri</b> and Martin Luther.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to the {{character}} varied, with some, including Spider-Man's creator, Stan Lee, approving {{the creation of a}} positive role model for non-white children, to displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with some decrying it as a publicity stunt motivated by political correctness, a charge Alonso denied. Alexandra <b>Petri</b> of The Washington Post called for {{the character}} to be judged on the quality of its stories, which have garnered positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|Viktor Fasth of Sweden {{was named}} the tournament's most {{valuable}} player and top goaltender by the IIHF directorate. Canadian Alex Pietrangelo {{was named the}} top defenceman and Jaromír Jágr of the Czech Republic {{was selected as the}} top forward. Finland's Jarkko Immonen was the tournament's leading scorer with 12 points and <b>Petri</b> Vehanen was the leading goaltender with a save percentage of 0.954.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1850s the {{miasma theory}} of disease was largely {{superseded}} by the germ theory of disease, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and {{their interactions with}} other forms of life. By the 1880s, bacteriology was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of Robert Koch, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in <b>Petri</b> dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation) was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
5|$|Manutius {{at first}} printed works only in Greek. His first {{printing}} in the Latin alphabet, in February 1496 (1495 by the Venetian calendar), {{was a book}} entitled <b>Petri</b> Bembi de Aetna Angelum Chabrielem liber. This book, usually now called De Aetna, was a short 60-page text about a journey to Mount Etna, written by the young Italian humanist poet Pietro Bembo, who would later become a Cardinal, secretary to Pope Leo X and lover of Lucrezia Borgia.|$|E
5|$|Modern Swedish (Swedish: nysvenska) {{begins with}} the advent of the {{printing}} press and the European Reformation. After assuming power, the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a Swedish translation of the Bible. The New Testament was published in 1526, followed by a full Bible translation in 1541, usually referred to as the Gustav Vasa Bible, a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were Laurentius Andreæ and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus <b>Petri.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a tetrapolar mating system, whereby genes at two {{different}} locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility, or mating type. This system prevents self-fertilization and ensures {{a high degree}} of genotypic diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on a <b>petri</b> dish, the colonies are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by lysis.|$|E
5|$|Peter is a {{considered}} a saint, with a feast day on 6 January. His cult was confirmed in 1915. A Vita <b>Petri,</b> or Life of Peter, written by Eadmer in the 12th century, exists in manuscript form, {{but it is}} unreliable. There is evidence that Peter was the object of veneration in Boulogne in the 15th century, and a church in that town was associated with Peter, although probably not {{from the start of}} his cult.|$|E
5|$|The {{anamorphic}} form of P.semilanceata is an asexual {{stage in}} the fungus's life cycle involved {{in the development of}} mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in a <b>petri</b> dish, the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P.semilanceata beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was produced during an important time in Swedish history. The establishment of modern Sweden {{coincided with the}} introduction of Protestantism and the break-up with Denmark and the Kalmar Union. The {{painting was}} commissioned by the Swedish reformer Olaus <b>Petri,</b> and the resulting controversies between him and King Gustav Vasa and the historical context remained a well-kept secret for centuries. During the 20th century the painting became an icon for the history of Stockholm and it is now frequently displayed whenever the history of the city is commemorated.|$|E
5|$|Fungal mycelia {{can become}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, for example, on various {{surfaces}} and substrates, such as damp walls and spoiled food, where they are commonly called molds. Mycelia grown on solid agar media in laboratory <b>petri</b> dishes are usually referred to as colonies. These colonies can exhibit growth shapes and colors (due to spores or pigmentation) that can be used as diagnostic features in the identification of species or groups. Some individual fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages {{as in the case of}} a clonal colony of Armillaria solidipes, which extends over an area of more than 900ha (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000years.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, {{these models}} can be {{represented}} in several ways. <b>Petri</b> nets, which were introduced in Carl Adam Petri's 1962 doctoral thesis, were an early attempt to codify the rules of consistency models. Dataflow theory later built upon these, and Dataflow architectures were created to physically implement the ideas of dataflow theory. Beginning in the late 1970s, process calculi such as Calculus of Communicating Systems and Communicating Sequential Processes were developed to permit algebraic reasoning about systems composed of interacting components. More recent additions to the process calculus family, such as the π-calculus, have added the capability for reasoning about dynamic topologies. Logics such as Lamport's TLA+, and mathematical models such as traces and Actor event diagrams, have also been developed to describe the behavior of concurrent systems.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disability to the British ship, Troude pulled Formidable ahead in light winds, slowly rejoining the main squadron under Moreno, which was holding station off Cadiz harbour. As Formidable moved away, the remaining masts on Venerable collapsed and the ship grounded off Sancti <b>Petri.</b> There was concern in the British squadron that Moreno might counterattack the disabled ship, but the arrival on the horizon of Audacious and Superb persuaded the Spanish admiral to withdraw into Cadiz. Hood was able to refloat Venerable on 13 July and the ship was towed back to Gibraltar with the prize Saint Antoine. Saumarez left three ships to maintain the blockade at Cadiz, returning the situation off the port to that before the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and <b>Petri</b> Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Agar.io is {{to grow a}} cell on a <b>petri</b> dish by swallowing both randomly generated pellets (agar), which slightly increases a cell's mass, and smaller cells, without being swallowed by larger cells. The browser version currently holds four game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Teams, Experimental, and Party. The mobile version of the game includes FFA (Free-For-All) and Rush Mode. The goal {{of the game is}} to obtain the largest cell; players must restart when all their cells are eaten. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols or skins. The more mass a cell has, the slower it will move. Cells gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{extensions}} to <b>Petri</b> nets. Some {{of them are}} completely backwards-compatible (e.g. coloured <b>Petri</b> nets) with the original <b>Petri</b> net, some add properties that cannot be modelled in the original <b>Petri</b> net formalism (e.g. timed <b>Petri</b> nets). Although backwards-compatible models do not extend the computational power of <b>Petri</b> nets, they may have more succinct representations and may be more convenient for modeling. Extensions that cannot be transformed into <b>Petri</b> nets are sometimes very powerful, but usually lack {{the full range of}} mathematical tools available to analyse ordinary <b>Petri</b> nets.|$|E
25|$|Olof Persson, {{sometimes}} Petersson (January 6, 1493 – April 19, 1552), {{better known}} under the Latin form of his name, Olaus <b>Petri</b> (or less commonly, Olavus <b>Petri),</b> was a clergyman, writer, judge and {{major contributor to}} the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. His brother, Laurentius <b>Petri</b> (Lars Persson), became the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden.|$|E
25|$|If a <b>Petri</b> net is {{equivalent}} to an elementary net, then Z can be the countable set {0,1} and those elements in P that map to 1 under M form a configuration. Similarly, if a <b>Petri</b> net is not an elementary net, then the multiset M {{can be interpreted as}} representing a non-singleton set of configurations. In this respect, M extends the concept of configuration for elementary nets to <b>Petri</b> nets.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{important}} activists of the Protestant Reformation included Jacobus Arminius, Theodore Beza, Martin Bucer, Andreas von Carlstadt, Heinrich Bullinger, Balthasar Hubmaier, Thomas Cranmer, William Farel, Thomas Müntzer, Laurentius <b>Petri,</b> Olaus <b>Petri,</b> Philipp Melanchthon, Menno Simons, Louis de Berquin, Primož Trubar and John Smyth.|$|E
25|$|Glass <b>petri</b> {{dishes are}} used to culture living cells.|$|E
25|$|Like {{industry}} standards such as UML activity diagrams, Business Process Model and Notation and EPCs, <b>Petri</b> nets offer a graphical notation for stepwise {{processes that}} include choice, iteration, and concurrent execution. Unlike these standards, <b>Petri</b> nets have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{definitions}} of <b>Petri</b> nets explicitly allow {{this as a}} syntactic feature.|$|E
25|$|Laurentius <b>Petri</b> Nericius (1499 – 27 October 1573) was a Swedish clergyman and {{the first}} Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden. He and his brother Olaus <b>Petri</b> are, {{together}} with the King Gustav Vasa, regarded as the main Lutheran reformers of Sweden. They are commemorated by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on April 19.|$|E
25|$|<b>Petri</b> nets are state-transition {{systems that}} extend {{a class of}} nets called {{elementary}} nets.|$|E
25|$|In {{the diagram}} of a <b>Petri</b> net (see top figure right), places are {{conventionally}} depicted with circles, transitions with long narrow rectangles and arcs as one-way arrows that show connections {{of places to}} transitions or transitions to places. If the diagram were of an elementary net, then those places in a configuration would be conventionally depicted as circles, where each circle encompasses a single dot called a token. In the given diagram of a <b>Petri</b> net (see right), the place circles may encompass more than one token to show {{the number of times}} a place appears in a configuration. The configuration of tokens distributed over an entire <b>Petri</b> net diagram is called a marking.|$|E
25|$|A (marked) <b>Petri</b> net {{is called}} k-bounded, safe, or bounded {{when all of}} its places are.|$|E
25|$|Note that a <b>Petri</b> net is bounded if {{and only}} if its {{reachability}} graph is finite.|$|E
25|$|Researchers, for {{the first}} time, {{find a way of}} {{reproducing}} Alzheimer's cells in a <b>Petri</b> dish.|$|E
25|$|Extended {{free choice}} (EFC) – a <b>Petri</b> net {{that can be}} {{transformed}} into an FC.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Petri</b> net (graph) {{is called}} (structurally) bounded {{if it is}} bounded for every {{possible}} initial marking.|$|E
