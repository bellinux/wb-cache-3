40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{parent-child}} {{survey is}} to investigate how television advertising is related to children’s <b>purchase</b> <b>requests,</b> materialism, disappointment, life dissatisfaction, and family conflict. In a first step, a conceptual model based on existing hypotheses was developed, and in a second step, this model was tested using a sample of 360 parent-child (8 - to 12 -year-olds) dyads. Using structural equation modeling, the findings show that advertising is positively and directly related to children’s <b>purchase</b> <b>requests</b> and materialism. It is also positively, though indirectly (mediated by advertising-induced <b>purchase</b> <b>requests),</b> related to family conflict, disappointment, and life dissatisfaction. Parent-child consumer communication and parental mediation of advertis-ing are important moderators {{of the effects of}} advertising on children’s pur-chase requests and materialism...|$|R

In addition, this thesis found that the auditors' actual precision was not as tight as stated in the DODIG audit report.

Methods: Child-parent pairs (n = 306) were recruited at pediatric clinics. Exposure to food marketing was assessed by a digital logo recognition test. Children matched 18 logos of unhealthy food (high in fat/sugar/salt) featured in promotion material from the food industry to pictures of corresponding products. Children’s nutritional knowledge, food preferences, <b>purchase</b> <b>requests,</b> eating behavior and socioeconomic characteristics were assessed by a digital game and parental questionnaires. Anthropometric measurements were recorded. Results: Recognition rates for the brand logos ranged from 30 % to 80 %. Logo recognition ability increased with age (p, 0. 001) and socioeconomic level (p, 0. 001 comparing children in the highest and lowest of three socioeconomic groups). Adjusted for gender, age and socioeconomic group, logo recognition was associated with higher BMI (p = 0. 022) and nutritional knowledge (p, 0. 001) but not to unhealthy food preferences or <b>purchase</b> <b>requests.</b> Conclusions: Children from higher socioeconomic groups in the region had higher brand logo recognition ability and are possibly exposed to more food marketing.
