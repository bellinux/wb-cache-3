5|$|<b>Portability</b> is very {{important}} for source code and programmers, especially those already familiar with C and C++.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{assembly}} code that was allegedly copied has also been replaced as a natural progression in ReactOS development, with developers having reimplemented the functionality in C for <b>portability</b> reasons.|$|E
5|$|Instrument {{builders}} developed {{other features}} that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with solo stops {{emerged in the}} early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time. Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve <b>portability,</b> and players used mutes to properly blend into chamber music.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{processes}} need {{to adhere}} to regulations, for example Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, Health Insurance <b>Portability</b> and Accountability Act, Good Laboratory Practice, and Food and Drug Administration specifications in the United States. Laboratory Information Management Systems help by tracking these processes. Regulation applies to both staff and supplies. , twelve US states require molecular pathologists to be licensed; several boards such as the American Board of Medical Genetics and the American Board of Pathology certify technologists, supervisors, and laboratory directors.|$|E
5|$|Portable organs (the portative and the {{positive}} organ) were invented in the Middle Ages. Towards {{the middle of}} the 13th century, the portatives represented in the miniatures of illuminated manuscripts appear to have real keyboards with balanced keys, as in the Cantigas de Santa Maria. Its <b>portability</b> made the portative useful for the accompaniment of both sacred and secular music in a variety of settings.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus on}} <b>portability</b> and {{standardization}} meant programs written in COBOL could be portable and facilitated {{the spread of}} the language {{to a wide variety of}} hardware platforms and operating systems. Additionally, the well-defined division structure restricts the definition of external references to the Environment Division, which simplifies platform changes in particular.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a blow to}} the {{short-range}} committee, who {{had made}} good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with <b>portability</b> in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL to overturn the resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and <b>portability.</b> This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{was also}} {{developed}} during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed. At first, oxyfuel welding {{was one of the}} more popular welding methods due to its <b>portability</b> and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made. Flux covering the electrode primarily shields the base material from impurities, but also stabilizes the arc and can add alloying components to the weld metal.|$|E
5|$|The M249 {{light machine}} gun (LMG), {{formerly}} designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi, a {{light machine gun}} manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high rate of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and <b>portability</b> approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first title in the Fire Emblem series on a {{portable}} console. While development of a handheld Fire Emblem title had been considered for earlier games, the team felt available hardware lacked the expression to realize their vision. The GBA offered technical capacities superior to the Super Famicom, the release platform of the last Fire Emblem title , while also offering <b>portability,</b> making it more appealing to players. The platform was also chosen due to estimated development time and budget considerations. Developing for the new hardware proved challenging in some respects, and easy in others such as creating basic software. During development, two different versions were developed while the team were {{getting used to the}} new hardware. One of the main issues they faced was the limited resolution and screen size of the GBA. The game's combat animations were intended to evoke scenes from high fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings, contrasting with the equivalent styles of fantasy fighting in Japanese stories.|$|E
25|$|Linux kernel <b>portability</b> to {{instruction}} set architectures other than x86, {{was an early}} feature added to the kernel.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{examples}} of pressurized liquid fuel cutting torches, usually using gasoline. These {{are used for}} their increased <b>portability.</b>|$|E
25|$|KDE SC 4.7 was {{released}} on 28 July 2011. This version updated KWin {{in order to be}} compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0, which will enhance its <b>portability</b> to mobile and tablet platforms. Other optimizations, {{such as the use of}} Qt Quick, were made in order to enhance this <b>portability.</b> This version also brought updates and enhancements to Plasma Desktop such as better network management and updates to certain widgets (like the Kickoff menu) as well as activities.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{problems}} have been dismissed by now, following many revisions and speed enhancements, and {{with the addition of}} more <b>portability</b> and ports.|$|E
25|$|The war precipitated {{research}} to find better resolution, more <b>portability,</b> and more features for radar, including complementary navigation systems like Oboe {{used by the}} RAF's Pathfinder.|$|E
25|$|Personal health records combine many of {{the above}} {{features}} with <b>portability,</b> thus allowing a patient to share medical records across providers and health care systems.|$|E
25|$|Headphone size {{can affect}} the balance between {{fidelity}} and <b>portability.</b> Generally, headphone form factors {{can be divided into}} four separate categories: circumaural (over-ear), supra-aural (on-ear), earbud and in-ear.|$|E
25|$|The y-digit {{codes are}} {{allocated}} per network, although {{with the introduction}} of number <b>portability,</b> {{there is no longer a}} fixed relationship between the mobile phone number and the network it uses.|$|E
25|$|Electroencephalography (EEG) is {{the most}} studied {{non-invasive}} interface, mainly due to its fine temporal resolution, ease of use, <b>portability</b> and low set-up cost. The technology is somewhat susceptible to noise however.|$|E
25|$|Though JSON was {{originally}} advertised and {{believed to be}} a strict subset of JavaScript and ECMAScript, it inadvertently allows some unescaped characters in strings that are illegal in JavaScript and ECMAScript strings. See Data <b>portability</b> issues below.|$|E
25|$|<b>Portability</b> : The system accepts {{and manages}} orders for all {{departments}} at the point-of-care, from any {{location in the}} health system (physician's office, hospital or home) {{through a variety of}} devices, including wireless PCs and tablet computers.|$|E
25|$|For {{surviving}} kin, cremation {{is preferred}} because of simple <b>portability.</b> Survivors relocating to another city or country {{have the option}} of transporting their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together.|$|E
25|$|Apart from <b>portability,</b> the CSRG {{worked on}} an {{implementation}} of the OSI network protocol stack, improvements to the kernel virtual memory system and (with Van Jacobson of LBL) new TCP/IP algorithms to accommodate {{the growth of the}} Internet.|$|E
25|$|In-ear headphones, {{also known}} as in-ear {{monitors}} (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar <b>portability</b> to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by audio engineers and musicians as well as audiophiles.|$|E
25|$|ODPâ€™s goal is {{to allow}} implementers of the API great {{flexibility}} to exploit and optimize the implementation. This is intended to enable easy platform <b>portability</b> such that an application written to the API can pick up performance gains without needing significant platform knowledge when ported.|$|E
25|$|Another C++-class {{library was}} created in 1993 at the Hamburg University of Technology called Profil/BIAS (Programmer's Runtime Optimized Fast Interval Library, Basic Interval Arithmetic), which made the usual {{interval}} operations more user friendly. It emphasized the efficient use of hardware, <b>portability</b> and independence of a particular presentation of intervals.|$|E
25|$|The Archos 15 Vision {{is quite}} thin (only 6mm) and light (only 18 g) with highly {{responsive}} touch keys and the 1.5 color screen {{that make the}} Archos 15 Vision very easy to use. It combines the extreme <b>portability</b> with the 4 GB of storage and the FM radio..|$|E
25|$|The Curta {{calculator}} {{was developed}} in 1948 and, although costly, became popular for its <b>portability.</b> This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.|$|E
25|$|The Health Insurance <b>Portability</b> and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits {{a health}} benefit plan from refusing to cover an employee's {{pre-existing}} medical conditions in some circumstances. It also bars health benefit plans from {{certain types of}} {{discrimination on the basis}} of health status, genetic information, or disability.|$|E
25|$|Health Insurance <b>Portability</b> and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 {{requires}} {{the adoption of}} national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers. And, it requires health care providers, insurance providers and employers to safeguard the security and privacy of health data.|$|E
25|$|Toolkit-based design: Git was {{designed}} as a set of programs written in C, and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs. Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and <b>portability,</b> the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} hardware abstraction {{does not}} involve abstracting the instruction set, which generally falls under the wider concept of <b>portability.</b> Abstracting the instruction set, when necessary (such as for handling the several revisions to the x86 instruction set, or emulating a missing math coprocessor), is performed by the kernel, or via hardware virtualization.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the increased amount of health care fraud in the United States, Congress, through the Health Insurance <b>Portability</b> and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), has specifically established health care fraud as a federal criminal offense with punishment of up to ten years of prison in addition to significant financial penalties.|$|E
25|$|Information {{security}} concerns surrounding PHRs extend beyond technological issues. There are also ethical issues affecting {{the transfer of}} personally identifiable information in the treatment process. Only gradually are architectural requirements and information-use policies becoming available such as the Privacy Rule under the U.S. Health Insurance <b>Portability</b> and Accountability Act (HIPAA).|$|E
25|$|Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHI): a rigid-hulled {{inflatable}} boat, {{powered by}} a gasoline outboard motor or an inboard/outboard diesel engine. The RHI can be easily deployed from a cutter with a four-point bridle for davit lifting and lowering. The RHI's <b>portability</b> and ruggedness {{allow it to be}} used on many kinds of missions.|$|E
