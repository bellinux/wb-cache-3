40|$|Legacy {{waste is}} a {{significant}} problem in Antarctica. This is particularly the case where waste generated on stations prior to the 1980 s was placed in landfill sites or disposed of at sea. Although several AAD reports from the 1980 s {{recognize that there are}} contaminated sites at the abandoned Wilkes station, there has been no systematic attempt to classify the waste or define the spatial scale of the problem, making development of strategic and systematic clean-up or preservation programs difficult. Wilkes. station is situated on the Clark Peninsula in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica. The station was established by the USA in 1957 as part of the International Geophysical Year, transferred to Australian control in 1959 and abandoned in 1969. Much of the station's equipment, fuel and buildings remain in-situ. During the summer seasons of 2008 / 09 and 2009110, Fryirs and Hafsteinsdottir undertook fieldwork to classify the waste and collect samples for heavy metal and hydrocarbon analysis. 538 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> with a volume of around 20, 000 m³ were identified across the Clark Peninsula in 6 categories based on their degree of hazard, recyclability, heritage value and their management potential. Petroleum hydrocarbons comprise 35 % of the waste. This waste contains several hundred semi-full fuel drums. Heritage items that illustrate expedition life at Wilkes comprise a further 27 % of the overall waste. Easily recyclable dry waste including timber, copper wire and pipe, scrap iron, steel mechanical parts etc. comprises 26 % of the total. •Non-recyclable waste makes up 5 % of the total and includes battery parts, plastics including fuel bladders, and food remains. Contaminated sediments make up 4 % of the total but are extensive in spatial area. Although hazardous substances such as caustic soda, explosives 'and asbestos makes up only 3 % of the total, these items represent significant contamination and heath issues for the site and for visiting expeditioners. The presence of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and contaminated sediments are impacting on the terrestrial and marine environment. Preliminary XRF results show that many of the sediment samples have levels of heavy metal contamination above the ANZECC guidelines. Certain hotspots of contamination occur across the Wilkes station and the Clark Peninsula. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Although {{waste is}} {{traditionally}} assessed as a polluting thing which {{need to be}} reduced or lessened, its management is a necessity wherever human beings live. Every year, global energy request increases. While oil products actually fulfil the great part of the energy demand, the growing difficulty in meeting it and, as a consequence, all the pollution and global warming problems are driving scientific research to an alternative and renewable energy. Waste contain a significant energy amount; if we could employ them and convert them into a reusable form, we might provide either to supply clean energy and to resolve the waste global problem. This issue is felt in a dental surgery too, because it concerns dangerous and infectious-risk waste disposal. The possibility of the employment of <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and consequently of their inside energy converting can represent {{a turning point in}} the clear energy field, gaining an enormous benefit for the environment and significantly lowering waste management costs. In recent years, Enzymatic Biofuel Cells (EFC), with substantial and green advantages have become a promising power source being distinguishable among the alternative energy conversion systems. Nowadays, since fossil fuel depletion and global climate change have started to threaten our existence and future, extensive research has been devoted on finding alternative energy resources and developing more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for energy storage and conversion. Material and methods. Material employed (purchased by Sigma-Aldrich) were: Glucose oxidase (GOx), Nafion perfluo-rinated resin solution at 5 % in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water, Polyethylene oxide. Stock solutions of D (+) glucose were prepared in a 0. 1 M phosphate buffer solution and stored at 4 °C for at least 24 h before use. Carbon cloth electrode ELAT HT 140 E-W with a platinum loading of 5 gm- 2 was purchased by E-Tek. Electrospun Nafion fibers were obtained as follows. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the electrode morphologies. Results. The current work focuses on enzymatic biological fuel cells (EFC), which are designed to convert the chemical energy of the fuel into electricity in a sustainable manner. The aim of our study is to develop enzymatic fuel cells using the infectious-risk special waste, such as blood and saliva, as fuels. Considering that blood contains glucose, the EFC devices development can be developed through the preparation of a glucose-oxidized (GOx) based bioanode, immobilized on an electrode surface. Conclusion. During our research we developed an Enzimatic Fuel Cell prototype and we evaluated its ability to harvest energy from the blood and the saliva inside the risk-infectious medical waste and to employ it in order one day to help the energy requirements of a consulting room. This device is based on GOx as biocatalyst and either Nafion or low cost membranes based on polyaromatic polymers were used as polymer electrolytes. Moreover, we also have explored the performance of single chamber configuration, which directly eliminates the use of membranes, to assess the applicability of EFCs for dentistry waste management...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: At {{this time}} ready mix {{concrete}} is being rapidly adopted {{to construct the}} building, but the implementation is often an excess supply {{and the rest is}} sometimes discarded disembarang place, so as to reduce the fertility the soil and damage the ecosystem balance. One way to overcome this is to recycle the waste concrete. However, the use <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> as recycled aggregate needs to be studied more, with experimentally testing and analysis of their characteristics. The methods and procedures for testing the implementation of recycled aggregate was done with reference to ASTM standards. By replacing the concrete base material in this case in the form of split coarse aggregate replaced with <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> light concrete with specific composition, which is to analyze the average compressive strength of concrete using coarse aggregate from <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> light concrete. Strength of concrete that will be targeted is 25 MPa. Then testing the modulus of elasticity at 28 days. From the test results obtained by the value of the concrete compressive strength is obtained by replacing the cracked split with light concrete the waste is 14. 909 MPa. The modulus of elasticity of concrete at 28 days for concrete using light concrete cracked the waste amounted to 18372. 53 MPa.
