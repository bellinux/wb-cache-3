5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a <b>profit</b> <b>on</b> their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic <b>profit</b> <b>on</b> piasters, and that a 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E

The Norwegian Competition Authority stated {{they would have to}} look at the merger, since the new company would have an almost-monopoly on offshore flights. However, the ministry stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in 1995, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid. The ownership of Braathens Helikopter was transferred to Helikopter Service on 14 December. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi received 14% of the shares in the merged company.

Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling, where a group buys a number of keys in regions where the cost is low, and then resells them into regions of much higher value to <b>profit</b> <b>on</b> the difference, outside of European oversight and tax laws.|$|E
5|$|Bent {{completed}} {{a move to}} Tottenham Hotspur for a club record fee of £16.5million on 29 June 2007, {{which was to be}} payable over three years and is inclusive of add-on payments. Ipswich were entitled to 20% of Charlton's <b>profit</b> <b>on</b> Bent under a sell-on clause, which gave the club an initial £2.58million. He scored his first goal for Tottenham in a friendly match against Stevenage Borough in their first pre-season fixture of the 2007–08 season. Bent scored his first competitive goal for Tottenham in a 4–0 home victory over Derby County in August 2007. This was followed up by scoring in the 6–1 win over Anorthosis Famagusta {{in the first round of}} the UEFA Cup on 20 September 2007.

Bent went on to score one more goal that season, against Newcastle United, which he finished with 36 appearances and 8 goals.|$|E
5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} getting his contract amended to allow him to make a <b>profit.</b> <b>On</b> 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E

5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a <b>profit</b> <b>on</b> the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E

However Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification. On 29 April 2007, Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two games of the season left to play, and the following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement.|$|E

At the same time, the airline lost NOK6 million on the routes to from Oslo to Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund, and NOK18 million on the coastal routes between Stavanger and Tromsø. From 1 October 1978, the company also introduced 50% youth discount for people under 26 years. From 1 May 1978, there was introduced a NOK100 tax on international charter flights. The same year, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of Bergenske Dampskibsselskab, that owned 51% of the travel agency Bennett Reisebureau. This was to try to secure influence over the chain, that was also owned 31% by SAS. A new, neutral ticketing system, SMART, was introduced in 1980 for all travel agents in Norway and Sweden.

Du Bois published a book entitled A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations, Struck Within the Past Century. In the volume, several coins from the Mint's coin cabinet, including an 1804 dollar, were reproduced by tracing a pantograph stylus over an electrotype of the coins. In May 1843, numismatist Matthew A. Stickney was able to obtain an 1804 dollar from the Mint's coin cabinet by trading a rare pre-federal United States gold coin. Due to an increase in the demand for rare coins, Mint officials, including Director Snowden, began minting an increasing number of coin restrikes in the 1850s. Several 1804 dollars were struck, and some were sold for personal <b>profit</b> <b>on</b> the part of Mint officials. When he discovered this, Snowden bought back several of the coins. One such coin, which Snowden later added to the Mint cabinet, was struck over an 1857 shooting thaler and became known as Class II, the only such piece of that type known to exist today. Six pieces with edge lettering applied after striking became known as Class III dollars.|$|E
