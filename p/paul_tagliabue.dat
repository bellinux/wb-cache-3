5|$|The Georgetown University men's {{basketball}} team {{is perhaps the}} most well-known Hoya program. Georgetown's first intercollegiate men's {{basketball team}} was formed in 1907. Former Georgetown great Patrick Ewing is the head coach. The Hoyas historically have been well regarded not only for their team success, but also for their ability to generate players that after graduation succeed both on the court, such as Patrick Ewing, and off, such as <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> and Henry Hyde. The team has reached the NCAA Tournament Final Four five times including the 1984 national championship, and has won the Big East Tournament seven times, and has also won or shared the Big East regular season title seven times.|$|E

50|$|Rice had {{publicly}} expressed {{aspirations to}} become the next commissioner of the National Football League and following the announcement of <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue's</b> retirement, she was widely believed to be a serious contender for the post. If appointed to the office, she would have been both the first African American and the first female commissioner of any North American major sports league. However, Rice, a Cleveland Browns fan, said she was not interested in replacing Tagliabue, saying that she preferred to remain as Secretary of State.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Paul</b> John <b>Tagliabue</b> ( [...] ; born November 24, 1940) is {{the former}} Commissioner of the National Football League. He took the {{position}} in 1989 and was succeeded by Roger Goodell, who {{was elected to the}} position on August 8, 2006. Tagliabue's retirement took effect on September 1, 2006. He had previously served as a lawyer for the NFL. Tagliabue served as Chairman of Board of Directors of Georgetown University from 2008 to 2015.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{controversial}} relocation of the Colts to Indianapolis, several {{attempts were made}} to bring an NFL team back to Baltimore. In 1993, ahead of the 1995 league expansion, the city was considered a favorite, behind only St. Louis, to be granted one of two new franchises. [...] League officials and team owners feared litigation due to conflicts between rival bidding groups if St. Louis was awarded a franchise, and in October Charlotte, North Carolina was the first city chosen. Several weeks later, Baltimore's bid for a franchise—dubbed the Baltimore Bombers, in honor of the locally produced Martin B-26 Marauder bomber—had three ownership groups in place and a state financial package which included a proposed $200 million, rent-free stadium and permission to charge up to $80 million in personal seat license fees. [...] Baltimore, however, was unexpectedly passed over in favor of Jacksonville, Florida, despite Jacksonville's minor TV market status and that the city had withdrawn from contention in the summer, only to return with then-Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue's</b> urging. [...] Although league officials denied that any city had been favored, it was reported that Taglibue and his longtime friend Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke had lobbied against Baltimore due to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and that Taglibue had used the initial committee voting system to prevent the entire league ownership from voting on Baltimore's bid. [...] This led to public outrage and the Baltimore Sun describing Taglibue as having an [...] "Anybody But Baltimore" [...] policy. [...] Maryland governor William Donald Schaefer said afterward that Taglibue had led him on, praising Baltimore and the proposed owners while working behind-the-scenes to oppose Baltimore's bid.|$|R
25|$|On July 9, 2017, Kornheiser was {{inducted}} into the Washington, D.C. Sports Hall of Fame alongside such notable names as Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky and former NFL commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue.</b>|$|E
25|$|On November 10, 2005, then-NFL {{commissioner}} <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> {{announced that}} the NFL and city officials had reached a preliminary agreement on bringing an NFL team back to the Coliseum. However, this {{did not come to}} fruition.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, former NFL Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> {{indicated}} {{that if the}} NFL expands again, San Antonio {{would be on the}} short list of candidate cities. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has acknowledged his support for the city's efforts to become home to an NFL franchise even though public opinion is that he would never let go of his team's presence in the San Antonio market.|$|E
25|$|The San Antonio {{metropolitan}} area's smaller {{population has}} so far contributed to its lack of an NFL, MLB, NHL, or MLS team. City officials {{are said to be}} attempting to lure the National Football League permanently to San Antonio. Former NFL Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> stated San Antonio was successful in hosting the New Orleans Saints, and that the city would be on the short list for any future NFL expansions. The city has also hosted the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers preseason camps in the past, and the Cowboys practiced in San Antonio through 2011. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones acknowledged his support for the city to become home to an NFL franchise.|$|E
500|$|Former owner Art Modell's {{relocation}} of the Browns after the 1995 season (to Baltimore creating the Ravens), caused tremendous heartbreak and resentment among local fans. [...] Cleveland mayor, Michael R. White, {{worked with the}} NFL and Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> {{to bring back the}} Browns beginning in 1999 season, retaining all team history. [...] In earlier NFL history, the Cleveland Bulldogs won the NFL Championship in 1924, and the Cleveland Rams won the NFL Championship in 1945 before relocating to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The NFLPA, {{on behalf}} of Will Smith, Scott Fujita and Anthony Hargrove, three players {{suspended}} due to the Bountygate investigation by the NFL, {{filed a lawsuit against}} the league. The investigation found that New Orleans Saints players were allegedly paid bonuses for hits that injured opposing players. The players' lawsuit claimed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell [...] "had violated the league's labor agreement by showing he had pre-determined the guilt of the players punished in the bounty probe before serving as the arbitrator for their June 18 appeal hearing". The suspensions were unanimously overturned by a three-member appeals panel; however, the ruling did not permanently void their suspensions. The NFL appointed former commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> to review the NFL's sanctions against the players, which he overturned.|$|E
500|$|Hess {{and team}} {{president}} Gutman {{agreed on a}} top candidate as new coach — Patriots coach Bill Parcells, who had won two Super Bowls with the Giants {{and was in the}} process of taking the Patriots there as well. [...] Parcells believed that he could void his contract and seek a position elsewhere; New England owner Robert Kraft believed the Patriots would be entitled to compensation. NFL commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> ruled in the Patriots' favor, and New England demanded the Jets give them the first pick overall in the upcoming draft. The Jets responded by hiring Parcells disciple Bill Belichick as head coach; Parcells was to serve as a [...] "consultant" [...] in 1997 and head coach beginning in 1998. The Patriots were unimpressed by what they saw as a subterfuge, and Tagliabue mediated the matter. He set Parcells free from the Patriots; the Jets gave the Patriots four draft picks, including their first round pick in 1999. The Jets put an end to Belichick's six-day reign (he remained as assistant head coach and as defensive coordinator) and hired Parcells as head coach.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the things}} that have marked the modern NFL as {{different}} from other major professional sports leagues is the apparent parity between its 32 teams. While from time to time, dominant teams have arisen, the league has been cited as one of the few where every team has a realistic chance of winning the championship from year to year. [...] The league's complex labor agreement with its players' union, which mandates a hard salary cap and revenue sharing between its clubs, prevents the richest teams from stockpiling the best players and gives even teams in smaller cities such as Green Bay and New Orleans the opportunity to compete for the Super Bowl. [...] One of the chief architects of this labor agreement was former NFL commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue,</b> who presided over the league from 1989 to 2006. [...] In addition to providing parity between the clubs, the current labor contract, established in 1993 and renewed in 1998 and 2006, has kept player salaries low—the lowest among the four major league sports in the United States— and has helped make the NFL the only major American professional sports league since 1993 not to suffer any player strike or work stoppage.|$|E
500|$|The Browns {{improved}} under Davis, and contended {{for a spot}} in the 2001 playoffs until a loss in the 15th {{week against}} Jacksonville that featured {{one of the most controversial}} calls in team history. As time expired in the fourth quarter with the Jaguars ahead 15–10, Couch led a drive into Jacksonville territory. On a fourth-down play that the team needed to convert to stay in the game, Couch threw to receiver Quincy Morgan over the middle. Morgan appeared to bobble the ball before grasping it firmly as he hit the ground. After the pass was ruled complete and Couch spiked the ball to stop the clock, officials reversed Morgan's catch on a Jacksonville challenge. As Davis pleaded his case that the play could not be reviewed because another play had been run, frustrated fans began throwing plastic beer bottles onto the field. Amid the bedlam, later named [...] "bottlegate", officials ended the game with 48 seconds on the clock and left the field as objects rained down on them from the stands. After most of the fans had left, NFL commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> called and ordered the game to be completed. Jacksonville ran down the clock for the win, and the Browns finished the season at 7–9.|$|E
500|$|Culverhouse {{quickly became}} one of the most {{influential}} NFL owners; he served as a member of the Player Club Relations Committee that handled player grievances, and of the NFL Congressional Committee. He was a member of the Executive Committee that handled negotiations during the 1982 NFL strike, an experience that earned him great praise from NFL negotiator Jack Donlan. Donlan praised Culverhouse's logic, analytical, and problem-solving skills, and his effectiveness [...] "at getting his way". Culverhouse was credited with having a big hand in the owners' course of direction during the strike, and was responsible for recruiting Donlan as negotiator. He repeated the role during the 1987 players' strike, after which NFLPA President Gene Upshaw described him as [...] "formidable", and said that [...] "at times, the whole league seemed to flow from this one guy". He was chairman of the NFL Finance Committee and the Management Council Executive Committee. His efforts were instrumental in bringing Super Bowl XVIII to Tampa, despite a lack of adequate hotel space in the city. Culverhouse was also a pioneer in using computers to handle team finances and scouting reports. He was a member of the four-man committee that stripped ownership of the New England Patriots from the Sullivan family when their debt became too great. Patriots founder Billy Sullivan later accused Culverhouse of blocking his effort to propose a stock sale that would have eased the debt. Culverhouse distanced himself from the NFL power core in later years, stung by other owners' criticisms of the Management Council. NFL Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> credited Culverhouse for building much of the strength and unity of the modern NFL.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2006, Bush was {{approached}} {{to become the}} next commissioner of the National Football League. [...] The outgoing commissioner, <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue,</b> was searching for replacements. In response, Bush said on May 24, 2006 that [...] "I'm Governor of the state of Florida and I intend to be Governor until I leave—which is January 2007." [...] Roger Goodell eventually became the new NFL commissioner.|$|E
2500|$|On October 27, 2012, former league {{commissioner}} <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> postponed {{the bounty}} appeals hearing, expecting {{to set a}} new schedule on October 29, 2012. On December 11, with three games left in the regular season, Tagliabue vacated the players' suspensions, saying in his ruling, [...] "I affirm Commissioner Goodell's factual findings as to the four players. I conclude that Hargrove, Smith and Vilma—but not Fujita—engaged in 'conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football ..." [...] He laid primary responsibility for the scandal on Williams and Payton.|$|E
2500|$|Burke's {{older brother}} Patrick Burke {{announced}} {{in a column}} on Outsports.com that the Burke family promised their [...] "unwavering, unremitting, relentless support" [...] {{for the cause of}} equality in sports and to continue working to end homophobia in hockey. [...] Since Brendan's death, his father has continued advocating against homophobia in professional sports, giving speeches at schools, marching in the annual Toronto Pride Parade, and working with former NFL commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue,</b> whose son is also openly gay, through PFLAG. In March 2012, in tribute to Brendan, Patrick and Brian Burke founded the You Can Play campaign to fight homophobia in sports.|$|E
2500|$|Ewbank's {{coaching}} {{style was}} laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. [...] "Weeb combined a low-key style with {{a flair for}} the most dramatic of accomplishments", former NFL commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> said in 1998. [...] "He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred {{to stay in the}} background and let the players take the credit." [...] He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown [...] "had the exact same approach: Don't do too much, but what you do, execute it flawlessly", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays.|$|E
2500|$|Although Parcells {{had decided}} to leave New England, his {{contract}} did not allow him to coach anywhere else. The New York Jets sought Parcells as head coach and general manager after a 4–28 record under Rich Kotite. To circumvent Parcells' contractual obligations, the Jets hired Bill Belichick (then the No.1 assistant to Parcells) as the Jets coach, and then hired Parcells in an [...] "advisory" [...] role. New England threatened legal action against Parcells and the Jets, but NFL Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> brokered a deal between the two sides, with New England releasing Parcells from his contract and the Jets giving New England a third and fourth round pick that year, a second-round pick {{the next year and}} a first-round draft choice the year after that. Jets owner Leon Hess gave Parcells complete control over football operations, the main sticking point in his dispute with Kraft.|$|E
2500|$|Under Rust, the Patriots {{finished}} with the worst season in franchise history in 1990 – a 1–15 record. [...] On the day after {{what turned out to}} be the team's only win that year (against the Colts), the Patriots were thrown into the middle of a sexual harassment scandal when Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson was sexually and verbally assaulted by several Patriots players in the team's locker room and was later labeled a [...] "classic bitch" [...] by Kiam. Following an investigation into the scandal, NFL Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> fined the team $50,000, and players Zeke Mowatt, Michael Timpson and Robert Perryman $12,500, $5,000, and $5,000 respectively. [...] As a final indignity, their season finale against the New York Giants would be one of their few sellouts of the year; however, most of the fans at the game that day were Giants fans. The team lost that game, missing a game-tying field goal in the closing seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Frontiere {{finally gave}} up and decided to move the Rams {{franchise}} to St. Louis. However, on March 15, 1995, the other league owners rejected Frontiere's bid to move the franchise by a 21–3–6 vote. Then-Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> stated after rejecting the move, [...] "This {{was one of the}} most complex issues we have had to approach in years. We had to balance the interest of fans in Los Angeles and in St. Louis that we appreciate very much. In my judgment, they did not meet the guidelines we have in place for such a move." [...] The commissioner also added: [...] "Once the bridges have been burned and people get turned off on a sports franchise, years of loyalty is not respected and it is difficult to get it back. By the same token, there are millions of fans in that area who have supported the Rams in an extraordinary way. The Rams have 50 years of history and the last 5 or so years of difficult times can be corrected." ...|$|E
2500|$|NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell {{responded with}} some of the most severe {{sanctions}} in the league's 92-year history, and among the most severe punishments for in-game misconduct in North American professional sports history. Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams was suspended indefinitely, though this would be overturned the following year. Head coach Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season—the first time in modern NFL history that a head coach has been suspended for any reason. [...] General manager Mickey Loomis was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season. Assistant head coach Joe Vitt was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season. The Saints organization was fined $500,000, and forced to forfeit their second-round draft selections in 2012 and 2013. On May 2, 2012, four current and former Saints players were suspended after being named as ringleaders in the scandal, with linebacker Jonathan Vilma also being suspended for the entire 2012 season—the longest suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history. [...] However, former NFL commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> overturned all sanctions against the players on December 11, 2012 after finding that the coaches were primarily responsible for the scandal.|$|E
2500|$|After the Super Bowl, Parcells {{resigned}} from the Patriots, prompting Kraft to believe the Jets had been tampering with Parcells in an attempt for him to resign and take the Jets' vacant head coaching position and have say in the Jets' first overall selection in the 1997 NFL Draft. The Jets decided that since Parcells couldn't be their head coach in 1997 because of an earlier contract renegotiation which eliminated the 1997 season from his contract, they would hire Parcells as a consultant and have Bill Belichick, the assistant head coach who followed Parcells from the Patriots, hold the title of head coach. Kraft, who was requesting a 1st-round draft pick in return for allowing Parcells to coach elsewhere, called the Jets' agreement [...] "a transparent farce" [...] that [...] "demonstrated it was the Jets' intention all along for Bill Parcells to become {{head coach of the}} Jets for the '97 season." [...] Despite Parcells claiming the Jets had been given league permission for the consulting agreement, the NFL denied any permission was given, instead having commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> arrange an agreement between the two sides. The Patriots received 3rd- and 4th-round picks in the 1997 NFL Draft, a 2nd-round pick in the 1998 Draft, and a 1st-round pick in the 1999 Draft in compensation for allowing Parcells to become the Jets' head coach.|$|E
2500|$|Cleveland NFL Football LLC (Cleveland Browns Trust) {{was formed}} by the NFL. The {{president}} of the trust was Bill Futterer, and NFL Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> was the trustee. The trust represented the NFL in the stadium design and construction, managed the sale of suites and club seats, and sold permanent seat licenses and season tickets. Additionally, the trust reorganized the Browns Backers fan clubs across the United States, resumed coaches' shows on television and radio throughout the state of Ohio, and conducted a dramatic one-year countdown celebration that incorporated the first live Internet broadcast in NFL history. The trust operated its campaign under a [...] "Countdown to '99" [...] theme, using Hall of Famers such as Lou Groza and Jim Brown extensively, and sold nearly 53,000 season tickets—a team record in 1998. It remains {{the only time in}} professional American football history that a league operated a team in absentia to preserve the history of the franchise and to build value in that franchise for the future owner. The NFL sold the Browns as an expansion team in 1998 to former Browns minority owner Al Lerner. The purchase price was a then- North American record $530million, more than double any previous selling price for a professional sports team. Commissioner Tagliabue announced that the Browns would be an expansion team, rather than a relocated team, at the owners' meeting in March 1998.|$|E
2500|$|MTV stated, [...] "The tearing of Janet Jackson's costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, {{completely}} unintentional and was {{inconsistent with}} assurances {{we had about}} the content of the performance. MTV regrets this incident occurred and we apologize to anyone who was offended by it." [...] The network also said, [...] "Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident". A statement from CBS read, [...] "We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended." [...] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands [...] "what a difference one percent can make". NFL Commissioner <b>Paul</b> <b>Tagliabue</b> said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the [...] "tasteful, first-class entertainment" [...] the league expected. FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident [...] "a new low for prime time television". Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, [...] "We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime." [...] An hour-long MTV documentary titled [...] "Making the Super Bowl Halftime Show" [...] was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently.|$|E
