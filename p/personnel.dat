5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF <b>personnel</b> are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF <b>personnel</b> born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson {{has argued that the}} ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more <b>personnel</b> from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E
