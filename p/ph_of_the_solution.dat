5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the <b>pH</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution.</b> The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E

25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the <b>pH</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution.</b> Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using Irish moss.|$|E

2500|$|A pH meter is a {{scientific}} instrument that measures the hydrogen-ion activity in water-based solutions, indicating its {{acidity or alkalinity}} expressed as pH. The pH meter measures the difference in electrical potential between a pH electrode and a reference electrode, and so the pH meter is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "potentiometric pH meter".

2500|$|Solubility is the {{property}} of a solid, liquid, or gaseous chemical substance called solute to dissolve in a solid, liquid, or gaseous solvent. The solubility of a substance fundamentally depends on the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the solute and solvent as well as on temperature, pressure and [...] the <b>pH</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution.</b> The extent of the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent is measured as the saturation concentration, where adding more solute does not increase the concentration of the solution and begins to precipitate the excess amount of solute. The solubility of a substance is an entirely different property from the rate of solution, which is how fast it dissolves.|$|E
