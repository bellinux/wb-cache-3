Departuring from the oldest attempts {{to describe the}} spin within the lagrangian framework we <b>pass</b> <b>throught</b> various non supersymmetric models. Then the component and superfield formulations of the spinning particle and superparticle models are reviewed. Our focus is mainly on the classical side of the problem, but some quantization questions are mentioned as well. ...|$|E
40|$|Principal curves are curves which <b>pass</b> <b>throught</b> the 'mid dle ' of a data cloud. They are {{sensitive}} to variances of data clouds. In this paper, we propose a robust principal curve model- Correntropy based Principal Curve (CPC) model, based on maximum correntropy criterion (MCC). The CPC model approximate the principal curve with k-segments of polygonal line. Employing the half-quadratic technique, the CPC model is optimized in an iteratively way. The CPC model is insen sitive to variances and outliers of data clouds. Extensive ex periments on sythetic and real-life datasets illustrate the robust ness of the CPC model in learning principal curves. Keywords: Pringcipal curves; MCC; ITL; Polygonal lin...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into five {{chapters}}. In the first two chapters I give the overview of clustering data analysis, I present definitions of terms used in the work and describe the k-means algorithm. Third chapter focuses on the filtering algorithm that uses heuristics when algorithm <b>pass</b> <b>throught</b> the MRKD-tree. The fourth chapter describes the x-means algorithm that uses all of the above-mentioned findings. In the fifth chapter I test all algorithms both on artificial and real data from physics. In some cases I refer to the WEKA program where the x-means algorithm is implemented. Algoritms that are discussed in this thesis are intended only for objects described by quantitative variables. They are also suitable for large datasets. In the attached CD I present the implementation of algorithms in Matlab language...|$|E

These works had an important influence in Scaravelli's interpretation of "Critic of pure reason" and other kantian works. Scaravelli's reading of these sources - and the critics of them that he made - <b>passed</b> <b>throught</b> all the composition of his work: "Scritti kantiani".

40|$|Determining {{fatty acid}} methyl or ethyl esters, in the {{presence}} of mono-, di- and tri glycerides, is very important when studying fatty compounds' methanolysis or ethanolysis, as well as for controlling the quality of petrochemical products. This work presents a useful technique for determining fatty acids methyl or ethyl esters by high temperature gas chromastography {{in the presence}} of mono-, di- and triglycerides. Samples were silylated with N, O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluroacetamide (BSTFA) and then <b>passed</b> <b>throught</b> a 12 m HT 5 column coated with a phenyl-polysiloxane-carborane film. Standard methyl and ethyl palmitate, methyl and ethyl oleate, DL-palmitin, dipalmitin, tripalmitin and triolein solutions were used for calibrating the technique, using tricaprin as internal standard. Retention times and response factors were also determined. The results were employed in following-up palm oil methanolysis and ethanolysis reactions...|$|R

It may communicate with the external jugular vein via a branch positioned anterior to the clavicle before emptying into the axillary vein. In this case multiple variations {{were found in the}} veins of the neck region: cephalic vein, jugular vein, and facial vein. The cephalic vein in the left side passed between the clavicular and sternal heads of the pectoralis major muscle. The cephalic and the external jugular veins were joined and made a common trunk at the anterior border of clavicle. Then opened into the junction of the subclavian and internal jugular veins below the clavicle. The facial and retromandibular veins were built up the external jugular vein.

In this study, we simulate the three dimensional wind fields during typical, steady conditions of the Southern Red Sea southeast monsoon season. The simulations verify the existence of a low level jet (LLJ) contained within the highly stratified marine layer over the Southern Red Sea. The LLJ is cause by the channeling and acceleration of marine layer flow as it <b>passes</b> <b>throught</b> the straight of Bab el Mandeb on its way from the Indian Ocean to the Eastern Sahara. The LLJ extends from 12. 5 o N to 14. 5 o N latitude in the Southern Red Sea and has peak velocities at 300 – 600 m elevation above the Red Sea. Sea-land breezes advect the high speed flow of the LLJ onshore along a 200 km streatch of Southeastern Eritrean coastline, producing an excellent wind energy resource that peaks daily at 3 PM.

40|$|Advanced control {{strategies}} for smart windows (SW) {{are discussed in}} this paper. Since smart windows are used both to reduce energy consumption and to improve thermal and visual comfort, the optimal solar flux <b>passing</b> <b>throught</b> the window {{is the result of}} a complex trade-off between daylighting and heat flow balance. A typical office building zone is modeled in TRNSYS with an integrated electrochromic smart window. Two types of advanced SW controllers, i. e. (i) a genetic algorithm based controller and (ii) a model predictive control based controller, are studied and compared to a base case scenario. The advanced controllers evaluate the hour-by-hour state of the smart window required to minimize the overall energy consumption (heating, cooling, lighting) while respecting constraints related to thermal and visual comfort. Results have shown that the two controllers, while presenting different control strategies, offer very similar and promising results in terms of energy savings and peak load reductions. Finally, opportunities resulting from the present work are discussed. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The abducens nerve {{originates}} from a set {{of neural}} cells located in the ventral portion of the pons(1). This cellular nucleus emits axons that attend a ventral course and leaves the brainstem in the pontomedullary sulcus(2, 3). The nerve has a previous anterior and superior trajectory, before it travel throught the dura-mater of the sellar region(2).

40|$|Bone retention, bone augmentation, {{and bone}} {{regeneration}} are central topics in oral surgery, implantology, and periodontology. Bones and teeth {{are the only}} structure within the body where calcium and phosphate participate as functional pillars. Despite their mineral nature, both organs are vital and dynamic. The major sequel from human tooth loss {{is the loss of}} alveolar bone. After tooth extraction, the residual alveolar ridge generally provides limited bone volume because of ongoing, progresive bone resorption. The process of healing on bone defect in the region of alveolar ridge <b>passes</b> <b>throught</b> several stages from the coagulum formation to the mature lameral bone. The healing process within postextraction sites reduces the dimension of the socket over time. Bone grafts and bone graft substitutes support regeneration in bone defects and can be used for bone augmentation. Bone graft substitutes are clasiffied by their origin as autogenous bone grafts, bone graft substitutes (allogenic from human origin and xenogenic materials from animal origin), and synthetic (alloplastic) bone graft substitues, manufactured from mineral raw materials, whose composition is precisely defined and whose availability is is unlimited. Alveolar ridge augmentations are classified according to their morphology and severity. Bone augmentation techniques can be used for the application of socket defect grafting, horizontal ridge augmentation, vertical ridge augmentation, and sinus augmentation. Ridge augmentation methods are therefore very important developments and have so far been promising especially {{in view of the fact}} that life is incresingly prolonged especially in economically well-developed countries and the incidence of the disease is expected to further increase in the future.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between Angelos Sikelianos {{and the ancient}} spirit is well-known and has been the object of extensive research. Within the unique universe of his poetic mythology, the ancient world and its intellectual expressions (poetry, arts, religion, philosophy) constitue for Sikelianos {{the components of the}} Greek cultural diachrony. The intertextual relations between Sikelianos’ poetry and the artistic representations of the great myths of the ancient Greec religion (sculpture and painting) are crucial in order to interpret this universe. Out of these relations, we have chosen the research thematic of the Dionysiac love which represents a key-element {{in order to understand the}} Sikelianos cosmology. Indeed, in the poet’s work, love is of cosmological and religious value. It expresses the original tendency appearing in the union of all thinks and can be related to the Dionysian spirit. Reiterating the significance of the ekphrasis as practiced by the ancient Greek tradition, the expression of the Dionysiac love in the poetic work of Angelos Sikelianos has been affirmed via its links to the Greek vase-painting and the ancient Greek sculpture. We have recorded in a systematic way the texts where the poet <b>passes</b> <b>throught</b> the description of a work of art in order to express the Dionysian spirit. In the frame of an inter-semiotic approach, we attempted to highlight the eventual common codes between poetry and art, in order to assess the profound influence of the ancient Greek spirit on the personality and the work of of Sikelianos. Dans la litterature international, l’ amour est sûrement un sujet privilégié, qui se exprime des façons divers. Dans mon projet de these nous examinerons une variante historique, poetique et très specifique, connue sous le nom de néohellénique dionysiasme”. Ce courant apparaît au debut de 20 eme siècle, porté principalement par les poets de génération littéraire de 1910, dans le plus représentantif est Aggelos Sikelianos. Dans l’ oeuvre de ce poet l’ amour prend une valere global et religieux, exprime la tendance originelle a l’ union de tout chose et se met en rapport avec l’ esprit dionysiaque. Dans notre these nous etudierons en detail les expressions de l’ amour dionysiaque dans l’ oeuvre poetic d’ Aggelos Sikelianos, nous entreprendrons une typologie systématique des cas et nous examinerons la relation avec l’ art et la mythologie du monde grec ancient. Spécifiquemement, a partir de la typologie des expressions de l’ esprit dionysiaque dans la poésie de Sikelianos, nous examinerons les correspodances dans des oeuvres de l’ art grec ancient où le sujet de l’ amour a une dimension dionysiaque et nous montrerons des codes communs entre l’ art ancien et la poésie de Sikelianos...|$|R
