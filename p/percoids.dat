40|$|This article {{describes}} the larval development and ontogenetic changes in diet of Nannatherina balstoni and constitutes the first description of flexion and postflexion larvae for the family Nannopercidae. Larvae were collected from pools in southwestern Australia. Larvae are elongate to moderately deep, lack head spines, have a moderate to large head and are moderately to heavily pigmented. Notochord flexion is complete by approximately 11 mm, i. e., longer than in members of the closely related Percichthyidae (≤ 9 mm). The sequence of fin completion, C, D 2, A, D 1 →P 1 →P 2, also differs to that reported for percichthyids, but is the generalized condition within the <b>percoids.</b> The retention of a prominent notochord tip in postflexion larvae of N. balstoni is a characteristic that occurs in few teleosts.

Three subfamilies are recognized—Epigoninae, Apogoninae and Pseudaminae. The genera of Epigoninae are not treated. The Cheilodipterinae and the Siphaminae are not recognized as subfamilies and the Synagropi- nae are removed from the Apogonidae to the Percichthyidae. Descriptions of 19 genera and 14 subgenera are given. Forty-three genera are placed in synonymy and three new subgenera are proposed: Pristicon, Verulux and Zapogon.

Contrary to modern sperm whales, most ancient sperm whales were built to hunt whales.

These fishes were classified into seven types based on the structural pattern of levator posterior with existence of the supraoccipital crest in mind.

40|$|Information on the {{temporal}} distributions of tropical fish larvae is scarce. Early stage larval fishes were sampled using towed bongo plankton nets at {{sites on the}} southern North West Shelf of Australia (21 ° 49 ′S, 114 ° 14 ′E), between October and February of 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99.

Benthic <b>percoid</b> shorefishes dominated surface assemblages in both summers and this pattern may be typical of tropical shelf environments. The abundance and diversity of larval fishes were lowest in October and increased from November through to February. Assemblages displayed weak cross-shelf patterns, with a few taxa being more abundant at inshore sites (e. g. monacanthids), whereas others were more abundant offshore (e. g. scombrids). Although the composition of assemblages remained relatively consistent, many taxa (e. g. pomacentrids and carangids) showed differences in abundance between summers. Multivariate analyses found no relationships between abundance patterns of larval fishes and biophysical variables, such as temperature, salinity, and zooplankton biomass.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{correlational}} patterns of diet and phylogeny on {{the shape of}} the premaxilla and anterior tooth in sparid fishes (Perciformes: Sparidae) from the western Mediterranean Sea. The premaxilla is less variable, and in spite of the presence of species-specific features, a common structural pattern is easily recognizable in all species (i. e. the ascending and the articular processes are fused in a single branch, as in many <b>percoid</b> fishes). In contrast, tooth shape is more variable, and different structural types can be recognized (e. g. canine-like or incisive). Coupling geometric morphometric and comparative methods we found that the relationship between shape, diet and phylogeny also differs between premaxilla and tooth. Thus, {{the shape of the}} premaxilla is significantly correlated with food type, whereas the shape of the teeth is not correlated with diet, and probably reflects the species phylogenetic relationships.

The breeding habits of this fish closely resembles to some Gobioid or tropical Blennoid fish, the eggs being deposited {{in a single layer}} on the under side of a flat stone near low water mark, where they are guarded by the male parent. The ovarian egg (Fig. 2, A) has double egg-membranes, the outer membrane, when spawned, turns over to form a bundle of adhesive threads (Fig. 2, B).

To date published morphological and molecular phylogenetics hypotheses of sinipercid fish are part congruent, {{and there are some}} areas of significant disagreement with respect to species relationships. The present study used separate and combined methods to analyze 7307 bp of data from three mitochondrial genes (cyt b, CO 1 and 16 S rRNA; approximate to 2312 bp) and three nuclear genes (viperin, the first two introns of S 7 ribosomal protein gene; approximate to 4995 bp) for the attempts to estimate the relationships among sinipercids and to assess the phylogenetic utility of these markers. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and partitioned Bayesian analyses. Despite the detection of significant heterogeneity of phylogenetic signal between the mitochondrial and nuclear partitions, the combined data analysis represented the best-supported topology of all data. The sinipercid fish form a monophyletic group with two distinct clades, one corresponding to the genus Siniperca and the other to Coreoperca. Coreoperca whiteheadi is the sister taxon to Coreoperca herzi plus Coreoperca kawamebari. In the Siniperca, Siniperca undulata is the sister taxon to the other members of Siniperca, within the subclade containing {{the other members of the}} genus, Siniperca chuatsi and Siniperca kneri are sister species, next joined by Siniperca obscura, Siniperca roulei, Siniperca scherzeri and finally by Siniperca fortis.

40|$|The extant sinipercids are a {{group of}} {{freshwater}} <b>percoid</b> fishes endemic to East Asia. A recent mitochondrial cytochrome b phylogeny of sinipercids has challenged some aspects for their traditional taxonomy and molecular phylogeny, especially for the monophyly of Sinipercidae. In this study, we analyzed mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear encoded S 7 ribosomal protein gene intron 1 for 10 sinipercid species and 11 related species to compare the phylogenetic signal and nucleotide substitution properties of these two gene sequences. The length of S 7 intron 1 ranged from 461 to 719 bp, but alignment was not difficult, and the indels, the proportion of which in the total nucleotides ranged from 3. 76 to 45. 83 %, were phylogenetically informative. Our results indicate that: (1) the relative rate presented by cyt b is five times that of S 7 intron 1; (2) the proportion of phylogenetic information is higher in S 7 than in cyt b; (3) S 7 intron 1 has more base composition bias, but more uniform nucleotide substitution properties; (4) the overall ratio between transitions and transversions in S 7 intron 1 is lower than in cyt b. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of aligned S 7 intron 1 and the combined S 7 and cyt b dataset resulted in phylogenies that contained the previously identified genera Siniperca and Coreoperca, whereas the monophyly of Coreoperca cannot be corroborated by separate cyt b analysis. The monophyly of Sinipercidae is not supported in separate and combined dataset analyses, although the alternative hypothesis cannot be significantly rejected based on approximately unbiased tests and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests. Overall, maximum parsimony analyses result in trees {{with a lack of}} phylogenetic resolution in deep nodes, and the signal from S 7 intron 1 conflicts the cyt b signal in the combined dataset analyses.

In this study, early stage larval fishes were sampled using towed bongo plankton nets at sites on the southern North West Shelf of Australia (NWS) (21 º 49 'S, 114 º 14 'E), between October and February of 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99. The first summer was characterised by El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) driven upwelling and high primary productivity, compared to the second summer when water temperatures were warmer and primary production was lower. I examined 9944 fish larvae from 76 families captured with the bongo nets. Benthic <b>percoid</b> shorefishes dominated surface assemblages in both summers and this pattern may be typical of tropical shelf environments. Abundance and diversity of larval fishes were lowest in October and increased from November through to February. Assemblages displayed weak cross-shelf patterns with a few taxa being more abundant at inshore sites (e. g. monacanthids), but others were more abundant offshore (e. g. scombrids). Although the composition of assemblages remained relatively consistent, many taxa (e. g. pomacentrids and carangids) showed differences in abundance between summers. Multivariate analyses found no relationships between abundance patterns of larval fishes and biophysical variables such as temperature, salinity and zooplankton biomass. Seasonal changes in abundance may thus reflect differences in the spawning activities of adult fishes and/or larval survival. Knowledge of the diets of tropical fish larvae is limited to only a few taxa. Here, we describe the diets of 591 individuals from 50 families of tropical larval shorefishes collected off the Northwest Shelf of Australia (21 º 49 'S, 114 º 14 'E), effectively doubling the number of families for which have we dietary data. The diversity of prey items eaten differed significantly among families. The majority of fish larvae ate copepods {{but there were some}} interesting exceptions. Chaetodontids ate only chaetognaths, acanthurids and nemipterids ate appendicularians, and tetraodontids ate predominately non-copepod prey (44...|$|R
40|$|The Regional History Project {{conducted}} {{a series of}} interviews with Kenneth S. Norris, UCSC Professor of Natural History Emeritus, {{in the spring and summer}} of 1998. Halfway through the interviews, Norris, who had been in poor health, was hospitalized unexpectedly and died on August 16, 1998. Rather than publish an incomplete set of his edited interviews, the project was reconceived. We interviewed a group of his colleagues and former students who could discuss many of the topics the interviewer had not had an opportunity to discuss with him. These additional interviews include recollections of Norris’s myriad research interests (desert biology, herpetology, marine mammalogy) and his scientific legacy; his teaching philosophy and how it was so creatively manifested for almost two decades in the celebrated Natural History Field Quarter class; and his founding role in the creation in 1965 of UC’s Natural Reserve System. On October 24, 1998, at the Norris Memorial, held at UCSC, celebrating his life and work, many of his far-flung students and colleagues gathered together from around the country. During that weekend project interviewer Irene Reti, conducted interviews with Stephen R. Gliessman, Donald J. Usner, and Shannon M. Brownlee, for their recollections of the Natural History Field Quarter. Randall Jarrell conducted interviews with Robert M. Norris, William N. McFarland, William F. Perrin, and later, with Roger J. Samuelsen, and Lawrence D. Ford, who discussed the genesis of the NRS and Norris as scientist and naturalist. Norris was born August 11, 1924 in Los Angeles when Southern California was still a rural place with easy access to wild things. His mother and father relished the outdoors and were unusually encouraging of their boys’ naturalist interests. They took Ken and his older brother Robert on many family camping trips and hiking in the mountains and by the time he was about ten, Ken’s taste for natural history and collecting was already well developed. Norris graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1942 and entered UCLA. He served in the U. S. Navy from 1944 until 1948, when he returned to UCLA, and earned his bachelor’s degree in biology in 1948, after having almost completed his degree in geology. When he was a senior he met up with Raymond B. Cowles, who had a transformative influence on the direction of his life. Norris earned a master’s degree in desert zoogeography at UCLA in 1951, with Ray Cowles as his major professor when he wrote his thesis, “The Evolution of the Iguanid, genus Uma. ” He moved from the desert to the sea when he began work towards his Ph. D. under the legendary Carl L. Hubbs, at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. Two years into his doctoral work Norris was hired as the founding curator at the country’s second oceanarium, Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes, California, where he began his pioneering work with marine mammals during the period 1953 to 1960. He continued working on his dissertation on the opaleye, named after its lovely bluegreen eyes, a perch-like fish of the sea chub family Kyphosidae, in which he investigated the effect of water temperatures on this intertidal fish. For the groundbreaking ecological approach he developed in this dissertation, “The Functions of Temperature in the <b>Percoid</b> Fish, Girella nigricans (Ayres),” he received the Mercer Award of the Ecological Society of America for the best study by a young scholar in 1963. He received his Ph. D. from Scripps in 1959 and in the same year Norris returned to UCLA where he was hired as Ray Cowles’s successor and taught biology and herpetology and continued his research on desert reptiles. He was at UCLA until 1972, where he advanced to full professor of Natural History (the only professor of natural history in the UC system). In 1965, due to his efforts, UC’s Natural Reserve System was established under UC President Clark Kerr. While continuing at UCLA on a part-time basis, he became the founding director of the Oceanic Institute in Hawaii, from 1968 until 1971. In 1972, he moved north when he was appointed at UCSC and founded Long Marine Laboratory and the Institute of Marine Sciences. He was Professor of Natural History until he retired in 1990 after eighteen years at UC Santa Cruz. In these interviews Norris and his colleagues discussed the unusually varied range of his scientific discoveries and conservation activities. At UCLA his work as a desert herpetologist and ecologist led to his discoveries of the function of color changes in amphibians and reptiles and of circadian rhythms in snakes. His pioneering investigations in marine mammalogy confirmed dolphin echolocation skills in a series of elegant experiments. Much of what is now known about whales and dolphins, specifically their social and familial interactions is due to his work. His expertise in marine mammalogy also resulted in his strong influence on public policy in the crafting of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972. His leadership and research were also instrumental in the national campaign to reduce the dolphin kill in tuna fishing. Norris was the author of over a hundred scientific papers and several books on dolphins and porpoises...|$|R
