5|$|In March 2007, the FDA {{reported}} {{the results of}} a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. <b>Patients</b> <b>treated</b> with vancomycin could be switched to oxacillin or dicloxacillin if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary.

5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma <b>patients</b> <b>treated</b> in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of <b>patients</b> <b>treated</b> with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIdiopathic {{pulmonary}} {{arterial hypertension}} (IPAH) is characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling. We have reported that high-dose prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2) therapy markedly improved hemodynamics in IPAH patients and that PGI 2 induced apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells obtained from IPAH patients. PGI 2 {{is thought to have}} reverse remodeling effects, although it has not been histologically confirmed. In a case series, we examined the reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling effects of PGI 2 in lung tissues obtained from an IPAH <b>patient</b> <b>treated</b> with high-dose PGI 2 and an IPAH <b>patient</b> not <b>treated</b> with PGI 2. Apoptotic cells were detected in small pulmonary arteries of the IPAH <b>patient</b> <b>treated</b> with high-dose PGI 2 but not in those from the IPAH <b>patient</b> not <b>treated</b> with PGI 2. Media of peripheral pulmonary arteries were thick in the IPAH <b>patient</b> not <b>treated</b> with PGI 2. On the other hand, media of peripheral pulmonary arteries were thin in the IPAH <b>patient</b> <b>treated</b> with high-dose PGI 2. The single case report suggested that high-dose PGI 2 therapy has the potential for reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling by induction of apoptosis and reduction of medial hypertrophy. Accumulation of cases is needed for the application to generalized effect of high-dose PGI 2. <Learning objective: Reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling would provide further improvement in patients with IPAH. High-dose PGI 2 therapy has the potential for reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling in patients with IPAH. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{reviewing}} 6 {{cases the}} authors {{conclude that the}} principal advantage of osteotaxis {{is that it allows}} the mobilization at an early stage of all the joints, so avoiding joint stiffness and muscular atrophy. The passage of the pins through the muscular mass, however, may sometimes temporarily limit the mobilization because of inflammatory reactions. It appears that a <b>patient</b> <b>treated</b> by osteotaxis will more rapidly resume his usual life than another <b>patient</b> <b>treated</b> orthopedically. The complications of pseudoarthrosis and postoperative infection that are relatively frequent after surgical treatment are to a great extent avoided by the use of osteotaxis.
