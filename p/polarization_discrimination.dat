Optical films containing scatterer particles are used in these systems. Therefore, dielectric scatterer particles are greatly needed to be analyzed for their optical scattering properties, and especially for polarizing effects. Depending on the sizes relative to the wavelength and {{the shape of the}} particles various computation approaches have been developed based on electromagnetic scattering theories such as Mie scattering, T-matrix methods etc [...] . Simulation programs of these approaches have been examined and applied for spherical and nonspherical particles. In general, for the particles those a few times large in size compared to the incident wavelength, the polarization differentiation is insignificant for a spherical particle compared to a spheroid one. And, the prolate spheroids with higher aspect ratio have been able to produce most significant differentiating figures. Polarization measurements have been carried on commercially available dielectric optical films of two different set and also on the films with/without nonspherical zeolite particles prepared in the laboratory.

Without OUT, the XPD is solely determined by antenna cross-polarization isolation (XPI) [23], that is often rather good within the antenna main radiation lobe (23 dB in our case), but it may strongly decrease outside. In order to avoid that the XPD evaluation is shadowed by the poor antenna XPI for some line of sight (LoS) Rx locations, a proper time gating has been therefore applied to the impulsive responses to remove the LoS contribution from the co- and cross-polarized received power values. Despite the propagation delays of the signal contributions coming from the OUT may be very close to the LoS delay for some Rx locations, a sufficient accuracy can be expected on the average due to the excellent time resolution of the measurement equipment (~ 0.15  ns).|$|R

40|$|Summary Inequality between {{identity}} {{groups has}} long been thought of as an important contributor to social unrest and violence {{as well as being}} important in assessing the justice of societies. Yet, the measurement {{of the ways in which}} such groups differ and are unequal remains underdeveloped. Accordingly, this paper introduces three distinct but interlinked concepts relating to inequality between groups which can be used in empirical estimation of group based inequality. We define and discuss the concepts of representational inequality, sequence inequality, and group inequality comparison. Representational inequality captures the extent to which a given level of attribute is shared between members of distinct groups, sequence inequality captures the extent to which groups are ordered hierarchically in their possession of the attribute and group inequality comparison captures the extent to which differences between groups account for the overall inequality of individuals. These concepts can be used to measure the degree of segregation, clustering, and polarization between groups. In order to illustrate the merit of these concepts and their joint application to understanding group based inequality we provide an example using Demographic and Health Surveys data for five societies. It may be seen that the choice of measures is greatly consequential in applied work. identity inequality segregation <b>polarization</b> clustering groups <b>discrimination</b> conflict...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} experimentally the relationships between cross-polarization discrimination (XPD), signal cross correlation, and polarization diversity gain with horizontally/vertically (HV) polarized reception at the base-station (BS) end at 1800 MHz. The performance of the horizontal/vertical polarization diversity scheme was also compared with a diversity scheme with 645 slanted polarizations and horizontal space diversity at 1800 MHz in a personal communication system (PCS) mobile network. A measurement campaign was conducted in small/micro cells in different types of areas, taking into account the influence of mobile antenna inclination. According to the measurements, XPD values for horizontal/vertical polarizations vary between 5 – 15 dB, depending on the environment. Furthermore, XPD values depend highly on the radio propagation path between the BS and mobile station (MS) due to line-of-sight (LOS) and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) situations. Signal cross correlations of horizontal and vertical polarizations in both LOS and NLOS situations were clearly below 0. 7, which is the generally accepted value to have a reasonable improvement at the receiving end with diversity. Finally, the results showed that almost equal diversity gain and system performance in a PCS network at 1800 MHz can be achieved in small/micro cells in different environments with 645 slanted polarizations at the BS end when comparing results with horizontal space diversity. The performance of horizontal/vertical polarization diversity scheme was approximately 1 dB worse than horizontal space diversity.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we review}} the Receiver Function (RF) method, {{conceived}} {{many years ago}} in earthquake seismology, to see whether {{it can also be}} used in reflection seismology, and more specifically to see whether it can be applied to ocean-bottom-cable (OBC) data. The conventional RF method is used to determine the local PS wave response of a target zone below a multi-component 3 C receiver and has been originally designed to process individual earthquake data of constant ray parameter p, acquired at the free surface. The target is illuminated from below. The converted PS wavefield generated at the receiver side is isolated from the global earth response by deconvolving the horizontal Ux component with the vertical Uz component, where Uz is assumed to contain only the impinging P waves (i. e. the unpredictable effective source function). Simultaneously to the source signature removal, the effect of the deconvolution can be subdivided into two steps: (1) P-PS wave separation and (2) multiples removal. The keyword is combination between components (by adaptive subtraction) or equivalently ratio between components. Our motivation is to reproduce these two steps with OBC data, {{in order to determine the}} (separated) primary PP and PS responses generated in the sub-seafloor area. However, there are several issues that require special attention when we implement the RF technique to OBC acquisition geometry. Firstly, the target (i. e. the sub-seafloor) is illuminated from above. Therefore there exist three types of incident waves at the receiver level: the upgoing P and PS wavefields (Pup and Sup as for land data) but also the additional downgoing P wavefield (Pdown). Secondly these wavefields are mixed between the components with time varying ray parameters, which precludes the possibility of applying the RF approach in the conventional time-offset domain. These problems can be addressed by taking into account the additional measurement of the pressure wavefield by the hydrophone Uh and by transforming the data in the ¿ -p domain (requiring fine receiver spacing usually afforded by OBCs). This transformation reorders the data by incidence angle at the receiver level, such that the pure upgoing PP and PS wavefields can be separated, based on <b>polarization</b> angle <b>discrimination.</b> This first step partially addresses the problem of multiples in the data by removing the downgoing (receiver side) water multiples, but it requires the knowledge of the seafloor properties as inputs. The other advantage of the ¿ ¡ p domain is that the water multiple reverberation becomes periodic. Remaining pure upgoing (source-side) water multiples are fully predictable (in contrast to overlapping source-side and receiver-side multiples) and can therefore be removed using predictive deconvolution (this is the required second step). Our adapted version of the RF technique uses the various ratios between components to estimate the elastic properties at the seafloor, as well as calibration operators, required for the decomposition. Our data-driven method can be automatically applied with a minimum of user-defined inputs, by taking advantages of the coherency between adjacent p traces and the redundancy of informations within the multiples. The strategy has been successfully applied to field data. Our results suggest several avenues for further processingPARIS-BIUSJ-Sci. Terre recherche (751052114) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
