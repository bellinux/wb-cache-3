25|$|Side reins are {{adjusted}} {{longer for}} less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened, and raised higher (from <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{up to the}} point of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. For green horses, the side reins are adjusted so that the horse can take contact with the bit, but does not have to flex beyond its abilities. A good starting point is to adjust the reins so the green horse carries its head approximately 4inches in front of the vertical. In any case, the head is not to be pulled behind the vertical.|$|E
2500|$|Shoulder: {{made up of}} the scapula and {{associated}} muscles, runs from the withers to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> (the joint {{at the front of the}} chest, i.e. the glenoid); the angle of the shoulder has a great effect on the horse's movement and jumping ability, and is an important aspect of equine conformation ...|$|E
2500|$|The leopard complex colors, {{characteristic}} of the Appaloosa breed, have several manifestations that feature mixtures of white and colored hairs. A varnish roan, one type of leopard complex coat color also called [...] "marble", is an all-over blend of white and colored hairs. Patches of skin that lie close to the bone, such as on the face and legs, and the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> and point of hip, do not grow as much white hair. These darker patches are called [...] "varnish marks" [...] and are not found in true roans. Varnish roans can also be distinguished from true roans {{by the presence of}} leopard complex characteristics, such as the white sclera, finely striped hooves, and mottled skin around the eyes, muzzle, and genitals.|$|E
5000|$|Width of {{the chest}} is {{measured}} from shoulder to <b>shoulder,</b> at the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bony areas {{retain their}} pigment longer. These areas include {{the bridge of}} the nose and cheekbones, ears, <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> and stifle, as well as the legs.|$|R
50|$|Chest ShapeWhen {{viewing the}} chest from the front, the chest should be wider {{at the bottom}} than at the top. The {{shoulder}} blades should be much closer together at their tops, toward their withers, than at the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulders</b> where the front legs attach.|$|R
5000|$|The length can be {{determined}} {{by looking at the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> to the point of elbow.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shoulder}} blade, {{measured from}} the top of the withers to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder,</b> lies in an upright position, particularly as it follows the scapular spine. Often accompanies low withers.|$|E
50|$|The arm bone is {{from the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> to the elbow, it is covered in heavy muscle {{and serves as a}} {{leverage}} point for the muscle of the front leg attached near the elbow.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the sternum is {{level with}} the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{shoulder}} seam {{runs from}} the neckline to the armscye, usually at the highest <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
50|$|The pectoralis minor {{depresses}} the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder,</b> {{drawing the}} scapula inferior, towards the thorax, and throwing its inferior angle posteriorly.|$|R
5000|$|The horse has {{an oblique}} angle of {{shoulder}} (measured {{from the top}} of the withers to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder)</b> with the withers set well behind the elbow. Often accompanies a deep chest and high withers.|$|E
5000|$|... {{instead of}} trying to {{visualize}} where the bones of the arm and shoulder are to get the above angle measured, the judge could use the angle between then <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> and the humerus, which should be at the angle of around 85 degrees.|$|E

5000|$|The body is {{approximately}} 15% {{longer than the}} height and is measured horizontally, from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder</b> to a vertical line {{at the rear of}} the rump.|$|R
5000|$|Should form a {{vertical}} {{line from the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder</b> down to the paws, with the elbows held close and parallel to the chest when viewed from the front.|$|R

50|$|The neck {{is short}} and {{slightly}} round, generally arched, the shoulder rather straight and strong. The withers are quite prominent and tends to be noyé, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> is open, the chest goes down and the flanks are rounded. The back is short, and wide, the loins short, powerful and well attached. The Croup is double, slightly tilted but not bent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{front legs}} come too far {{back under the}} body, giving a bulky {{appearance}} to the breast as viewed from the side. The front legs lie behind a line drawn from the withers to the ground, setting the horse under himself. It {{is often associated with}} a long shoulder blade that drops the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> somewhat low with the arm bone relatively horizontal, setting the elbow more to the rear.|$|E
50|$|The bareback rider {{does not}} use a saddle or rein, but uses a rigging that {{consists}} of a leather and rawhide composite piece often compared to a suitcase handle attached to a surcingle and placed just behind the horse's withers. The rider leans back and spurs with an up and down motion from the horse's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> toward the rigging handle, spurring at each jump in rhythm with {{the motion of the}} horse.|$|E
50|$|The acromioclavicular joint, or AC joint, {{is a joint}} at the top <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder.</b> It is the {{junction}} between the acromion (part of the scapula that forms the highest <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder)</b> and the clavicle. It is a plane synovial joint.|$|R
40|$|An eight-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse was {{admitted}} to Stange Memorial Clinic on July 23, 1953, with an extensive laceration on its left side. The wound began about eight inches behind the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder</b> and extended well back into its flank. It was about six inches deep just above the stifle and the wound gaped widely; {{there was also a}} small laceration on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder.</b> The course and damage may be seen in Figure 1. Sight was gone from the left eye, this presumably being a predisposing factor to the injury which occurred when the animal brushed against the top of a metal fence post...|$|R

50|$|While a toy dog, Havanese are {{sturdy and}} not overly delicate. Most are 10 to 16 lb and 8.5 to 11.5 in, with the ideal being 9 to 10.5 {{in at the}} withers. The body, {{measured}} from <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> to point of buttocks, is slightly longer than the height at the withers, giving the dog the appearance of being slightly longer than tall. The length of the body results from the long ribcage, not the loins.|$|E
50|$|Dogs stand 23½ {{inches and}} bitches 22 inches, {{measured}} at the withers. One inch taller or shorter than the ideal is acceptable. Males weigh between 70 and 84 pounds. Females weigh between 57 and 71 pounds. The Bergamasco is a muscular, heavy-boned herding dog with plenty of substance. The Bergamasco is very slightly longer than tall, with the length of body measured from <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> to point of buttocks about 5 to 6 percent longer than the height {{measured at the}} withers.|$|E
50|$|Side reins are {{adjusted}} {{longer for}} less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened and raised higher (from <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{up to the}} point of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. Side reins should never be so short that the horse's head is pulled behind the vertical. For green horses, the side reins should be adjusted so that the horse's head is approximately 4 inches in front of the vertical and the side reins are attached at a point level with the point of the shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|Omotransversarius: {{originates}} in the atlas and the cervical vertebrae (C2-C4), continues down dorsal to the brachiocephalicus to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder,</b> then combines with the trapezius and inserts into the humerus. Helps raise the scapula {{and move the}} limb forward.|$|R
50|$|The iHunch is characterised by {{a posture}} {{with the head}} sitting {{somewhat}} forward <b>of</b> the <b>shoulders</b> (i.e., the ear lobe is anterior to a vertical line through the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder</b> (acromion process)). This can be very marked, {{with the back of}} the skull positioned anterior to the breastbone (sternum). The chin is poked forward.|$|R

5000|$|By adulthood, the varnish roan {{usually has}} a base coat of intermingled dark and white hairs, though more white hairs than dark, with mottled skin, color {{mainly on the}} cheeks of the face, and around the knees. The darker areas remain at bony points (on the face, usually in a {{distinct}} V {{on the bridge of}} the nose; on the cheeks, <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoulder,</b> elbows, knees, point of hips, hock) and it can be seasonal as well. Although classic roans are roan from birth, varnish roans are often born with spots and [...] "roan out" [...] as they age. A horse's appearance can change almost completely, although the original markings are usually visible.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{neckline}} is ascending {{then the}} only qualification {{of the formation}} {{lies in the fact}} that the lowest <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the right <b>shoulder</b> must be noticeably lower than the peak <b>of</b> the left <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
