[...] The rove beetles are a large family, having almost 2,900 species in North America. This species can be found in woods and wherever carrion is found, usually from the spring to autumn months. These active beetles fly swiftly or run rapidly over the ground with the tip of the abdomen raised like a scorpion's stinger.

40|$|Coleoptera occupy three rather {{distinct}} seashore habitats: the intertidal zone, {{sandy beaches}} and salt-mudflats. In our fauna, about 75 species are coastdwellers. More than 50 % {{belongs to the}} Carabidae and Staphylinidae of which the last is predominant. The species are after ecological factors classified in three major groups: halobiontic, halophilous and haloxene species. Most typical coastbeetles are found beneath wrack and algae, a small group is carnivorous and phytophagous, and only one species {{is known to be}} <b>parasitic.</b> <b>Most</b> of the species are very local or rare and only a few can be recognized as common.

40|$|Plants {{are one of}} the {{two major}} groups of living organisms that are an {{essential}} entity to the function of the biosphere. Plants can be found in all known parts of the earth, in all shapes and sizes. They include the green algae, mosses, ferns, vines, grasses, bushes, herbs, flowering plants and trees. Although some plants are <b>parasitic,</b> <b>most</b> produce their own food through photosynthesis. Most plants initiate from a seed. The importance of plants in the food chain dates back to ancient times. The first humans gathered wild plants for food. As settlements developed, food crops were cultivated, leading to selection of high-yielding cultivated varieties to feed the growing populations. Unlike plants, humans and other animals are unable to manufacture their own food. Therefore, they are dependent, directly or indirectly, on plants. Plants are found in natural ecosystems such as rain forests, and also in agricultural areas and urbanized settings. They are an essential part of our daily lives providing food, clean air, and important ecosystem functions. The study of plants and their function could be considered the most complex of interactions. From the time a seed germinates, it goes through a myriad of physiological processes that can be closely studied using modern tools and molecular biological methods. An open access journal such as Plants will give millions of readers access to that information around the world...|$|E
50|$|Seed {{germination}} of parasitic plants {{occurs in}} a variety of ways. These means can either be chemical or mechanical and the means used by seeds often depends on whether or not the parasites are root parasites or stem parasites. <b>Most</b> <b>parasitic</b> plants need to germinate in close proximity to their host plants because their seeds are limited in the amount of resources necessary to survive without nutrients from their host plants. Resources are limited {{due in part to the}} fact that <b>most</b> <b>parasitic</b> plants are not able to use autotrophic nutrition to establish the early stages of seeding.|$|R
40|$|Among {{factors which}} may {{diminish}} plant populations, there also the <b>parasitic</b> fungi. <b>Most</b> endangered tracheophytes {{seem to be}} those of coastal areas. In recent years almost all European beaches suffered profound modifications due to tourism. As a consequence of beach transformation, littoral plant populations decreased dramatically. There are needed urgent measures, if still possible. Parasitic fungi may contribute also to the decline of some littoral plant populations. A state of equilibrium has bean reached indeed by a long term coevolution, but this can sometimes be fragile...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A fully model-based {{nonlinear}} embedding {{device model}} including low- and high-frequency dispersion effects is implemented for the Angelov device model and successfully demonstrated for load modulation power-amplifier (PA) applica-tions. Using this nonlinear embedding device model, any desired PA {{mode of operation}} at the current source plane can be pro-jected to the external reference planes to synthesize the required multi-harmonic source and load terminations. A 2 -D identifica-tion of the intrinsic PA operation modes is performed first at the current source reference planes. For intrinsic modes defined without lossy <b>parasitics,</b> <b>most</b> of the required source impedance terminations will exhibit a substantial negative resistance after projection to the external reference planes. These terminations can then be implemented by active harmonic injection at the input. It is verified experimentally for a 15 -W GaN HEMT class-AB mode that, using the second harmonic injection synthesized by the embedding device model at the input, yields an improved drain efficiency of up to 5 % {{in agreement with the}} simulation. A figure-of-merit is also introduced to evaluate the efficacy of the nonlinear embedding PA design methodology in achieving the targeted intrinsic mode operation given the model accuracy.

5000|$|The thyroid is {{normally}} very resistant to infection.

50|$|Ophionyssus natricis or Reptile mite is a <b>parasitic</b> mite <b>most</b> {{commonly}} found on snakes, but also occurring on captive lizards, turtles, crocodiles and other reptiles.

Also this provides a point of entry where diseases from Aeromonas spp. and Inclusion Body Disease (IBD) can be transmitted. Mites have also been shown to act as vectors for IBD. The pathology for disease transmission by the mites is still unknown. Human infestation has been reported.|$|R

40|$|Diseases {{resulting}} from zoonotic transmission of parasites are common.

This review aims to bring together the current data available on global burden estimates of parasitic zoonoses and indicate any changes in the trends of these diseases. There is a clear need of such information as interventions to control zoonoses are often in their animal hosts. The costs of such interventions together with animal health issues will drive the cost effectiveness of intervention strategies. What is apparent is that collectively, parasitic zoonoses probably have a similar human disease burden {{to any one of}} the big three human infectious diseases: malaria, tuberculosis or HIV in addition to animal health burden. Although the global burden for <b>most</b> <b>parasitic</b> zoonoses is not yet known, the major contributors to the global burden of parasitic zoonoses are toxoplasmosis, food borne trematode infections, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, leishmaniosis and zoonotic schistosomosis.
