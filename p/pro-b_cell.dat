40|$|Studies {{presented}} here {{show that the}} expression of CD 4, MHC class II (Ia,) and B 220 cleanly resolves a major and a minor subset within the earliest <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> population (germ-line pro-B) in adult bone marrow (BM). The major subset expresses intermediate B 220 and low CD 4 levels. The minor subset, which constitutes roughly 20 % of the adult germ-line pro-B, expresses very low B 220 levels and does not express CD 4. Ia is clearly detectable at low levels on the major germ-line pro-B subset, both in wild-type adult mice and in gene-targeted mice (RAG 2 −/− and μMT), in which B cell development terminates before the pre-B cell stage. A small proportion of cells in the more mature <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> subsets (Hardy Fractions B and C) also express Ia at this level. In contrast, Ia levels on the minor subset are barely above (or equal to) background. Surprisingly, the major germ-line <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> subset found in adults is missing in fetal and neonatal animals. All of the germ-line pro-B in these immature animals express a phenotype (very low B 220, no CD 4, or Ia) {{similar to that of}} the minor <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> subset in adult BM. Because B cell development in fetal/neonatal animals principally results in B- 1 cells, these findings demonstrate that the B- 1 development pathway does not include the major germ-line pro-B subset found in adult BM and hence identify a very early difference between the B- 1 and - 2 development pathways...|$|E

This clone has the phenotype B 220 +, BP- 1 +, HSA +, CD 43 + λ 5 +, and CD 25 -, and has its Ig locus in a germline configuration. G 12 cells spontaneously express cell-surface MHC class II molecules, although to a much lesser extent than the mature M 12. 4. 1 B-cell lymphoma. G 12 cells can process and present the native Hen Egg Lysozyme (HEL) to an MHC class II-restricted T-cell hybridoma. The efficiency of presentation is inferior to that obtained with M 12. 4. 1 cells.

40|$|The 5 ' {{end of the}} IgH locus {{contains}} a cluster of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, one of which (HS 1) was shown to be <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> specific and to contain binding sites for the transcription factors PU. 1, E 2 A, and Pax 5. These data {{as well as the}} location of the hypersensitive sites at the 5 ' border of the IgH locus suggested a possible regulatory function for these elements with respect to the IgH locus. To test this notion, we generated mice carrying targeted deletions of either the <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> specific site HS 1 or the whole cluster of DNaseI hypersensitive sites. Lymphocytes carrying these deletions appear to undergo normal development, and mutant B cells do not exhibit any obvious defects in V(D) J recombination, allelic exclusion, or class switch recombination. We conclude that deletion of these DNaseI hypersensitive sites does not have an obvious impact on the IgH locus or B cell development...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{bone marrow}} {{cultures}} have been useful in determining gene expression patterns in pre-B cells {{and in the}} identification of cytokines such as interleukin 7 (IL- 7). We have developed a culture system to selectively grow populations of B lineage restricted progenitors (<b>pro-B</b> <b>cells)</b> from murine bone marrow. <b>Pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> do not grow in response to IL- 7, Steel locus factor (SLF), or a combination of the two. c-kit, the SLF receptor, and the IL- 7 receptor are both expressed by <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells,</b> indicating that the lack of response is not simply due to the absence of receptors. Furthermore, SLF is not necessary for the growth of <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> since they could be expanded on a stromal line derived from Steel mice that produces no SLF. IL- 7 responsiveness in pre-B cells is associated with an increase in n-myc expression and is correlated with immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements. Although members of the ets family of transcription factors and the Pim- 1 kinase are expressed by <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells,</b> n-myc is not expressed. <b>Pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> maintain Ig genes in the germline configuration, which is correlated with a low level of recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (Rag- 1 and 2) mRNA expression, but high expression of sterile mu and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. <b>Pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> are unable to grow separated from the stromal layer by a porous membrane, indicating that stromal contact is required for growth. These results suggest that <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> are dependent on alternative growth signals derived from bone marrow stroma and can be distinguished from pre-B cells by specific patterns of gene expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{potential of}} hematopoietic progenitors is restricted {{early on to}} either the erythromyeloid or lymphoid lineages. The broad developmental potential of Pax 5 –/– <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> is in apparent conflict with such a strict separation, although these progenitors realize the myeloid and erythroid potential with lower efficiency compared to the lymphoid cell fates. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the transcription factors C/EBPα, GATA 1, GATA 2 and GATA 3 strongly promoted in vitro macrophage differentiation and myeloid colony formation of Pax 5 –/– <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells.</b> GATA 2 and GATA 3 expression also resulted in efficient engraftment and myeloid development of Pax 5 –/– <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo. The myeloid transdifferentiation of Pax 5 –/– <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> was accompanied by the rapid activation of myeloid genes and concomitant repression of B-lymphoid genes by C/EBPα and GATA factors. These data identify the Pax 5 –/– <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> as lymphoid progenitors with a latent myeloid potential that can be efficiently activated by myeloid transcription factors. The same regulators were unable to induce a myeloid lineage switch in Pax 5 +/+ <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells,</b> indicating that Pax 5 dominates over myeloid transcription factors in B-lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|During aging, {{adaptive}} immunity is severely compromised, {{due in part}} to decreased production of B lymphocytes and loss of immunoglobulin (Ig) diversity. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie age-associated diminished B cell production remain unclear. Using in vivo labeling, we find that this reduction in marrow pre–B cells reflects increased attrition during passage from the <b>pro–B</b> to pre–B <b>cell</b> pool. Analyses of reciprocal bone marrow chimeras reveal that the magnitude and production rates of pre–B cells are controlled primarily by microenvironmental factors, rather than intrinsic events. To understand changes in <b>pro–B</b> <b>cells</b> that could diminish production of pre–B cells, we evaluated rag 2 expression and V(D) J recombinase activity in <b>pro–B</b> <b>cells</b> at the single cell level. The percentage of <b>pro–B</b> <b>cells</b> that express rag 2 is reduced in aged mice and is correlated with both a loss of V(D) J recombinase activity in <b>pro–B</b> <b>cells</b> and reduced numbers of pre–B cells. Reciprocal bone marrow chimeras revealed that the aged microenvironment also determines rag 2 expression and recombinase activity in <b>pro–B</b> <b>cells.</b> Together, these observations suggest that extrinsic factors in the bone marrow that decline with age are largely responsible for less efficient V(D) J recombination in <b>pro–B</b> <b>cells</b> and diminished progression to the pre–B cell stage.

40|$|The {{candidate}} oncoprotein BCL- 3 {{has been}} shown to function as a transcriptional co-activator for homodimers of NF-kappaB p 50 and p 50 B. We expressed BCL- 3 ectopically in <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> lines and found that these cells exhibited a dramatic increase in nuclear kappaB motif binding activity of p 50 homodimers containing BCL- 3 in the complex. Co-transfection and in vitro reconstitution experiments revealed that the complex of p 50 with its precursor p 105 (p 50 -p 105), which was shown to accumulate in the cytoplasm of the <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> lines, is required for induction of DNA binding of p 50 homodimers by BCL- 3. However, we could see no in vivo or in vitro evidence of a BCL- 3 -induced increase in proteolytic processing. Instead, BCL- 3 -mediated reorganization of NFKB 1 subunits was demonstrated in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining clearly demonstrated that the transition from cytoplasmic p 50 -p 105 to nuclear p 50 homodimers was induced by BCL- 3 expression. Thus BCL- 3 has versatile functions: cytoplasmic activation of p 50 homodimers, their nuclear translocation and, as previously shown, modulation of the transcriptional machinery in the nucleus...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{addition}} of interleukin- 3 (IL- 3) abrogated the B-cell potential of primary colonies supported by IL- 11, erythropoietin, IL- 7 and steel factor. However, the mechanism by which IL- 3 exerts its inhibitory role is not understood. Using a variant of the mouse <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> line Ba/F 3 which expresses both IL- 3 and IL- 11 receptors, we showed that pretreatment of these cells with IL- 3 before stimulation by IL- 11 suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). This inhibition occurred within 30 min and required the synthesis of a negative regulator. The onset of IL- 3 -dependent inhibition was correlated temporally with the appearance of SOCS- 3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling- 3) protein. In addition, overexpression of SOCS- 3 in the <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> line effectively blocked STAT 3 activation induced by IL- 11. These findings establish that a cytokine (IL- 3) that has been shown to modulate its own signal of activation is also able to down-regulate signalling activated by a different cytokine (IL- 11). This cross-talk involves activation of the JAK (Janus kinase) /STAT signalling pathway, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and is mediated, at least in part, by SOCS- 3...|$|E

We assessed whether Pax 5 (-/-) pro-B cells that were also rendered deficient for the linker for activation of T cells (LAT), an adaptor essential for T cell receptor signaling, {{can be used for}} the rapid in vivo analysis of mutant forms of LAT. We showed that Pax 5 (-/-) Lat(-/-) <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> lines can be infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing a LAT cDNA and sorted for the expression of LAT. When injected into Rag 1 (-/-) mice, they restore normal intrathymic T cell development and give rise to functional peripheral T cells. Considering that the handling of Pax 5 (-/-) <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> lines is easier than that of bone marrow hematopoietic precursors, we used them for the rapid functional analysis of a novel Lat allelic series. When compared to knock-in and transgenic approaches, a major advantage of our Pax 5 (-/-) pro-B cell-based experimental approach consists in the production of mice bearing a given mutation within 2 - 3 months. Therefore, it constitutes a powerful first-line screen for mutations worth fastidious knock-in approaches...|$|E

40|$|Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cutaneous fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, and kidney malignancies. Affected individuals carry germ line mutations in folliculin (FLCN), a {{tumor suppressor gene}} that becomes biallelically inactivated in kidney tumors by second-hit mutations. Similar to other factors implicated in kidney cancer, FLCN {{has been shown to}} modulate activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, its precise in vivo function is largely unknown because germ line deletion of Flcn results in early embryonic lethality in animal models. Here, we describe mice deficient in the newly characterized folliculin-interacting protein 1 (Fnip 1). In contrast to Flcn, Fnip 1 -/- mice develop normally, are not susceptible to kidney neoplasia, but display a striking <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> block that is entirely independent of mTOR activity. We show that this developmental arrest results from rapid caspase-induced pre-B cell death, and that a Bcl 2 transgene reconstitutes mature B-cell populations, respectively. We also demonstrate that conditional deletion of Flcn recapitulates the <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> arrest of Fnip 1 -/- mice.

Analysis of adult BM for the correlated expression of la both with heat stable antigen (HSA) and BP- 1 on B lineage cells revealed In both cases a small fraction of cells expressing either the HSA or BP- 1 but lacking la.

The frequency of ETV 6 /RUNX 1 fusions in newborns clearly exceeds the leukemia rate revealing that additional events occur in ETV 6 /RUNX 1 -positive cells for leukemic transformation. Hitherto, the mechanisms triggering these second hits remain largely elusive. Thus, we generated a novel ETV 6 /RUNX 1 transgenic mouse model where {{the expression of the}} fusion protein is restricted to CD 19 + B cells. These animals harbor regular B cell development and lack gross abnormalities. We established stable <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> lines carrying the ETV 6 /RUNX 1 transgene that allowed us to investigate whether ETV 6 /RUNX 1 itself favors the acquisition of second hits.

40|$|The MYC {{family of}} {{cellular}} oncogenes includes c-Myc, N-myc, and L-myc, which encode transcriptional regulators {{involved in the}} control of cell proliferation and death. Accordingly, these genes become aberrantly activated and expressed in specific types of cancers. For example, c-Myc translocations occur frequently in human B lymphoid tumors, while N-myc gene amplification is frequent in human neuroblastomas. The observed association between aberrations in particular MYC family genes and specific subsets of malignancies might reflect, at least in part, tissue-specific differences in expression or function of a given MYC gene. Since c-Myc and N-myc share substantial functional redundancy, another factor that could influence tumor-specific gene activation would be mechanisms that target aberrations (e. g., translocations) in a given MYC gene in a particular tumor progenitor cell type. We have previously shown that mice deficient for the DNA Ligase 4 (Lig 4) nonhomologous DNA end-joining factor and the p 53 tumor suppressor routinely develop progenitor (pro) -B cell lymphomas that harbor translocations leading to c-Myc amplification. Here, we report that a modified allele in which the c-Myc coding sequence is replaced by N-myc coding sequence (NCR allele) competes well with the wild-type c-Myc allele as a target for oncogenic translocations and amplifications in the Lig 4 /p 53 -deficient <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> lymphoma model.

In this study, we describe the generation of Ig-α-deficient mice and their comparative analysis to mice deficient for Ig-β, the membrane-IgM, and recombination-activating gene 2 to determine the requirement of Ig-α and Ig-β in survival and differentiation of <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells.</b> We find that {{in the absence of}} Ig-α, B cell development does not progress beyond the progenitor stage, similar to what is observed in humans lacking this molecule. However, neither in Ig-α- nor in Ig-β-deficient mice are <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> impaired in V(D) J recombination, in the expression of intracellular Ig μ-chains, or in surviving in the bone marrow microenvironment. Finally, Ig-α and Ig-β are not redundant in their putative function, as <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> from Ig-α and Ig-β double-deficient mice are similar to those from single-deficient animals in every aspect analyzed...|$|R
40|$|V(D) J joining is {{mediated}} by RAG recombinase during early B-lymphocyte {{development in the}} bone marrow (BM). Activation-induced deaminase initiates isotype switching in mature B cells of secondary lymphoid structures. Previous studies questioned the strict ontological partitioning of these processes. We show that <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> undergo robust switching to a subset of immunoglobulin H (IgH) isotypes. Chromatin studies reveal that in <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells,</b> the spatial organization of the Igh locus may restrict switching to this subset of isotypes. We demonstrate that in the BM, V(D) J joining and switching are interchangeably inducible, providing {{an explanation for the}} hyper-IgE phenotype of Omenn syndrome...|$|R
40|$|B cell {{generation}} and immunoglobulin (Ig) diversity in mice is compromised with aging. Our recent work sought to understand mechanism(s) {{that contribute to}} reduced B cell production in aged mice. Using in vivo labeling, we found that reduction in marrow pre-B cells reflects increased attrition during passage from the <b>pro-B</b> to pre-B <b>cell</b> pool. Analyses of reciprocal bone marrow (BM) chimeras reveal that the production rates of pre-B cells are controlled primarily by microenvironmental factors, rather than intrinsic events. To understand changes in <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> that could diminish production of pre-B cells, we evaluated rag 2 expression and V(D) J recombinase activity in <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> at the single cell level. The percentage of <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> that express rag 2 is reduced in aged mice and is correlated with both a loss of V(D) J recombinase activity in <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> and reduced numbers of pre-B cells. Reciprocal BM chimeras revealed that the aged microenvironment also determines rag 2 expression and recombinase activity in <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells.</b> These observations suggest that extrinsic factors in the BM that decline with age are largely responsible for less efficient V(D) J recombination in <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> and diminished progression to the pre-B cell stage. These extrinsic factors may include cytokines and chemokines derived from BM stromal cells that {{are essential to the}} development of B cell precursors. The changes during aging within the BM hematopoietic microenvironment most likely are linked to the physiology of aging bone. Bone degrades with age (osteoporosis) due to decreased formation of new bone by osteoblasts. Marrow stem cells (MSC) are considered the progenitor of both adipocytes, osteoblasts and hematopoietic stromal cells and a controlled reciprocal regulation exists of osteoblast versus adipocyte differentiation; with age adipocytes increase, and osteoblast decrease. It is possible that stromal {{cell generation}} from MSC is compromised during aging. Currently, understanding of BM microenvironmental factors that regulate rag gene expression is very limited. However, as early progenitors differentiate, it is increasing clear that a limited set of transcription factors (e. g. ikaros, PU. 1, E 2 A, EBF, pax 5) regulate B-lineage specific genes, and that expression and stability of these factors is responsive to the microenvironment. Current and future work by several groups will strive to understand mechanisms that regulate these factors and how aging impacts these regulatory circuits...|$|R
40|$|SummaryOncogene {{addiction}} {{is thought to}} occur cell autonomously. Immune effectors are implicated in the initiation and restraint of tumorigenesis, but their role in oncogene inactivation-mediated tumor regression is unclear. Here, we show that an intact immune system, specifically CD 4 + T cells, {{is required for the}} induction of cellular senescence, shutdown of angiogenesis, and chemokine expression resulting in sustained tumor regression upon inactivation of the MYC or BCR-ABL oncogenes in mouse models of T cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia, respectively. Moreover, immune effectors knocked out for thrombospondins failed to induce sustained tumor regression. Hence, CD 4 + T cells are required for the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment through the expression of chemokines, such as thrombospondins, in order to elicit oncogene addiction...|$|E

These responses include cytokine gene expression, regulated cell cycle activation, and both the protection from and induction of the cell death program. To examine the function of individual Rel family proteins in B cell development and resolve their role in the signaling of apoptosis, we used a tetracycline-regulated gene expression system to overexpress either c-Rel or RelA in the transformed <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> line 220 - 8. Elevated levels of RelA, but not c-Rel, induced aG 1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of RelA were required for this effect.

LEF- 1 was originally identified in pre-B and T cells, but its function in B lymphocyte development remains unknown. Here we report that LEF- 1 -deficient mice exhibit defects in <b>pro-B</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and survival in vitro and in vivo. We further show that Lef 1 −/− pro-B cells display elevated levels of fas and c -myc transcription, providing a potential mechanism for their increased sensitivity to apoptosis. Finally, we establish a link between Wnt signaling and normal B cell development by demonstrating that Wnt proteins are mitogenic for pro-B cells and that this effect is mediated by LEF- 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{developmental}} {{progression from}} <b>pro-B</b> to pre-B <b>cells</b> {{is controlled by}} pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling which depends on BLNK (SLP- 65) for coupling the Syk kinase to its downstream effector pathways. Here we identified BLNK as a direct target of the transcription factor Pax 5 (BSAP). Restoration of BLNK expression in Igμ transgenic Pax 5 −/− <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> resulted in constitutive pre-BCR signaling and increased cell proliferation without inducing progression to the pre-B cell stage. Igμ+ Pax 5 −/− <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> expressing a BLNK-estrogen receptor fusion protein initiated signaling immediately upon hormone addition, which facilitated analysis of pre-BCR-induced gene expression changes. The pre-BCR was shown to execute its checkpoint function by regulating genes involved in cell proliferation, intracellular signaling, growth factor responsiveness, and V(D) J recombination...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{compared}} the chemotactic respon-siveness of different subsets of human B lineage cells to stromal derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1). High percentages (30 – 40 % of input) of purified bone marrow progenitors including non-B lineage pro-genitors, <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells,</b> and pre-B cells migrated to SDF- 1 a, demonstrating that SDF- 1 is an effica-cious chemoattractant of these <b>cells.</b> <b>Pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> responded optimally {{to a lower}} concentration of SDF- 1 than other subsets, demonstrating that SDF- 1 is a more potent chemoattractant of this subset. A lower percentage (10 – 15 % of input) of mature B lymphocytes migrated to SDF- 1 a than <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells,</b> demonstrating that responsiveness of B lineage cells to SDF- 1 decreases during differentiation. Inhibition by anti-CXCR 4 mAb demonstrated that migration of B lineage cells to SDF- 1 was com-pletely dependent on CXC chemokine receptor- 4 (CXCR 4). Mature B cells expressed higher levels of CXCR 4 receptors than uncommitted progenitors and <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells,</b> despite differences in responsive-ness to SDF- 1. CXCR 4 receptors expressed by unresponsive and SDF- 1 -responsive B cells bound SDF- 1 a with similar affinities (KD 5 1. 7 – 3. 3 3 10 - 9 M). Therefore, elements downstream from CXCR 4 appear to regulate responsiveness of B cells to SDF- 1. We speculate that SDF- 1 and CXCR 4 direct migration of progenitor cells in microenviron-ments that promote B lymphopoiesis. J. Leukoc...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{inability}} of scid <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> to progress to the pre-B and B cell stages {{is believed to}} be caused by a defective recombinase activity that fails to resolve chromosomal breaks resulting from attempted V(D) J recombination. In support of this model, we report that certain immunoglobulin transgenes, specifically those which strongly Inhibit endogenous VH-to-DJH and Vκ-to-Jκ rearrangement in wild-type mice, allow ccid <b>pro-B</b> <b>cells</b> to progress to the pre-B and B cell stages. This rescue of scid B cell differentiation is associated with a dramatic reduction in expression of the recombination activation genes, RAG 1 and RAG 2, and with reduced transcription of the K locus...|$|R
