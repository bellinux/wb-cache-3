40|$|The {{rapid growth}} {{of the use of}} options in {{portfolio}} management has been accompanied by a variety of claims regarding the performance of options strategies. In particular, many investors believe that they can enhance the performance of their pure-stock portfolios using systematic covered-call writing or protective <b>put</b> <b>buying.</b> Surprisingly, the results between similar studies from many brokerage firms, large banks or even academics devoted to these strategies differ considerably, and there is no clear evidence on whether a specific options strategy is superior. In this paper, we will review the results from the major research studies on options strategies and we will empirically examine the outcomes of such strategies on the Swiss market using various performance measures. We will also theoretically explain why some strategies regularly appear to outperform on a "risk" adjusted basis. Finally, we will show that when correctly measuring performance, these strategies do not dominate anymore. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates recent {{allegations}} {{regarding the}} misuse of private insider information by hedge funds prior to the public announcement of M&A deals. We analyze this issue by using a unique and comprehensive dataset which allows us to analyze the trading pattern of hedge funds around corporate mergers and acquisitions in both the equity and derivatives markets. In general, our {{results are consistent with}} hedge funds, with short-term investment horizons (henceforth, short-term hedge funds) taking advantage of private information and engaging in trading based on such information. We show that short-term hedge funds holdings of a target’s shares in the quarter prior to the M&A announcement date are positively related to the profitability of the deal as measured by the target premium. In addition, we also find that the target price run-up before the deal announcement date is significantly greater for deals with greater short term hedge fund holdings. We also find evidence consistent with informed abnormal short selling and <b>put</b> <b>buying</b> in the corresponding acquirer’s stock prior to M&A announcements. This is particularly evident when hedge funds take larger stakes in target firms. In addition, we show that such a strategy is potentially very profitable. We consider alternative explanations for such short term hedge fund holdings in target firms; however our results seem inconsistent with these alternative explanations but rather, seem to be consistent with trading based on insider information. Overall, our results have important implications regarding the recent policy debate on hedge fund regulation. ...|$|E

40|$|Financial market {{models are}} able to help the investors foresee {{the risk of a}} {{financial}} market crash and reduce the probability of its occurrence. Modelling in financial markets is categorized into microscopic models and macroscopic models. The microscopic models study the mechanisms behind the market and their behaviour. These models assist in an understanding of the causes of financial market crashes. Macroscopic models find the disciplines and rules from the historical macroscopic data for the prediction of market trends, directions and crashes. They aim to provide forecasts of when the crashes should occur. Except for large fluctuations, the stock market price or index movements can be characterized by a random walk. The stock price trajectory possesses the properties of self-similarity and scale invariance, and hence mimics fractals. Furthermore, the stock price movement is a manifestation of the actions and interactions of stock traders. The hierarchical model with fractal structures, representing the interaction structure of the stock traders, is applicable {{to the study of the}} microscopic mechanisms of stock price movements. In the language of statistical mechanics, stock market crashes are viewed as critical phenomena where a crash occurs only at the critical point with a phase transition. The renormalization group is a mathematical apparatus that allows the decomposition of a macroscopic problem viewed at different scales. The renormalization group analysis of the hierarchical model finds that the time to reach the critical point of a system is a function of the interaction degree of stock traders in a power law. Moreover, the hierarchical model with the renormalization group formalism shows that the behavior of the fraction of all stock traders <b>putting</b> <b>buy</b> orders over time follows a power law coupled with log-periodic oscillations. Based on the renormalization group analysis results of the hierarchical model, a log-periodic power law model is derived by constructing an renormalization group formalism from the risk-driven model. In the log-periodic power law model, the expected time to crash is always finite. Therefore, market crashes are inevitable, but the existence of bubbles and crash risks is foreseen by the model...|$|R

A unique data set from a large German discount broker gives us the opportunity to analyze the trading behavior of 1, 454 investors, making 89, 958 transactions in 6, 724 warrants on 397 underlyings. In different logit regression, we make use of the facts that investors can speculate on rising and falling prices of the underlying with call and put warrants and that we also have information about the stock portfolios of the investors. We report several facts about the trading behavior of individual investors in warrants that are consistent with the literature on the behavior of individual investors in the stock market. The warrant investors buy calls and sell puts if the price of the underlying has decreased over the past trading days and they sell calls and <b>buy</b> <b>puts</b> if the price of the underlying has increased. That means, the investors follow negative feedback trading strategies in all four trading categories observed. In addition, we find strong evidence for the disposition effect for call as well as put warrants. The trading behavior is also influenced if the underlying reaches some exceptionally prices, e. g. highs, lows or the strike price. We show that hedging, as one natural candidate to <b>buy</b> <b>puts,</b> does not {{play an important role in}} the market for bank-issued warrants. The probability to buy calls is positively related to the holding of the underlying in the portfolio, meaning that investors tend to leverage their stock positions, while the relation between put purchases and portfolio holdings of the underlying is negative.
