5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E

This inflation was exacerbated by the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E

5|$|Count Geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing the {{division}} of his realm between Henry and Henry's younger brother Geoffrey, who would have inherited Anjou. According to William of Newburgh, who wrote in the 1190s, Count Geoffrey decided that Henry would receive England and Anjou {{for as long as}} he needed the resources for the conflict against Stephen. Count Geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until Henry swore an oath that the young Geoffrey would receive Anjou when England and Normandy were secured. W. L. Warren cast doubt on this account on the grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source, it would be questionable that either Geoffrey or Henry would consider such an oath binding and it would break the inheritance <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. The young Geoffrey died in 1158, before receiving Anjou, but he had become count of Nantes when the citizens of Nantes rebelled against their ruler. Henry had supported the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Domitian also {{revived the}} <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{imperial}} cult, which had fallen somewhat {{out of use}} under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and Cassius Dio allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of Dominus et Deus. However, {{not only did he}} reject the title of Dominus during his reign, but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time that was applied {{in a way to}} draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E

5|$|In 318 BCE, Cassander {{appointed}} Demetrius Phalereus {{to govern}} the city-state of Athens. Demetrius issued a set of laws that are known from later literary works. Although knowledge of these laws is fragmentary, {{it does not appear}} that Demetrius legislated anything on the subject of epikleroi. This is in striking contrast to Solon's legislation, which was concerned with the internal affairs of the family and its external manifestations in public life. By the 4th century BCE, the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epiklerate was falling into disuse, and it disappeared during the Hellenistic Period, although it continued to appear in New Comedy and scattered inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, if dated correctly, refer to occasional epikleroi. One method that developed to avoid the epiklerate was through the adoption of a son by the father of a possible epikleros.|$|E

G Strategies subsequently became part of Golin Harris International. In , Ferraro was made {{executive vice president and}} managing director of the public affairs <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Global Consulting Group, an international investor relations and corporate communications component of Huntsworth. There she worked with corporations, non-profit organizations, state governments and political figures. She continued there as a senior advisor working about two days a month.|$|E
