This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down." ...|$|E

The results were used to explore <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> different hormone-free artificial insemination (AI) protocols aimed at diminishing <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> inseminations needed to optimise fertility. Adult bucks and does were exposed to artificially long days during winter, then exposed to a natural photoperiod before buck exposure (Day 0). Most goats (> 70 %) ovulated twice, developing a short cycle followed by a normal cycle over 13 days after buck exposure. Among them, 21 % were in oestrus at the short cycle and 94 % at the normal cycle. This second ovulation occurred within 48 h of Day 6 and was the target for AI protocols. In protocol A (n= 79), goats were inseminated 12 h after oestrus detection from Day 5 to Day 9. Up to six AI times over four days were needed to inseminate goats in oestrus. Forty-nine <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inseminated goats <b>kidded.</b> In protocol B (n= 145), oestrus detection started on Day 5. The earlier (group 1) and later (group 2) buck-marked goats received one single insemination at fixed times on Days 6. 5 or 7 and 8, respectively; unmarked goats (group 3) were inseminated along with group 2. In protocol C (n= 153), goats were inseminated twice on Days 6. 5 or 7 and 8 without needing to detect oestrus. Goats induced to ovulate by hormonal treatment were used as the control (n= 319). Fertility was lower in protocol B than C and control (47 vs. 58 vs. 65 % kidding; p≤ 0. 05), whereas this was higher in buck-marked goats than unmarked ones (64 vs. 33 %; p≤ 0. 05). In protocol B, fertility can increase (> 60 %) when only goats coming into oestrus are inseminated. <b>The</b> best <b>kidding</b> rate (∼ 70 %) was achieved when does were inseminated within 24 h <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LH surge.
