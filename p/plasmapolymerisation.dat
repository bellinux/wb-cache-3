40|$|International audienceThe present work {{deals with}} plasma {{polymerisation}} of TetraMethylDiSilOxanewith a Dielectric Barier Discharge plasma jet at atmospheric pressure. Depending on parameters likevoltage, frequency, carrier gas and monomer injection, the deposited polymer looks like gelfilm or transparent film with fringes. Deposits {{are characterized by}} Fourier Transformed IRspectroscopy and contact angle measurements.

40|$|Using a home-built {{scanning}} near-field {{optical microscope}} we have obtained subwavelength microscopic images of silver particles in polymer matrices. Samples with different particle sizes and different filling factors were produced by <b>plasmapolymerisation.</b> Spatially highly resolved spectra were obtained using a sensitive CCD camera {{connected to a}} spectrometer. Spectral information allows in principle to avoid the "ubiqitous" artefacts in scanning near-field optical microscopy, reported recently by Pohl et al. And is able to yield the size and orientation of particles...|$|E
40|$|<b>Plasmapolymerisation</b> is {{a method}} of thin-film- technology, that is at present {{essentially}} on a laboratory scale. Because of it's high development potential many efforts are made to bring this low-cost process of surface modification into industrial use. It is possible to change the coating properties in a wide range, so that the characterization methods are very important. These methods {{make it possible to}} use the wide potential for various applications in a most efficient way and with a high quality of the coatings, too...|$|E
40|$|Low-temperature, {{low-pressure}} plasmas {{are widely}} used {{in the field of}} coating technology. Among the various coating processes that are involved in this technology the process of plasma polymerisation is the objective of intensified research activities. Some characteristic features of the generated plasmapolymers are unique and therefore new fields of application are discussed. Nevertheless the <b>plasmapolymerisation</b> process itself is not well understood due to the complex mechanisms in the plasma. In view of this an extensive analytical characterization of the coatings is an important step towards a better understanding. For this purpose the analytical methods ESCA and FTIR as well as the contact angle analysis and ellipsometry are described regarding the specific requirements of plasma polymers...|$|E
