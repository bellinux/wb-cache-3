50|$|The least 'invasive' tie is a reveal tie. These use {{an opening}} in the {{structure}} but use a tube wedged horizontally in the opening. The reveal tube is usually held in place by a reveal screw pin (an adjustable threaded bar) and <b>protective</b> <b>packing</b> at either end. A transom tie tube links the reveal tube to the scaffold. Reveal ties are not well regarded, they rely solely on friction and need regular checking so it is not recommended {{that more than half of}} all ties be reveal ties.|$|E

40|$|The {{persimmon}} {{culture can}} be attacked by several pests and diseases, however, {{there are few}} studies related to the control. In addition, {{there is a lack}} of pesticides registered in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA, in Portuguese “Ministério da Agricultura, Pecuária e Abastecimento”), emerging the fruit bagging as an alternative. The aim of this study was to evaluate different kinds of <b>protective</b> <b>packs</b> for bagging persimmon fruits, in order to control pests and diseases and, consequently, improve the fruit quality. The experiment was conducted in a persimmon orchard on the experimental station of the Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS), located in the Tuiuty District, in Bento Gonçalves, RS. Were performed four treatments: control (not bagged fruits), perforated polypropylene packaging, white TNT (non woven tissue) packing, and kraft brown paper packing. The harvested fruits were evaluated for weight, symptoms of caterpillars damage, presence of mealybug (Pseudococcus sp.) and symptoms of Schyzothyrium pomi. The fluctuation population of Anastrepha fraterculus was performed using McPhail trap with hydrolyzed protein. Among the treatments, only the fruits protected with perforated polypropylene differ significantly from the control on the evaluations of weight and Schyzothyrium pomi symptoms. However, there was no significant difference on the damage caused by caterpillars and presence of mealybugs. The use of perforated polypropylene has demonstrated efficiency on the control of Anastrepha fraterculus, and it can be used to reduce the damage in the fruits...|$|R
40|$|Biogenic amine content, {{microbial}} {{counts and}} pH were investigated in 20 kinds of Spanish retail meat products treated with mild preservation {{technologies such as}} high pressure (HP) and protective atmospheres. High levels of tyramine were found in non-packed (NP) and <b>protective</b> atmospheres <b>packed</b> (PAP) Spanish dry fermented sausage, >chorizo>. These are also associated with the total viable count {{and high levels of}} lactic acid bacteria. Lower levels of tyramine were observed in chorizo and cooked white sausage >butifarra> treated with HP. High concentrations of agmatine were detected in these pressurised products, mainly in chorizo. High levels of cadaverine, together with high levels of putrescine, and agmatine were observed in sliced cooked ham in PAP and in vacuum packed (VP) butifarra. High concentrations of spermidine and spermine were observed in the different products analysed. © Springer-Verlag 2004. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{characteristic}} of packing {{is to protect}} the product from external factors while the product is delivering to consumers. However, recently packing has become an indispensable aspect of marketing. Because, packing is considered as a silent dealer which directly reaches consumers. Packing {{is one of the most}} important factor of product sales. Consumers assess a product with its packing and make up a purchasing decision accordingly. In addition to its <b>protective</b> function, <b>packing</b> also performs functions such as selling and communication. Recently, firms have begun attaching great importance on packing investments. A high-quality and attractive packing means expenditure. A firm can increase its sales as much as it creates difference with its packing. Therefore, it is required to take a risk of increasing the packing costs for increasing sales. Increasing packing cost is an important factor of prices. In this study, the relation between the packing cost and price has been researched by making regression analysis...|$|R
2500|$|Hunts in the {{southern}} United States sometimes pursue the bobcat (Lynx rufus). [...] In countries such as India, and in other areas formerly under British influence, such as Iraq, the golden jackal (Canis aureus) is often the quarry. During the British Raj, British sportsmen in India would hunt jackals on horseback with hounds {{as a substitute for}} the fox hunting of their native England. Unlike foxes, golden jackals were documented to be ferociously <b>protective</b> of their <b>pack</b> mates, and could seriously injure hounds. Jackals were not hunted often in this manner, as they were slower than foxes and could scarcely outrun greyhounds after 200 yards.|$|R
50|$|About half of {{the large}} {{photographic}} glass plate negatives exposed on the telescope, some 19,000 in all, had been accumulating in the sub-basement of the Robinson building at the California Institute of Technology since 1949. In 2002, astronomer Jean Mueller approached Richard Ellis, {{the director of the}} Caltech Optical Observatories, to volunteer to the task of organizing the Oschin Telescope plate archive. Given the go-ahead, she recruited eleven volunteers from the Mount Wilson Observatory Association (MWOA) and the Los Angeles Astronomical Society (LAAS), and the team then spent 13 weekends (more than one thousand hours) poring over the stacks, placing plates in <b>protective</b> sleeves, and <b>packing</b> them in more than 500 boxes that were transported to Palomar.|$|R
500|$|While walking home, Marty {{experiences}} {{a vision of}} Gotts attacking Forester. Marty eventually makes {{her way to the}} crime scene where she finds the victim's body. She returns to the police station and confesses to the murders. To convince the police that she is the murderer, Marty tells Pennock where Gotts hid the heroin he stole from the first victim, but none of the prints on the heroin belong to Marty, furthering Mulder's argument that she is, in fact, innocent. Mulder approaches Marty and tells her that he researched her mother's murder—she died from a stab wound to the kidney, the same way Gotts kills his victims. Mulder concludes that Marty was given her ability when her then-pregnant mother was killed by Gotts; it is revealed that Gotts is actually Marty's father and that he had spent thirty years (her whole life) in prison until being paroled. Marty sends Mulder and Scully to the bar that Gotts was last seen at, while Pennock takes her back to her apartment to pick up some things before entering <b>protective</b> custody. While <b>packing,</b> Marty has a vision of Gotts in the apartment lobby; she knocks Pennock out, takes his gun and waits. [...] Mulder figures out that Marty had been experiencing Gotts' sight for the thirty years he was in prison; in effect spending her whole life in prison. Mulder and Scully arrive at Marty's apartment to find Gotts dead by his daughter's hands. Marty is convicted of his murder and is sentenced to prison, but she is finally free of her father's vision.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to increase the post harvest life of mango fruit at ambient temperature during storage to boost export of this very tasty and delicious fruit in the international market. Different combinations of Bee wax with polysaccharide based coatings such as CMC, Guar gum, vegetable oil having CaCl 2 as firming agent, fungicide like NaOCL and 2, 4, 5 -T as anti ripening agent were employed on hard green, matured, unripened, and uniform sized of Dushehari, Sindhri and Chaunsa White the three very important commercial varieties of mango. Coated fruit was either packed in export quality carton boxes, polyethylene, and wooden alone or in polyethylene-carton and polyethylene-wooden combinations containing KMnO 4 sachet to absorb or remove ethylene. The effect of surface coating and packaging on the keeping quality of mango was investigated after an interval of 3 days at ambient temperature (32 - 35 oC with 53. 6 78. 8 % RH), (35 - 44 oC with 55. 9 - 69. 7 % RH) and (28 - 33 oC with 56. 7 - 69. 7 % RH) respectively during storage. The data obtained was statistically analyzed for Analysis of Variance (ANOV A) by using 2 -Factorial Complete Randomized Design (CRD) and Duncan,s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) was applied to compare the mean values obtained. Results revealed that treatments, storage and their interactions had highly significant effect on keeping quality of mango during storage. It was observed that coating (CMC-WAX + 2, 4, 5 -T+ H 3 BO 3 -CaCl 2) mixture had shown the best results and maintained 90 % green color, firm texture followed by (CMC-W AX + NaOCI), (CMC+ Wax+ KMnO 4) and (CMC +Wax + CaCl 2 + 2, 4, 5 -T) in which majority of the samples were still green with creamy white pulp even after one month of storage. On the other hand in control sample 70 - 75 % fruit were ripened with full yellow color within a week and blackening of the skin at stem end and rotting in some of the samples was started within 12 days of their storage and due to its unattractive skin, brown pulp color and poor taste fruit was unacceptable after 16 days of storage. Whereas treated fruit without rotting were green even after 21 st day of their storage. Therefore, increasing of the storage life of treated Sindhri mango up to 25 days and Chaunsa White more than 30 days is very encouraging as compared to its own original life only 4 to 6 days. It was also investigated that mango packed in polyethylene or coated fruit having with other <b>protective</b> chemicals <b>packed</b> in polyethylene within carton or wooden boxes played a very effective and vital role to control compositional changes by delaying the ripening process and with a minimum quality loss. It was observed that Chaunsa White treated with Wax-CMC coating having ethylene absorbent, fungicide and antiripening agents having NaOCI, KMnO 4. 2, 4, 5 -T or 2, 4, 5 -T with CaCl 2 and H 3 BO 3 packed in polyethylene or all these combinations along with polyethylene packaged in carton or wooden had lower weight loss, slower increase of TSS, pH, higher retention of acidity, slower increase in AA, RS, TIS, SUC, TS, SAR, or lower score of SKC, FLC, T AS and higher TEX and slower increase of FLA score respectively as compared to fruit packed in carton/wooden box alone or polyethylene packed fruit in carton/wooden without chemical treatments were comparatively less effective...|$|R
