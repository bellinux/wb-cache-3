In oncology, genes coding for DPD, UGT1A1, TPMT, CDA involved in the pharmacokinetics of 5-FU/capecitabine, irinotecan, 6-mercaptopurine and gemcitabine/cytarabine, respectively, have all been described as being highly polymorphic.

Comparison of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> among different populations can provide important clues for understanding phenotypic variation and formation processes of A. thaliana. It is an important aspect that cannot be ignored for phenotypic adaptation and evolution of natural A. thaliana populations. We investigated nine <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> of 10 A. thaliana populations located in the northern Tianshan, Altai, and Tarbagatay mountains of Xinjiang, and compared variations in <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> in natural conditions at micro-, local- and regional-scales. Our results showed that different traits respond differently to environmental changes. Plant height, plant weight, root weight, root length, single fruit weight and fruit dehiscence force differed among populations at the three scales. However, branching number and fruit length did not differ among populations with low phenotypic differentiation coefficients. Plant weight, root weight and fruit number per plant all showed a consistent integration pattern at different scales, potentially reflecting the importance of physiological functional integration in A. thaliana. These three phenotypic characteristics also exhibited obvious adaptation to local environment. At the same time, {{we found that the}} extent of integration of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> varied between local and regional scales. Cluster analysis showed that different populations from the same region grouped together, further showing that the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> of A. thaliana were strongly influenced by the micro-scale environmental factors. Mantel test showed that the variations of plant height, plant weight, root weight, single fruit weight, fruit length and fruit dehiscence force significantly correlated with geographic distance, while the variations of branch number and root length did not. We therefore concluded that phenotypic variations of A. thaliana were strongly affected by the microscale environmental factors.

25|$|Although {{it is easy}} {{to assume}} that each of these traits was uniquely {{selected}} for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 Dmitry Belyayev tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting a behavioral trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing. In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations. Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for mink and Japanese quail. In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for a behavioral trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a <b>phenotypic</b> <b>trait,</b> these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.|$|E

In an enclosure experiment, we studied links between <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits,</b> swimming performance and survival in two Enallagma damselflies. Predatory dragonflies imposed survival selection for increased swimming propensity and speed only in E. annexum; probably E. aspersum was buffered by the former species' presence. Accordingly, more circular caudal lamellae, structures involved in generating thrust while swimming, were selected for only in E. annexum. Other <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> that contributed to swimming speed were apparently not under selection, probably because of many-to-one mapping (functional redundancy).

But conversely, if species exhibit niche differences {{that allow them to}} coexist, then by definition there is no single best adapted species. Rather, demographic rates depend on species’ relative abundances, so that <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> conferring high adaptedness do not necessarily confer high abundance. I illustrate these points using a simple theoretical model incorporating adjustable levels of "adaptedness" and "niche differences". Even very small niche differences can weaken or even reverse the expected correlation between adaptive traits and abundance.

Thus, I estimated mouse relative abundance (through livetrapping) and percentages of fruit predation by mice, and quantified plant environmental and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> in 9 populations of H. foetidus in southeastern Spain during 2 years (overall, 254 plants). I found substantial variation among populations in mouse trapping success (ranging from 0. 0 to 21. 8 individuals/ 100 trap nights), size of fruit crops (8. 6 – 28. 9 fruits per plant), and percentages of fruit predation by mice (0. 0 – 93. 3 %). However, no simple relationship was found between mouse abundance (as estimated by trapping success) and strength of fruit predation. None of the 4 measured plant <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> (e. g., number of fruits or plant size) had a significant effect on mouse foraging. Conversely, 2 of the 6 environmental traits considered (substrate and distance to nearest tree) influenced fruit predation by mice. Plants located on rocky substrates and nearby trees experienced higher percentages of predation and this result was rather consistent across the 2 years and the 2 levels considered (inter- and intrapopulation). Even though mice could have selected other plant <b>phenotypic</b> <b>traits</b> not accounted for (e. g., chemical <b>traits),</b> such hypothetical <b>phenotypic</b> selection appears to be inconsequential as a source of individual variation in H. foetidus maternal fitness because its effects could have been ‘‘diluted’’ by the overwhelming influence of environmental factors.
