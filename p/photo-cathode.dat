40|$|Abstract. The quantum {{efficiency}} of field-assisted transmission-mode GaAs photocathodes has been calculated. The {{results show that}} supplying an electric field across a photocathode is {{an efficient way to}} greatly increase the {{quantum efficiency}} of transmission-mode GaAs photocathodes. Quantum efficiency {{is one of the most}} important para-meters of photocathodes. In previous research, the quantum efficiency of transmission-mode GaAs <b>photo-cathodes</b> has already been calculated [l, 21, and the idea of field-assisted photocathodes has also been pro-posed [l]. However, the previous work did not provide the results of calculations or the relationship between the quantum efficiency and the electric field in detail. Here, we calculate the quantum efficiency of transmission-mode GaAs photocathodes with varying electric field, which is supplied across the photocath-odes. The results indicate that the quantum efficiency can be greatly increased with the electric field. We hope that the results will be helpful in further improving the quantum efficiency of transmission-mode GaAs <b>photo-cathodes.</b> Figure 1 shows an energy band diagram used in the calculation. The direction of the electric field is from the emission surface toward the inside of cathodes. The electrons at the top of the valence band absorb incident photons, jump into the conduction band and become photoelectrons. As the photoelectrons diffuse toward the emission surface, they also drift toward the emis-sion surface under the action of the electric field E. If we consider the motion of the photoelectrons only in the x direction and assume that the field is a uniform electric field, the distribution of photoelectrons in the GaAs active layer is determined by d'An(x) dAn(x...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} been {{developing}} a novel threshold Cherenkov detector, {{consisting of a}} gas radiator followed by a UV photosensitive wire chamber using CsI photocathodes. The photo-detector lies directly in the particle path and is thus required to have single photo-electron sensitivity and yet to be insensitive {{to the passage of}} a charged particle. In addition, the detector should be made of low mass material to minimize the effect of multiple scatterings. The proposed threshold Cherenkov counters are called Hadron Blind Detectors (HBDs) because they are blind to low energy hadrons which have lower speed {beta} for given momentum p than that of electrons. HBDs can be used in colliders, especially heavy ion hadron colliders (RHIC, LHC), which have huge {number_sign} of hadrons produced per event, to select electrons by being blind to low-momentum hadrons.
