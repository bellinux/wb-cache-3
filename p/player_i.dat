25|$|A GaleStewart {{game is a}} two-player game {{of perfect}} information. The game is defined using a set A, and is denoted G'A. The two players {{alternate}} turns, and each player is aware of all moves before making the next one. On each turn, each player chooses a single element of A to play. The same element may be chosen more than once without restriction. The game can be visualized through the following diagram, in which the moves are made from left to right, with the moves of <b>player</b> <b>I</b> above and the moves of player II below.|$|E
25|$|The dalled pieces move {{according}} to dice throws. Each player's pieces move first through the home row to the stern, then through row C towards the prow, {{then into the}} enemy row back towards the stern. From here it moves into row C again, etc., never returning to the home row. The showings of the two dice may be either added and used to move one piece, or used separately for two different pieces. E.g., a throw of a dal and a three allows the <b>player</b> (<b>i)</b> to dal one piece (moving it one position) and then move another dalled piece three positions; (ii) to dal one piece and move it {{a total of four}} positions; (iii) to move two dalled pieces, one three positions and the other one position; or (iv) to move one dalled piece four positions. The showings of both dice must be used in a move. If that is not possible, the showing of one of the dice must be used. If that is not possible either, the move is lost. At a throw of dal-dal (two dals), the player has an extra throw.|$|E

500|$|Adamle {{was born}} in Fairmont, West Virginia to {{immigrants}} from Slovenia. His family moved to Cleveland {{when he was a}} child, and he attended Collinwood High School on the city's east side. Adamle was a standout fullback on his high school team and made a Cleveland-area All-Star squad in 1941 that matched up against a team of stars from Florida. He was [...] "without question the best high school <b>player</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen," [...] one Cleveland sports editor said after he was chosen as an all-star. He was also named an All-Ohio player by the Associated Press and United Press International and earned three varsity letters in football in high school.|$|E
500|$|Coach Kipke {{credited}} {{the play}} of halfback, Herman Everhardus, and his ends for the undefeated season: [...] "Our ends, Ward and Petoskey, were near perfection." [...] The 1934 University of Michigan yearbook, called the Michiganensian, described Petoskey's contributions as follows: [...] "After three years of Varsity football, Petoskey is {{recognized as one of}} Michigan's greatest all-time ends. [...] At the end of his junior year, he was chosen All American, and {{recognized as one of the}} greatest defense players in the country. [...] He was alert, followed every play, and opponents found it almost impossible to gain around his end." [...] In 1955, Kipke rated Petoskey as one of the six best players he ever coached: [...] "If I had to name the best <b>player</b> <b>I</b> ever coached, it would have to be among Harry Newman, Francis Wistert, Otto Pommerening, Ted Petoskey and Maynard Morrison." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson {{described}} Baxter as [...] "arguably {{the best}} player to play in Scottish football" [...] and [...] "the greatest <b>player</b> <b>I</b> ever played with... He had touch, balance, vision and just this wonderful aura..." [...] Rangers manager Willie Waddell said, [...] "Jim was the finest left half ever produced by Rangers." [...] Jimmy Johnstone, who played for Rangers' great rivals Celtic, said shortly after Baxter's death, [...] "He was a great man and a genius on the ball." [...] Allegedly Pelé once said that Baxter {{should have been a}} Brazilian. After Baxter's performance in the 1963 [...] "rest of the world" [...] vs England match, Ferenc Puskás asked, [...] "Where has this fellow been hiding?" [...] Shortly before his own death, George Best named Baxter {{as one of the best}} eleven players he had played with or against in an interview with FourFourTwo magazine.|$|E

500|$|Notre Dame offered Lavelli a scholarship, and he {{committed}} {{to attend the}} school. After {{he had a chance}} encounter with Eddie Prokop, however, an able running back who was a fifth-string player for Notre Dame, Lavelli was convinced to look elsewhere. [...] "If Eddie Prokop were a fifth-string <b>player,</b> <b>I</b> was not one to sit on anyone's bench," [...] he later said. Lavelli enrolled at Ohio State University in 1941 after learning that Paul Brown was appointed the football team's new head coach. Brown had developed a sterling reputation as the high school coach at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, losing only eight games in nine years there. Lavelli's catching ability had made him a star infielder in high school, and the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball recruited him to play second base in the low minor leagues. He refused the invitation, opting to concentrate on football.|$|E
500|$|After {{his brief}} stay in Pittsburgh, the Pirates sent Clarke to Greenville in 1920. He played next for Toledo and Winston-Salem, {{and then for}} the Reading Aces in the International League during the 1922 and 1923 seasons. In 1924, he played for both Reading and Harrisburg. [...] In 1925, he played for the Salisbury Indians in the Eastern Shore League. In the spring of 1925, The Sporting News wrote: [...] "Nig Clarke not only led the league with the bat and the mitt and the arm, he was the very picture of a {{baseball}} <b>player.</b> <b>I</b> rather suspect that Nig put away as much corn juice as the next man. In the days of his greatness he was wont {{to take a couple}} of snifters every morning before breakfast. Never seemed to hurt Nig any." [...] At the end of the season, he was given most valuable player honors for his performance with Salisbury. Clarke concluded his professional baseball career in 1927 with Tulsa.|$|E
500|$|On 24 July 2011, Hooper had {{a penalty}} saved by Graham Stack in Celtic's first match of the 2011–12 season, a 2–0 win over Hibs. On 13 August, he scored his first {{goal of the}} season in a 5–1 win over Dundee United. He also picked up an ankle injury which ruled him out for the next two matches. On 25 August he made his return in Celtic's 3–1 loss to FC Sion. Three days later, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win over St Mirren. English Premier League clubs Queens Park Rangers and Wolverhampton Wanderers {{expressed}} interest in signing Hooper on transfer deadline day of summer 2011, however Celtic rejected their enquiries about his availability. Hooper's regular strike partner Anthony Stokes said [...] "He's a top, top <b>player.</b> <b>I</b> have no doubt one day he could play at the very top level but we want to keep him here as long as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the opening}} day of the 1999–2000 season, Shearer {{received}} the first red card of his career in his 100th appearance for Newcastle. After dropping Shearer to the bench in a Tyne-Wear derby loss against Sunderland, the unpopular Gullit resigned to be replaced by the 66-year-old Bobby Robson. Despite Gullit giving Shearer the captain's armband, reports of a rift between club captain and manager were rife, Gullit's decision to drop Shearer proved deeply unpopular with fans and his departure capped a dismal start to the season. The animosity between Shearer and Gullit was later confirmed by the latter, who reported telling the striker that he was [...] "...the most overrated <b>player</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen." [...] Ironically, Robson had tried to sign Shearer for Barcelona in 1997, making a bid of £20million which would have seen Shearer break the world's transfer fee record {{for the second time in}} 12 months. However, then Newcastle manager Kenny Dalglish rejected the offer.|$|E
500|$|In a {{surprising}} choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, {{who was not}} a big name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high-powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, [...] "Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve [...] [...] [...] If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't know what would have happened to me. I don't know if I would have turned into the <b>player</b> <b>I</b> was and played in the NFL." [...] In the following years, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed [...] "Quarterback U" [...] as a result.|$|E
500|$|The 1918 {{season was}} cut short {{at the end of}} November due to the {{continuing}} effects of World War I and the influenza pandemic. Only five games were played, and the season's final game was in Cleveland against the Naval Reserve. Warner's first loss at Pitt, {{it was one of the}} most controversial games in school history. According to Warner and several reporters covering the game, Pitt was robbed by the officials. The referees said that the timekeeper's watch was broken, ended the first half before Pitt was able to score and allowed the Reserves extra time in the fourth quarter to pull ahead, 10–9. Although he refused to acknowledge the loss, Warner's 29-game winning streak came to an end. Moon Ducote kicked the 41-yard, game-winning field goal for the Naval Reserve, and Warner called him [...] "the greatest football <b>player</b> <b>I</b> ever saw". Despite the loss, a number of selectors named the 4–1 1918 Panthers national champion. The team was led by freshman running back Tom Davies, who averaged 150 yards per game over his four-year career.|$|E
