In the 1870s the city built three local water networks of inadequate capacity that were abandoned by 1885. After long disputes between supporters of municipal and <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply,</b> in 1888 the city settled on building a single pressurized water system. Key element of the system – two tower-like water reservoirs near present-day Rizhsky Rail Terminal – were partially financed with Alekseyev's personal funds. The main distribution pipeline, 108 versts long, was completed during Alekseyev's tenure in 1892. In 1896 the system reached individual houses along the Garden Ring and in 1912 the city was able to require mandatory hookup to running water for all new buildings within the city limits.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Canada, {{the legal}} {{responsibility}} for the condition of <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies,</b> including <b>private</b> wells and cisterns, rests with their owners. However, {{there are reports that}} Canadians test these <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> intermittently and that treatment of such water is uncommon. An estimated 45 % of all waterborne outbreaks in Canada involve non-municipal systems. An understanding of the perceptions and needs of Canadians served by <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> is essential, as it would enable public health professionals to better target public education and drinking water policy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the public perceptions of <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> in the City of Hamilton, Ontario (Canada), with the intent of informing public education and outreach strategies within the population. Methods A cross-sectional postal survey of 246 residences with <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> was conducted in May 2004. Questions pertained to the perceptions of water quality and alternative water sources, water testing behaviours and the self-identified need for further information. Results Private wells, cisterns or both, were the source of household water for 71 %, 16 % and 13 % of respondents, respectively. Although respondents rated their water quality highly, 80 % also had concerns with its safety. The most common concerns pertained to bacterial and chemical contamination of their <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and its potential negative effect on health. Approximately 56 % and 61 % of respondents used in-home treatment devices and bottled water within their homes, respectively, mainly due to perceived improvements in the safety and aesthetic qualities compared to regular tap <b>water.</b> Testing of <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> was performed infrequently: 8 % of respondents tested at a frequency that meets current provincial guidelines. Two-thirds of respondents wanted more information on various topics related to <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies.</b> Flyers and newspapers were the two media reported most likely to be used. Conclusion Although respondents rated their water quality highly, the majority had concerns regarding the <b>water</b> from their <b>private</b> <b>supply,</b> and the use of bottled water and water treatment devices was extensive. The results of this study suggest important lines of inquiry and provide support and input for public education programs, particularly those related to <b>private</b> <b>water</b> testing, in this population. </p...|$|R

Escherichia coli was detected in 6588 (18. 87 %) of samples and at least one positive sample was detected from 3638 (32. 39 %) of sites. However, this estimate of supplies failing to meet the European drinking water E. coli standard was probably an underestimate as the more samples taken per supply, the more likely the supply was to fail. A multivariable model of <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> data showed a strong seasonal impact, with samples between January and May being significantly less contaminated with E. coli than samples between June and December. Samples from springs (OR 2. 5, CI 2. 0 - 3. 1) or surface waters (OR 2. 4, CI 0. 8 - 7. 0) were more likely to fail than groundwater sources, as were supplies with no effective treatment (OR 1. 8, CI 1. 5 - 2. 3). Commercial supplies were less likely to fail than domestic supplies (OR 0. 63, CI 0. 48 - 0. 83) and the probability of failure was linearly associated with the density of sheep in the area and rainfall on the previous day. A Monte Carlo modelling approach was used to estimate that, had sufficient samples been taken, 54 % (95 % confidence intervals 49 - 59 %) of all <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> in England were likely to be unsatisfactory.

40|$|The health {{problems}} associated with waterborne Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia are well known. Up to 400, 000 people were affected in the largest recorded outbreak of Cryptosporidium, in Milwaukee in the USA. As well as being a major dilemma for water companies, these protozoan parasites are also a problem for environmental health officers. There are risks of Cryptosporidium associated with <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> that {{do not apply to}} mains water. These are: • the immediate proximity of young farm animals to many supplies; • the inadequate protection of many sources leading to rainwater washing faecal material into the collection point; and • the absence of treatment to many supplies and the inadequacy of the treatment systems that are installed. The <b>Private</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Supplies</b> Regulations 1991 (HMSO, 1991) [5] do not require <b>private</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> to be monitored for Cryptosporidium or Giardia lamblia. They rely on the presence of a single faecal indicator organism (faecal coliforms) to alert local authorities to the possible contamination by pathogens.
