5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, valves, and other components which work in concert to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust.</b> Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect valves {{and from there}} flowed through the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to, for example, turbojet engines which mainly expel {{atmospheric air}} to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust,</b> rocket packs are far simpler to build than devices using turbojets. The classical rocket pack construction of Wendell Moore {{can be made}} under workshop conditions, given good engineering training and {{a high level of}} tool-making craftsmanship.|$|E
25|$|The corbel {{arch bridge}} is a masonry, or stone, bridge where each {{successively}} higher course (layer) cantilevers {{slightly more than}} the previous course. The steps of the masonry may be trimmed to make the arch have a rounded shape. The corbel arch does not <b>produce</b> <b>thrust,</b> or outward pressure {{at the bottom of}} the arch, and is not considered a true arch. It is more stable than a true arch because it does not have this thrust. The disadvantage is that this type of arch is not suitable for large spans.|$|E
50|$|A lightcraft is a space- or air-vehicle {{driven by}} laser {{propulsion}}. Laser propulsion is in {{early stages of}} development. Lightcraft uses an external source of laser or maser energy to provide power for <b>producing</b> <b>thrust.</b> The laser/maser energy is focused to a high intensity {{in order to create}} a plasma. The plasma expands, <b>producing</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
50|$|The NASA Mighty Eagle <b>produces</b> <b>thrust</b> by {{the violent}} {{decomposition}} of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using silver as a catalyst.|$|R
50|$|A lightcraft is {{a vehicle}} {{currently}} under development that uses an external pulsed source of laser or maser energy to provide power for <b>producing</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
25|$|Not all of {{that energy}} can be {{utilized}} by any realistic propulsion technology {{because of the nature}} of the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged pions. The neutral pions decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 attoseconds) into high-energy photons, but the charged pions decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be deflected magnetically to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rocket {{propellant}} is {{mass that}} is stored, usually {{in some form}} of propellant tank or casing, prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a rocket engine {{in the form of a}} fluid jet to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust.</b> For chemical rockets often the propellants are a fuel such as liquid hydrogen or kerosene burned with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen or nitric acid to produce large volumes of very hot gas. The oxidiser is either kept separate and mixed in the combustion chamber, or comes premixed, as with solid rockets.|$|E
25|$|Frog {{kick and}} {{modified}} frog kick: The frog kick {{is like the}} swimming action of a frog or the kick used in breaststroke. Both legs operate together and <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> which is directed more consistently backwards than flutter kick, and is suitable for finning near a soft silty bottom as it {{is less likely to}} stir up the silt and degrade the visibility. The modified form is done with bent knees, and though less powerful, produces almost no down-thrust, and is often used in cave diving and wreck diving where silt out can cause dramatic loss in visibility and may compromise the ability of the divers to navigate out of the overhead environment.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of pulsejet engines, both of which use {{resonant}} combustion and harness the expanding combustion products to form a pulsating exhaust jet which <b>produces</b> <b>thrust</b> intermittently.|$|R
5000|$|By {{reducing}} {{propeller blade}} tip losses, the ducted fan {{is more efficient}} in <b>producing</b> <b>thrust</b> than a conventional propeller of similar diameter, especially at low speed and high static thrust level (airships, hovercraft).|$|R
50|$|The grain behaves like a solid mass, {{burning in}} a {{predictable}} fashion and producing exhaust gases. The nozzle dimensions are calculated {{to maintain a}} design chamber pressure, while <b>producing</b> <b>thrust</b> from the exhaust gases.|$|R
25|$|The two 117 engines {{incorporate}} thrust vectoring (TVC) nozzles whose rotational axes {{are each}} canted at an angle, {{similar to the}} nozzle arrangement of the Su-35S. This configuration allows the aircraft to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> vectoring moments about all three rotational axes, pitch, yaw and roll. Thrust vectoring nozzles themselves operate in only one plane; the canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently. The engine inlet incorporates variable intake ramps for increased supersonic efficiency and retractable mesh screens to prevent foreign object debris being ingested that would cause engine damage. The 117 engine is to also incorporate infrared and RCS reduction measures. In 2014, the Indian Air Force openly expressed concerns over the reliability and performance of the 117 engines; during the 2011 Moscow Air Show, a T-50 suffered a compressor stall that forced the aircraft to abort takeoff.|$|E
2500|$|Follow-up {{studies on}} Brown's work and other claims have been {{conducted}} by R. L. Talley in a 1990 US Air Force study, NASA scientist Jonathan Campbell in a 2003 experiment, [...] and Martin Tajmar in a 2004 paper. They have found that no thrust could be observed in a vacuum and that Brown's and other ion lifter devices <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> along their axis regardless of the direction of gravity consistent with electrohydrodynamic effects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the Griffon {{featured}} a dual turbojet-ramjet powerplant, with the turbojet enabling unassisted takeoffs (ramjets cannot <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> at zero airspeed and thus cannot move an aircraft from a standstill) and the ramjet producing extra thrust at airspeeds above 1,000km/h (600mph). To reduce risks in using the relatively new turbo-ramjet powerplant, the first Griffon (Nord 1500-01 Griffon I) was completed with only the 3,800 kgf thrust ATAR 101F turbojet component. First flown by Andre Turcat on [...] 20 September 1955, the Griffon I proved to be underpowered but plans to install the planned ramjet component were never realised. Despite the lack of power the Griffon I still managed to reach M 1.17. Flying with the Griffon I ceased in April 1957 in favour of the ramjet-equipped Griffon II. Visible {{differences between the two}} aircraft were limited to the smaller intake and two-position exhaust nozzle of the Griffon I.|$|E
5000|$|An axial-flow waterjet's {{pressure}} is increased by diffusing the flow {{as it is}} passes through the impeller blades and stator vanes. The pump nozzle then converts this pressure energy into velocity, thus <b>producing</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
50|$|For smaller helicopters, {{it may be}} {{advantageous}} to use a NOTAR (from NO TAil Rotor) system. In this yaw-control method, air is blown out of vents along the tail boom, <b>producing</b> <b>thrust</b> via the Coandă effect.|$|R
50|$|The Hyperloop Makers UPV {{proposes a}} {{propulsion}} system that consists in compressing the incoming air flowing along an inner tube up to a turbine that partially recovers energy and a nozzle that expands {{the air at}} the outlet of the pod <b>producing</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
50|$|Airbreathing {{jet engines}} are gas {{turbines}} optimized to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> from the exhaust gases, or from ducted fans {{connected to the}} gas turbines. Jet engines that <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> from the direct impulse of exhaust gases are often called turbojets, whereas those that generate thrust {{with the addition of}} a ducted fan are often called turbofans or (rarely) fan-jets.|$|E
50|$|Turboprop {{engines are}} jet engine derivatives, still gas turbines, that extract {{work from the}} hot-exhaust jet to turn a {{rotating}} shaft, which is then used to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> by some other means. While not strictly jet engines in that they rely on an auxiliary mechanism to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust,</b> turboprops {{are very similar to}} other turbine-based jet engines, and are often described as such.|$|E
50|$|The {{propelling}} nozzle {{is a critical}} part of a ramjet design, since it accelerates exhaust flow to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the pitchover, the rocket's {{flight path}} {{is no longer}} {{completely}} vertical, so gravity acts to turn the flight path back towards the ground. If the rocket were not <b>producing</b> <b>thrust,</b> the flight path would be a simple ellipse like a thrown ball (it's a common mistake to {{think it is a}} parabola: it is only true if you assume that Earth is flat, and gravity always points in the same direction, which is a good approximation for short distances), leveling off and then falling back to the ground. The rocket is <b>producing</b> <b>thrust</b> though, and rather than leveling off and then descending again, by the time the rocket levels off, it has gained sufficient altitude and velocity to place it in a stable orbit.|$|R
50|$|The {{control is}} called the cyclic because it changes the pitch of the rotor blades cyclically. The result is to tilt the rotor disk in a {{particular}} direction, resulting in the helicopter moving in that direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic forward, the rotor disk tilts forward, and the rotor <b>produces</b> a <b>thrust</b> in the forward direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic to the side, the rotor disk tilts to that side and <b>produces</b> <b>thrust</b> in that direction, causing the helicopter to hover sideways.|$|R
5000|$|In {{one type}} of lightcraft, the laser shines on a {{parabolic}} reflector {{on the underside of}} the vehicle that concentrates the light to produce a region of extremely high temperature. The air in this region becomes heated and expands violently in a laser-supported detonation, <b>producing</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Valveless engines <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> {{forces in}} two {{distinct}} but synchronized mass acceleration events per cycle, {{rather than just}} one.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Boxfish use median-paired fin swimming, as {{they are}} not well streamlined, and use {{primarily}} their pectoral fins to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some seabird species utilize surface feeding or plunge diving during {{foraging}} {{in which}} gravity and/or momentum {{is used to}} counteract buoyancy effects {{for a short period}} of time. Other species can remain submerged for longer periods of time and practice pursuit diving in which they actively <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> to remain submerged and chase after prey. Because birds have decoupled locomotor modules, pursuit divers can <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> using either their wings, feet, or some combination of the two.|$|E
5000|$|Pilots can {{activate}} and deactivate afterburners in-flight, and {{jet engines}} {{are referred to}} as operating wet when afterburning is being used and dry when not. [...] An engine <b>producing</b> maximum <b>thrust</b> wet is at maximum power, while an engine <b>producing</b> maximum <b>thrust</b> dry is at military power.|$|R

5000|$|A ramjet, {{sometimes}} referred to as a flying stovepipe or an athodyd (an abbreviation of aero thermodynamic duct), is a form of airbreathing jet engine that uses the engine's forward motion to compress incoming air without an axial compressor. Because ramjets cannot <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> at zero airspeed, they cannot move an aircraft from a standstill. A ramjet-powered vehicle, therefore, requires an assisted take-off like a rocket assist to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust.</b> Ramjets work most efficiently at supersonic speeds around [...] This type of engine can operate up to speeds of [...]|$|E
50|$|An ionocraft or ion-propelled {{aircraft}} (commonly {{known as}} a lifter or hexalifter) is a device that uses an electrical electrohydrodynamic (EHD) phenomenon to <b>produce</b> <b>thrust</b> in the air without requiring any combustion or moving parts.|$|E
50|$|Helicopters have a rotor turned by an {{engine-driven}} shaft. The rotor pushes air downward {{to create}} lift. By tilting the rotor forward, the downward flow is tilted backward, <b>producing</b> <b>thrust</b> for forward flight.

5000|$|Inspiration for the J-2 {{dates back}} to various NASA studies {{conducted}} in the late 1950s, of LH2-fuelled engines <b>producing</b> <b>thrust</b> of up to 665 kN following {{the success of the}} 67 kN RL-10 used on the Atlas-Centaur’s Centaur upper stage. As ever-heavier launch vehicles entered consideration, NASA began to look at engines <b>producing</b> <b>thrusts</b> of up to 890 kN, with development being officially authorized following the 1959 report of the Saturn Vehicle Evaluation Committee. A source evaluation board was formed to nominate a contractor from five bidding companies, and approval was given on 1 June 1960 for Rocketdyne to begin development of a “high-energy rocket engine, fuelled by LOX and hydrogen, {{to be known as the}} J-2”.
