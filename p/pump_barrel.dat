50|$|When {{the rods}} {{at the pump}} end are {{travelling}} up, the traveling valve is closed and the standing valve is open (due to the drop in pressure in the <b>pump</b> <b>barrel).</b> Consequently, the <b>pump</b> <b>barrel</b> fills with the fluid from the formation as the traveling piston lifts the previous contents of the barrel upwards. When the rods begin pushing down, the traveling valve opens and the standing valve closes (due {{to an increase in}} pressure in the <b>pump</b> <b>barrel).</b> The traveling valve drops through the fluid in the barrel (which had been sucked in during the upstroke). The piston then reaches the end of its stroke and begins its path upwards again, repeating the process.|$|E
50|$|Often, gas is {{produced}} {{through the same}} perforations as the oil. This can be problematic if gas enters the pump, because it can result in {{what is known as}} gas locking, where insufficient pressure builds up in the <b>pump</b> <b>barrel</b> to open the valves (due to compression of the gas) and little or nothing is pumped. To preclude this, the inlet for the pump can be placed below the perforations. As the gas-laden fluid enters the well bore through the perforations, the gas bubbles up the annulus (the space between the casing and the tubing) while the liquid moves down to the standing valve inlet. Once at the surface, the gas is collected through piping connected to the annulus.|$|E

Ni/MoS 2 composite coatings with different content of MoS 2 were produced {{on the surface}} of 1045 steel by laser cladding technology. SEM and EPMA were used to analyze the microstructures and micro area compositions of the coatings. Dry friction and wear properties of the coatings were tested by friction and wear tester. The results indicate that the microstructures of Ni/MoS 2 composite coating are large quantities of different-form white silicides and black sulfides distributing on the substrate. The sulfides mainly consist of CrxSy, MoS 2 and FeS. When the content of MoS 2 is 9 %, Ni/MoS 2 composite coating exhibits best tribological properties.

40|$|It {{is known}} that an axial piston <b>pump</b> <b>barrel</b> {{experiences}} small oscillations due to forces acting over it. Cavitation als o occurs in many cases, damaging the plate and barrel sliding surfaces and therefore reducing the volumetric and overall efficiency of the pump. More importantly, the resulting failure of the pump is often a critical issue in modern industrial applications. The complex fluctuation movement of the barrel while turning around the piston pump axis, has been experimentally evaluated in this paper, also the barrel plate film thickness will be experimentally studied, showing that {{a large amount of}} the piston pump leakage occurs between the barrel/plate gap. The present paper demonstrates the importance of properly designing the barrel/plate sliding surface. Some of the paper conclusions are that the film thickness between the barrel and the plate sharply decreases as oil temperature increases, mixed lubrication appears under most of the conditions studied and it is especially severe at high temperatures. With regards to the barrel dynamics two main frequencies appear, one related to the torque created when each pis ton enters and leaves the pressure kidney port, and a much higher frequency due to the elastic and plastic metal to metal contact.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 It {{should be}} an {{objective}} to predict bearing housing vibrations by means of finite element methods and avoid them in the design phase rather than to go in for corrective actions on the test bed or in the field. Bearing housing vibrations due to an excitation by the impeller vanes occur, {{if there is a}} natural frequency of the pump. The finite element method is a useful tool to determine natural frequencies but it is still necessary to compare them with real tested structures. Especially the connecting stiffness between different parts in a structure and the boundary conditions has often to be estimated. Within this paper the determination of bearing housing frequencies has been undertaken systematically from a simple test device to a complete <b>barrel</b> <b>pump.</b> With the test device several influences onto the natural frequencies were studied, such as internal pressure, bolting, seals, and foundation stiffness. It is demonstrated that with appropriate modeling and assumptions the measured frequencies can be accurately met by means of finite elements.

An experimental modal analysis was carried out on the real structure of this pump assembly. At several locations of the surface transducers were placed and the response due to the hammer test was identified in terms of frequencies and modal shapes. This result was correlated with the finite element results to update the finite element model and obtain better congruence between experiment and analysis. The results were promising, especially for the most important bearing housing natural frequency, where the differences between analysis and test were very low.

These effects can be minimized by controlling the amount of heat generated as well as how the components of the seal react to increased temperature.
