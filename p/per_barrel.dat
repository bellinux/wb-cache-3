5|$|In her April 2008 budget, Stelmach's Finance Minister Iris Evans {{forecast}} a $1.6billion surplus for 2008–2009. By August, she had revised {{this prediction}} to $8.5billion. The {{major reason for}} this change {{is an increase in}} oil prices: while she had estimated in April that they would average $78 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> over the fiscal year, by August increases—including a high of $147 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> in July—have led her to make a new estimate of a $119.25 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> average. By November, prices had fallen to $55 <b>per</b> <b>barrel,</b> and Evans estimated a $2billion surplus. By February 2009, the government of Alberta appeared poised to run a $1billion deficit. In April 2009, Evans released her budget for 2009–2010, in which she anticipated a $4.6billion deficit. This is the largest deficit in Alberta's history, and its first in sixteen years. The government's fiscal plan includes deficits until 2012–2013, when it again anticipates a surplus.|$|E
5|$|The Muscat International Airport reopened {{after three}} days while Fujairah reopened on June 7 after it was closed the day before. The cyclone caused little impact to oil {{facilities}} along its path; after the initial price rises, oil dropped over USD2 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> as a result. Across the northern Arabian Sea, the passage of Gonu produced stronger winds and significant upwelling– an oceanographic phenomenon that involves {{the replacement of the}} nutrient-depleted surface water with deeper nutrient-rich water; the passage caused a significant increase in phytoplankton. Additionally, the cyclone delayed the arrival of the Indian Ocean south-west monsoon in the Western Ghats in India.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents <b>per</b> <b>barrel,</b> less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E
25|$|Unstable {{fossil fuel}} prices has made {{investment}} in fossil fuel extraction a more risky investment opportunity. West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell in value from $107 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> in June 2014 to $50 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> in January 2015.

25|$|Coal (by {{liquefaction}} technology) {{is one of}} the backstop {{resources that}} could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under peak oil. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 <b>per</b> <b>barrel,</b> with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to oil sand projects, with an oil price around $70 <b>per</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Price {{increases}} {{were also}} imposed greatly. Since short-term oil demand is inelastic, immediate demand falls little {{when the price}} rises. Thus, market prices rose from $3 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> to $12 <b>per</b> <b>barrel</b> to reduce demand to the new, lower level of supply. The world financial system, which was already {{under pressure from the}} Bretton Woods breakdown, was set on a path of recessions and inflation that persisted until the early 1980s, with oil prices remaining elevated until 1986.|$|E
