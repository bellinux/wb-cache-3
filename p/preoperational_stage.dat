In this paper, we present data from think aloud studies that demonstrate the nature of those difficulties. In the think alouds, novices were required to complete short programming tasks which involved either hand executing ("tracing") a short piece of code, or writing a single sentence describing the purpose of the code.

Lullabies, folk songs, ballads, tongue twisters, word puzzles and people songs introduce children with the word existence of mother tongue. The literature products help children learn Turkish, the mother tongue, effectively in the sensory-motor and <b>preoperational</b> <b>stages</b> of development. Native language education through the culture also contributes to the awareness of language and nationality. The classification of the folk literature products according to children’s development and maturation phases, their sensation-opinion adequacies, their tastes and habits, their dream worlds and their usage as a material of children’s literature with scientific methods depend on in common tries of language teachers, pedagogs, educational researchers and psychologists.

40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{research}} conducted {{in the area of}} information seeking behavior in children, the research focusing on young children, more specifically on pre-kindergarten students, is almost nonexistent. Children at this age are in the <b>preoperational</b> developmental <b>stage.</b> They tend to display curiosity about the world around them, and use other people as a means to gain the information they are seeking. Due to the insistence from President Obama to implement pre-kindergarten programs for all low and middle class children, the need to understand the cognitive, emotional, and physical needs of these children is becoming increasingly imperative. To researchers, the actions displayed by these young children on a daily basis remain vital in determining the methods by which they are categorized, studies, and even taught. This study employed Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory (SDT), Dervin's sense-making theory, Kuhlthau''s information search process model (ISP), and Shenton and Dixon's microcosmic model of information seeking via people to lay the theoretical foundational framework. This ethnographic study aimed to fill the age gap found in information seeking literature. By observing young children in the school setting, I gained insight into how these children seek information. The resulting information collected via field observations and semi-structured interviews were coded based on Shenton and Dixon's model of information seeking via people. The findings, in Chapter 5, revealed emerging codes and trends in the information seeking behaviors of pre-kindergarten students...|$|R
40|$|A content {{analysis}} was conducted of all UK local daily newspaper articles appearing {{in the first half}} of 1981, concerned with nuclear power or renewable alternatives. Evaluative coverage of these technologies was compared on dimensions found to characterise energy issues (economic, environmental, technological future/political, physical and psychological risks). In addition, comparisons were drawn between coverage in areas 'threatened' with the potential siting of a new nuclear power station and that in 'unaffected' areas. The development stage of the two technologies and the degree of 'factual' as opposed to 'polemical' coverage they attracted were also recorded. In evaluative terms, nuclear power was evaluated overwhelmingly negatively, and alternative positively. Moreover, this pattern showed a degree of consistency irrespective of the dimension of evaluation. The 'threatened' subsample was most negatively disposed towards nuclear power. Polemical coverage was greater for nuclear power than for alternatives and greatest in the 'threatened' sample. The category also contained articles more likely to attract attention because of their greater headline size and length. Whereas most coverage of nuclear power concentrates on <b>preoperational</b> or operational <b>stages</b> coverage of alternatives is more concerned with its formative and planning states. These findings were related to people's attitudes concerning nuclear power, and the growth is antinuclear feeling in particular. ...|$|R
5000|$|Similar to preoperational children's egocentric {{thinking}} is their structuring of a {{cause and effect}} relationships.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{displayed}} a concern {{related to the}} elementary school child 2 ̆ 7 s inability to use maps commonly associated with the social studies program.

Professional literature related to Piaget 2 ̆ 7 s theory about how children develop cognitive abilities and how movement between developmental <b>stages</b> (<b>preoperational</b> to concrete and concrete to formal) is facilitated was reviewed. The review revealed that the criteria of concrete experiences, social interaction and exploratory experiences should be displayed in instructional activities to facilitate movement between developmental stages. ^ Through use of the suggested map skills and the Piagetian criteria suggested for facilitation of transitions between developmental stages, 24 map skill activities were developed. These activities were presented in a matrix of four basic map skills, two transitions, and three Piagetian criteria. ^ A panel of experts knowledgeable in the application of Piaget 2 ̆ 7 s theory to elementary school curriculum and/or experience in the consideration of map skills within the context of Piaget 2 ̆ 7 s notions about how children learn was used to determine whether or not the Piagetian criteria were met in the wording of the activities. A Delphi procedure was used to refine the map skill activities and reach an acceptable level of agreement in terms of Piagetian criteria.

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{centration}} is observed predominantly in {{children in the}} <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> of cognitive development. Conversely, children in the concrete operational stage demonstrate decentration - an ability to recognize alternate point of views and a straying away from egocentric thinking. Piaget concluded that, by age 7, children were able decenter their thoughts and acknowledge perspectives different than their own. This was evidenced by the consistent and correct selection of photographs by seven- and eight-year-olds in the 1956 study.|$|E
50|$|In psychology, {{centration}} is {{the tendency}} to focus on one salient aspect of a situation and neglect other, possibly relevant aspects. Introduced by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget through his cognitive-developmental stage theory, centration is a behaviour often demonstrated in the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage.</b> Piaget claimed that egocentrism, a common element responsible for preoperational children’s unsystematic thinking, was causal to centration. Research on centration has primarily been made by Piaget, shown through his conservation tasks, while contemporary researchers have expanded on his ideas.|$|E
50|$|During this stage, {{children}} between the age of 7 and 11 use appropriate logic to develop cognitive operations and begin applying this new thinking to different events they may encounter. Children in this stage incorporate inductive reasoning, which involves drawing conclusions from other observations {{in order to make}} a generalization. Unlike the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage,</b> children can now change and rearrange mental images and symbols to form a logical thought, an example of this is reversibility in which the child now has the ability to reverse an action just by doing the opposite.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional human intuition is a {{function}} of the human mind, defined particularly by the psychologist and psychiatrist Carl Jung. Psychologist Jean Piaget showed that intuitive functioning within the normally developing human child at the Intuitive Thought Substage of the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> occurred at from four to seven years of age. In Carl Jung's concept of synchronicity, the concept of [...] "intuitive intelligence" [...] is described as something like a capacity that transcends ordinary-level functioning to a point where information is understood with a greater depth than is available in more simple rationally-thinking entities.|$|E
50|$|Symbolic thought {{refers to}} the ability to use words, images, and other symbols to {{represent}} words or feelings. During the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> a child's capacity for symbolism increases, this is shown by their increase in language use during this stage. This can also be seen by the way children play with objects, a stick becomes a sword and a box becomes armor. Children in this stage still might not understand that a map represents a real place, and that a picture of food does not have a smell.|$|E
5000|$|The Three Mountain Problem was a task {{developed}} by Jean Piaget IPA: /ʒɑ̃ pjaʒɛ/, a Swiss developmental psychologist. Piaget {{came up with}} a theory for developmental psychology based on cognitive development. Cognitive development, according to his theory, took place in four stages. These four stages were classified as the sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational and formal operational stages. The Three Mountain Problem was devised by Piaget to test whether a child’s thinking was egocentric, which was also a helpful indicator of whether the child was in the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> or the concrete operational stage of cognitive development.|$|E
5000|$|Conservation tasks test a child’s {{ability to}} see that some {{properties}} are conserved or invariant after an object undergoes physical transformation. The following tasks also explain {{the different types of}} conservation. Piaget proposed that children's inability to conserve is due to weakness in the way children think during the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> (ages 2-6). This stage of cognitive development is characterized by children focusing on a single, salient dimension of height or length, while ignoring other important dimensions about a situation. [...] Children during this stage also tend to focus on the static characteristics of objects, instead of focusing on when objects undergo changes, which is a critical element of the following tasks.|$|E
5000|$|Childhood {{is the age}} span {{ranging from}} birth to adolescence. According to Piagets theory of {{cognitive}} development, childhood consists of two stages: <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> and concrete operational stage. In developmental psychology, childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of infancy and toddlerhood (learning to walk and talk, ages birth to 4), early childhood (play age covering the kindergarten and early grade school years up to grade 4 (5-10 years old)), preadolescence, around 11 and 12 (where puberty could possibly begin in early developers but could equally be in early childhood if the child has not reached puberty), and adolescence (puberty (early adolescence, 13-15) through post-puberty (late adolescence, 16-19) [...] ). Various childhood factors could affect a persons attitude formation.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous task {{indicative}} of centration is the conservation of liquids task. In one version, the child is shown two glasses, A1 and A2, that are filled to the same height. The child is asked if the two glasses contain {{the same amount of}} liquid, in which the child almost always agrees that they do. Next, the experimenter pours the liquid from A2 to glass P, which is lower and wider. The child is then asked if the amount of liquid is still the same. At the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage,</b> children will respond that the amount is not the same, with either the taller glass or the wider glass containing more liquid. Once the child has reached the concrete operational stage, however, the child will conclude the amount of liquid is still the same.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 17th century, two {{philosophers}} independently wrote {{works that}} have been widely influential in child rearing. John Locke's 1693 book Some Thoughts Concerning Education is a well known foundation for educational pedagogy from a Puritan standpoint. Locke {{highlights the importance of}} experiences to a child's development, and recommends developing their physical habits first. In 1762, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau published a volume on education, Emile: or, On Education. He proposed that early education should be derived less from books and more from a child's interactions with the world. Of these, Rousseau is more consistent with slow parenting, and Locke is more for concerted cultivation.Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development describes how children represent and reason about the world. This is a developmental stage theory that consists of a Sensorimotor stage, <b>Preoperational</b> <b>stage,</b> Concrete operational stage, and Formal operational stage. Piaget was a pioneer in the field of child development and continues to influence parents, educators and other theorists.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} paper, Freud (1891) distinguishes between word-presentations, the mental images of words, and thing-presentations, the {{representations}} of actual objects. Word-presentations involve the linking of a conscious idea to a verbal stimulus, {{are associated with}} the secondary processes, and are oriented towards reality. Thing-presentations are essentially pre- or nonverbal images of objects, {{are associated with the}} primary processes, and are not necessarily connected with reality (Rycroft, 1995; Gibeault, 2005a, 2005b; Lanteri-Laura, 2005b). The influence of the external world on the ego is apparent here in that mental processes and word-presentations become connected only gradually as the ego differentiates from the id as a result of contact with the environment (Rycroft, 1995; Freud, 1923). The idea of thing vs. word-presentations is also evident in Freud's hypotheses concerning schizophrenia (Rycroft, 1995; Freud, 1894, 1896). It is suggested that, as a defense against intrapsychic conflict, schizophrenics divest thing-presentations of significance and come to treat word-presentations as actual things (cf. mental functioning in Piaget's <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> of cognitive development).|$|E
5000|$|According to Piaget, a Swiss {{developmental}} psychologist {{known for}} his epistemological studies with children, every child experiences imaginary audience during the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> of development. He also stated that children will outgrow this stage by age 7 but as we know now this stage lasts much longer than that. Piaget also said imaginary audience happens because young children believe others see what they see, know what they know, hear what they hear, and feel what they feel[...] The extremes to which adolescents experience an imaginary audience, however, varies from child to child. Some children {{are considered to be}} more [...] "egocentric" [...] than others and experience more of an extreme imaginary audience or have more of an elaborate personal fable. Therefore, children then subconsciously put more value on the idea that everyone cares about what they are doing at all times. This is very common in adolescents during this level of development as the child is going through Erik Erikson's identity vs.. identity confusion.|$|E
5000|$|Class {{inclusion}} {{refers to}} a kind of conceptual thinking that children in the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> cannot yet grasp. Children's inability to focus on two aspects of a situation at once inhibits them from understanding the principle that one category or class can contain several different subcategories or classes. For example, a four-year-old girl may be shown a picture of eight dogs and three cats. The girl knows what cats and dogs are, and she is aware that they are both animals. However, when asked, [...] "Are there more dogs or animals?" [...] she is likely to answer [...] "more dogs". This is due to her difficulty focusing on the two subclasses and the larger class all at the same time. She may have been able to view the dogs as dogs or animals, but struggled when trying to classify them as both, simultaneously. Similar to this is concept relating to intuitive thought, known as [...] "transitive inference".|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} to viewing {{the ways in}} which information is processed in humans was suggested by Jean Piaget in what is called the Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory (Presnell, 1999). Piaget developed his model based on development and growth. He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process. The four stages are: the sensorimotor (from birth to 2 years), preoperational (2-6 years), concrete operational (6-11 years), and formal operational periods (11 years and older). During the sensorimotor stage, newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes. In the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage,</b> children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people's point of view. The concrete operational stage is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem. The last stage is the formal operational, in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments.|$|E
50|$|Magical {{thinking}} is most prominent in children between ages 2 and 7. During this age, children strongly {{believe that their}} personal thoughts have a direct effect {{on the rest of}} the world. Therefore, if they experience something tragic that they do not understand, e.g. a death, their minds will create a reason to feel responsible. Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist, came up with a theory of four developmental stages. Children between ages 2 and 7 would be classified under his <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> of development. During this stage children are still developing their use of logical thinking. A child's {{thinking is}} dominated by perceptions of physical features, meaning that if the child is told that a family pet has gone away, then the child will have difficulty comprehending the transformation of the dog not being around anymore. Magical thinking would be evident here, since the child may believe that the family pet being gone is just temporary. Their young minds in this stage do not understand the finality of death and magical thinking may bridge the gap.|$|E
5000|$|Called the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> by Jean Piaget, this is {{the stage}} during which the child {{repeatedly}} asks [...] "Why?", and is used to build relationships with the child. The child can't yet perform the abstract thinking operations. The child {{has to be able}} to see what is being talked about, because they do not understand the concepts of logic, betrayal, contemplation, etc. This means that they think literally: if a child is told that they have to go to bed because [...] "night is falling", they will ask how can the night (literally) fall from the sky. They also see the human characteristics in every object, e.g. the table [...] "is bad" [...] if they accidentally hit it with their foot and it hurts. They also exhibit egocentrism; not to be confused with egoism; that being said, they do not comprehend that the other person has beliefs and the children at this age think that what they think, everybody thinks. There is also a matter of perceptive centration, which causes the children to primarily see what is visually most prominent on someone/something, e.g. if a man has long hair, the child will think he's a woman.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concrete}} operational {{stage is}} the third stage of Piaget's theory of cognitive development. This stage, which follows the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage,</b> occurs {{between the ages of}} 7 and 11 (preadolescence) years, and is characterized by the appropriate use of logic. During this stage, a child's thought processes become more mature and [...] "adult like". They start solving problems in a more logical fashion. Abstract, hypothetical thinking is not yet developed in the child, and children can only solve problems that apply to concrete events or objects. At this stage, the children undergo a transition where the child learns rules such as conservation. Piaget determined that children are able to incorporate Inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning involves drawing inferences from observations {{in order to make a}} generalization. In contrast, children struggle with deductive reasoning, which involves using a generalized principle in order to try to predict the outcome of an event. Children in this stage commonly experience difficulties with figuring out logic in their heads. For example, a child will understand that [...] "A is more than B" [...] and [...] "B is more than C". However, when asked [...] "is A more than C?", the child might not be able to logically figure the question out in his or her head.|$|E
5000|$|Jean Piaget was a Swiss {{scholar who}} began his studies in {{intellectual}} development in the 1920s. Piaget’s first interests were those that dealt with {{the ways in which}} animals adapt to their environments and his first scientific article about this subject was published when he was 10 years old. This eventually led him to pursue a Ph.D. in Zoology, which then led him to his second interest in epistemology. Epistemology branches off from philosophy and deals with the origin of knowledge. Piaget believed the origin of knowledge came from Psychology, so he traveled to Paris and began working on the first “standardized intelligence test” at Alfred Binet laboratories; this influenced his career greatly. As he carried out this intelligence testing he began developing a profound interest in the way children’s intellectualism works. As a result, he developed his own laboratory and spent years recording children’s intellectual growth and attempted to find out how children develop through various stages of thinking. This led to Piaget develop four important stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor stage (birth to age 2), <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage</b> (age 2 to 7), concrete-operational stage (ages 7 to 12), and formal-operational stage (ages 11 to 12, and thereafter). Piaget concluded that adaption to an environment (behaviour) is mananged through schemes and adaption occurs through assimilation and accommodation.http://www.newriver.edu/images/stories/library/Stennett_Psychology_Articles/Piagets%20Theory%20of%20Cognitive%20Development.pdf ...|$|E
50|$|Youth {{advertising}} {{is an important}} determinant of consumer behaviour. It can influence an individuals product preferences and purchases. Studying the consumer behaviour of youth {{may be seen as}} a negative thing. It could impact and contribute to changing a child’s set of values and morals, whilst in the midst of shaping their character. Young consumers are more susceptible to marketing as part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex is not fully mature until early adulthood. This may lead to an individual making uninformed decisions and acting impulsively. The vulnerability of young consumers can be taken advantage of as they are more influenced by advertising messages than adults. Marketers believe that the brands consumers build relationships with when they are young will carry over and be maintained when they get older. This would increase the chances of those individuals staying brand loyal. Cognitive studies use Piaget’s Theory to analyse age-based differences in a child’s ability to process, understand and comprehend television content. There are three stages consisting of preoperational for ages 2 to 7, concrete operational for ages 7 to 11 and formal operational for ages above 12. In the <b>preoperational</b> <b>stage,</b> a child focusses on a products appearance, while initiating animistic thinking. In the concrete operational stage, a child now has the ability to understand the world more realistically and the intention of advertisers to sell products. In the formal operational stage, a child has the ability to distinguish motives of the advertiser. Factors that may co-determine a child’s consumer behaviour include socio-economic level of the family and parent-child interaction. Young consumers may not have disposable incomes and many rely solely on parents as a source of finance. Research shows that people with higher incomes tend to have a higher level of price acceptance towards consumables. Depending on certain factors, purchasing certain brands may depend on the cost associated.|$|E
