50|$|In Māori {{tradition}} Tama-te-kapua was {{the captain}} of the Te Arawa canoe which came to New Zealand from Polynesia in about 1350. The reason for his leaving his homeland was the theft by his brother Whakaturia and himself of breadfruit (kuru or <b>poroporo)</b> from a tree belonging to a chief named Uenuku. The Te Arawa canoe landed at Maketu, New Zealand, where Tama-te-kapua settled. His descendants peopled this part and the Rotorua region. Today their descendants say of Te Arawa canoe that the bow piece is Maketu and the stern-piece is Mount Tongariro. The meeting house at Te Papaiouru Marae is named after Tamatekapua.|$|E
50|$|The valley {{receives}} {{a high level}} of rainfall — from 1600 mm per year at the coast, to more than 4000 mm per year in the Raukūmara Range. This water drains into a large number of streams and rivers, which flow to Waiapu River, the main stem in the north-east of the valley. The Waiapu River flows north-east from the joining of the Mata River and the Tapuaeroa River near Ruatōria, and reaches the Pacific Ocean near Rangitukia. Other tributaries in the valley include the Mangaoporo, <b>Poroporo,</b> Wairoa, Maraehara rivers, and the Paoaruku stream. A tributary of the Mata River, the Waitahaia River, is renowned for its brown trout — a European species of fish introduced into New Zealand for fishing in the late 1860s.|$|E

50|$|The Waiapu River is a {{river in}} the Gisborne District of the North Island of New Zealand, with a total length of {{approximately}} 130 km. Found in the north-east of the Waiapu Valley, it flows north-east from the joining of the Mata River and the Tapuaeroa River (both of which flow from the Raukumara Ranges), then passes by Ruatoria before reaching the Pacific Ocean at Rangitukia. Other tributaries of the Waiapu River include the Mangaoporo, <b>Poroporo,</b> Wairoa, Maraehara rivers, and the Paoaruku stream. It is the most well known {{river in the}} region, and lies within the rohe (territory) of Ngāti Porou, the largest iwi (extended kinship group or tribe) on the East Coast, and second largest in New Zealand. The area {{was the site of}} hostilities during the New Zealand Wars from June to October in 1865, both between Pākehā (New Zealand Europeans) and Māori, and between factions of Ngāti Porou.|$|E
40|$|The tomato/potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), TPP) is {{a species}} of Psylloidea first {{detected}} in New Zealand in 2006. Since its incursion the TPP {{has proved to be}} a major insect pest of solanaceous crops, particularly potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) and capsicums (Capsicum L.). The TPP is a vector of Zebra Chip Disease or liberibacter (Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum syn. psyllaurous), a lethal plant disease related to Citrus greening disease (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus). Successive annual population outbreaks coupled with widespread liberibacter infection continues to challenge New Zealand‘s horticulture sector. Three traditional Maori food sources, namely taewa (Solanaceae, Solanum tuberosum L. ssp. andigena and ssp. tuberosum), kumara (Convolvulaceae, Ipomoea batatas (l.) Lam.) and <b>poroporo</b> (Solanaceae, Solanum aviculare G. Forst syn. S. Laciniatum (LINN.), are known to be susceptible to TPP infestation. Kumara and taewa are annual summer plants present during the peak TPP development and population growth period. <b>Poroporo</b> flowers and fruits year-round and is therefore theoretically susceptible to infestation throughout the year and may serve as a potential overwintering host and food source for TPP. <b>Poroporo</b> was assessed as an overwintering host of the TPP and the lifecycle progression of TPP was also compared on the three host plant species; taewa, kumara and <b>poroporo.</b> The role of these three host plants in the annual lifecycle of this insect pest in the New Zealand environment. The results showed that <b>poroporo</b> was not an important overwintering host of the TPP in the Manawatu/Rangitikei region; rather it can be viewed as an alternative or refuge host in the absence of the primary solanaceous host species and other volunteer weed host plants. The results indicated that taewa is a more suitable host of the TPP than <b>poroporo</b> and kumara. In the same vein, <b>poroporo</b> is clearly more suitable as a host than kumara. The relationship seen in this study in terms of host suitability can be pictorially represented as; Taewa> Poroporo> Kumara This study showed that all three host species are capable of supporting TPP and therefore each of the host species should be managed with a view to minimise the impact of TPP across seasons...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{relationship}} between the landscape as representation and as reality in Japan. Through the analysis of essentialized natural imagery and landscapes in illustrated story scrolls of the Heian court and Meiji era woodblock prints, and comparing these to two films of the animation house of Studio Ghibli, Tonari no Totoro by Miyazaki Hayao and Omohide <b>Poroporo</b> by Takahata Isao, I argue that these animated films convey a new message of environmentalism to the Japanese viewing audience by altering the traditional Japanese visual language. Furthermore, I argue that in doing so, these films have aided in altering {{the relationship between the}} Japanese people and landscape of Japan, leading to a revised national identity framed by a new environmentalism...|$|E
40|$|Solanum aviculare, {{endemic to}} Australasia, is an opportunist pioneer {{secondary}} successional plant occupying disturbed and open lowland habitats, {{and was an}} important medicinal and cultural species to Māori known as <b>poroporo.</b> It is currently in 'decline', the ecological decline appearing to correspond {{to a decline in}} knowledge and cultural use of the species. To gain understanding {{of the reasons for the}} decline, enhance ecological knowledge, assist conservation and cultural restoration of Solanum aviculare this research documented the successional role and cycle of regeneration dynamics and tactics, established morphological characteristics, investigated the genetic diversity and recorded cultural and conservation information. The successional status and role was identified. Growth data identified cohort development and inter-site differences, metadata found height and crown spread growth to be significantly correlated and likely part of an early reproduction and dispersal strategy. Germination of soil cores from differing depths confirmed a viable seed bank exists sufficient for species maintenance. Viable seed spread via animal gut passage was determined by germination and chemical tests, results showed rats passed higher rates of viable seed than birds. Seed germination trials with stratified and fresh seed confirmed temporal and depth behaviour, flowering observation documented temporal differences with the closely allied species Solanum laciniatum, indicating a relationship to stasis induction. Leaf morphology studies documented differences between the two allied species and proposed further nomenclature. Genetic diversity was investigated through the use of PCR/ISSR techniques. Chloroplast DNA was extracted by CTAB and DNA kit protocols. CTAB extraction was unable to effectively remove RNA, although use of DNA samples with high quantities of RNA confirmed that RNA was not an inhibiting factor in PCR production. The production of consistent reliable ISSR bands proved difficult, with no technical explanation found. ISSR findings indicate that Solanum aviculare is highly monomorphic, consisting of predominant invariant monomorphic loci. Twenty primers were tested with no polymorphic loci identified and no intra species variation documented. Indications were also that Solanum aviculare and Solanum laciniatum are inter species invariant on monomorphic loci. Monomorphic loci may possibly be the evolutionary markers of generic differentiation within Solanum. Surveys identified Solanum aviculare as uncommon and rare, existing mainly as single plants or small groups in the majority of areas surveyed. The Threatened and Uncommon Plant listing of Solanum aviculare as an 'at risk declining' species is confirmed and a further Recommendation category proposed. Ecological decline and corresponding decline in cultural use and knowledge of Solanum aviculare was identified through specialist interviews; appearing to be related to removal from Māori of control over their land. The name <b>poroporo</b> being now associated mainly with non indigenous Solanum species. Māori cultural concepts in practice were highlighted as fundamentally important to reversing the decline, with an example of a successful traditional practice based (tikanga) integrative collaborative restoration program being documented. This research forwards that optimal collaborative solutions, programs integrating scientific and tikanga knowledge and practices, provide the best opportunity of reversing the declining trend and for increasing and maintaining knowledge associated with the traditional role of <b>poroporo...</b>|$|E
