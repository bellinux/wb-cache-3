5000|$|Shiva queried, [...] "Shall I {{create a}} girl who was in equal {{strength}} with you?" [...] For this was how Kaliyan defined how his wife should be.She must be more beautiful than I am, but of half the strength. Her mouth should be beautiful. She must have breasts like <b>palmyra</b> <b>nuts.</b> Her face, vulva, eyes and vision should be beautiful. Her hips should be narrow. Her hands, legs, teeth and her walk should be beautiful. Also her thigh should be beautiful. The front of her chest and {{the back of her head}} must be beautiful. She must dress beautifully. She must be created with a sweet fragrance. She must be with a great beauty so that the trimurthi should be lascivious with her.|$|E
5000|$|Several of the Jataka tales {{describe}} the Buddha's past lives as a monkey or an ape (see the Four harmonious animals). For example, the Mahakapi Jataka or Great Monkey King.In {{the heart of}} a Himavat there was a large tree, which bore excellent fruits even bigger than the <b>palmyra</b> <b>nuts</b> having exceedingly sweet flavor; lovely hue and fragrance, which no man had ever seen or noticed before. This tree was also the abode of several monkeys; and the Bodhisatta was born as the king of those monkeys. He was much larger in size than his followers; and was more compassionate and virtuous than others. One day, the monkey king noticed that a branch of the tree had grown just over the stream. It alarmed him, because some of the fruits might drop in the stream, which then might get carried away to the man’s world; and the men would then certainly come to have all the fruits for themselves. So, he instructed the monkeys not to let any fruit grow on that branch if they wished to enjoy the fruits for a longer period. … one piece of fruit fell and floated downstream, where it came into the hands of a king who tasted it, and then remarked, [...] "Nothing could surpass the flavor of this fruit". He then ordered his men to hunt for the tree in and around the river-bank which bore the fruit. Soon the king’s men found out the tree laden with such luscious and delicious fruits. When they saw the monkeys enjoying those fruits, which their king wanted to have so eagerly, they attacked the monkeys mercilessly with volleys of arrows.Witnessing the approaching attacking royal soldiers the Bodhisatta jumped on a mountain peak, which the other monkeys were not likely to copy. There, in order to save his friends he seized a strong rooted tall cane with his legs and bending it towards the tree jumped back and caught hold of the branch of the tree. He then called upon the other monkeys to use him as a bridge to jump upon the mountain peak. Taking advantage of the situation all the monkeys jumped on the mountain and darted away quickly. The monkey king was, however, terribly bruised and injured by being trampled by his mates when acting as a bridge for them. Soon he swooned. The king watched the flight of the monkeys; and also the plight of the monkey king. He was greatly moved by the exemplification of such insight; courage; valor; and sacrifice, which an animal had just displayed to save the lives of his subjects. The king then ordered his men to delicately bring down the unconscious ape and gently place him on a couch and to render the best possible first aid. When the great monkey regained his consciousness the king asked him to explain as to why did he endangered his life to save his subjects, who were rather meant to serve or sacrifice. Like a guru, he then said, [...] "O King! Verily my body is broken but my mind is still sound; I uplifted only those over whom I exercised my royal powers for so long." [...] And before the king could utter some words of praise for the great monkey; he found him dead. (tr. Varma 1999) ...|$|E
40|$|Adsorption of lead(II) from {{wastewater}} effluents using indigenous cellulose based waste biomass, such as nipa palm <b>nut</b> (NPN), <b>palmyra</b> palm <b>nut</b> (PPN), {{oil palm}} empty fruit bunch (EFB), oil palm fibre (OPF), and oil palm shell (OPS), as potential {{raw materials for}} the preparation of activated carbons was studied. Chemical activation method was used in preparing the activated carbon. The influence of various factors namely pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial ion concentration and adsorbent particle size was studied to identify the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents. The amount of Pb 2 + adsorbed increased with increase in adsorbent dosage, and contact time and decreased with increase in particle size and initial ion concentration. The optimum pH was obtained at pH 6 for all the adsorbents. The result of adsorption studies showed that activated carbons produced from OPS and NPN are the most efficient adsorbents {{for the removal of}} Pb 2 + from aqueous solutions. Adsorption data were modeled using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich equations. Equilibrium data fitted well to the Freundlich, Langmuir and Tempkin models. The equilibrium data were best described by Freundlich model. It is seen from the study that all the adsorbents can be used as low-cost adsorbents for the removal of Pb 2 + from aqueous solution...|$|R
