50|$|These {{stations}} give {{detailed information}} about tsunamis while they are still far off shore. Each station consists of a sea-bed bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>recorder</b> (at a depth of 1000-6000 m) which detects {{the passage of a}} tsunami and transmits the data to a surface buoy via acoustic modem. The surface buoy then radios the information to the NTWC via the GOES satellite system. The bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>recorder</b> lasts for two years while the surface buoy is replaced every year. The system has considerably improved the forecasting and warning of tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami buoy {{systems are}} made up of three parts. There is a <b>pressure</b> <b>recorder</b> {{anchored}} {{to the bottom of the}} sea floor. A moored surface buoy and an acoustic transmission link that is connected to the <b>pressure</b> <b>recorder</b> and sends data from the anchored <b>pressure</b> <b>recorder</b> to the surface buoy. The surface buoy has a two and a half meter diameter fiberglass disk covered with foam and has a gross displacement of 4000 kg. The mooring line connecting the surface buoy and the <b>pressure</b> <b>recorder</b> is a nineteen millimeter nylon line that has a tensile strength of 7100 kg. The data being sent from the anchored <b>pressure</b> <b>recorder</b> and the surface buoy consists of temperature and pressure of the surrounding sea water. It retrieves and releases data every 15 seconds to get an average reading of the current weather conditions.Once the data is retrieved to the surface buoy, the pressure data is converted to an average height of the waves surrounding the buoy. The data containing the temperature of the surrounding sea water is important to the calculations because temperature can affect pressure, and sea temperature is required to get that much more of an accurate reading of the ocean swells. Because swell size of ocean varies constantly, the system has two modes of reporting data, standard mode and event modes. Standard mode is the more common mode of the two because standard mode sends the estimated sea surface height and the time these calculations were recorded every 15 minutes. If the software receives data that is not within the recent data averages, the system automatically switches to event mode. Event mode transmits data every 15 seconds and calculates the average sea surface height and the time when data being recorded every minute. If no further data is received that is not out of the averages being calculated at the time, it switches back to standard mode after four hours. When NOAA released the first six DART buoys, their system only had a one way communication system. It was not until 2005 when the first generation of the DART buoy was upgraded to the second generation of the DART buoy. After 2005 the Dart buoys started using Iridium communication satellites that abled you to not only retrieved information but to also send information to a DART. The two-way communications between Tsunami Warning Centers and the <b>pressure</b> <b>recorder</b> made it possible to manually set DART buoys in event mode in case of any suspicion of a possible in-coming tsunamis. To make sure communications are always in contact and secure, the DART buoys have two communication systems; two independent and a redundant communication system. With these updated and reliable communicating systems, data can now be sent where it needs to be sent around the world.|$|E

50|$|It is {{observed}} that a baroclinic Rossby wave propagating westward across the Caribbean Sea, oscillating with {{a period of}} 120 days, is rapidly returned to the east along the southern boundary as coastal shelf waves.

40|$|The {{threat of}} a tsunami in coastal {{communities}} is considerable, especially in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Current warning systems consist of two networks: (1) a network of seismometers, and (2) a network of sea level gauges and bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>recorders.</b> Bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>recorders</b> communicate with ocean surface buoys, which send the data to processing centers through satellite communication uplinks. The ability to quickly and accurately detect a tsunami in the deep ocean is proposed using a new space-based passive microwave radiometer system. Passive microwave radiometry can detect oceanic parameters such as sea-surface temperature and sea surface roughness to contribute to earlier tsunami detection, when the tsunami is farther from shore, which will increase the reaction time for at-risk coastal communities. This thesis will outline a physics based approach to manipulating brightness temperature data from the ocean's surface through the variation {{as a result of}} the satellite platform, the sensor, its location, the antenna, and other considerations. The thesis will give a description of how each component of the overall system will change the surface data because the observations are space-based. The thesis will also outline how the current detection system can be compared to the new space-based system. In the future, the comparison method can be used to make an argument to support the system with the best capability to serve as an efficient and accurate tsunami early-warning system. by Rebecca G.

40|$|The Southern Ocean hosts {{significant}} topographic mixing {{that might}} be associated with internal tides. Tidal signals are evident in bottom temperature at 1000 m in Drake Passage, suggesting that internal tides with an amplitude of between ∼ 20 and 200 m may be present. Various necessary conditions for internal tide generation show that the steep topography in and around Drake Passage can initiate internal tides, and recent global tide models have suggested this region to generate very large interface displacements. Here, we present an attempt to detect internal tides in Drake Passage. During the last 10 years, combinations of bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>recorders</b> and inverted echo sounders have been deployed in the region. The bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>recorders</b> measure predominantly the barotropic tide; the inverted echo sounders measure travel time from sea bed to sea surface and therefore are influenced both by sea level (barotropic tide) and internal sound speed (internal tide). By subtracting one from the other, the internal tide should be detectable. Although the technique works successfully around Hawaii, it does not prove the existence of large internal tides in Drake Passage. The detectability of the internal tidal signal in Drake Passage is investigated using a six-layer one-dimensional model to simulate the bottom pressure and travel time signals of a semi-diurnal tide. The temperature and salinity stratification in Drake Passage is sufficiently weak that large vertical excursions are necessary to produce a signal in travel time detectable above the noise in Drake Passage. An internal tide of at least 70 or 20 m in northern and southern Drake Passage, respectively, would be detected. The fact that these are, perhaps surprisingly, not detected by the combination of bottom pressure and travel time, constrains the internal tides in Drake Passage to be ∼ 20 m in southern Drake Passage, and between 20 and 70 m in northern Drake Passage. The model also predicts that satellite altimetry {{would not be able}} to detect internal tides in Drake Passage, but would in the Brazil Basin and Hawaii regions...|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{seafloor}} deformation can {{be measured}} using pressure, since ambient seawater pressure is a proxy for depth. However, most quartz pressure gauges experience drift that can contaminate expected geodetic signals. An instrument called the Self-Calibrating <b>Pressure</b> <b>Recorder</b> (SCPR) was developed {{to compensate for the}} effects of drift by using a piston gauge to supply a stable reference pressure. SCPR deployments are limited to two years, so to collect longer geodetic records over years to decades the Absolute Self-Calibrating <b>Pressure</b> <b>Recorder</b> (ASCPR) was developed. The ASCPR uses the same calibration system as the SCPR, but instead makes campaign-style measurements of the true, absolute value of pressure. In order for measurements to be accurate, the calibration system components must be known to a few parts per million (ppm). However, during the deployment and the measurement periods, the ASCPR is susceptible to changes in pressure on the order of 100 ppm, due to temperature changes. In the lab, we exposed the ASCPR to temperature changes while measuring the reference pressure to characterize the effects of thermal expansion on the piston gauge. The corrected pressures were stable at a 95 % confidence level of ± 0. 23 kPa, or 2. 3 cm equivalent, corresponding to a 13 ppm effect at a simulated pressure of 19, 000 kPa. We also determined the thermal expansion effects had a time constant of 5. 9 hours, which allows us to determine the changes over time, thereby reducing the amount of time required for the instrument to stabilize. Finally, the coefficient of thermal expansion that minimized the uncertainty in the pressure was less than the nominal value stated by the manufacturer. The uncertainty remained at the 13 ppm level, larger than our desired uncertainty of less than 10 ppm. At this level, the ASCPR can be used to detect larger geodetic signals, but requires further improvements to monitor slow deformation and sea level. My thesis is focused on evaluating the accuracy of the ASCPR and how it depends on the temperature variations during deploymen...|$|E

The observations generally show weak variations in swell energy across the shelf during benign conditions, in qualitative agreement with predictions of a spectral refraction model. Although the predicted ray trajectories are quite sensitive to the irregular shelf bathymetry, the predicted energy variations are surprisingly weak, consistent with the observations. These results indicate that small amplitude swell is not significantly damped on the shelf. However, a large decrease in swell energy levels across the shelf (up to 7 O%) observed with high energy incident swell, is not predicted by the energy conserving refraction model.
