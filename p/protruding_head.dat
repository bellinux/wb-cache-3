25|$|Bradypodion pumilum have a {{much higher}} {{survival}} rate in a metropolitan area if they are bigger in size. Their survival rate was dependent on body size, and the larger the size, the greater the chance that the individual would survive a ten-day period. Larger, older chameleons {{tend to be more}} sedentary compared to the smaller younger ones which means that the larger ones likely have smaller home ranges. Smaller chameleons inhabit grasses while larger chameleons are found mainly in bushes and trees. This is territorial, because it is believed that larger males would cannibalize smaller ones intruding on their territory. An alternative thought is that the smaller chameleons simply do not have big enough limbs to grasp larger branches correctly. When fighting contests occur, the outcome is influenced by the height of the ornamental casque, the relative size of the pink patch {{in the center of the}} flank, and previous experience. The ornamental casque is the <b>protruding</b> <b>head</b> piece of the chameleon, usually with a rounded end. The height of this piece is an honest signal to other male chameleons representing its total size. Similarly with the pink patch in the center of the flank, this is an honest signal showing that the chameleon has a healthy diet correlating to the strength of the individual. The turnover rate in males is thought to be higher than females.|$|E

The underparts are black, although white fringes to the feathers gives the belly a scaly appearance when seen well from below. The tail and the upper wings are black, and the underwings are brown. The eyes are brown and the small bill and very short legs are black. The sexes are identically plumaged, and juveniles differ from the adults only in that the feathers show pale fringes, particularly on the wings. The southern subspecies, A. p. kurodae, has a narrower white rump (15mm/0.6in against the nominate form's 20mm/0.8in), a grey throat and blacker underparts. Juveniles of migratory Apus swifts have a partial moult prior to migration, but retain the larger wing feathers. The moult is completed in the wintering grounds, where adults have a complete moult.|$|E

60|$|Some {{idea of the}} {{magnitude}} and weight of the vessel may be formed {{from the fact that}} each iron plate weighs about the third of a ton, and is fastened with a hundred iron rivets. About thirty thousand of these plates were used in her construction, and three million rivets. The fastening of these rivets was one among the many curious operations performed in course of building. The riveting men were arranged in gangs, each gang consisting of two riveters, one holder-up, and three boys. Two boys were stationed at the fire or portable forge, and one with the holder-up. This boy's duty was to receive the red-hot rivet with his pincers from the boy at the forge, and insert it in the hole destined for its reception, the point protruding about an inch. The holder-up immediately placed his heavy hammer against the head of the rivet, and held it firmly there, while the two riveters assailed it in front with alternate blows, until the countersunk part of the hole was filled up, after which the <b>protruding</b> <b>head</b> was cut off smooth with the plate, the whole operation scarce occupying a minute. In riveting the double part of the ship the holder-up and his boy were necessarily in the interior part of the tubes, and passed the whole day in the narrow space between, (of two feet ten inches wide), in comparative darkness, having only the glimmer afforded by a single dip candle, and being immediately under the deafening blows of the riveters.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} a relatively <b>protruded</b> <b>head</b> and neck posture on postural balance, in computer based worker. Method Thirty participants, who work with computers for over 6 hrs per day (Group I), and thirty participants, who rarely work with computers (Group II), were enrolled. The head and neck posture was measured by estimating angles A and B. A being the angle between the tragus of the ear, the lateral canthus of the eye, and horizontal line and B the angle between the C 7 spinous process, the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal line. The severity of head protrusion with neck extension was assessed by the subtraction of angle A from angle B. We also measured the center of gravity (COG) and postural balance by using computerized dynamic posturography to determine the effect of computer-based work on postural balance. Results Results indicated that group I had a relatively more <b>protruded</b> <b>head</b> with extensive neck posture (angle B-A of group I and group II, 28. 2 ± 8. 3, 32. 9 ± 6. 0; p<. 05). The COG of group I tended more toward the anterior than that of group II. Postural imbalance and impaired ability to regulate movement in forward and backward direction were also found. Conclusion The {{results of this study suggest}} that forward head postures during computer-based work may contribute to some disturbance in the balance of healthy adults. These results could be applied to education programs regarding correct postures when working at a computer for extended periods of time...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the bolt clampup force relaxation behavior in countersunk, single-lap bolted joints between glass/vinylester resin laminates and steel panels. Additionally, the effect of bolt clampup force relaxation on the bearing strength of such joints was studied. Specially-instrumented bolts were used to measure clampup force relaxation in ten countersunk joint specimens. A 100, 000 pound capacity MTS testing machine {{was used to evaluate}} the bearing strength in tension of sixteen countersunk bolted joint specimens torqued to four different levels of initial torque, as well as four similar protruding-head bolted joint specimens (at the same levels of torque). The results of the relaxation experiments indicate that clampup force varies widely in nominally identical joints at identical torque levels, by as much as a factor of two. In countersunk bolt joints with sufficiently high initial clampup force, the clampup force relaxed in accordance with the inverse power equation proposed by Shivakumar and Crews for protruding-head bolt joints in graphite/epoxy laminates. Relaxation in the present experiments proceeded faster than in the protruding-head joints studied by Shivakumar and Crews; this {{is believed to have been}} due to the relative lack of constraint provided at the GRP surface by the countersunk bolt. The results from the bearing strength experiments suggest that clampup force has only a small beneficial effect on bearing strength in both countersunk and <b>protruding</b> <b>head</b> single-lap joints, when compared to double-lap joints. The reduced effectiveness of clampup force in increasing the bearing strength is believed to be a result of the increased joint rotation and bolt bending inherent in single-lap joints. These phenomena lead to delamination and brooming failure in the GRP, which can be avoided in double lap joints with sufficient bolt clampup force. The countersunk joints failed at a load approximately 20 % lower than the <b>protruding</b> <b>head</b> joints. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study is presented {{on the effects}} of bolt-hole clearance on the load distribution in multi-bolt composite joints. Single-shear, three-bolt joints were studied. The specimens were manufactured from graphite/epoxy HTA/ 6376, with quasi-isotropic lay-ups. <b>Protruding</b> <b>head</b> bolts of 8 mm diameter and torqued to finger-tight conditions were used. Different combinations of clearance were obtained by using four different reamers and a purpose-designed high-precision drilling jig. Instrumented bolts with strain gauges attached for measurement of shear strain at the shear plane, were used to measure bolt load distribution. Prior to use in the multi-bolt joints, the bolts were calibrated in single-bolt joints. For assembly of the multi-bolt joints, a special jig had to be designed to allow simultaneous aligning of the bolt along the axis of the joint, centring of each bolt in its hole, and torquing of the bolts to a prescribed level. The results of the study show that relatively small amounts of clearance can have substantial effects on load distribution. As an example, the middle bolt in a joint of this type is normally assumed to carry less load than the outer bolts, and is therefore considered not to be under threat of failure. But in the presence of clearance the load can shift to the middle bolt, potentially causing an unexpected failure mode...|$|E
