This factor, named atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) or, later, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), was first isolated, purified and sequenced from rat atrial extracts [4]. This work was followed by the isolation of related members of a family of natriuretic peptides (NP), <b>pathetic</b> <b>nerve</b> activity by ANF and BNP results in a reduction in NaC reabsorption. The powerful natriuretic and diuretic effects of ANF and BNP are mainly related to an increase in glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction as well as the inhibition of NaC reabsorption {{at the level of the}} collecting duct [13, 14]. The increase in glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction results from dilatation of afferenttigations in which injections of atrial, but not ventri-the heart was first established unequivocally by inves- action is sustained even in acute hemorrhage or prolonged dehydration [12].
