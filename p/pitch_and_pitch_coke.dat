40|$|Workers {{in plants}} {{producing}} carbon anodes for aluminium electrolysis {{are exposed to}} PAHs containing coal tar <b>pitch</b> volatiles, <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>coke.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the suitability of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene to characterize respiratory exposure to PAH, which is most relevant for assessing individual health risks. Six workers in a carbon anode plant volunteered to take part in a personal air sampling and a biological monitoring programme lasting five consecutive 8 -h shifts to determine occupational exposure to airborne PAHs and urinary excretion of l-hydroxypyrene. Exposure to total PAH for all worksites varied from 3. 99 to 120. 6 μg PAH m− 3 and for benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) from 0. 17 to 4. 88 μg BaP m− 3. The concentration of 1 -hydroxypyrene in post- and pre-shift urine samples was in the range (0. 5 - 61. 8 μmol 1 -OHP per mol creatinine) and depended on the worksite. The Spearman rank correlation test showed a low but significant (P< 0. 05) correlation of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene in the post- and pre-shift samples with respiratory pyrene exposure. The quantitative aspects of biological monitoring for the evaluation of respiratory PAH exposure were tested with a pharmacokinetic model. On the basis of individual pyrene exposure, excretion of urinary 1 - hydroxypyrene during the working week was calculated for each worker. The results presented in this investigation indicate that biological monitoring of the pyrene metabolite 1 -hydroxypyrene is a useful indicator of a general PAll exposure, but cannot replace personal air sampling for assessing the lung cancer risk of individuals.

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} to what extent lesbian women demonstrate <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> variation that is different from that of heterosexual women. Study Design. Static group comparison. Methods. The average <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> variation of a group of 34 self-identified lesbian women and an age-matched group of 68 heterosexual women were compared. The speech sample consisted of read speech. Acoustic analysis was performed by means of PRAAT. Results. Mean fundamental frequency in the group of lesbian women was significantly lower than that of the group of heterosexual women. The lesbian woman also showed significantly less pitch variation. Conclusions. Lesbian women tend to demonstrate a lower average <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> less <b>pitch</b> variation than heterosexual women, but this does not mean a confirmation of the popular stereotype that lesbian women are masculine women. In their assessment of clients with voice disorders, clinicians should reckon with the sociophonetic variation that is associated with sexual orientation...|$|R
40|$|Native {{speakers}} {{recognize a}} second language accent mainly by prosodic features. <b>Pitch,</b> <b>pitch</b> range, <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> variability are language-specific <b>and</b> have to be acquired in L 2 acquisition (usually without explicit teaching). Until now, results remain inconclusive as to whether L 2 speakers are able to acquire a pitch range that is wider than their native pitch range. The present paper investigates the acquisition of mean <b>pitch,</b> <b>pitch</b> range, <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> variability in Mandarin Chinese by native speakers of Danish. This is particularly interesting since Chinese uses a relatively wide pitch range whereas Danish has an extremely small pitch range. We show that Danish students can largely acquire the mean <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> range of Mandarin Chinese. However, the pitch variability of Danish-accented Chinese {{turned out to be}} considerably lower than native Chinese, which we tentatively attribute to a poor acquisition of tone...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} what pronunciation features (i. e., segmental and suprasegmental features, {{as well as}} other acoustic properties such as speech rate, intensity, <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> range) affect the intelligibility of Japanese learners of English, when judged by native-speaking (NS; American) and non-native-speaking (NNS; Japanese) listeners. Kashiwagi and Snyder (2008) concluded, based on both statistical and interview data, that intelligibility and accentedness judgments were quasi-independent of each other, and that segmental features in the speech samples of Japanese learners were perceived both by NS (American) and NNS (Japanese) listeners to be more problematic than suprasegmentals. The present study is designed to verify these conclusions by re-examining the data with further statistical procedures. Additional data on speech rate, intensity, <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> range were also added to the statistical analyses to explore the issue of intelligibility. The resulting data suggest that non-native pronunciation of segmentals, especially of certain vowels, affect the judgments of intelligibility most strongly, and that intelligibility scores and accentedness ratings are controlled by different sets of factors. Speech rate, intensity, <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> range are also found to have some effects. The data also suggest that NS (American) and NNS (Japanese) listeners are affected differently by certain pronunciation features...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} on the interactions between <b>coke</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> is of great value for the aluminum industry. This information can help choose the suitable <b>coke</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> pairs {{as well as the}} appropriate mixing parameters to be used during the production of anodes. In this study, the interaction mechanisms of <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>coke</b> at the mixing stage were studied by a sessile-drop test using two coal-tar <b>pitches</b> as the liquid <b>and</b> three petroleum cokes as the substrate. The results showed that the coke–pitch interactions are related to both <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>coke</b> chemical compositions. The contact angle of different coke–pitch systems decreased with increasing time and temperature. At high temperatures, decreasing the pitch viscosity facilitated the spreading of <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> its penetration into the coke bed. The chemical behavior of petroleum <b>cokes</b> <b>and</b> coal tar <b>pitches</b> were studied using the FT-IR spectroscopy and XPS. The results showed that the wettability behavior of <b>cokes</b> by <b>pitches</b> depends on their physical properties as well as the presence of surface functional groups of <b>coke</b> <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> which can form chemical bonds...|$|R
