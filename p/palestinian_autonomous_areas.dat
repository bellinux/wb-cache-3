5|$|This list of <b>autonomous</b> <b>areas</b> {{arranged}} by country gives {{an overview of}} <b>autonomous</b> <b>areas</b> of the world. An <b>autonomous</b> <b>area</b> is defined as an area {{of a country that}} has a degree of autonomy, or has freedom from an external authority. It is typical for it to be geographically distant from the country, or to be populated by a national minority. Countries that include <b>autonomous</b> <b>areas</b> are often federacies. The <b>autonomous</b> <b>areas</b> differ from federal units and independent states in the sense that they, in relation to the majority of other sub-national territories in the same country, enjoy a special status including some legislative powers, within the state (for a detailed list of federated units, see Federated state#List of federal units by federation).|$|R

50|$|An {{autonomous}} administrative division (also {{referred to}} as an <b>autonomous</b> <b>area,</b> entity, unit, region, subdivision, or territory) is a subdivision or dependent territory {{of a country that}} has a degree of self-governance, or autonomy, from an external authority. Typically, it is either geographically distinct {{from the rest of the}} country or populated by a national minority. Decentralization of self-governing powers and functions to such divisions is a way for a national government to try to increase democratic participation or administrative efficiency and/or to defuse internal conflicts. Countries that include <b>autonomous</b> <b>areas</b> may be federacies, federations, or confederations. <b>Autonomous</b> <b>areas</b> can be divided into territorial autonomies, subregional territorial autonomies, and local autonomies.|$|R
