Disney head Michael Eisner hoped to use ABC Family to repurpose ABC network shows. To meet that end, he decided to revive the TGIF block on ABC Family to create additional revenue for ABC's family sitcoms. This effort hit a roadblock {{due to the fact}} that ABC did not own the syndication rights to all of its programs. As such, the [...] "new" [...] TGIF block, which debuted on March 1, 2002, consisted of the recently-acquired dramedy State of Grace, in addition to reruns of ABC's According to Jim and, unusual for what was meant to be a sitcom block, the drama Alias. Due to poor advertising sales, complaints from ABC affiliates, and show <b>producers</b> <b>concerned</b> that the new block would hurt syndication revenue, ABC Family's TGIF was pulled after a few short weeks.|$|E

Estimated demand parameters for avocados indicate that new advertising and promotion {{funded by the}} 2. 5 cents per pound assessment on all Hass avocados sold in the U. S. can offset {{a portion of the}} price impact of increased imports. Producers of other specialty crops may want to investigate the feasibility of using national promotion and research orders to expand demand when faced with increased production or imports. U. S. fruit and vegetable producers have employed government-mandated self-help marketing programs since the 1930 s to increase the demand for their products. Designed to address a particular commodity’s marketing problems, these programs may include one or more provisions selected from grades and standards, research, promotion, quantity controls, or container regulations. Gov-ernment enforcement of rules preventing free riders has facilitated the long-term success of these industry programs. Increased imports resulting from new trade agreements and market integration are not covered by many mandated marketing programs, however, and free riding can once again be a problem for organized commodity groups. The California avocado industry provides a case study of the economic pres-sures from increased imports and ongoing efforts to expand the demand for all avocados using government-mandated marketing programs.

40|$|This is the author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] state of Oregon’s (USA) land use planning framework has long been characterized by tensions between state and local authority, between traditionally-defined “urban” and “rural” concerns, and between the competing interests of various landowners. An examination of Wallowa County, Oregon’s implementation of House Bill 3326, a 2001 law giving counties the power to define certain agricultural lands as “marginal,” and therefore exempt from restrictions on subdivision and development, illustrates the ways in which these tensions become magnified as rural communities attempt to govern private land use in the context of rural restructuring. Implementation of HB 3326 highlighted the tensions between landowners interested in capitalizing on development opportunities afforded by HB 3326, neighboring <b>producers</b> <b>concerned</b> about interference from future amenity migrants, and existing amenity migrants with interests in protecting their rural idyll. Contestations over nonfarm development took place {{in the context of a}} strong agricultural community identity, concerns about the effects of economic restructuring on producers, and local resistance to the rural gentrification process. The process of defining marginality came to encompass not only technical issues of land productivity, but also broader community contestations over the continuation of traditional land uses and the legitimacy of various actors to govern private land...|$|E
40|$|The asset {{participation}} {{relationship between}} the state and the corporate entity is an essential determinant of corporate value in the natural resource sector. Natural re-sources deplete, with the result that oil reserve replacement is an accepted imperative for companies that derive earnings and balance sheet values from global resource assets. Corporate asset values in the sector are underpinned by entitlement to future reserves. Specifically, I show that the global nature of government participation varies and that it matters in which country reserves are held since entitlement structures directly deter-mine how the state and corporate producers share economic rents from resource assets. My global Oil and Gas (O&G) sector study provides market evidence of economic and state variable limits on the value of globalization. Findings revise the low oil price paradigm covered in prior studies and provide evi-dence that, for O&G <b>producers</b> <b>concerned</b> with reserve replacement, global asset values are directly affected by state entitlement terms. In developed OECD countries, state and corporate agent participation terms are price insensitive, and take the form of concession contracts with royalty or profit taxation terms. By contrast, in emerging NON-OECD countries state agents participate on production sharing terms that are linked to the market price of oil. Relative to comparable OECD oil assets, the value of corporate agent participation in Non-OECD O&G assets is limited by explicit and progressive state agent participation terms that favour sovereign state agent returns. I show that unless price sensitive entitlement clauses are is included in the value of cash flow expectations, state participation terms potentially invert risk return convention under conditions of increasing oil prices. The Fama and French (1993) framework is used to provide market evidence of economic state variable limits on the returns for O&G companies with relatively high asset holdings in Non-OECD countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to take a fresh look at the nature of organic production, {{consumption}} and marketing in England and Wales in order to better assess its current and likely contribution to rural development and its ability to meet consumer expectations. Based on a mixed methodological approach the study consulted with 2, 300 individuals to reveal a complex and multi-dimensional sector with a highly committed consumer base. The research aimed to describe and account for: (1) The socio-economic impacts of the organic farm supply chains on rural development; (2) The extent to which organic food delivers consumer expectations; and (3) The barriers affecting conversion to organic farming and expansion of existing organic farms. The research reported here is arguably one of the most integrated studies of organic consumption, production and marketing conducted to date. It throws new light on the nature of organic consumption, underlining both the on-going commitment of the majority of committed organic consumers and the gap in perceptions, degrees of ‘brand trust’ and price sensitivity between this group and the majority of consumers who rarely or never buy organic. While this degree of commitment suggests that recent declines in organic consumption may not be sustained and will soon hit a floor, this finding also points to difficulties, particularly in a time of recession, in enrolling new consumers into organic networks, particularly via the direct marketing channels that smaller producers are more likely to depend on. This group of producers, locally embedded and linked to consumers via short supply chains, fulfil the expectations of many organic consumers and exemplify the idea of alternative food producers. Managed by self selecting, entrepreneurial farmers, these organic producers make a valuable contribution towards employment and income generation within the local rural economy. As our broader analysis of food chains and multiplier effects across the regional and national rural economy shows, however, it is the large scale <b>producers,</b> <b>concerned</b> with the production of bulk commodities and integrated into long supply chains, that inevitably account for the main rural employment and income benefits of the organic sector, if measured in aggregate terms. While there is a good case to be made for the rural development benefits of organic farming, it is important to recognise these scale effects and their geographically uneven distribution in any policy assessment.
