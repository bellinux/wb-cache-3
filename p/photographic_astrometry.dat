50|$|The first all-sky <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry</b> project, Astrographic Catalogue and Carte du Ciel, {{was started}} in 1887. It was {{conducted}} by 20 observatories all using special photographic telescopes with a uniform design called normal astrographs, all with an aperture of around 13 inches (330 mm) and a focal length of 11 feet (3.4 m), designed to create images with a uniform scale on the photographic plate of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm while covering a 2° × 2° field of view. The attempt was to accurately map the sky down to the 14th magnitude {{but it was never}} completed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the postwar}} period Jakov E. Gordon (1912-1978) was {{appointed}} to the post of director of the observatory (in 1951). In 1955, Repsold Meridian Circle was transported to Nikolaev from Pulkovo after reconstruction and a number of upgrades, on which different observational programs were carried out during 40 years. In 1961, Zonal Astrograph made by the “Carl Zeiss” firm was transferred from Pulkovo to NAO and the history of <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry</b> has begun. Nikolaev photographic observations of Solar system bodies are among some of the most accurate in the World. In 1957-1969 visual and photographic observation satellites were carried out to determine their orbits. In 70 - 80s, the observatory was the initiator and main administrant of several scientific expeditions for observations upon conditions of Polar night and high mountains in the Caucasus on the West Spitsbergen island. In total, nearly 35 different catalogs were created by NAO with the positions of celestial bodies. In 1978 Rima Timofeevna Fedorova (1934 born) became director of the observatory. Gennady Pinigin (current director, 1943 born) took up the position of director in 1986.|$|E

Aspects of <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry</b> are addressed, {{including the}} use and optimization of emulsions as detectors {{and the application of}} side-field and long-focus <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry</b> to the determination of stellar positions, to proper motion surveys, the determination of more accurate parallaxes, the study of binaries, and the examination of the membership and internal motions of star clusters. The advantages and disadvantages of photoelectric astrometry are summarized, and the instruments used in this field is discussed, including scanners, detector arrays, stellar interferometers, space telescopes, and satellites. Promising observational methods for studying binary stars are addressed. Astrometry derived from meridian circle observations is considered, emphasizing the FK 4 system.

40|$|Abstract. Absolute proper {{motions of}} stars {{with respect to}} galaxies {{obtained}} within the KSZ and MEGA programmes {{were used in the}} determination of spin parameters of the Hipparcos catalogue system relative to the inertial reference frame. The Kyiv part of the Bonn-Potsdam-Kyiv project ”Hipparcos extragalactic link by <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry</b> ” is discussed. Solutions using bright stars, faint stars as well as the whole magnitude range of stars were found. ”The faint KSZ stars ” solution (ωx = − 0. 27 ± 0. 80 mas/yr, ωy =+ 0. 15 ± 0. 60 mas/yr, ωz = − 1. 07 ± 0. 80 mas/yr) is considered as the most reliable and is recommended for the correction of the Hipparcos catalogue system. Key words: astrometry – reference systems – stars: kinematics orientation of the Hipparcos system in a certain epoch and its spin correction (VLBI, MERLIN, HST, use of Earth rotation parameters). In this paper we present the results of the application of absolute proper motions of stars with respect to galaxies in selected fields of the sky, obtained within the KSZ and MEGA programmes, to determine a spin correction of the final Hipparcos catalogue system. In spite of the comparably low accuracy of these data, it is possible to link the Hipparcos system with random errors less than ± 1 mas/yr as it has been shown in (Yatsenko et al. 1987). The present investigation represents the Kyiv part of the Bonn-Potsdam-Kyiv project ”Hipparcos extragalactic link by <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry</b> ” (Brosche et al. 1995). 2.

40|$|The {{four major}} (“Galilean”) {{satellites}} of Jupiter form a miniature Solar System, whose “years ” are measured in days. Astronomers have monitored {{the motions of}} these worlds from Galileo’s time to the present to improve their orbital models and to {{study the effects of}} tides on the movements of Io and Europa. (In order outward from Jupiter, the Galileans are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.) The most accurate ways to measure the positions of these moons are by <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry</b> with large tele-scopes and by CCD photometry of the eclipses of these bodies by the shadow of Jupiter. The A. L. P. O. program, however, preserves continuity with almost four centuries of visual timings of these eclipses, investigating the sources of error in making visual timings. The “standard ” to which we have compared our timings is the “E- 2 ” ephemeris developed by Dr. Jay Lieske of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The A. L. P. O. began a program of visually timing Galilean satellite eclipses in 1975, and to date (January 2006) has gathered about ten thousand such timings by observers throughout the world. An eclipse immersion of Io is shown to the right, with the satellites moving counterclockwise as seen from the north. An eclipse begins with the satel-lite’s ingress disappearance and ends with its egres...|$|E
40|$|In {{this pilot}} investigation, precise optical {{positions}} in the FK 5 system are presented {{for a set of}} 16 compact extragalactic radio sources, which {{will be part of the}} future radio [...] optical reference frame. The 0. 9 m KPNO and CTIO telescopes equipped with 2 K CCD's have been used for this project. The astrometric properties of these instruments are investigated in detail. New techniques of using wide field CCD observations for astrometry in general are developed. An internal precision of 5 to 31 mas in position per single exposure is found, depending on the brightness of the object. The tie to the primary optical reference system is established by <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry</b> using dedicated astrographs on both hemispheres. An accuracy of ≈ 30 mas per source is estimated for the multi [...] step reduction procedure when based on the future Hipparcos catalog, while the FK 5 [...] based positions suffer from system errors of 100 to 200 mas as compared to the radio positions. This work provides a contribution to the international effort to link the Hipparcos instrumental coordinate system to the quasi [...] inertial VLBI radio reference frame. Precise radio and optical astrometry of a large sample of compact extragalactic sources will also contribute to the astrophysics of these objects by comparing the respective centers of emission at the optical and radio wavelengths.

40|$|The reflex {{motion of}} a star induced by a {{planetary}} companion {{is too small to}} detect by <b>photographic</b> <b>astrometry.</b> The apparent discovery in the 1960 s of planetary systems around certain nearby stars, in particular Barnard’s star, turned out to be spurious. Conventional stellar radial velocities determined from photographic spectra at that time were also too inaccurate to detect the expected reflex velocity changes. In the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, the introduction of solid-state, signal-generating detectors and absorption cells to impose wavelength fiducials directly on the starlight, reduced radial velocity errors to the point where such a search became feasible. Beginning in 1980, our team from UBC introduced an absorption cell of hydrogen fluoride gas in front of the CFHT coudé spectrograph and, for 12 years, monitored the radial velocities of some 29 solar-type stars. Since it was assumed that extrasolar planets would most likely resemble Jupiter in mass and orbit, we were awarded only three or four two-night observing runs each year. Our survey highlighted three potential planet hosting stars, γ Cep (K 1 IV), β Gem (K 0 III), and ǫ Eri (K 2 V). The putative planets all resembled Jovian systems with periods and masses of: 2. 5 yr and 1. 4 MJ, 1. 6 yr and 2. 6 MJ, and 6. 9 yr and 0. 9 MJ, respectively. All three were subsequently confirmed from more extensive data by the Texas group led by Cochran and Hatzes who also derived the currently accepted orbital elements. None of these three systems is simple. All 5 giant stars and the supergiant in our survey proved to be intrinsic velocity variables. When we first drew attention to a possible planetary companion to γ Cep in 1988 it was classified as a giant, and there was the possibility that its radial velocity variations an...|$|E
