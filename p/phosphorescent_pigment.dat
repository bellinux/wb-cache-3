5000|$|In {{recent work}} Silverthorne {{has added a}} kinetic aspect to some of her rubber sculptures, as well as <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>pigment.</b> Once such piece is Pneuma Machine, 2005, in which rubber {{machines}} move and shake while glowing in the dark. Silverthorne has also worked with video and photography, again referencing the “deteriorating antiquated condition of the studio building,” making it seem “haunted” by “all its once avant-garde, now historical practices.” ...|$|E
50|$|Common {{pigments}} used in lume {{include the}} <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>pigments</b> zinc sulfide and strontium aluminate. Use of zinc sulfide for safety related products {{dates back to}} the 1930s. However, the development of strontium oxide aluminate, with a luminance approximately 10 times greater than zinc sulfide, has relegated most zinc sulfide based products to the novelty category. Strontium oxide aluminate based pigments are now used in exit signs, pathway marking, and other safety related signage.|$|R
5000|$|This type of <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>pigments,</b> {{often called}} lume, operate {{like a light}} battery. After {{sufficient}} activation by sunlight or artificial light, they glow {{in the dark for}} hours. Larger markings are visible for the whole night. This activation and subsequent light emission process can be repeated again and again, and the material does not suffer any practical aging. Strontium aluminate-based pigments have to be protected against contact with water or moisture, since this degrades the light emitting quality.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 Dutch {{designer}} Jonas Samson {{created a}} wall covering system with integrated lighting. The product {{appears to be}} regular wallpaper when the light is off and when illuminated can display light in any pattern or design. The design enables a room to be lit entirely by the walls. Turning the wallpaper on can be performed as a single action or {{can be set up}} in an elaborate sequence to make a space more dynamic and engaging. The designer has used <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>pigments,</b> transparent layers and a light switch to create a patterned wall with a botanical print powered by external light sources.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} phosphorescent or ‘glow in the dark’ {{paint and}} its problems, charac- teristics and treatment possibilities, while using an artwork without title (1968, RMT, En- schede) by IMI Giese as case study. To understand {{the problems that}} can occur with this little examined material, {{it is crucial to}} know how phosphorescence works and what the composition and properties of different <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>pigments</b> are. The conservation challenges for this specific artwork are mostly due to the properties and composition of the paint: the lacunas for instance are a direct effect of the stickiness of the paint layer. The challenging search began for a phosphorescent retouching paint with an identical daylight colour and an afterglow with a similar colour, intensity, and duration as the original Wiedolux paint. Since all readily available <b>phosphorescent</b> paints and <b>pigments</b> did not match the properties of the original paint layer, it was necessary to manipulate self- made phosphorescent paints. The ways of manipulation have been tested through visual and technical analysis. This study provides insight into the results of the test sequences and offers useful information about the way conservators can adjust the properties of a phos- phorescent retouching material to suit their needs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} work was to analyze the {{possibility}} of creating a light-storing photocatalyst material, a system that couples a phosphorescent substrate with a titania coating. The substrate could activate the titanium dioxide coating even in condition of darkness thanks to its light emission. This improvement of absorption can be achieved because the titania semiconductor is irradiated both by the direct light and by the luminescent substrate which is activated at the same time. Methods: TiO 2 -based sol-gel solutions were deposited on commercial borosilicate glasses containing 2 different <b>phosphorescent</b> <b>pigments</b> (emission peaks at 470 and 520 nm, respectively). Particular {{attention was paid to}} optimize the film-substrate adhesion by using a scratch test to evaluate the optimal temperature of the posttreatment step. Results and discussion: The main result is that when irradiated the photoluminescent pigments allow an increase in the photocatalytic acitivity of the coatings. The pigments are able to convert the ultraviolet component of light in order {{to increase the amount of}} energy that can be absorbed by titania. Moreover, the hydrophilicity test showed that in the absence of irradiation the phosphorescent samples are characterized by a lower loss of superhydrophilicity...|$|R
50|$|Since the 1980s, Brigitte Kowanz's {{work has}} focused on the {{investigation}} of space and light. At the beginning of this period, between 1979 and 1984, she produced paper and screen images with <b>phosphorescent</b> and fluorescent <b>pigments</b> in collaboration with Franz Graf. From 1984, Kowanz developed her first light objects from bottles, fluorescent lamps and fluorescent paint. Complex spatial images and light-shadow-projections were created using the simplest of means.However, light is not only a material, but also often a topic of Kowanz's works. For example, she has been engaged with the speed of light in a personal complex of works since 1989. A very small decimal number in neon figures indicates the time that the light needs to cover the length of this sequence of numbers.One complex of issues that Kowanz has also been engaged in since the 1980s is that of language and writing and its translation into codes. Light is investigated as a space-forming medium as well as an information carrier and medium of knowledge and visibility.Since 1995, Kowanz has also regularly used the morse alphabet - based on simple dash-dot combinations - for coding purposes. As a binary code, it represents the origin of the transfer of information using light. Kowanz uses (semi-)transparent glasses and mirrors, especially in her newer works. This leads to a diverse overlaying of the virtual and the real in her three-dimensional objects. The mutual reflection of light, language and mirror (Rainer Fuchs) produces hybrid spaces whose boundaries seem to be clearly defined at one moment, but gone again the next. Real space and virtual reflection penetrate each other, the boundaries between artwork and observer become fluid.The occupation with the intangible physics of light, which - although a guarantee of visibility - is itself slightly overlooked, persists in the works of Brigitte Kowanz to this day.|$|R
