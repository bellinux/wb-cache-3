5|$|Lice were {{ubiquitous}} in human society {{until at least}} the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as The Kilkenny Louse House, and novels such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional <b>parasitosis.</b> A louse {{was one of the}} early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, Micrographia.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional <b>parasitosis,</b> though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
25|$|Serious infestations {{and chronic}} attacks can cause anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Development of {{refractory}} delusional <b>parasitosis</b> is possible, {{as a person}} develops an overwhelming obsession with bed bugs.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine has {{not been}} rigorously {{evaluated}} in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, delusional <b>parasitosis</b> or post-traumatic stress disorder. Olanzapine is no less effective than lithium or valproate, and more effective than placebo in treating bipolar disorder. It has also been used for Tourette syndrome and stuttering.|$|E
25|$|Various {{sources and}} {{publications}} {{have suggested that}} some springtails may parasitize humans, but this is entirely inconsistent with their biology, and no such phenomenon has ever been scientifically confirmed, though {{it has been documented}} that the scales or hairs from collembolans can cause irritation when rubbed onto the skin. They may sometimes be abundant indoors in damp places such as bathrooms and basements, and incidentally found on one's person. More often, claims of persistent human skin infection by springtails may indicate a neurological problem, such as delusory <b>parasitosis,</b> a psychological rather than entomological problem. Researchers themselves may be subject to psychological phenomena. For example, a publication in 2004 claiming that springtails had been found in skin samples was later determined to be a case of pareidolia; that is, no springtail specimens were actually recovered, but the researchers had digitally enhanced photos of sample debris to create images resembling small arthropod heads, which then were claimed to be springtail remnants. However, Steve Hopkin reports one instance of an entomologist aspirating an Isotoma species and in the process accidentally inhaling some of their eggs, which hatched in his nasal cavity and made him quite ill until they were flushed out.|$|E

500|$|In the {{psychiatric}} disorder delusional <b>parasitosis,</b> patients express a persistent irrational fear of {{animals such as}} lice and mites, imagining that they are continually infested and complaining of itching, with [...] "an unshakable false belief that live organisms {{are present in the}} skin".|$|E
2500|$|The {{name was}} coined in 2002 by Mary Leitao, {{a mother who}} {{rejected}} the medical diagnosis of her son's delusional <b>parasitosis.</b> She revived it from a letter written by a physician in the mid-17th century. Leitao and others involved in her Morgellons Research Foundation successfully lobbied members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the condition in 2006. CDC researchers issued {{the results of their}} multi-year study in January 2012, indicating that there were no disease organisms present in people with Morgellons and that the fibers found were likely cotton, and concluded that the condition was [...] "similar to more commonly recognized conditions such as delusional infestation".|$|E
2500|$|Pica is {{characterized}} by an appetite for substances that are largely non-nutritive, such as ice (pagophagia); hair (trichophagia); paper (xylophagia); drywall or paint; metal (metallophagia); stones (lithophagia) or soil (geophagia); glass (hyalophagia); or feces (coprophagia); and chalk. According to DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition) criteria, for these actions to be considered pica, they must persist {{for more than one}} month at an age where eating such objects is considered developmentally inappropriate, not part of culturally sanctioned practice and sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. It can lead to intoxication in children, which can result in an impairment of both physical and mental development. In addition, it can also lead to surgical emergencies due to an intestinal obstruction as well as more subtle symptoms such as nutritional deficiencies and <b>parasitosis.</b> [...] Pica has been linked to other mental and emotional disorders. [...] Stressors such as emotional trauma, maternal deprivation, family issues, parental neglect, pregnancy, and a disorganized family structure are strongly linked to pica as a form of comfort.|$|E
5000|$|Secondary organic {{delusional}} <b>parasitosis</b> {{occurs when}} {{the state of the}} patient is caused by a medical illness or substance (medical or recreational) use. In the DSM-IV this corresponds with [...] "psychotic disorder due to general medical condition". Physical illnesses that can underlie secondary organic delusional <b>parasitosis</b> include: hypothyroidism, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, neurological disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency, and diabetes mellitus. Any illness or medication for which formication is a symptom or side effect can become a trigger or underlying cause of delusional <b>parasitosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Delusional <b>parasitosis</b> is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} {{characterized by a}} fixed, false belief that a skin infestation exists, which {{is in contrast to}} cases of actual <b>parasitosis,</b> such as scabies and infestation with Demodex, in which a skin infestation is present and identifiable by a physician through physical examination or laboratory tests.|$|E
5000|$|Psychiatric disease ("psychogenic itch", {{as may be}} seen in {{delusional}} <b>parasitosis)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Delusional <b>parasitosis</b> {{is divided}} into primary, {{secondary}} functional, and secondary organic groups.|$|E
50|$|Delusional <b>parasitosis,</b> {{also known}} as {{delusional}} infestation or Ekbom's syndrome, is a delusional disorder in which individuals incorrectly believe they are infested with parasites, insects, or bugs, whereas in reality no such infestation is present. Individuals with delusional <b>parasitosis</b> usually report tactile hallucinations known as formication, a sensation resembling insects crawling on or under the skin.|$|E
50|$|Ekbom {{described}} the syndrome of delusional <b>parasitosis.</b> The condition has been termed Ekbom syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|In primary {{delusional}} <b>parasitosis,</b> the delusions {{comprise the}} entire disease entity: {{there is no}} additional deterioration of basic mental functioning or idiosyncratic thought processes. The parasitic delusions consist of a single delusional belief regarding some aspect of health. This is {{also referred to as}} [...] "monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis", and sometimes as [...] "true" [...] delusional <b>parasitosis.</b> In the DSM-IV, this corresponds with [...] "delusional disorder, somatic type".|$|E
50|$|Delusional <b>parasitosis</b> is {{seen more}} {{commonly}} in women, {{and the frequency}} is much higher {{past the age of}} 40.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{functional}} delusional <b>parasitosis</b> {{occurs when}} the delusions {{are associated with a}} psychiatric condition such as schizophrenia or clinical depression.|$|E
50|$|Pimozide {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of delusional disorder and paranoid personality disorder. It has also been used for delusions of <b>parasitosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Itch is also {{associated}} with some symptoms of psychiatric disorders such as tactile hallucinations, delusions of <b>parasitosis,</b> or obsessive-compulsive disorders (as in OCD-related neurotic scratching).|$|E
50|$|Delusory cleptoparasitosis {{is a form}} of {{delusion}} of <b>parasitosis</b> {{where the}} person believes the infestation is in their dwelling, rather than on or in their body.|$|E
50|$|Morgellons {{is poorly}} {{understood}} but {{appears to be}} a form of delusional <b>parasitosis</b> in which people have painful skin conditions that they believe contain fibers of various kinds.|$|E
50|$|Serious infestations {{and chronic}} attacks can cause anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Development of {{refractory}} delusional <b>parasitosis</b> is possible, {{as a person}} develops an overwhelming obsession with bed bugs.|$|E
50|$|However, {{it is also}} {{characteristic}} that sufferers will reject the diagnosis of delusional <b>parasitosis</b> by medical professionals, and very few are willing to be treated, despite demonstrable efficacy of treatment.|$|E
50|$|Morgellons {{is poorly}} {{understood}} {{but the general}} medical consensus {{is that it is}} a form of delusional <b>parasitosis</b> in which individuals have some form of actual skin condition that they believe contains some kind of fibers.|$|E
50|$|A {{parasitic}} disease, {{also known}} as <b>parasitosis,</b> is an infectious disease caused or transmitted by a parasite. Many parasites do not cause diseases. Parasitic diseases can affect practically all living organisms, including plants and mammals. The study of parasitic diseases is called parasitology.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{directed}} toward the underlying cause. However, in primary eosinophilia, or if the eosinophil count must be lowered, corticosteroids such as prednisone may be used. However, immune suppression, the mechanism of action of corticosteroids, can be fatal in patients with <b>parasitosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the {{psychiatric}} disorder delusional <b>parasitosis,</b> patients express a persistent irrational fear of {{animals such as}} lice and mites, imagining that they are continually infested and complaining of itching, with [...] "an unshakable false belief that live organisms {{are present in the}} skin".|$|E
50|$|As noted above, santonin was {{formerly}} {{used as an}} anthelminthic, typically administered with a purgative. Santonin was used in treatment of infestation by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides and in ascarid parasitoses in general (including threadworm <b>parasitosis).</b> It is ineffective in treatment of tapeworm infestation.|$|E
50|$|Olanzapine has {{not been}} rigorously {{evaluated}} in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, delusional <b>parasitosis</b> or post-traumatic stress disorder. Olanzapine is no less effective than lithium or valproate, and more effective than placebo in treating bipolar disorder. It has also been used for Tourette syndrome and stuttering.|$|E
50|$|It {{is useful}} to {{differentiate}} inflammation and infection as there are many pathological situations where inflammation is not driven by microbial invasion - for example, atherosclerosis, type III hypersensitivity, trauma, ischaemia. There are also pathological situations where microbial invasion does not result in classic inflammatory response—for example, <b>parasitosis,</b> eosinophilia.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{associate}} professor of environmental theme of Kala-azar (KA). Dr. Haralmpie Manchev, who first described this <b>parasitosis</b> in children in Macedonia, a disease caused by leishmaniasis, the vector of the parasite from infected animals (dogs, ferrets and other tropical beasts) with gnat known to us as papatachi (ph. Flebotomus paptacei).|$|E
5000|$|A {{point of}} {{confusion}} is that RLS and delusional <b>parasitosis</b> are entirely different conditions that {{have both been}} called [...] "Ekbom syndrome", as both syndromes were described by the same person, Karl-Axel Ekbom. Today, calling WED/RLS [...] "Ekbom syndrome" [...] is outdated usage, as the unambiguous names (WED or RLS) are preferred for clarity.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} of 108 {{patients at the}} Mayo Clinic was published in Archives of Dermatology on May 16, 2011. The study failed to find evidence of skin infestation despite doing skin biopsies and examining specimens provided by the patients. The study, which was conducted between 2001 and 2007, concluded that the feeling of skin infestation was delusional <b>parasitosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lice were {{ubiquitous}} in human society {{until at least}} the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as The Kilkenny Louse House, and novels such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional <b>parasitosis.</b> A louse {{was one of the}} early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, Micrographia.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of {{secondary}} forms of delusional <b>parasitosis</b> are addressed by treating the primary associated psychological or physical condition. The primary form is treated much as other delusional disorders and schizophrenia. In the past, pimozide was the {{drug of choice}} when selecting from the typical antipsychotics. Currently, atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine or risperidone are used as first line treatment.|$|E
