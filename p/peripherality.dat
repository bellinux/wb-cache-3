Legitimate peripheral participation was central to Lave and Wenger's take on situated cognition (referred to as [...] "situated activity") because it introduced socio-cultural and historical realizations of power and access to the way thinking and knowing are legitimated. They stated, [...] "Hegemony over resources for learning and alienation from full participation are inherent in the shaping of the legitimacy and <b>peripherality</b> of participation in its historical realizations" [...] (p. 42). Lave and Wenger's (1991) research on the phenomenon of apprenticeship in communities of practice not only provided a unit of analysis for locating an individual's multiple, changing levels and ways of participation, but also implied that all participants, through increased involvement, have access to, acquire, and use resources available to their particular community.To illustrate the role of LPP in situated activity, Lave and Wenger (1991) examined five apprenticeship scenarios (Yucatec midwives, Vai and Gola tailors, naval quartermasters, meat cutters, and nondrinking alcoholics involved in AA). Their analysis of apprenticeship across five different communities of learners lead them to several conclusions about the situatedness of LPP and its relationship to successful learning.

5000|$|Radical 142 虫, the [...] "insect" [...] or [...] "reptile" [...] radical, is {{used for}} the early Man [...] "southern barbarians" [...] and modern-day Min 閩 people (see Fujian#History). In Minnan they are both {{pronounced}} as /ban²⁴/ (POJ: bân). Xu Shen's Shuowen defines both words as 蛇種 [...] "a type of snake". The American philologist and linguist Victor H. Mair explains the modern significance of these two ancient graphic pejoratives.The debasement of local languages and cultures in China (whether they are Sinitic or non-Sinitic) is so ubiquitous that people become inured to it. They internalize the negative stereotypes associated with <b>peripherality</b> and sheer difference (from the orthodox language and culture of the center). This subtle (but sometimes also brutal) psychological conditioning extends even to the names people call themselves and the totemic myths with which they identify. For instance, the people of Fujian and Taiwan are proud to identify themselves as being from Min, but seldom do they consider that the character adopted to write this name over two millennia ago (it did not yet exist among the oracle bone and bronze inscriptions) includes the infamous chóng ("insect; serpent") radical. There it is staring you right in the face every time you look at the character: a bug inside of a door, but people do not see the insect / snake, perhaps because {{they do not want to}} see it or cannot bear to see it. Here is how Xu Shen explained the character used to write mín around the year 100 CE: [...] "Southeastern Yue Viet; snake race. character is formed from the insect / serpent and takes its pronunciation from mén." [...] 東南越蛇穜从虫門聲 … Southern Min speakers refer to themselves as bân-lâm-lâng, which is usually written with sinographs meaning [...] "Southern Min person" [...] 閩南人, but should actually be written with sinographs meaning [...] "Southern barbarian fellow" [...] 蠻南儂. … The graph pronounced lâm in Taiwanese is the notorious mán ("barbarians the south") as pronounced in MSM. Here is how Xu Shen explains the graph used to write lâm / mán: [...] "Southern barbarians are a snake race. character is formed from the insect / serpent and takes its pronunciation from luàn 南蠻蛇種从虫" [...] … The Mán inhabitants of Mǐn are thus doubly southern, doubly barbarian, and doubly serpentine. Since these explanations have been enshrined in the most authoritative, foundational dictionary of the sinographs, a dictionary which is still invoked with reverence today, there is no denying them. The impact that such designations have had on the consciousness of those who are on both the receiving end and the giving-end is enormous. (2010: n.p.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{configuration}} of rural health services {{is influenced by}} geography. Rural health practitioners provide {{a broader range of}} services to smaller populations scattered over wider areas or more difficult terrain than their urban counterparts. This has implications for training and quality assurance of outcomes. This exploratory study describes the development of a "clinical peripherality" indicator that has potential application to remote and rural general practice communities for planning and research purposes. Methods Profiles of general practice communities in Scotland were created from a variety of public data sources. Four candidate variables were chosen that described demographic and geographic characteristics of each practice: population density, number of patients on the practice list, travel time to nearest specialist led hospital and travel time to Health Board administrative headquarters. A clinical <b>peripherality</b> index, based on these variables, was derived using factor analysis. Relationships between the clinical <b>peripherality</b> index and services offered by the practices and the staff profile of the practices were explored in a series of univariate analyses. Results Factor analysis on the four candidate variables yielded a robust one-factor solution explaining 75 % variance with factor loadings ranging from 0. 83 to 0. 89. Rural and remote areas had higher median values and a greater scatter of clinical <b>peripherality</b> indices among their practices than an urban comparison area. The range of services offered and the profile of staffing of practices was associated with the <b>peripherality</b> index. Conclusion Clinical <b>peripherality</b> is determined {{by the nature of the}} practice and its location relative to secondary care and administrative and educational facilities. It has features of both gravity model-based and travel time/accessibility indicators and has the potential to be applied to training of staff for rural and remote locations and to other aspects of health policy and planning. It may assist planners in conceptualising the effects on general practices of centralising specialist clinical services or administrative and educational facilities. </p...|$|E
40|$|This mainly {{conceptual}} chapter aims to re-consider {{the meaning}} and implications of 'peripherality' {{in the context of}} a contemporary European economy where service activities have become more important and competition is said to have become more knowledge-based. In doing so, it brings together two areas of literature that have been hitherto disconnected, namely research on <b>peripherality</b> and peripheral regions and research on the spatiality of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). The chapter has three main sections. First, {{the meaning and}} prior usage of the term of 'peripherality' - particularly in relation to economic development – is reviewed and a multi-dimensional understanding of the concept is articulated. Second, the meaning and implications of <b>peripherality</b> in the specific context of KIBS is explored and reconsidered. The discussion here explores the tradability of services, recent work on 'temporary geographical proximity' and the potential impact of virtual accessibility (via ICT). This leads to the proposal of a tentative continuum of <b>peripherality</b> in KIBS covering four types of location from 'core' to 'extreme periphery'. Finally, some avenues for future research are outlined. Business travel, temporary geographical proximity and the spatial costs facing service firms in 'non-core' locations are identified as important topics for further study...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the core-periphery pattern of Europe with a special {{interest}} to the economic and spatial <b>peripherality</b> of border regions in South-eastern Europe. In this respect, some statistical calculations and data in NUTS II level are used to examine the regional disparities between the countries and regions. The result is that there are serious regional inequalities that are deepened after enlargement and are supporting the continuity of well-known core-periphery pattern in Europe. The most depressed areas in South-eastern Europe are the border regions to the detriment of poor infrastructure and undeveloped economic activities. The Capitals and metropolitan cities are the certain foci of high value-added economic activities and take the highest share of GDP. On the contrary, employment by the agricultural sector is mostly in the border regions, which means economic <b>peripherality</b> has an impact upon spatial <b>peripherality.</b> In respect to these findings promoting programs to constitute cross-border co-operations in the South-eastern Europe has a key role to develop the relations among these countries and to overcome the inequalities in the region both in economic and spatial terms...|$|E
40|$|Article 2 of the Maastricht Treaty {{states as}} {{the goals of the}} European Union the {{promotion}} of harmonious and balanced economic development, convergence of economic performance, improvement of the quality of life and economic and social coherence between the member states. A prominent role for the achievement of these goals play the envisaged Trans-European Transport Networks (TETN). They are to link landlocked and peripheral areas with the central areas of the Community. The identification of those peripheral regions, whose accessibility and transport infrastructure systems are to be improved, is becoming of great political importance. This is underlined by the European Commission's first Cohesion Report (1997) which emphasises that "regions should ensure that policy success is measurable, that results are regularly monitored, and that the public and political authorities are regularly informed of progress. " This paper presents the results of a study on <b>peripherality</b> undertaken for the European Commission. The purpose was to undertake, for the fifteen EU states and twelve candidate countries, the calculation of an index of <b>peripherality</b> of the 'potential' type. The economic potential of a region is the total of destinations in all regions weighted by a function of distance from the origin region. It is assumed that the potential for economic activity at any location is a function both of its proximity or 'travel tim' to other economic centres and of its economic size or 'mass'. The influence of each economic centre on any other centre is assumed to be proportional to its volume of economic activity and inversely proportional to a function of the distance between them. The economic potential of a given location is found by summing the influence on it of all other centres. Based on theoretical considerations, an integrated European <b>Peripherality</b> Index software system was developed to facilitate <b>peripherality</b> indices calculatio scenarios comparison, data updating and results demonstration. It is designed in a way to evaluate the impacts of transport infrastructure projects as well as impacts of general transport policies with respect to <b>peripherality</b> and could be seen as a first attempt for a wider regional monitoring system. In this, it should contribute to answer the debated question whether infrastructure improvements rather lead to cohesion effects or whether they increase disparities between the regions. The paper starts with theoretical considerations on cohesion effects of transport infrastructure improvements and concepts of accessibility and <b>peripherality.</b> Then the methodology used and the software system developed will be addressed briefly. Eventually the results of the indicator calculations will be presented, before the paper concludes with political implications and findings. ...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally <b>peripherality</b> has {{indicated}} remoteness, isolation and non-development. However, {{during the recent}} decades peripheral areas have lost or reduced their <b>peripherality</b> as technological advances have been introduced. This has created the potential for gradual but vital changes in connections between accessible and more remote areas. Some peripheral areas seem {{to take advantage of}} these new opportunities. However, at the same time some more accessible regions seem to lack behind. Aspatial <b>peripherality</b> is a term devised by AsPIRE project team to collectively describe a range of various processes in changing essence of <b>peripherality.</b> The research project was planned in such way that a multifaceted concept of aspatial <b>peripherality</b> was first researched through five themes: impact of information technology, business networks, governance, social capital and tourism. The themes were explored in two case study regions in each country. First group of regions represented positive aspects of aspatiality, more peripheral but well-performing A regions, second group represented negative aspects of aspatiality, accessible but lacking B regions. Within context of the research project governance was considered as one of the aspatial factors which play a role in finding out the overall developmental performance in case study regions. The assumption in the research project was that quality and also capability of governance will become important and vital as conventional spatial peripheral disadvantage weakens. It is argued in this research report that regional governance has three components: organisational structures, governance processes and policy measures. The causal relationship between the nature and quality of governance is mostly described as implicit within the literature. The link is determined largely according to terms of an observed association and not as a real process. Nevertheless, hypothetically it can be assumed that there are implicit relationships between organisational structures and policy measures. Especially in the case of <b>peripherality</b> the links between regional policy measures and implementation are appealing area under discussion. Besides the differences between A and B regions, the greatest differences seem to have been between member states. Distinct structural evolutions in different countries form relatively rigid structure of administration within which the variation is relatively limited. Nevertheless, considerable variation was found in terms of the policy and implementational milieux of the A and B regions. The capacity of governance seems to be roughly the same in peripheral and in less peripheral case study regions. The peripheral/well-performing A regions have been capable to create effective and transparent integration of politics, public administration and processes. The inadequate structures and processes have driven various actors to organise effective decision-making processes in regional development policy. The A regions have reduced separation between policy tools, and each organisation have clear competencies for recourses at their command. In the accessible/lacking B regions, new governance frameworks tend to be restricted and policy-makers are not capable to strengthen and to be adjusted in new modes of governance. There has been lack of ability to draw measures upon diverse problems, conditions and potentials in implementing measures in regional and local development. The B regions have also faced problems in associating governance processes with development procedures. Spatial planning in the B regions has merely contained technical procedures and indications to infrastructure development. The geographical location and infrastructural issues were still considered as barriers to development in periphery. Especially the favour of transport and infrastructure investments and support for indigenous entrepreneurs was evident in the A regions. Interestingly IT infrastructural investment was not seen as a particularly effective approach. The mode of governance in the peripheral/well-performing A regions demonstrated in comparison to the accessible/lacking B regions a greater capacity and willingness to work collectively. It is realistic to assume therefore that the regional governance of the A regions provides some compensation for the disadvantages of <b>peripherality.</b> New modes of governance are forcing policy makers to find new ways dealing with processes, which are emerging to compound or distort the handicaps conventionally, associated with remote locations. Regional governance may ameliorate <b>peripherality</b> in formulating coalitions within which interactive governance process is able to accept unified strategies...|$|E

40|$|The article {{offers a}} structurationalist {{analysis}} of the embeddedness of Arab entrepreneurs in {{the political economy of}} Israel in two stages. Firstly, we consider entrepreneurs' agency in the context of socio-spatial structural aspects concerning tangible networks that are directly associated with business operation. Secondly, we consider agents' horizons of awareness of opportunities in the market {{in the context of their}} accessibility to support institutions and elites. The analysis focuses on exposing barriers to economic growth and the understanding of their root causes. From the three structural dimensions studied in the first stage - regional scale, ethnicity and <b>peripherality</b> - we found that while agents struggle to embed themselves in the national economy, ethnicity and <b>peripherality</b> create barriers to the expansion of networks beyond home regional networks. While ethnicity seems to be a secondary barrier, <b>peripherality</b> emerges as the more significant mechanism that maintains low development capacity in the Arab sector in Israel. The major mechanisms that maintain Arab entrepreneurs' peripheral status include: selective state policies that privilege Jewish New Towns over neighbouring Arab ones; the abuse of power by Jewish corporations; and a vicious circle of low profitability created by the large number of small competitors. The research demonstrates that even the great effort made by Arab entrepreneurs to embed themselves in business networks on a national scale does not enable them to transform these networks to economic success.

During the 1980 s, the growth in maritime trade was dispersed to benefit most of Ireland's ports, although more recently traffic has polarised strongly on the ports of Cork, Dublin, Rosslare, the Shannon Estuary and Waterford. Four processes have played key roles in changing the comparative advantages of Irish ports and stimulating trade: deflection of trade to Northern Ireland ports; Europeanisation and globalisation; industrial policy and economic restructuring; <b>peripherality</b> and transport policy.

40|$|Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Geschlechter(un) gleichheit und Prozesse der Familienbildung im Kontext der Cleavage-Theorie von Stein Rokkan hinsichtlich der entscheidenden Dichotomie Zentrum/Peripherie. Das Schema ist einfach: hoch modernisierte Gesellschaften gehören zum Zentrum, weniger moderne zur Peripherie. Die Gleichheit der Geschlechter und die Entstehung einer Vielzahl neuer Ehe- und Familienformen sind dabei Indikatoren der Modernisierung. Daraus kann der Schluß abgeleitet werden, je höher die Gleichheit der Geschlechter in einem Land ist und je mehr nicht-traditionelle Familienformen vorliegenden, desto zentraler ist die Position eines Landes. Rokkans Ansatz und diese Hypothese wird anhand empirischer Daten für einige westeuropäische Länder (Zentrum: Deutschland, Frankreich, Großbritannien, Schweiz, Österreich, Niederlande, Belgien, Luxemburg, Italien und Dänemark; Peripherie: Irland, Spanien, Portugal, Griechenland, Norwegen, Schweden und Finnland) geprüft. (pmb) 'The study {{tries to}} apply Rokkan's centre/periphery {{dichotomy}} {{to the analysis}} of gender equality and the family, which, according to Rokkan, belong to the domain of culture.

According to the indicators used in the study, we can conclude that politico-economic centrality and <b>peripherality</b> do not coincide with centrality and <b>peripherality</b> in the domains of gender equality and the family, the differences in this respect stemming rather from each country's cultural heritage.

I argue that i) the primary stress rules are category sensitive – {{there are two}} distinct rules in BP: one for non-verb forms which applies at the derivational level (level) {{and the other for}} verb forms which applies at the inflectional level (level); ii) the primary stress rules are quantity-insensitive; iii) the extrametricality is determined by morphology and is subject to <b>Peripherality</b> Condition. </p...|$|E
30|$|First, we have rejuvenated the centre–periphery spatial {{framework}} of uneven development and structural inequality {{to shed light}} on the migration decisions and movement patterns of young graduates from three countries located in the centre (Germany) and in the north-eastern (Latvia) and southern (Italy) peripheries of Europe. Each of the three migrations examined represents a different geo-economic and cultural positioning. The consciousness of being from a peripheral and under-privileged part of Europe was recurrent in the narratives of participants from Latvia and from the southern part of Italy, but almost entirely absent from the Germans’ accounts. In Italy and Latvia these ‘push factors’ for graduate emigration were also discussed {{in the context of a}} developing ‘brain drain’ – another syndrome of <b>peripherality</b> and subjugation to the pull factors of the ‘core’. For the Germans, there were only coded references to cores and peripheries, expressed more in cultural and lifestyle terms: the ‘boring’ life in small-town Germany contrasted with the vibrant social and cultural life in a global city. A similar case of cultural <b>peripherality</b> was found in Southern Italy where, in the eyes of many interviewees, the still-powerful mechanisms of clientelism and ‘recommendations’ were symptomatic of backwardness.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a sound interpretative and policy {{framework}} for ‘Inner Peripheries’ at the EU level. Its ambition is to bridge conceptual approaches to <b>peripherality</b> with the policy objectives set by key documents such as the Territorial Agenda 2020 and other recent reports on economic, social and territorial cohesion. An integrated multi-scalar approach, grounded on the notion of spatial disparity, is therefore connected with a ‘place-based’ approach to policy design. The breakthrough experience of the Italian programme on Inner Areas is an opportunity to broaden the reflection on inner peripheries and policies that are most apt to reconnect them. A more comprehensive analytical framework is proposed here, which looks at the foundational economy, spatial justice and territorial cohesion. The framework deals with both the ‘condition’ of <b>peripherality</b> and the ‘process’ by which endogenous and exogenous drivers determine the marginalisation of specific territories. Such tenets are fleshed out in the development of an original approach bridging theory and practice, analysis and policy, crucially assuming multi-scale governance design as the enabling framework for greater coherence between top-down and community-led initiatives. </p...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the export}} {{dependent}} nature {{of most of}} British Columbia’s essentially publicly-owned resource-based economy, many of its rural communities suffer from <b>peripherality</b> and exposure to world commodity market fluctuations, exhibiting the classic symptoms of unsustainable resource exploitation. Over the past decade, a radical provincial administration has attempted to address these difficulties, promoting a programme entailing greater efforts to develop a community-based consensual approach to the planning {{and management of the}} provincial resource base, and a move away from reliance [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a theoretical}} {{treatment of the}} history of Latin American music in the twentieth century. It 2 ̆ 7 s central claim is twofold. First, the progressive development of a Latin American music was made possible and meaningful by the region 2 ̆ 7 s economic, political and cultural <b>peripherality</b> vis-Ã -vis the (neo-) colonial metropole: Western Europe and the United States. That <b>peripherality</b> was manifest as an attempt to find in Latin American particularity the grounds for universal significance. Reading this attempt in Kantian terms of conceptual determination, it appears as an aesthetics. Given the failure of imported concepts to adequately schematize the stuff of Latin American experience, that which was native to the region could only be determined reflectively in light of sense-data alone. Throughout the last century, musical compositions, genres, and practices sought to complete that process of determination, or else transcend it altogether. The second part of my claim is that those musical responses to the aesthetic problem of Latin American <b>peripherality</b> were ultimately consumed by the very duality of universality and particularity they sought to overcome. They share an aporetic structure proper to the eruption of geographical difference onto the historical plane. The dissertation revolves around three case studies. The first focuses on the composer Carlos Chavez, making perspicuous the stakes of his stylistic development in light of the peasant revolution of 1910. The second traces the intellectual history of the musical gauchesca, understanding this genre as turning on the contradictions of Argentine modernity in its identification with song and Nature as such. Finally, the last case study takes up Chilean Nueva CanciÃ³n as it appeared in the years before the 1973 military coup. It represented a musical movement that sought out a place for aesthetics {{in the context of a}} socialist revolution. These three cases form a counterpoint to a philosophical discourse on the history of Latin America - one that demonstrates the shape and import of an idealist musicology...|$|E
