5|$|The {{roof of the}} south, {{east and}} west stands built for the {{athletics}} stadium configuration {{was supported by the}} cable net system. The temporary open stand at the north end was built around the masts and tie down cables that would ultimately support the roof of the North Stand. After the games the track and field were excavated. The temporary bleachers at the north end were removed and the North Stand and lower tier of seats constructed on the prepared excavation. The North Stand roof was completed by adding rafters, <b>purlins</b> and cladding.|$|E
5|$|This {{structure}} {{was built in}} the mid-15th century. At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would have sat at a long table, facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined. The roof has arch-braced-collar trusses, with double <b>purlins,</b> and cusped curved windbraces. Typical of West Country design, these carved windbraces are both decorative and practical. Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils, and at the base of each main rafter is a carved wooden angel with a shield with the Lyte arms. The fireplace is 15th century, while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century. The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage, which would have divided the Hall from the kitchen and servants quarters' which would have lain {{to the left of the}} hall. The screen and gallery are not original, having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907. He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room. At the time of Jenner's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Purlin</b> {{connections}} {{have important}} {{influence on the}} stiffness, bearing capacity and the <b>purlin</b> calculation methods. A new kind of <b>purlin</b> connection was put forward in this paper. The mechanical behavior of the new connection was studied by finite element analysis using software ANSYS. As {{can be seen from}} the simulation results, the new connection can enhance the stiffness of <b>purlin,</b> and effect of each new wave connection is better than the promotion of <b>purlin</b> stiffness in the vibration wave connection.

50|$|In architecture, {{structural}} engineering or building, a <b>purlin</b> (or historically purline, purloyne, purling, perling) is any longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a roof except {{a type of}} framing with {{what is called a}} crown plate. In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: <b>purlin</b> plate, principal <b>purlin</b> and common <b>purlin.</b>|$|R

25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated <b>purlins,</b> which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E
25|$|No {{country in}} Europe {{possesses}} roofs to equal those of England {{created in the}} 15th century. The great roof of Westminster Hall remains {{to the present day}} unique. In Norfolk and Suffolk roofs abound of the hammerbeam class; that at Woolpit, Suffolk, achieves the first rank of quality. Each bracket is carved with strongly designed foliage, the end of every beam terminates in an angel carrying a shield, and the <b>purlins</b> are crested, while each truss is supported by a canopied riche (containing a figure) resting on an angel corbel. Here, too, as at Ipswich and many other churches, there is a row of angels with outspread wings under the wall-plate. This idea of angels in the roof is a very beautiful one, and the effect is much enhanced by the coloring. The roof at St Nicholas, King's Lynn, is a magnificent example of tiebeam construction. The trusses are filled in with tracery at the sides and the centres more or less open, and the beams, which are crested and embattled, contain a row of angels on either side. In Devon, Cullompton possesses a very fine semicircular ceiling supported at intervals by ribs pierced with carving. Each compartment is divided up into small square panels, crossed by diagonal ribs of cresting, while every joint is ornamented with a boss carved in the decorative way peculiar to the Gothic craftsman. The nave roof of Manchester cathedral is nearly flat, and is also divided up into small compartments and bossed; the beams are supported by carved brackets resting on corbels with angels at each base.|$|E
500|$|Cables are {{attached}} to the twelve masts circling the stadium with rafters and <b>purlins</b> for additional rigid support. The cigar-shaped masts double as visual features, with the highest at [...] Access to the upper tiers of seats is provided by eight circular ramps with conical roofs resembling turrets above which eight of the twelve masts rise up providing the support structure for the roof.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>purlin</b> {{plate in}} wooden {{construction}} is also called an [...] "arcade plate" [...] in European English, [...] "under purlin", and [...] "principal purlin". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. <b>Purlin</b> plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and {{are supported by}} posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. <b>Purlin</b> plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A crown plate has similarities to a <b>purlin</b> plate but supports collar beams {{in the middle of}} a timber framed building.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{structural}} {{behavior of}} a cold-formed steel purlin-sheeting system is surprisingly complex. To adequately model the response using computational methods, the numerical analysis must consider material and geometrical nonlinearity, and in addition the influence of contact between the <b>purlin,</b> sheeting, and connection should also be considered. Models proposed in the literature were analyzed and compared with a finite element model that was developed considering the essential nonlinearities including contact. The developed finite element model was successfully validated against experimental results conducted in Brazil using a standard vacuum rig. With {{the success of the}} model a parametric study was conducted to better understand the impact of the <b>purlin,</b> sheeting, and connection variables on the <b>purlin</b> demands in wind uplift. Empirical design expressions were generated using the parametric study to provide engineers a more convenient means to predict the bending demands on the <b>purlin</b> {{as a function of the}} displacement due to wind uplift...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the medieval}} origins are now {{obscured}} behind a modern façade, substantial {{parts of the}} timber-framed original open hall-house layout remain inside. [...] The oldest {{part of the building}} is the north–south range, parallel to the High Street. [...] This has a gigantic tie-beam holding up a king post ceiling. [...] The king post's structure includes <b>purlins,</b> chamfers and decorative mouldings. [...] This façade has three modern gable ends and a tiled upper storey. [...] Around the corner, facing Broadwalk, there is a twin-gabled modern façade, again with a tile-hung first floor and a stucco-faced ground floor. [...] This part is a modern extension. [...] At the northern end, there is another original wing running west to east: it has substantial timberwork with chamfering, visible from one of the bars.|$|E

60|$|I {{sometimes}} {{dream of}} a larger and more populous house, standing in a golden age, of enduring materials, and without gingerbread work, which shall still consist of only one room, a vast, rude, substantial, primitive hall, without ceiling or plastering, with bare rafters and <b>purlins</b> supporting a sort of lower heaven over one's head--useful to keep off rain and snow, where {{the king and queen}} posts stand out to receive your homage, when you have done reverence to the prostrate Saturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the sill; a cavernous house, wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see the roof; where some may live in the fireplace, some in the recess of a window, and some on settles, some {{at one end of the}} hall, some at another, and some aloft on rafters with the spiders, if they choose; a house which you have got into when you have opened the outside door, and the ceremony is over; where the weary traveller may wash, and eat, and converse, and sleep, without further journey; such a shelter as you would be glad to reach in a tempestuous night, containing all the essentials of a house, and nothing for house-keeping; where you can see all the treasures of the house at one view, and everything hangs upon its peg, that a man should use; at once kitchen, pantry, parlor, chamber, storehouse, and garret; where you can see so necessary a thing, as a barrel or a ladder, so convenient a thing as a cupboard, and hear the pot boil, and pay your respects to the fire that cooks your dinner, and the oven that bakes your bread, and the necessary furniture and utensils are the chief ornaments; where the washing is not put out, nor the fire, nor the mistress, and perhaps you are sometimes requested to move from off the trap-door, when the cook would descend into the cellar, and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you without stamping. A house whose inside is as open and manifest as a bird's nest, and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the back without seeing some of its inhabitants; where to be a guest is to be presented with the freedom of the house, and not to be carefully excluded from seven eighths of it, shut up in a particular cell, and told to make yourself at home there--in solitary confinement. Nowadays the host does not admit you to his hearth, but has got the mason to build one for yourself somewhere in his alley, and hospitality is the art of keeping you at the greatest distance. There is as much secrecy about the cooking as if he had a design to poison you. I am aware that I have been on many a man's premises, and might have been legally ordered off, but I am not aware that I have been in many men's houses. I might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who lived simply in such a house as I have described, if I were going their way; but backing out of a modern palace will be all that I shall desire to learn, if ever I am caught in one.|$|E

50|$|The initial {{opening up}} of the roof was {{achieved}} by inserting a robust valley rafter into the south slope; this abuts one of the retained original common rafters and is jointed in place.

The wind-brace may have been removed to facilitate the addition of the new valley rafter, while the <b>purlin</b> was removed to create the required through-access. The work was carried out to a high-degree, with care taken to mark out the assembly and to execute it with care rather than rely on bolts, straps or even nails.
