She was {{very concerned about the}} health and comfort of her pets, taking them on visits to friends, along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped. She frequently sacked vets – telling one [...] "I do not <b>pay</b> <b>you</b> to tell me that {{there is nothing wrong with}} my animal" [...] – and trying animal faith healers at times. [...] Additionally, she was a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book Extraordinary Cats, published in 1967.|$|E

There's to be no compensation payment and that's final." [...] Banks then refused the move until Stoke boss Tony Waddington seemingly negotiated a £2,000 payment out of Leicester. It was only some years later that Banks was informed that Stoke had actually made the payment, not Leicester. Waddington valued good goalkeepers highly, and the two built up a close relationship. During this time, Banks moved to Madeley, Staffordshire. He replaced John Farmer as the club's number one, and kept goal {{in the last four}} games of the 1966–67 season, making his home debut at the Victoria Ground in a 3–1 win over his former club Leicester.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image {{to take away from}} the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I did think with art films that they don't <b>pay</b> <b>you,</b> they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm so happy to be here." ...|$|E

Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to them or not, which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. [...] "It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in now, if you can go make this person well to go create some income...'" [...] Landy expressed similar views. [...] "Saying that [...] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll <b>pay</b> <b>you</b> a million dollars {{if you can get}} up and fly around the room.'" [...] This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions. Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided.|$|E

It was immediately sent inland to the operational area around Mount Kilimanjaro, within sight of which it set up camp. On 20 March, the regiment was inspected by General JM Stewart of the Indian Army.

500|$|In January 1991, {{following}} her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided {{to name the}} trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as [...] "nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound", and also {{to allow her to}} continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's [...] "disastrous" [...] debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: [...] "we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realize nobody likes you!

Probst claimed his retirement was properly handled because he had suffered on-duty injuries in a crash with a drunk driver. But he said Rizzo bundled severance, vacation and sick pay owed to him into the workers' compensation settlement - a practice that authorities said would be in violation of the tax codes.|$|E

[...] Daniell's son, quoted in the same book, said that the Somerset professional players had advised against taking Gimblett on to the county staff: [...] "They used to tell my father they thought Harold was far too impulsive."

2500|$|The {{hamburger}} {{was very}} popular among Americans during {{the postwar period}} following World War I, even in popular culture. An example of this was the prominent appearance of hamburgers in E. C. Segar's Thimble Theatre comic strip, which prominently featured a cartoon character named Popeye the Sailor who ate spinach to sustain his superhuman strength. Popeye's first appearance was as a supporting character on January 17, 1929 alongside many other characters. One of these characters was J. Wellington Wimpy (often shortened to just [...] "Wimpy"), a lover of hamburgers who was both polite and gluttonous. His signature phrase, [...] "I'll gladly <b>pay</b> <b>you</b> tomorrow for a hamburger today", became popular and widely known. During {{the height of his}} popularity in the 1930s, Wimpy introduced the hamburger to the youth of the time as a healthy food. It also resulted {{in the creation of a}} chain of fast food restaurants called Wimpy's in his honor, which sold hamburgers for ten cents. In a similar fashion, the fictional character Jughead Jones, who first appeared in Archie Comics in 1941, was passionate about food generally, and hamburgers specifically.|$|E

The latter had asked McNeally to delay his resignation until Eisenhower could appoint a replacement. Despite Stevens's short tenure as an Alaska resident and his relative lack of trial or criminal law experience, Pratt asked Stevens to serve in the position until Eisenhower acted. Stevens agreed. [...] "I said, 'Sure, I'd like to do that,' [...] " [...] Stevens recalled years later. [...] "Clasby said, 'It's not going to <b>pay</b> <b>you</b> as much money, but, {{if you want to do}} it, that's your business.' He was very pissed that I decided to go." [...] Most members of the Fairbanks Bar Association were outraged at the appointment of a newcomer, and members in attendance at the association's meeting that December voted to support Carl Messenger for the permanent appointment, an endorsement seconded by the Alaska Republican Party Committee for the Fairbanks-area judicial division. However, Stevens was favored by Attorney General Herbert Brownell, by Senator William F. Knowland of California, and by the Republican National Committee, (Alaska itself had no Senators at this time, as it was still a territory). [...] Eisenhower sent Stevens's nomination to the U.S. Senate, which confirmed him on March 30, 1954.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money I will <b>pay</b> <b>you</b> by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where he could see a different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish my picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E
