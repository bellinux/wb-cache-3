5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting <b>protective</b> <b>effects,</b> risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora. However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.|$|E
40|$|The <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> of BCG against {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{estimated in}} randomized controlled trials and observational studies ranges from negative to dose to a 100 %. One {{of the many}} explanations offered {{for this is that}} different im-munological mechanisms may be associated with <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> against different forms and sites of disease. In this investigation, we recalculated vaccine <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> separately for pulmonary disease and for meningeal/miliary disease in randomized controlled trials and case-control studies, tested for heterogeneity in site-specific estimates of <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> and calculated a summary measure when appropriate. We found <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> against pulmonary disease to be heterogenous to a statistically significant degree, and thus we did not calculate a summary measure of protection. <b>Protective</b> <b>effect</b> against meningeal and miliary TB was higher than against pulmonary disease and, except for a single study with two cases only, appeared to be homogeneous. Summary BCG <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> against miliary or meningeal TB in randomized controlled trials was 86 % (95 % confidence interval [CD 65, 95) and in case-control studies 75 % (95 % Cl: 61, 84). The fact that <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> appeared to be homogeneous against meningitis and miliary TB but not against pulmonary disease may result from the fact that patients with meningitis are on average younger and thus less likely to have been exposed to atypical bacteria; to a waning of the <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> of BCG; or from the diversity of mechanisms of pathogenesis of pulmonary disease, which can originate from reinfection, reactiva-tion or primary progression...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} {{resilience}} has a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> in difficult work environments. METHODS: A survey of 2063 individuals measured individual resilience, stress, burnout, sleep problems, likelihood of depression, job satisfaction, intent to quit, absences, and productivity. It also measured work characteristics: job demands, job influence, and social support. Multivariate and logistic regression models examined {{the main effects}} and interactions of resilience and job characteristics. RESULTS: High strain work environments (high demand, low influence, and low support) have an unfavorable effect on all outcomes. Resilience has a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> on all outcomes. For stress, burnout, and sleep, higher resilience has a more <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> under low-strain conditions.

40|$|Asthma {{is one of}} {{the major}} common {{diseases}} seen in children of all ages. Past research has noted that breastfeeding has a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> against the development of asthma, although the results remain conflicted. The purpose of this research paper was to conduct an extensive literature review to determine if sufficient evidence exists to identify a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> of breastfeeding on the incidence of asthma in children. Fourteen studies were reviewed to determine if current research literature solidifies a relationship between breastfeeding and asthma and/or wheeze. Nine of the 14 studies (64 %) showed a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> of breastfeeding on asthma, 1 (11 %) found that breastfeeding increased the risk for developing asthma in the absence of family history, and 3 (20 %) noted both <b>protective</b> and non-protective <b>effects,</b> and one found no effect. Six (43 %) demonstrated that the <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> was influenced positively (n= 3) or negatively (n= 3) when a family history of asthma was present. Overall, more studies demonstrated a <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> of breastfeeding, with the impact varying by family history.

25|$|Folate {{deficiency}} can disrupt neuralation and neurogenesis. Maternal {{folic acid}} intake {{around the time}} of conception prevents neural tube defects. Furthermore, folic acid intake was recently associated with incidence of autism. Enriched white flour is fortified with folic acid in the United States and many other countries. However the European Union does not have mandatory folic acid fortification. Although the <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> of folic acid are well documented, there remains legitimate concern that fortification could lead to toxic levels in a subset of the population. For example, elevated levels of folic acid can interact with vitamin B12 deficiency to cause neurodegeration. Furthermore, folic acid and iron can interact to exacerbate malaria.|$|E
25|$|However, during {{onset of}} osteoarthritis, the {{collagen}} matrix becomes more disorganized {{and there is}} a decrease in proteoglycan content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Without the <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> of the proteoglycans, the collagen fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. Inflammation of the synovium (joint cavity lining) and the surrounding joint capsule can also occur, though often mild (compared to the synovial inflammation that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis). This can happen as breakdown products from the cartilage are released into the synovial space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them.|$|E

500|$|Evidence {{supports}} that male circumcision {{reduces the risk}} of HIV infection among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the WHO recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program in areas with high rates of HIV such as sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence for a health benefit against HIV for {{men who have sex with}} men is less clear. Likewise, the effectiveness of using circumcision to prevent HIV in the developed world is also unclear. Circumcision is associated with reduced rates of cancer causing forms of human papillomavirus (HPV), UTIs, and cancer of the penis. Prevention of those conditions is not a justification for routine circumcision of infants. Studies of its potential <b>protective</b> <b>effects</b> against other sexually transmitted infections have been unclear. A 2010 review found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a typical complication rate of 1.5% for babies and 6% for older children, with few cases of severe complications. Bleeding, infection, and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common complications cited.

40|$|The <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> of cations, {{especially}} Ca and Mg, against aluminum (Al) rhizotoxicity {{has been}} extensively investigated in the last decades. The mechanisms by which the process occurs are however only beginning to be elucidated. Six experiments were carried out here to characterize the <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> of Mg application in relation to timing, location and crop specificity: Experiment 1 - <b>Protective</b> <b>effect</b> of Mg compared to Ca; Experiment 2 - <b>Protective</b> <b>effect</b> of Mg on distinct root classes of 15 soybean genotypes; Experiment 3 - Effect of timing of Mg supply on the response of soybean cvs. to Al; Experiment 4 - Investigating whether the Mg <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> is apoplastic or simplastic using a split-root system; Experiment 5 - <b>Protective</b> <b>effect</b> of Mg supplied in solution or foliar spraying, and Experiment 6 - <b>Protective</b> <b>effect</b> of Mg on Al rhizotoxicity in other crops. It {{was found that the}} addition of 50 mmol L- 1 Mg to solutions containing toxic Al increased Al tolerance in 15 soybean cultivars. This caused soybean cultivars known as Al-sensitive to behave as if they were tolerant. The protective action of Mg seems to require constant Mg supply in the external medium. Supplying Mg up to 6 h after root exposition to Al was sufficient to maintain normal soybean root growth, but root growth was not recovered by Mg addition 12 h after Al treatments. Mg application to half of the root system not exposed to Al was not sufficient to prevent Al toxicity on the other half exposed to Al without Mg in rooting medium, indicating the existence of an external protection mechanism of Mg. Foliar spraying with Mg also failed to decrease Al toxicity, indicating a possible apoplastic role of Mg. The <b>protective</b> <b>effect</b> of Mg appeared to be soybean-specific since Mg supply did not substantially improve root elongation in sorghum, wheat, corn, cotton, rice, or snap bean when grown in the presence of toxic Al concentrations...|$|R
