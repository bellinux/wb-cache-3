40|$|Bacterium {{is still}} {{a major cause of}} many {{infectious}} diseases and a global threat to human health, aquaculture, and animal feeding. Prevention by vaccination is the most efficient and economical way of fighting bacterial diseases, but one of the persistent challenges to prevent bacterial infections and disease transmissions is the existence of multiple bacterial species, families, and genera and the lack of efficient polyvalent vaccines against them. The information on candidate immunogens for <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> development is elusive, as well. For the development of broad cross-protective vaccines, we have employed heterogeneous antiserum-based immunoproteomics approaches to identify antigenically similar outer membrane (OM) proteins that could be used as potential <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. fluvialis, Aeromonas hydrophila, and A. sobria infections. VPA 1435, VP 0764, VPA 1186, VP 1061, and VP 2850 could be recognized by at least three antisera and demonstrated significantly passive and active immune protection against V. parahaemolyticus infection in a crucian carp model. VP 1061 and VP 2850 induced higher immune and protective abilities than the other three OM proteins. Furthermore, the abilities of VP 1061 and VP 2850 in the generation of broad cross-protective immune reaction against the infections of V. alginolyticus, A. hydrophila, and Pseudomonas fluorescens were also investigated in fish and mouse models. Our results suggested that VP 1061 and VP 2850 could potentially be used as <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates for the development of novel polyvalent vaccines against V. parahaemolyticus and other Gram-negative pathogens.

40|$|MUC 1 is a membrane-tethered mucin {{expressed}} on the ductal cell {{surface of}} glandular epithelial cells. Loss of polarization, overexpression and aberrant glycosylation of MUC 1 in mucosal inflammation and in adenocarcinomas induces humoral immune {{responses to the}} mucin. MUC 1 IgG responses {{have been associated with}} a benefit in survival in patients with breast, lung, pancreatic, ovarian and gastric carcinomas. Antibodies bound to the mucin may curb tumor progression by restoring cell-cell interactions altered by tumor-associated MUC 1, thus preventing metastatic dissemination, as well as counteracting the immune suppression exerted by the molecule. Furthermore, anti-MUC 1 antibodies are capable of effecting tumor cell killing by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Although cytotoxic T cells are indispensable to achieve anti-tumor responses in advanced disease, abs to tumor-associated antigens are ideally suited to address minimal residual disease and may be sufficient to exert adequate immune surveillance in an adjuvant setting, destroying tumor cells as they arise or maintaining occult disease in an equilibrium state. Initial evaluation of MUC 1 peptide/glycopeptide mono and <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccines</b> has shown them to be immunogenic and safe; anti-tumor responses are scarce. Progress in carbohydrate synthesis has yielded a number of sophisticated substrates that include MUC 1 glycopeptide epitopes that are at present in preclinical testing.

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the major}} {{obstacles}} {{in the design of}} an effective vaccine against HIV- 1 is the hypervariability of the HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein. Most HIV- 1 vaccine candidates have utilized envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate, but to date, none of them elicited broadly reactive humoral immunity. Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV- 1 gp 120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV- 1. We compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of HIV- 1 vaccines containing either gp 120 protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp 120 s from different primary HIV- 1 isolates in immunized hamsters. Results We amplified and characterized 14 different gp 120 s from primary subtype B isolates with both syncytium and non-syncytium inducing properties, and expressed the proteins in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. Purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp 120 s to vaccinate golden hamsters. The <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> showed higher antibody titers to HIV- 1 subtype B isolates MN and SF 162 compared to the groups that received one or four gp 120 proteins. However, the <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against HIV- 1 primary isolates. Interestingly, the <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype CD 4 reactivity to HIV- 1 subtypes B, C, and A/E Conclusion Although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp 120) resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity. </p...|$|E
40|$|The great {{difficulty}} in eliciting broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) isolates {{has been attributed to}} several intrinsic properties of their viral envelope glycoprotein, including its complex quaternary structure, extensive glycosylation, and marked genetic variability. Most previously evaluated vaccine candidates have utilized envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate. Here we compare the breadth of NAb and protective immune response following vaccination of pigtailed macaques with envelope protein(s) derived from either single or multiple viral isolates. Animals were challenged with Simian/human immunodeficiency virus strain DH 12 (SHIVDH 12) following priming with recombinant vaccinia virus(es) expressing gp 160 (s) and boosting with gp 120 protein(s) from (i) LAI, RF, 89. 6, AD 8, and Bal (Polyvalent); (ii) LAI, RF, 89. 6, AD 8, Bal, and DH 12 (Polyvalent-DH 12); (iii) 89. 6 (Monovalent- 89. 6); and (iv) DH 12 (Monovalent-DH 12). Animals in the two <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> groups developed NAbs against more HIV- 1 isolates than those in the two monovalent vaccine groups (P = 0. 0054). However, the increased breadth of response was directed almost entirely against the vaccine strains. Resistance to SHIVDH 12 strongly correlated with the level of NAbs directed against the virus on the day of challenge (P = 0. 0008). Accordingly, the animals in the Monovalent-DH 12 and Polyvalent-DH 12 vaccine groups were more resistant to the SHIVDH 12 challenge than the macaques immunized with preparations lacking a DH 12 component (viz. Polyvalent and Monovalent- 89. 6) (P = 0. 039). Despite the absence of any detectable NAb, animals in the <b>Polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> group, but not those immunized with Monovalent- 89. 6, exhibited markedly lower levels of plasma virus than those in the control group, suggesting a superior cell-mediated immune response induced by the <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractPancreas disease (PD) in salmonid fish {{is caused}} by an {{infection}} with Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) and remains {{as one of the}} major health problems in the European fish farming industry. Sequence studies have revealed a genetic diversity among viral strains. A subtype of SAV (SAV 3) is causing an epizootic in farmed salmonids in Norway. Here we evaluate efficacy and safety of an inactivated virus vaccine based on ALV 405, a strain of SAV 3 that was isolated from Norwegian salmon. The vaccine provided an average relative percent survival (RPS) of 98. 5 in an intraperitoneal challenge model, and induced nearly total protection against PD in a cohabitant challenge model. It provided significant protection against SAV-induced mortality also in a field trial under industrial conditions. Local reactions seen as melanization and adhesions in the visceral cavity were less severe than those induced by two commercial vaccines. Finally, we demonstrated that the protection is not impaired when the ALV 405 antigen is combined with other viral or bacterial antigens in a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The results confirm that efficient and safe protection against SAV infection and development of PD is possible using an inactivated virus vaccine, both alone and as a component in a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine...</b>|$|E

We also evaluated the serum antibody response to nonvaccine strains of P. aeruginosa, including strains expressing structural variants (subtype strains) of the O side chain of the vaccine strains. The <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine,</b> prepared under conditions suitable for human use, contained low levels of contaminants and passed preclinical safety and toxicity tests required for human use. Chemical analyses indicated that individual polysaccharides were composed of both O-side chain and core sugars. Following immunization of C 3 H/HeN mice and New Zealand White rabbits, antibody titers against vaccine components increased between 32 - and 200 -fold. Antibodies reactive with LPS isolated from smooth and rough nonvaccine strains were also elicited. Analysis of the opsonic activity against the known LPS subtype variants of the vaccine strains revealed a variable pattern of killing, which ranged from opsonic killing of > or = 69 % of bacterial cells representing all subtype variants within a serogroup to opsonization of only a minority of the subtype variant strains. Mouse and rabbit immune sera showed different patterns of opsonic activity against subtype strains, indicating that different epitopes on these antigens are immunodominant in the representatives of these two animal species tested.

40|$|In {{order to}} protect against organisms that exhibit {{significant}} genetic variation, polyvalent vaccines are needed. Given the extreme variability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), {{it is probable that}} a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> will also be needed for protection from this virus. However, to understand how to construct a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccine,</b> serotypes or immunotypes of HIV must be identified. In the present study, we have examined the immunologic relatedness of intact, native HIV- 1 primary isolates of group M, clades A to H, with human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed at epitopes in the V 3, C 5, and gp 41 cluster I regions of the envelope glycoproteins, since these regions are well exposed on the virion surface. Multivariate analysis of the binding data revealed three immunotypes of HIV- 1 and five MAb groups useful for immunotyping of the viruses. The analysis revealed that there are fewer immunotypes than genotypes of HIV and that clustering of the isolates did not correlate with either genotypes, coreceptor usage (CCR 5 and CXCR 4), or geographic origin of the isolates. Further analysis revealed distinct MAb groups that bound preferentially to HIV- 1 isolates belonging to particular immunotypes or that bound to all three immunotypes; this demonstrates that viral immunotypes identified by mathematical analysis are indeed defined by their immunologic characteristics. In summary, these results indicate (i) that HIV- 1 immunotypes can be defined, (ii) that constellations of epitopes that are conserved among isolates belonging to each individual HIV- 1 immunotype exist and that these distinguish each of the immunotypes, and (iii) that there are also epitopes that are routinely shared by all immunotypes...|$|E

The production of anti-Aeromonas salmonicida Abs was significantly greater in the combined vaccine group at 296 degree days post-vaccine injection (dd pvi), while the production of anti-Listonella anguillarum Abs was significantly greater at 106 dd pvi in the combined vaccine group. Of even greater interest was the apparent delay in production of IHNV-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAb) when the DV was injected concurrently with the polyvalent AV.

Methods: CSF samples were analyzed with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This allowed for meningitis etiologies dynamics studies in the pilot Districts. Results: Because of geographical difficulties and lack of means, less than 40 % of suspected cases had their CSF analyzed at PCR reference laboratory. In 2009, among confirmed cases at reference laboratory, Sp (Streptococcus pneumonia), NmA (Neisseria meningitis A) and Hib (Hemophilus influenzae b) were responsible respectively for 90 %, 6. 6 % and 4. 4 % of cases. In 2010, serogroup distribution among confirmed cases was: Sp 62. 7 %, NmX 32. 2 % and NmA 5. 1 %. Sp which was continuously present in Burkina Faso takes more significant proportions, just as serogroup X which until there was sporadically encountered. The attack rates of NmX were tree to twelve times higher than for NmA in the two Districts where NmX has been notified. Conclusion: As a consequence of such results, efforts must be maintained in epidemiologic surveillance field and in reinforcement of laboratory capacities. Fast care should be guaranteed to patients with adequate antibiotics according to country national guideline and chemoprophylaxis measures should be undertaken among contacts of patients to prevent secondary cases.

Prophylactic therapy with penicillin has been advocated in recognition of the fact {{that a majority of the}} causative organisms are sensitive to penicillin. However, no controlled studies have proved the effectiveness of such therapy. Immunization with broadly <b>polyvalent</b> <b>vaccines</b> against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influen-zae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis may ultimately represent the most effective way to reduce the incidence of catastrophic infections. The association of sickle cell anemia with in-creased susceptibility to serious infections has bee...|$|R
40|$|The {{employees}} {{of an oil}} company in southern England participated in the controlled trial of a saline <b>polyvalent</b> influenza <b>vaccine.</b> Of 981 volunteers, 681 received the vaccine and the remainder an indistinguishable inert control substance. The identity of the latter group was not disclosed until the incidence of influenza had been assessed. Three questionnaires were circulated in December 1963, February and April 1964 for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|The {{aetiology}} of appendicitis {{is usually}} polymicrobial. We report a rare case of appendicitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae {{as the only}} causative organism. The case assumes significance because it occurs {{in the absence of}} any predisposing factor for invasive pneumococcal infection, it is unimicrobial, it may lead to the misdiagnosis of primary peritonitis due to pneumococcus, and it undermines the efficacy of <b>polyvalent</b> pneumococcal <b>vaccine...</b>|$|R
