A new model based in a mixed mathematical equation comprising a logistic model, and a magnetic saturation model resulted appropriate to estimate the ammonia consumption under limiting conditions. Favorable conditions for PHA production in P. fluorescens were found at temperature of 30  °C, reaching the maximum biomass concentration of 2. 83  g L− 1, and consuming 99. 9 % of the initial ammonia, to produce 2. 13  g L− 1 of PHA.

The production of proferrorosamine A and siderophores by P. roseus fluorescens {{appears to be}} controlled {{in a similar way}} by the concentration of available iron and by the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The higher the concentration of iron available for the microorganism, the lower the production of both chelating compounds. However, the production of siderophores was much more sensitive to iron availability than was proferrorosamine A production. Proferrorosamine A and siderophores were only produced in minimal medium C if the concentration of dissolved oxygen ranged from 4. 5 to 2. 0 ppm. At higher or lower concentrations, none of the iron-chelating compounds were produced. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} proferrorosamine-negative Tn 5 mutants of P. roseus fluorescens were able to form siderophores only under iron-limiting conditions when proferrorosamine A was added to the medium.
