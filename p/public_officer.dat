5|$|As the Director-General was a <b>public</b> <b>officer</b> {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he {{was subject to}} an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Under section 35 of the Interpretation Act, if {{written law}} confers power on a {{minister}} {{to give a}} direction, issue an order or authorize something to be done, exercise of the power may be done (unless the law states otherwise) under the signature of the permanent secretary to the ministry which the minister is responsible for, or of any <b>public</b> <b>officer</b> authorized in writing by the minister. Section 36 of the Act permits a minister empowered {{to exercise a power}} or perform a duty to, {{in the absence of any}} statutory provision to the contrary, depute another person to exercise the power or perform the duty on his or her behalf. The delegation must be approved by the President (acting on Cabinet's advice); may be made subject to conditions, exceptions and qualifications; and must be published in the Government Gazette. The minister remains capable of exercising the power or performing the duty personally. The power to make subsidiary legislation cannot be delegated.|$|E

25|$|The {{right of}} abode in Hong Kong {{is the right to}} legally reside in Hong Kong without any limit or {{condition}} of stay being imposed by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the People's Republic of China stood to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, the nationality of Hong Kong people as well as their {{right of abode}} in the territory was formalised prior to the 1997 handover. Since Hong Kong has never been an independent country, there is no provision for its own citizenship status. Hong Kong Permanent Resident is the legal status for those who have the right of abode in Hong Kong, which is the de-facto citizenship status in Hong Kong. Most citizen rights in Hong Kong (such as the right to vote) are granted to all permanent residents, while some (such as the right to hold a HKSAR passport, or becoming a high-rank <b>public</b> <b>officer</b> such as the Chief Executive) are restricted to permanent residents who are also Chinese citizens.|$|E

500|$|Where {{a statute}} gives a {{decision-maker}} a discretionary power, {{it is generally}} unlawful for the decision-maker to delegate that power to another person or body unless the statute itself expressly provides {{that this may be}} done. Thus, it is illegal for a decision-maker to abdicate its responsibility of exercising power by taking orders from other bodies. The Carltona doctrine of English administrative law (which Singapore inherited at independence) allows a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of a minister, even where the statute confers discretion on the minister. The Interpretation Act of Singapore provides that the exercise of a minister's power may be done under the signature of the permanent secretary to the ministry which the minister is responsible for, or by any <b>public</b> <b>officer</b> authorized in writing by the minister. In addition, ministers are permitted to [...] other persons to exercise certain powers or perform certain duties on their behalf.|$|E

Although the colonial government admitted that the <b>public</b> <b>officer’s</b> claim was justified, because of the austerity that World War I which was raging in Europe brought on the government, the claims could not be met.
