40|$|Abstract Background It is well {{established}} that {{the growth of the}} prostate gland is a hormone-dependent phenomenon involving both androgenic and estrogenic control. Proliferation of prostate cells is, at least in part, under control of estrogen receptor beta (ER-beta). <b>Phytoestrogens</b> bind ER-beta with high affinity and therefore may have antiproliferative effects in the prostate. Methods The prostates of male Long-Evans rats fed a diet high in <b>phytoestrogens</b> (Phyto- 600) or very low levels of <b>phytoestrogens</b> (Phyto-free) were analyzed to determine the impact of dietary <b>phytoestrogens</b> on prostate weight and androgen receptor (AR) expression in the prostate. Results Dietary <b>phytoestrogens</b> significantly decreased post-pubertal prostate weight gain in Phyto- 600 vs Phyto-free fed males. Additionally, dietary <b>phytoestrogens</b> (Phyto- 600) decreased AR expression in the prostate as determined by in situ hybridization. Conclusions Soy <b>phytoestrogens,</b> present in diet, alter prostate growth presumably by binding ER-beta and subsequently reducing AR expression within the prostate. </p...|$|R

25|$|The Yoruba peoples {{have the}} highest rate of {{twinning}} in the world, at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, possibly because of high consumption of a specific type of yam containing a natural <b>phytoestrogen</b> which may stimulate the ovaries to release an egg from each side.|$|E
50|$|Soybeans contain isoflavones called {{genistein}} and daidzein, {{which are}} {{one source of}} <b>phytoestrogens</b> in the human diet. Because most naturally occurring <b>phytoestrogens</b> act as selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, which do not necessarily act as direct agonists of estrogen receptors, normal consumption of foods that contain these <b>phytoestrogens</b> should not provide sufficient amounts to elicit a physiological response in humans.|$|R
40|$|Isoflavones {{and their}} {{metabolites}} are termed <b>phytoestrogens</b> because they bind to estrogen receptors, although weakly compared to physiologic estrogens. Soybean {{is the main}} source of <b>phytoestrogens.</b> Several recent reviews concluded that {{there is no evidence that}} <b>phytoestrogens</b> relieve menopausal symptoms better than placebo. At the same time, some studies suggest their efficacy. In theory, the use of <b>phytoestrogens</b> for hormone replacement appears irrational: biological action of estrogens is receptor-mediated; the question is therefore, why the vegetable analogues should be used instead of physiological hormones optimally complementary to the receptors. Apparently, the problem should be seen within the scope of placebo marketing under the guise of evidence-based medications. For example, a supposed anti-atherogenic effect of <b>phytoestrogens</b> was confirmed by doubtful experiments with cell cultures, which are discussed here. Furthermore, there is a contradiction: <b>phytoestrogens</b> are supposed to compensate for estrogen deficiency in menopause; but at the same time, their estrogenic potential does not prevent the widespread use of soy for infant food and other foodstuffs. Environmentally relevant doses of <b>phytoestrogens</b> have impacts on ovarian differentiation, fertility and genderrelated behavior in animals. In conclusion, the beneficial and potentially harmful effects of <b>phytoestrogens</b> should be clarified by independent research, which can be of importance for the future of the soybean in agriculture.

40|$|<b>Phytoestrogens</b> {{are very}} intensively studied {{in recent years}} because they show {{different}} pharmacological effects on human health.

In addition, also it was demonstrated number of positive effects of soybean <b>phytoestrogens</b> on the health status of women in the menopause, such as reducing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis. Various technologically processed soy beans are important part of the feed rations mainly for high-lactating dairy cows, because they are a valuable source of the energy and high-quality protein, despite their negative effect on reproductive performance. <b>Phytoestrogens</b> consumed from the feed rations are hydrolyzed in the rumen of dairy cow and together with their metabolites are absorbed in the small intestine into the blood.

40|$|The {{aromatase}} enzyme catalyzes {{the conversion}} of androgens to estrogens in many human tissues. Estrogens are known to stimulate cellular proliferation associated with certain cancers and protect against adverse symptoms during the peri- and postmenopausal intervals. <b>Phytoestrogens</b> are a group of plant derived naturally occurring compounds that have chemical structures similar to estrogen. Since <b>phytoestrogens</b> {{are known to be}} constituents of animal/human food sources, these compounds have received increased research attention. <b>Phytoestrogens</b> may contribute to decreased cancer risk by the inhibition of aromatase enzyme activity and CYP 19 gene expression in human tissues. This review covers (a) the aromatase enzyme (historical descriptions on function, activity, and gene characteristics), (b) <b>phytoestrogens</b> in their classifications and applications to human health, and (c) a chronological coverage of aromatase activity modulated by <b>phytoestrogens</b> from the early 1980 s to 2015. In general, <b>phytoestrogens</b> act as aromatase inhibitors by (a) decreasing aromatase gene expression, (b) inhibiting the aromatase enzyme itself, or (c) in some cases acting at both levels of regulation.

40|$|Of any plant, soy {{contains}} the largest concentration of isoflavones, {{a class of}} <b>phytoestrogens.</b> <b>Phytoestrogens</b> are structurally similar to estradiol and mimic its effects.

However, these results must be interpreted with care, and additional evidence is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn. In particular, since not all activities related to soy can be assigned to the estrogenic-like activity, further studies are needed to identify firstly which soy constituent(s) improve metabolic parameters when ingested and secondly, which are the mechanisms whereby dietary soy improves metabolic-related conditions like obesity and diabetes. Finally, the potential detrimental effects of soy and <b>phytoestrogens</b> are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Phytoestogens are a {{group of}} lipophillic plant {{compounds}} that can have estrogenic effects in animals; both tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic effects have been reported. Prolactin-secreting adenomas are the most prevalent form of pituitary tumors in humans and {{have been linked to}} estrogen exposures. We examined the proliferative effects of <b>phytoestrogens</b> on a rat pituitary tumor cell line, GH 3 /B 6 /F 10, originally subcloned from GH 3 cells based on its ability to express high levels of the membrane estrogen receptor-α. Methods We measured the proliferative effects of these <b>phytoestrogens</b> using crystal violet staining, the activation of several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and their downstream targets via a quantitative plate immunoassay, and caspase enzymatic activities. Results Four <b>phytoestrogens</b> (coumestrol, daidzein, genistein, and trans -resveratrol) were studied over wide concentration ranges. Except trans -resveratrol, all <b>phytoestrogens</b> increased GH 3 /B 6 /F 10 cell proliferation at some concentration relevant to dietary levels. All four <b>phytoestrogens</b> attenuated the proliferative effects of estradiol when administered simultaneously. All <b>phytoestrogens</b> elicited MAPK and downstream target activations, but with time course patterns that often differed from that of estradiol and each other. Using selective antagonists, we determined that MAPKs {{play a role in the}} ability of these <b>phytoestrogens</b> to elicit these responses. In addition, except for trans -resveratrol, a serum removal-induced extrinsic apoptotic pathway was blocked by these <b>phytoestrogens.</b> Conclusion <b>Phytoestrogens</b> can block physiological estrogen-induced tumor cell growth in vitro and can also stimulate growth at high dietary concentrations in the absence of endogenous estrogens; these actions are correlated with slightly different signaling response patterns. Consumption of these compounds should be considered in strategies to control endocrine tumor cell growth, such as in the pituitary. </p...|$|R
