40|$|Groundwater {{flow and}} {{contaminant}} transport models {{are used to}} support decision making regarding waste disposal options, sites contaminated by surface or subsurface sources, or to develop and test cost-effective groundwater remediation schemes. Such models are influenced by different sources of uncertainty, including those due to spatial variability in aquifer and aquitard properties including hydraulic conductivity (K). However, quantifying spatial variability in K remains challenging. Classical drilling techniques for shallow heterogeneous unconsolidated sedimentary deposits involving continuous coring are expensive and time-consuming, especially when the area of interest exceeds several tens of km². Alternative techniques such as direct <b>push</b> <b>technologies</b> use hydraulic rams, supplemented with vehicle weight, or high-frequency hammering, to advance small-diameter tools into the subsurface. These tools are typically used for cost-effective geotechnical characterization of unconsolidated deposits; recent developments also allow for hydraulic characterization. The depth of investigation is up to ~ 40 m, depending on the tools used (i. e applied load) and sediment properties (friction). Up to now, {{only a limited number}} of studies document using this type of data to parameterize regional groundwater flow models. To fill this gap, this study aims at parameterizing a regional groundwater flow model using data from various types of direct <b>push</b> <b>technologies.</b> We discuss the characterization of an area (~ 60 km²) near the nuclear zone of Mol/Dessel (Belgium), using various direct <b>push</b> <b>technologies.</b> Most of the measurements are concentrated in an area of 200 × 400 m². The data include 265 cone penetration tests (CPTs), 113 pore pressure dissipation tests (PPDTs), 17 direct push injection logs (DPIL), 6 hydraulic profiling tool (HPT) logs and 19 direct push slug tests (DPST). Resulting K values, either calculated or estimated, and the corresponding spatial variability are compared with that of borehole and outcrop studies. The benefit of using standard CPT data for the parameterization of an aquitard at the study site has previously been shown. The approach is now applied to the aquifer units and incorporates new direct push data for the entire upper ~ 40 m of the hydrogeological domain. The effect of the 3 D heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field on the performance of the groundwater flow model is discussed; the value of the different direct <b>push</b> <b>technologies</b> is equally addressed.

40|$|Introducing a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> {{to stimulate}} {{entrepreneurship}} {{in remote areas}} in developing countries can be examined {{in the context of}} a franchising model (social or commercial franchising). The results of this study (fieldwork in Kalimantan, Indonesia) point to a high feasibility of introducing a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> by a franchising model. The results indicate that the smallholder rubber farmers (community level) and the head of villages, head of district and the government departments (low, middle and high institutional level) support a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> and are willing to participate. Furthermore almost all stakeholders prefer a franchising model to introduce a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> with social franchising elements. Additionally, empirical evidence confirmed the main theoretical argument of this research: a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> carried out by a franchising model can stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in remote villages. This study thus concluded that in order to stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in local communities and with that local economic development, a hybrid franchising (a combination of both commercial and social franchising) model should be used to carry a <b>technology</b> <b>push...</b>|$|R

40|$|What is it? Podcasting {{is part of}} the {{so-called}} Web 2. 0 that depends on <b>push</b> <b>technologies</b> to deliver content. <b>Push</b> <b>technologies</b> is terminology used to define the process of collective technologies used to send out information to users, regardless of whether anyone is tuned in. The updating process is usually an unobtrusive one. With that in mind Podcast creators can have their content delivered to subscribers as soon as it becomes available, without the steps of typing an URL and subsequently downloading the information. Students can subscribe to podcasts and have the content delivered automatically to their device management software. This allows for the time-shifted delivery of content, much like TiVo for TV. Podcasting has revolutionized education and particularly higher education by enabling up-to-date content, addressing multiple intelligences and allowing for the anytime/anywhere delivery of instructional content. Podcast content can include but is not limited to audio and video recordings of lectures, incidental content (e. g. interviews, narrations) and generally any audio and video content. For example, Stanford University offers audio lecture content, but also offers videos of their sports activities. There have also been extensions that allow for the updating o...|$|R
