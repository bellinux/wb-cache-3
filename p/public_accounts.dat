40|$|Today’s <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms face {{a number}} of {{challenges}} {{in relation to their}} most valuable resource and primary revenue generator, human capital. Expanding regulations, technology advances, increased competition and high turnover rates {{are just a few of}} the issues confronting <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> leaders in today’s complex business environment. In recent years, some <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms have attempted to combat low retention and high burnout rates with traditional one-to-one mentoring programs, with varying degrees of success. Many firms have found that they lack the resources necessary to successfully implement and maintain such programs. In other industries, organizations have used a group mentoring approach in an attempt to remove potential barriers to mentoring success. Although the research regarding group mentoring shows promise for positive organizational outcomes, no cases could be found in the literature regarding its usage in a <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firm. Because of the unique challenges associated with <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms, this paper attempts to answer two questions: (1) Does group mentoring provide a viable alternative to traditional mentoring in a <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firm? (2) If so, what general model might be used for implementing such a program? In answering these questions, a review of the group mentoring literature is provided, along with a suggested model for the implementation of group mentoring in a <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firm...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{inability}} of <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> practices to retain female auditors {{is of concern}} to the profession. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the factors associated with the actual turnover decisions made by female auditors in the <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> profession. Design/methodology/approach – Multinomial logistic regression is used to analyze survey data from 247 female auditors who were formerly employed by <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms in Hong Kong. About 20 semi-structured interviews are conducted to supplement the findings. Findings – The results reveal that role conflict has the highest explanatory power among the independent variables. Social comparison with peers, stress and age are also influential factors in the turnover decisions made by female auditors in the <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> field. These results support social comparison theory, which asserts that individuals are driven to evaluate their abilities and opinions through social comparison with others. A particularly interesting finding is that neither physical appearance nor gender discrimination is an influential factor, which contradicts the findings of research carried out in the USA and Japan. Originality/value – According to human capital theory, the departure of female auditors from the <b>public</b> <b>accounting</b> profession represents a significant loss in human capital. <b>Public</b> <b>accounting</b> firms should thus take immediate measures to retain this valuable source of human capital and achieve the goal of a gender-diverse workplace.
