Flip-flops are an inherent building block in Universal shift registers design. In order to achieve Universal shift registers, that is both high performances while also being power efficient, careful attention must {{be paid to the}} design of flip flops. Several fast low power flip flops, called <b>pulse</b> <b>triggered</b> flip flop (PTFF), design is analyzed and designed the universal shift registers [...] The paper presents a modified design for explicit <b>pulse</b> <b>triggered</b> Flip-flop with reduced transistor count for low power and high performance applications.

40|$|Abstract- Pulse-triggered {{flip-flops}} {{are mainly}} {{used to improve}} speed of operation (pipeline speed), though flip-flop robustness and system timing closure are challenging {{in a wide range}} of supply voltages. Usually pulse-triggered flip-flops have specific structures and transistor sizes to optimize the system performance. The transistor size, topology, and threshold voltage of the flip-flop make the timing characteristics sensitive to the supply voltage. The transparent windows generated and required in a pulse-triggered flip-flop may have mismatch under different supply voltages (scaling), which is likely to result in system timing and functional failures. in single edge adaptive <b>pulse</b> <b>trigger</b> flip-flops the latching speed is less, no of transistors are more and power dissipation also high so to overcome these limitations dual edge adaptive <b>pulse</b> <b>triggered</b> flip flop is proposed. Proposed structure improves the robustness of adaptive pulse-triggered flip-flops and promises this high-speed clocked element for wide range of supply voltages so data latching speed is increase, numbers of transistors were reduced and power dissipation also reduced.

40|$|Single-soliton Kerr {{frequency}} comb generation and maintenance in monolithic microresonators recently attract great interests {{because it is}} the key to enable chip-scale optical {{frequency comb}}s, optical synthesis of ultrashort pulses, coherent communication systems, etc. It however remains challenging to straightforwardly and deterministically achieve and maintain the attractive single-soliton state in microresonators. In this paper, for the first time, we propose and comprehensively demonstrate to excite the single-soliton Kerr comb in anomalous dispersion regime of Si 3 N 4 microring resonators by seeding the continuous-wave pump field with a pulsed trigger. We show that with sufficient single pulse energy, a pulse train with low repetition rate and even a single <b>pulse</b> <b>trigger</b> can both generate Kerr comb with the deterministic single-soliton state without experiencing any unstable or chaotic states. Neither the pump frequency nor the cavity resonance is required to be actively tuned in the whole process, which are the common approaches reported so far. The mode-locked single-soliton Kerr comb generated is robust and insensitive to noise perturbations. The use of single <b>pulse</b> <b>trigger</b> makes it possible to manipulate the number and temporal locations of cavity solitons inside the cavity by controlling the power and temporal location of the <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse.</b> The proposed single <b>pulse</b> <b>trigger</b> approach is confirmed to be valid when the thermal dynamics of the cavity is included into the model.

40|$|Abstract- The initial {{statistical}} {{time lag}} of partial discharge (PD) measurements was eliminated by using short x-ray pulses (duration 50 ns) for triggering. Phase resolved PD (PRPD) patterns at low electric field levels were recorded. No {{significant difference between}} the PRPD patterns after x-ray <b>pulse</b> <b>triggering</b> and naturally incepted PDs was observed. These measurements were performed with self-produced spherical void samples and even voids of 0. 5 mm were detected after one x-ray pulse application. It is assumed that the x-ray pulses provide necessary start electrons to start an avalanche. However, in order to study the effect of the x-ray pulse on the triggering and on the discharge mechanism, time resolved PD measurements with an ultra-wideband detection circuit are necessary. In this work, the classical wide-band PD detection circuit was modified and time resolved measurements were performed. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of the x-ray dose on the first PD pulses, here shown for one void size. Moreover, the temporal development of subsequent discharges after the total decay of the x-ray pulse is studied. To increase the accuracy of the detection, optical measurements of the discharge are synchronously made with a photomultiplier tube...|$|E
40|$|Drosophila cyclin E (DmcycE) is {{required}} in embryos for S phase of mitotic and endoreduplication cycles. Here, we describe regulatory differences characteristic for these two cell cycle types. While DmcycE transcript levels decline in DmcycE mutant cells programmed for mitotic proliferation, they are maintained and no longer restricted to transient pulses in DmcycE mutant cells programmed for endoreduplication. Moreover, DmcycE expression in endoreduplicating cells is down-regulated by ectopic expression of a heat-inducible cyclin E transgene. DmcycE expression in endoreduplicating tissues, therefore, is restricted by a negative feedback to the transient <b>pulse</b> <b>triggering</b> entry into S-phase. Conversely, during mitotic cycles, where S phase entry is not only dependent on cyclin E but also on progression through M phase, cyclin E and associated Dmcdc 2 c kinase activity are present throughout the cell cycle. Reinitiation of DNA replication during the G 2 phase of the mitotic cell cycle, therefore, is prevented by cyclin E/Dmcdc 2 c kinase-independent regulation. Observations in cyclin A mutants implicate G 2 cyclins in this regulation. Our results suggest molecular explanations for the different rules governing S phase during mitotic and endoreduplication cycles. Karsten Sauer, Jürgen A.

40|$|BackgroundMany {{studies have}} shown that {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) behaves irregularly, rather than with laminar flow, in the various CSF spaces. We adapted a modified previously known magnetic resonance imaging technique to visualize irregular CSF motion. Subsequently, we assessed the usefulness and clinical significance of the present method. Materials and MethodsNormal CSF motion in 10 healthy volunteers was visualized with the dynamic improved, motion-sensitized, driven-equilibrium steady-state free precession technique. Subsequently, CSF motion visualization with a modified sequence was applied to 3 patients. ResultsIn healthy volunteers, we achieved visualization of the irregularity of CSF flow in the ventricles and spinal canal, whereas CSF motion was diminished in the peripheral part of the intracranial subarachnoid space. In one case, we confirmed the patency of the patient's third ventriculostomy fenestration site. In the other, we verified the usefulness of the proposed sequence for determining the communication between the ventricle or subarachnoid space and the cyst. ConclusionsUsing the present sequence, we obtained images that accentuated CSF motion, which is largely composed of irregular motion. This method does not require <b>pulse</b> <b>triggering</b> or complex post-processing of images and allows visualization of CSF motion {{in a short period of}} time in selected whole imaging planes.

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{quantify}} pancreatic regional perfusion with dynamic contrast material-enhanced {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) imaging {{by using a}} one-compartment model and to assess perfusion changes during secretin stimulation in healthy volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study had institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained. Ten healthy volunteers (five men, five women; mean age, 24. 7 years +/- 1. 9 [standard deviation]; range, 22 - 29 years) underwent MR imaging pancreatic perfusion studies performed twice without secretin and twice during secretin stimulation. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging consisted of saturation-recovery T 1 -weighted turbo-field-echo imaging with peripheral <b>pulse</b> <b>triggering</b> and respiratory tracking. A dose of 0. 05 mmol gadodiamide per kilogram of body weight was injected {{at a rate of}} 3. 5 mL/sec. Regional perfusion parameters were fitted with a one-compartment model. The analysis of variance test for repeated measurements was used to assess differences in pancreatic perfusion without and that with secretin administration. RESULTS: Significant differences in perfusion parameters between the three pancreatic regions were observed (P <. 05). During secretin stimulation, a significant difference was observed only between the body and the tail of the pancreas (P =. 02). A significant increase (P =. 003) in pancreatic perfusion was observed after secretin administration. Mean pancreatic perfusion was 184 mL/min/ 100 g of tissue +/- 71, 207 mL/min/ 100 g +/- 77, and 230 mL/min/ 100 g +/- 87 without secretin and 342 mL/min/ 100 g +/- 154, 338 mL/min/ 100 g +/- 156, and 373 mL/min/ 100 g +/- 176 after secretin stimulation in the head, body, and tail of the pancreas, respectively. Intraindividual variability was 21 % without secretin stimulation and 46 % with secretin stimulation. CONCLUSION: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging enables noninvasive quantification of regional pancreatic perfusion in resting conditions and demonstrates the increase in pancreatic perfusion during secretin stimulation in healthy subjects.

40|$|International audienceThe {{extremely}} large solar eruption on 28 October 2003 {{caused an}} intense geomagnetic storm at Earth. A second solar eruption on 29 October {{resulted in a}} reintensification of the storm about a day later. Similarities and differences between these two events in terms of solar eruption, solar wind driver, and their resulting effect on the near-Earth environment are investigated and put into context of previous works on storm geoeffectivness. Within the second storm some of the strongest substorms {{in the history of}} magnetic recordings occurred in northern Scandinavia. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the cause and resulting effects of these extreme geomagnetic disturbances on the ionosphere and upper atmosphere, focusing on the northern Scandinavian sector where these disturbances reached extremely high values. During this time period, well after the initial arrival of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME), the Cluster spacecraft were located at the flank of the magnetospheric tail. The satellites were passed several times by an inward and consecutively outward moving magnetopause in close relation to the substorm intensifications in northern Scandinavia. We propose that the evolution of these magnetospheric substorm intensifications are influenced by the changing dynamics of the solar wind in the form of increased pressure occurring after a prolonged period of southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) and thus excessive energy loading into the magnetosphere prior to the onset of the intensifications. We present evidence of external pressure <b>pulse</b> <b>triggering</b> and possibly also quenching of these substorm onsets and recoveries. In addition, EISCAT data have been used to investigate the detailed local behavior of the ionospheric plasma, giving rise to such extreme disturbances.

40|$|We {{report about}} a time {{resolved}} measurement of electron dynamics in an aluminum oxide thin film on silicon done by Ultrafast Scanning Electron Microscopy (USEM). This novel technique aims {{to join the}} time resolution typical of fs lasers to the spatial lateral and depth resolution of electron microscopy in a single tabletop tool. The USEM apparatus operates in Ultra-High Vacuum regime, and in our pump-probe setup the sample under test is excited both by an UV fs laser pulse and by a delayed electron <b>pulse,</b> <b>triggering</b> the emission of low energy electrons to the detector. Optical properties in the visible and near UV of wide bandgap insulators are influenced by defects that act as traps for electrons; lifetime and energy of excited states have been studied by time resolved photoluminescence [1]. It’s known from cathodoluminescence measurements that defects may be excited also by the electron beam of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) [2]. Our goal is to evaluate the excitation dynamics of the color centers in an insulator from the secondary electron contrast typical of the SEM images. The laser‑induced electronic contrast of the alumina film shows a relevant CW contribution, that we attribute tentatively to the photo‑induced carriers within the insulator. Nonetheless, by employing lock-in detection of secondary electrons, {{it is possible to}} observe also a fast dynamics with components ranging from hundreds of picoseconds to few nanoseconds. We observed an enhancement of secondary electron emission rising at zero delays and vanishing for positive delay with a time constant of tens of nanoseconds attributed to the excitation of an oxygen vacancy by the laser beam. It was possible to observe a depletion mechanism acting at positive delays and decaying with a tau of tens of picoseconds that was attributed to laser induced surface charging [3]. A third enhancement acting at negative delays and decaying with a time constant of few nanoseconds was attributed to the photoemission of electrons from color centers excited by the electron beam.

40|$|The thesis reports an {{investigation}} of the mechanisms whereby the femoral artery supplying blood to a temporarily vasodilated skeletal muscle bed also dilates. Arterial diameter was continuously measured by an ultrasonic transit time technique, calibrated against distance by separate determination of the velocity of ultrasound in blood. An instrument capable of sampling up to four distances at repetition frequencies above 1 andnbsp;kHz was developed, and new methods of transmitter <b>pulse</b> <b>triggering</b> and received pulse amplification and detection are described. Design of optimal transducers for arterial, cardiac, venous and transcutaneous use is discussed in terms of testing by beam visualisation and other methods. The system runs for several hours without temperature drift and will resolve distance changes smaller than one micron. Trials by measurement of dynamic distension of a long water-filled rubber tube and comparison with manometrically measured phase velocity showed that the technique yields results within the range of predicted values from the various theories of pulsatile flow in rubber tubes. Blood pressure and flow and vessel diameter were measured from the exposed femoral arteries of anaesthetised greyhounds. Transient hyperaemia was induced by distal injection of vasodilator substances, nerve stimulation or occlusion of the femoral artery, and sustained high flowrate by establishing an arteriovenous shunt. Dilatation of up to 3 % was observed in {{less than half of the}} experiments. The effects on the response of altering blood pressure, arterial constriction, and various degrees of arterial exposure and handling were observed. The data on exposure illuminate the controversy over the applicability to unexposed vessels of data obtained invasively. Locally originating response mechanisms were tested by perfusion of excised arteries at varying flowrates, pressures and pharmacologically induced tonic constriction levels. Conduction of constriction and relaxation was tested in vivo and in vitro by procedures to show the distant effects of locally applied pharmacological agents. Pressure and distension data were digitised and analysed by computer to determine wave velocities, elastic moduli and the importance of elastic non-linearity. Methods of finding phase, group and foot velocities were compared. The femoral dilatation response occurred after distal arterial section and when an arteriovenous shunt was established. Therefore the mechanism is not thought to involve conduction of dilatation commands from peripheral vessels. Temperature changes caused an opposite effect to high flow dilatation: the artery dilated slightly on cooling during occlusion and vice versa. The dilatation response is considered to depend on local sensing of increased arterial blood flowrate. Two such possible mechanisms are discussed. </p...|$|E
