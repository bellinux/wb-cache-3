5|$|K-383 and US-36 {{intersect}} K-261, a spur serving <b>Prairie</b> <b>Dog</b> State Park, {{before reaching}} the city of Norton. The highways curve northeast and back east and pass through {{the northern part of}} the city as Holme Street, a four-lane undivided road. K-383 and US-36 intersect US-283 (State Street) north of the downtown area. The highways become a two-lane road again as they leave Norton. K-383 and US-36 cross over the Kyle Railroad and begin to parallel the railroad and <b>Prairie</b> <b>Dog</b> Creek. The highways meet the southern end of K-67, a spur serving the Norton Correctional Facility, before they diverge. US-36 continues east and K-383 heads northeast parallel to the Kyle Railroad through the hamlet of Calvert. The state highway meets the northern end of K-60 just before it crosses over the Kyle Railroad on the edge of the city of Almena. K-383 continues east parallel to the Nebraska Kansas Colorado Railway into Phillips County. After they pass through the city of Long Island, that railroad splits to the north into Nebraska. K-383 passes through the village of Woodruff shortly before it reaches its northern terminus at US-183 about one half-mile south of the Nebraska state line.|$|E
5|$|K-383 {{begins at}} a four-legged {{intersection}} {{northeast of the}} town of Selden in northern Sheridan County. US-83 heads west toward Selden and Colby and north toward Oberlin; K-23 heads south and east toward Hoxie. K-383 heads northeast as a two-lane road immediately parallel to the Kyle Railroad and a couple of miles south of <b>Prairie</b> <b>Dog</b> Creek. The highway enters Decatur County and intersects K-223 north of the village of Leoville and K-123 while passing through the city of Dresden. K-383 and the railroad enter the creek valley shortly before the city of Jennings, through which the road is Railroad Street. The highway separates from the railroad for several miles prior to rejoining at the city of Clayton at the DecaturNorton county line. K-383 leaves the railroad again southwest of the village of Oronoque, heading east then curving north to cross <b>Prairie</b> <b>Dog</b> Creek at its entrance to Keith Sebelius Lake. The highway crosses over the Kyle Railroad before intersecting US-36, with which the state highway runs concurrently east.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which {{typically}} form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often {{consists of an}} adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders.|$|E
50|$|Their {{above-ground}} {{activities include}} making social contact, {{being aware of}} their surroundings and predators, grooming, burrowing, etc. Their main activity above ground is feeding. Although Gunnison’s <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> {{are considered to be}} less social than black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> they are considered to be more social than the white-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs.</b> Studies have shown female Gunnison's <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> {{are far more likely to}} engage in friendly social contact with other <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> and males are more likely to create conflict.|$|R
40|$|<b>Prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> (genus Cynomys) are midsized ground {{squirrels}} and a sentinel of the Great Plains’ health. Where {{there are}} <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> there are predators. Where there are <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> {{the soil is}} turned over and aerated. Where there are <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> plant biodiversity is maintained by their intermittent disturbance. Sadly, <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> are vilified by humans: they are shot, poisoned, drowned, sucked out of their burrows with high powered vacuums, and their habitats paved over and converted to housing and shopping centers. In this book, the authors tell us about their studies of social behavior and communication in Gunnison’s <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> while broadening their story to include information about the other four species— black-tailed, white-tailed, Utah, and Mexican—along with messages about conservation and coexistence. Their admirable intent is to educate people about <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> {{as a way to}} help conserve them...|$|R

5|$|Guinea pigs {{are used}} in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig. The {{traditional}} Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fogón, is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.|$|E
5|$|The state holds {{populations of}} white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, coyotes, {{mountain}} lions, bobcats, elk, and birds such as quail, doves, cardinals, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and pheasants. In prairie ecosystems, American bison, greater prairie chickens, badgers, and armadillo are common, {{and some of}} the nation's largest <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, grey fox, and river otter populations, which coexist with 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator.|$|E
5|$|Among Chacoan mammals are the {{plentiful}} coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also {{live within}} the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) are an obligate dietary specialist of <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> (Cynomys spp.). Indeed, the extirpation of ferrets {{from the wild}} was attributed to the decline of <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> throughout North America. However, {{the degree to which}} ferrets are specialized predators of <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> and their foraging plasticity is unclear. We quantified the diet of free-ranging black footed ferrets in Wyoming, USA using stable isotope analysis. We also explored different age-sex group dietary differences based on sexual size dimorphism. Our results confirmed that <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> were the most important diet item, although ferrets also displayed greater foraging plasticity than previously believed and consumed large quantities of species of smail mammals. The degree to which ferrets specialized on <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> also differed between ferret age-sex groups. Adult male and juvenile ferrets possessed roughly equivalent diets, with <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> constituting nearly 75 % of their assimilated diet. In contrast, adult female ferrets relied less on <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> (63 %), and more heavily on smaller-bodied mice(31 %). These results suggest that intraspecific competition is limited by sexual size dimorphism, with larger males consuming the larger-bodied <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> more than adult females. <b>Prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> were, however, a critical nutritional component for young, and female ferrets appear to have preferentially provided <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> to their offspring, rather than consuming in their own diet. Conservation of <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> colonies, not just as prey items, but also for the prey-rich habitat they provide will be key for saving one of North America's most endangered mammals...|$|R
50|$|<b>Prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> {{were once}} the most {{abundant}} animals in the short grass prairie, living in colonies across a range that historically spanned 11 states. Presently, <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> are found in 1 percent of their former range. The decrease {{has been driven by}} poisoning campaigns, habitat disruption, and hunting. The decline in <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> has significantly impacted many of the other animals that reside in the short grass prairie, including the black-footed ferret, whose diet relies on <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs.</b> Other animals negatively affected by the decline of <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> are the mountain plover, swift fox, ferruginous hawk and the burrowing owl.|$|R
50|$|Competitive {{interactions}} between black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> and domestic livestock for preferred forage species are unclear. Several studies suggest black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> avoid eating many plants that livestock prefer, and prefer many plants livestock avoid.

5|$|US-383 was {{relocated}} to K-383's present alignment southwest of Clayton starting in 1954. The highway was constructed along its current route near Oronoque concurrent {{with the construction}} of the Norton Reservoir (now Keith Sebelius Lake) on <b>Prairie</b> <b>Dog</b> Creek around 1962. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved the removal of the US-383 designation in 1979. K-383 was assigned to the portions of former US-383 in Kansas from US-83 near Selden to a concurrency with US-183 at the Nebraska state line in 1981. In 1990, K-383's western terminus was {{relocated to}} its present spot. K-383 had begun at US-83's intersection with the first eastwest section line road the latter highway intersects west of K-383. US-83 followed the section line road to near what was then K-23's northern terminus, then turned north along another section line road and passed under K-383 and the Kyle Railroad; a connector ramp was used between US-83 and K-383 at the bridges, which were constructed by 1951. US-83 was relocated to remove the grade separations and both K-383 and K-23 were given their present termini; the eastwest section line road west of K-23 was transferred to county maintenance. In 1994, K-383 was relocated at its present eastern terminus to remove what had been a wye junction with US-183.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the {{black-footed ferret}} included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed ferrets use <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover. Six black-footed ferret nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, {{were lined with}} buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass. High densities of <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrows provide {{the greatest amount of}} cover for black-footed ferrets. Black-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies contain a greater burrow density per acre than white-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies, and may be more suitable for the recovery of black-footed ferrets. The type of <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrow may be important for occupancy by black-footed ferrets. Black-footed ferret litters near Meeteetse, Wyoming, were associated with mounded white-tailed <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrows, which are less common than non-mounded burrows. Mounded burrows contain multiple entrances and probably have a deep and extensive burrow system that protects kits. However, black-footed ferrets used non-mounded <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> burrows (64%) more often than mounded burrows (30%) near Meeteetse, Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|In the Great Plains, the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> is a {{keystone}} species. Studies comparing species abundances {{in areas}} of colonization against areas with no <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonization show clear evidence that the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> does {{have a significant impact}} on its surroundings by altering vegetation and therefore affecting habitat and food availability for other species. There is a great mosaic of vegetative diversity within the Great Plains due to the prairie dog’s extensive grazing on long grasses. This mosaic supports a variety of small mammals. In addition to altering vegetation, the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> also creates habitat for many other organisms by creating extensive tunnel systems that other small mammals such as the desert cottontail, striped skunk and deer mouse use for shelter. A strong characteristic of keystone species is their ability to create and modify other organism’s habitats and it is evident that the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> does this. In conclusion, the <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> is an iconic animal species North America. Its close link to the ecology and structure of the Great Plains make it the defining keystone species of the ecoregion.|$|E

25|$|The {{contradictory}} mandates {{of the two}} {{federal agencies}} involved, the USFWS and the U.S. Forest Service are exemplified in what the Rosebud Sioux tribe experienced: The ferret was reintroduced by the USFWS, which according to the tribe promised {{to pay more than}} $1 million a year through 2010. On the other hand, the tribe was also contracted for the U.S. forest service <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> poisoning program.

When the federal government started an investigation of the tribe's <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> management program, threatening to prosecute tribal employees or agents carrying out the management plan in the ferret reintroduction area, the tribal council passed a resolution in 2008, asking the two federal agencies to remove ferrets, and reimburse the tribe for its expenses for the ferret recovery program.|$|E
25|$|The <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> is well {{adapted to}} predators.

According to them, <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> calls contain specific information {{as to what the}} predator is, how big it is and how fast it is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply that prairie dogs have highly developed cognitive abilities.
