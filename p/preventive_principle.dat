It is also the foundation of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (1989), which sought to minimise the production of hazardous waste and to combat illegal dumping.

50|$|The Responsibility to Protect {{differs from}} {{humanitarian}} intervention in four important ways. First, humanitarian intervention only {{refers to the}} use of military force, whereas R2P is first and foremost a <b>preventive</b> <b>principle</b> that emphasizes a range of measures to stem the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity before the crimes are threatened or occur. The use of force may only carried out as a measure last resort, when all other non-coercive measures have failed, and only when it is authorized by the UN Security Council. This is in contrast to the principle of 'humanitarian intervention', which allows for the use of force as a humanitarian imperative without the authorization of such bodies like the Security Council.|$|E
5000|$|Edwin Chadwick's 1829 article, [...] "Preventive police" [...] in the London Review, {{argued that}} {{prevention}} {{ought to be}} the primary concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice.

[...] In contrast to a deterrent of punishment, a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - [...] "crime doesn't pay".

Alexander used these words for reshaping these subliminal preparations: [...] "The neck to be free, the head to go forward and up, the back to lengthen and widen."

[...] Negative directions (that use Alexander's other <b>preventive</b> <b>principle</b> of [...] "inhibition") have also been found to be effective, because negative directions leave the positive response open-ended.Whichever is used, all [...] "Directing" [...] is suggestively thought, (rather than willfully accomplished.) This is because the neuro-muscular responses to [...] "Directing" [...] often occur underneath one's ability to perceive how they are actually carried out neuro-physiologically and neuro-cognitively. As freedom of expression or movement is the objective, the most appropriate responses cannot be anticipated or expected, only observed and chosen in the moment. Teacher trainees gradually learn to include a constant attending to their lengthening in stature in every movement. It becomes a basis for initiating and continuing every action, every response to stimuli or while remaining constructively at rest.|$|E

40|$|Due to the multifactorial {{etiology}} of the carious process {{and also to}} the dynamic character of the disease, its clinicaltherapeutical management becomes increasingly complex. The strategies applied {{in the management of}} occlusal caries have had several stages, starting with the pre-restorative period, when only few empirical and simple restorative methods were available. The following so-called ”restorative” stage was dominated by the belief of specialists and researchers that the only efficient treatment of carious lesions, whichever their evolution stage, is reconstruction of the odontal functional morphology through obturations. In the last decades of the last century, the <b>preventive</b> <b>principles,</b> supported by {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of action of fluoride, gained more and more space, ”the preventive stage” being now in progress. The major challenge in the management of the carious process is the control of its advance especially through preventive/therapeutical non-operative measures.

40|$|The {{remedial}} {{measures in the}} protection of the environment. This thesis focus on the {{remedial measures}} which belong to legal instruments and create {{an integral part of the}} public law. The public bodies, which are responsible for the enforcement of public interests, are in charge of enforcement of remedial measures to be done. As in the international law, the state is primarily responsible for remedying of damages arising from activities under its jurisdiction. Despite the remedial measures are incorporated into almost all legal enactments, the quality of the legislature is rather low and this legal tool has been beyond the academical interest. The remedial measures represent one of the most important instruments of the environment protection and are closely connected with the principles of the environment protection, i. e. the principle of the sustainable development, the polluter- pays principle, the <b>preventive</b> <b>principle</b> and the principle of the State responsibility. The remedial measures create a part of the measures within the environment protection, which primarily work as subsequent measures and partly as continuous and preventive ones. The remedial measures comprise different kinds of measures, the main goal of which is to remedy changes which are considered to be undesired from the legal and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|SPRUE IS one of {{the most}} {{important}} diseases in the world. It probably disables thousands of adults each year, and it also occurs in children. With the recession of malaria, bowel diseases bulk bigger in tropical health. If money is available to pay for them, there are effective treatments for bacillary dysentery, amoebic dysentery, cholera, typhoid, and intestinal tuberculosis. Worm infestations were never more easily and safely treated. Sprue, however, remains the same difficult disease. The numbers are so great, and the treatment so tedious and imperfect, that the application of some general <b>preventive</b> <b>principle</b> is very desirable. This note is written with India sprue in mind, mainly in Indian soldiers. Caribbean sprue apparently is different in some respects, and, like Indian sprue in Europeans, may be more easily treated. The response to folic acid is better. Sprue is said not to occur in Africa, but Trowell (1960) speaks of protein malnutrition in adults causing loose stools, anorexia and oedema. This may be related, as we see later. We may provisionally define sprue as a disease manifested mainly in the small intestine, with a protracted course, little tendency to natural cure, and a strong tendency to get worse. There is intestinal malabsorption, more or less severe, with anorexia, wasting, loss of strength, anaemia, ankle oedema and glossitis. Apathy and lack of drive are notable. There is usually no fever. The disease is very disabling and may end in death. It is not solely or mainly a disease of Europeans in the tropics. It attacks Indians and Pakistanis too. It is a disease not only of adults, but also of children (Hurst, 1942; Mathew et al., 1964). It is not merely sporadic. ft occurs in epidemics. Since it can be epidemic, it must be environmental, and not due to an innate abnormality of the small intestine. The epidemic of sprue in the 14 th Army during its campaigns on the Indo-Burman frontier, particularly in 1944, was specially instructive. Thousands of Indian troops (young men recently healthy, be it remembered) were evacuated to hospitals because of disabling sprue. Europeans were attacked, but in a smaller number. These events established that sprue could be epidemic, and epidemic i...|$|E

The aim of this strategy is to act preventively against crime and to reduce fear of crime by means of modification of the physical setting in public spaces.

After presenting this concept at the theoretical level I focus on six concrete locations in Prague. On the basis of my field research I investigate if the principles of CPTED are applied in these locations. I also refer to differences between locations, where the <b>preventive</b> <b>principles</b> were applied and locations without use of the CPTED standards. Through the use of questionnaires I try to verify if people really feel safer in places where the principles of CPTED were used.

The prevalence of nosocomial infection is 7 - 10 percent of admitted patients. the present study was carried out to determine the degree of following the <b>preventive</b> <b>principles</b> of nosocomial infections in educational hospitals of Khorramabad city at 2004 - 2005. Material and methods: This descriptive, cross –sectional study covered all wards (23 wards) of educational hospitals expect operation rooms. Physical environment, resources and equitpment and staff practice on infection control were observed. Data were collected by two checklists. Wards status and staff practice were categorized to three levels (good, medium and low). Collected data were analyzed by SPSS V. 11 software. Results: The degree of following infection control principles in most of the personnel’s was medium (53. 7 %) and in hand washing was low (90 %). Wards status about physical environment (47. 83 %), resources and equipment (78. 3 %) were medium level.

40|$|Background: Explosive events {{refer to}} events, either natural or man-made, that occur advertently or accidentally. This article aimed to study {{epidemiology}} of explosive events and investigate the health {{consequences of such}} events. It also aimed to discuss the prevention and management of these events from a healthcare provision viewpoint. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study comprised 2 sections. First, following an extensive review of the literature, a database, containing the related articles was developed. Then, the core research group drafted the first adapted version of the results. Using a Delphi panel methodology, the results were finalized based on the consensus of 11 experts. Results: Terrorist explosion {{is the most common}} type and of ever-growing explosions worldwide. It accounts for the largest proportion of casualties caused by man-made events. Health consequences of explosions can be classified into physical, mental, and social ones, which can appear immediately or a long time after the event and affect individuals, families, and societies. Conclusion: Because of the wide range and adverse impacts of explosions, healthcare authorities and staff should have a good grasp of <b>preventive</b> <b>principles,</b> as well as protection and management of explosion sites. Besides they have to be familiar with treating the injured. It is recommended that training courses and simulated explosive events be designed and run by the healthcare sector. ...|$|R
40|$|Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a {{frequent}} cause of morbidity following surgical procedures. Gram-positive cocci, particularly staphylococci, cause {{many of these}} infections, although Gram-negative organisms are also frequently involved. The risk of developing a SSI {{is associated with a}} number of factors, including aspects of the operative procedure itself, such as wound classification, and patient-related variables, such as preexisting medical conditions. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) {{plays an important role in}} reducing SSIs, especially if patient-related risk factors for SSIs are present. The main components of antimicrobial prophylaxis are: timing, selection of drugs and patients, duration and costs. Compliance with these generally accepted <b>preventive</b> <b>principles</b> may lead to overall decreases in the incidence of these infections. Ideally the administration of the prophylactic agent should start within 30 minutes from the surgical incision. The duration of the AP should not exceed 24 hours for the majority of surgical procedures. The shortest effective period of prophylactic antimicrobial administration is not known and studies have demonstrated that post-surgical antibiotic administration is unnecessary. Furthermore, there were no proven benefits in multiple dose regimens when compared to single-dose regimens. The choice of an appropriate prophylactic antimicrobial agent should be based primarily on efficacy and safety. Broad spectrum antibiotics should be avoided due to the risk of promoting bacterial resistance. Cephalosporins are the most commonly used antibiotics in surgical prophylaxis; specifically, cefazolin or cefuroxime are mainly used in the prophylaxis regimens for cardio-thoracic surgery, vascular surgery, hip or knee arthroplasty surgery, neurosurgical procedures and gynecologic and obstetric procedures. A review of the prophylactic regimens regarding the main surgical procedures is presented...|$|R
40|$|Health, as {{a general}} topic and {{as one of the}} {{principle}} human requirements in all societies, recently has been apt to great environmental and social changes. So as the aforementioned societies depending on their facilities, and development in economics and human well-being, go through different stages of epidemiological transition and in each phase of this transition will face various necessities. Nowadays developed societies, entering the final phases of this transition, are going to control non-communicable diseases and their risk factors, so as health indices and statistics show this significant reduction. Reciprocally, developing countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran are faced with a lot of diseases and their related risk factors. The rapid economic, social and cultural growth of these societies, which is accompanied by increased population and life expectancy, has caused a considerable population of these countries to reach to the age of suffering from non- communicable diseases. On the other hand, great social changes have led to the appearance of such risk factors as smoking, immobility, obesity, hypertension, and so on. Increased costs of health care services accompanied by increased cost which is paid by people; known as out of pocket; are unavoidable outcomes of this unordinary phenomenon.

40|$|Three main <b>preventive</b> <b>principles</b> against {{milk fever}} were {{evaluated}} in this literature review, and {{the efficacy of}} each principle was estimated {{from the results of}} controlled investigations. Oral calcium drenching around calving apparently has a mean efficacy of 50 %– 60 % in terms of milk fever prevention as well as prevention of milk fever relapse after intravenous treatment with calcium solutions. However, some drenches have been shown to cause lesions in the forestomacs. When using the DCAD (dietary cation-anion difference) principle, feeding rations with a negative DCAD (measured as (Na + K) – (Cl + S)) significantly reduce the milk fever incidence. Calculating the relative risk (RR) of developing milk fever from controlled experiments results in a mean RR between 0. 19 and 0. 35 when rations with a negative versus positive DCAD are compared. The main drawback from the DCAD principle is a palatability problem. The principle of feeding rations low in calcium is highly efficient in milk fever prevention provided the calcium intake in the dry period is kept below 20 g per day. Calculating the relative risk (RR) of developing milk fever from controlled experiments results in a very low mean RR (between 0 and 0. 20) (daily calcium intake below versus above 20 g/d). The main problem in implementing the low-Ca principle is difficulties in formulating rations sufficiently low in calcium when using commonly available feeds. The use of large doses of vitamin D metabolites and analogues for milk fever prevention is controversial. Due to toxicity problems and an almost total lack of recent studies on the subject this principle is not described in detail. A few management related issues were discussed briefly, and the following conclusions were made: It is important to supply the periparturient cow with sufficient magnesium to fulfil its needs, and to prevent the dry cows from being too fat. Available information on the influence of carbohydrate intake, and on the effect of the length of the dry period and prepartum milking, is at present insufficient to include these factors in control programmes. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis was elaborated on {{the theme}} Nursing care at women with relapsing inflammation of the urinary bladder. It is a very current and discussed topic because every woman encountered the inflammation of the urinary bladder {{at least once in}} her life. In case of undergoing the infection of the urinary bladder there is a very high risk of relapses. Together with respiratory inflammations the infection of the urinary bladder belong to the most common infections in general. A large percentage of women suffer from inflammations of the urinary bladder repeatedly and they have even several attacks per year. Nursing care, awareness and education are the integral part while contact with a woman coming to the ambulatory surgery with the infection of the urinary bladder. It is very important to give information and put emphasis on compliance with <b>preventive</b> <b>principles</b> which have an irreplaceable place in preventing relapses. The bachelor thesis is divided into two parts, theoretical and empirical part. The theoretical part deals with characteristic of the inflammation of the urinary bladder. There is elaborated in detail a chapter preventive measures where are described in depth preventive procedures of prevention of the relapsing inflammations of the urinary bladder. There is described nursing care for women with the inflammation of the urinary bladder and there are presented several nursing diagnoses which can occur at women. In the bachelor thesis two aims were set. The first aim was to determine if patients are satisfied with information on their disease and the second aim if the disease restricts patients in social life. Five hypotheses were set. First hypothesis - repeated relapses of the inflammation of the urinary bladder restrict women in work process. Second hypothesis - repeated relapses of the inflammation of the urinary bladder restrict women in their sexual life. Third hypothesis - repeated relapses of the inflammation of the urinary bladder eliminate women from social life. Fourth hypothesis awareness of patients in this area is not sufficient. Fifth hypothesis women with relapsing inflammation of the urinary bladder do not respect regime measures. To verify hypotheses a quantitative research inquiry was used. Results of the inquiry confirmed the first hypothesis when almost 80 % of women have to be unable to work. The second hypothesis was also confirmed - 69 % of women mentioned a limitation in their sexual life. The third hypothesis, the fact that women feel to be restricted in social life was also confirmed. The hypothesis number four was confirmed too: awareness of patients in this area is not sufficient. From the research inquiry arises that almost a half of patients respects only some preventive measures. For the research inquiry there was used a quantitative method of data collection by means of non-standardized anonymous questionnaire for women affected by relapsing inflammation of the urinary bladder. Questionnaires were designated for women attending urological and gynaecological ambulatory surgery in the University Hospital Plzeň and in the České Budějovice Hospital. Research inquiry was realised from January 2014 to March 2014. There were distributed 150 questionnaires and 120 questionnaires were used for final processing because of elimination of incomplete or completely empty questionnaires.

40|$|A {{principle}} of extended producer’s {{responsibility in the}} law of waste management pursues the following aims of the waste management: 1) the maximum decrease {{in the amount of}} waste in any type of business and human existence, 2) the immediate reuse of production waste in a manufacturing process, 3) recovery of raw materials from collected waste, 4) application of processes to dispose of waste, 5) orderly waste storage ensuring the least damage to the environment. The overriding objective of this principle is application of legal instruments encouraging producers to undertake activities which will: prevent production of waste, decrease the level of using materials and energy at every stage of a product life cycle and encourage to introduce changes in the phase of a product design and during its manufacture.

The challenge of imparting these principles in either undergraduate or postgraduate medical education has, however, {{not been fully}} met. The necessary skills are provided comprehensively by preventive medicine residency programs, but {{at the expense of}} clinical training.

The report {{examines}} whether experts affect the outcome of the legislation. As Lømmelpakken has been criticised for violating the rule of law, the report examines how the rule of law was considered in the hearing statements and whether this was taken into consideration in the debate in the Parliament. The hearing statements were categorised into themes guided by the core theme: predictability of the law. The themes found were: obscure rule of law, the separation of the powers, <b>preventive</b> detentions, the <b>principle</b> of legality and the principle of proportionality. Furthermore two themes occurred during the coding of the hearing statements: unintended affects and judicial political aspects. Thereafter it was investigated whether the debate in the Parliament reflected the hearing statements. The conclusion was that experts did not affect the outcome of the legislation. On the contrary, the politicians affect the outcome in close cooperation with the police. At the same time the notion of rule of law is not used in its judicial sense, it is equated with security where the citizen is protected against “the other” rather than against interventions from the state. One could argue that the state of Denmark is slowly, but steadily, moving away from a constitutional state toward a police state...|$|R
40|$|Internet level- 5 {{protocols}} {{are defined}} by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Some of these specifications were developed long before the need for mobile support. As a consequence they are extremely solid but not flexible enough when used in the desktop environment and fail to deliver when ported onto mobile handsets. In this thesis I investigate the level- 5 protocols in particular, in order to analyze, understand better and enhance their performance. First {{we take a look}} at Mobile Services and Mobile Networks. I study how Packet Data services are handled and how a communication protocol can affect their behaviour and performance. Then I discuss the Internet Level- 5 protocols and focus on their main characteristics. Finally I develop a model for Protocol Performance Measurements. The model addresses the level- 5 protocols but it can also be used for lower layers as well. Ultimately I used the model in order to analyze one of the most important use cases on IETF’s agenda – Presence. This was done by conducting observations in the real, mobile environment, upon the developed model’s application. I showed how this model can be used in order to measure the Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) protocol suite performance. In the thesis it is also shown how the same model can be used in order to prove the benefits of a new IETF proposal. The theoretical concepts utilized in this thesis belong to the classical knowledge of computation science. The basic automaton, the Finite State Machine, was semantically extended and used to model the dynamic behaviour of communication protocols. Furthermore, its enhanced version, the Finite State Protocol (FSP), provides metrics that can be used as indicators for the system’s dynamic/evolutionary behaviour and for the communication protocols’ performance. This thesis work has been based on ISO definitions on quality concepts, and it, in particular, creates new knowledge by associating protocols’ effectiveness with design quality, and by proving that other quality attributes - such as reliability and resilience – can be formally enhanced. This can start from the very early stages of the mobile software development as <b>preventive</b> maintenance <b>principles</b> indicate.

40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the exposure to}} electric fields and magnetic fields of non-ionizing radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum (15 Hz to 100 kHz) in the dwellings of children from the Spanish Environment and Childhood-"INMA" population-based birth cohort. The study sample was drawn from the INMA-Granada cohort. Out of 300 boys participating in the 9 - 10 year follow-up, 123 families agreed to the exposure assessment at home and completed a specific ad hoc questionnaire gathering information on sources of non-ionizing radiation electric and magnetic fields inside the homes and on patterns of use. Long-term indoor measurements were {{carried out in the}} living room and bedroom. Survey data showed a low exposure in the children's homes according to reference levels of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection but with large differences among homes in mean and maximum values. Daytime electrostatic and magnetic fields were below the quantification limit in 78. 6 % (92 dwellings) and 92. 3 % (108 dwellings) of houses, with an arithmetic mean value (± standard deviation) of 7. 31 ± 9. 32 V/m and 162. 30 ± 91. 16 nT, respectively. Mean magnetic field values were 1. 6 lower during the night than the day. Nocturnal electrostatic values were not measured. Exposure levels were influenced by the area of residence (higher values in urban/semi-urban versus rural areas), type of dwelling, age of dwelling, floor of the dwelling, and season. Given the greater sensitivity to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields of children and following the precautionary <b>principle,</b> <b>preventive</b> measures are warranted to reduce their exposure...|$|R
40|$|During 2012, the USDHHS’s Health Resources and Services Administration funded 12 {{accredited}} {{preventive medicine}} residencies to incorporate an evidence-based integrative medicine curriculum into their training programs. It also funded a national coordinating {{center at the}} American College of Preventive Medicine, known as the Integrative Medicine in Preventive Medicine Education (IMPriME) Center, to provide technical assistance to the 12 grantees. To help with this task, the IMPriME Center established a multidisciplinary steering committee, versed in integrative medicine, whose primary aim was to develop integrative medicine core competencies for incorporation into preventive medicine graduate medical education training. The competency development process was informed by central integrative medicine definitions and <b>principles,</b> <b>preventive</b> medicine’s dual role in clinical and population-based prevention, and the burgeoning evidence base of integrative medicine. The steering committee considered an interdisciplinary integrative medicine contextual framework guided by several themes related to workforce development and population health. A list of nine competencies, mapped to the six general domains of competence approved by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, was operationalized through an iterative exercise with the 12 grantees {{in a process that}} included mapping each site’s competency and curriculum products to the core competencies. The competencies, along with central curricular components informed by grantees’ work presented elsewhere in this supplement, are outlined as a roadmap for residency programs aiming to incorporate integrative medicine content into their curricula. This set of competencies adds to the larger efforts of the IMPriME initiative to facilitate and enhance further curriculum development and implementation by not only the current grantees but other stakeholders in graduate medical education around integrative medicine training...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{chance of}} an {{influenza}} pandemic {{is real and}} clinicians should keep themselves informed about the rationale and science behind <b>preventive</b> and therapeutic <b>principles</b> relating to an (impending) influenza pandemic. Discussion Vaccination is considered the best prevention {{in case of a}} pandemic threat and first choice to contain the impact of a pandemic. Pending the availability of an effective pandemic vaccine, antivirals are likely the only effective agents for prevention and treatment. When an influenza pandemic is impending, all interventions aim to prevent people becoming infected and to suppress replication and transmission of the virus as much as possible. Antivirals will be prescribed to patients with laboratory confirmed pre-pandemic influenza as well as to their contacts (post-exposure prophylaxis) which may delay development of or even prevent a pandemic. During a manifest influenza pandemic, however, there is large-scale spreading of the influenza virus. Therefore, preventive use of antivirals is less efficient to prevent transmission. Delaying the pandemic is then important in order to prevent exhausting public health resources and disruption of society. Thus, during a manifest pandemic everyone with influenza symptoms should receive antivirals as quickly as possible, regardless of virological confirmation. To ensure optimal effectiveness of antivirals and to minimize development of drug resistant viral strains, the use of antivirals for annual influenza should be restrictive. The crucial position of family physicians during an (impending) influenza pandemic necessitates the development of primary health care guidelines on this topic for all countries. Summary Family physicians will {{play a key role in}} assessing and treating victims of a new influenza virus, and in reassuring the worried well. We outline various possible interventions in the event of an impending and a manifest influenza pandemic, such as non-medial measures, prescription of antivirals, and vaccination, and emphasize the need for pandemic influenza preparedness. </p...|$|R
40|$|Health {{policy in}} the UK is going through {{significant}} changes. At {{the heart of the}} transformation is a dedicated focus on public health. The new primary-care-based health system will not only be premised on a specialist public health workforce, but also on broader based public-health-oriented health professionals. Within primary care, widening the foundation of health professionals with public health competencies suggests that higher education bodies will need to adapt their curricula to an approach that highlights population-based health <b>principles,</b> <b>preventive</b> philosophy, and public health concepts and methods. The first part of this paper describes the mapping of the public health content of healthcare curricula at one university in England, based on the 10 public health standard areas of competencies of the Faculty of Public Health Medicine. The second part examines, through the findings of a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis, the factors that advocates for a public-health-oriented educational strategy must examine before embarking on the instigation and development of public health concepts in the healthcare curricula. The aspects that necessitate consideration include strengths such as the prevailing policy, market forces, commitment, and motivation to the effort, and the availability of resources, information and external contacts. Features such as political drive and advocacy, interest in the education debate, collaborative links through joint working and partnerships, and ongoing internal reforms and restructuring could all act as opportunities. However, resistance and anxiety are to be expected, the operationalization of the effort and empowerment of those leading it need to be thought about, and issues of control and interests are critical. The presence of conflicting priorities and competition or the lack of vision and directives, or uncertainty about change, could act as threats and barriers to the effort. If shifting the 'traditional' healthcare curricula to a more 'innovative' public-health-oriented one is to be a success, administrators of educational change will need to take into account a 'melange' of factors and stakeholders involved in a gradual and incremental process...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho de dissertação do Mestrado em Direito Negocial na área de concentração em processo civil da Universidade Estadual de Londrina estuda as tutelas de urgência compostas pela tutela cautelar dos arts. 798 e seguintes; e a tutela antecipada do art. 273, I, todos do Código de Processo Civil, ambas com finalidade preventiva para afastar a iminência de risco de dano. As tutelas em apreço têm características próprias as quais são objeto da discussão em capítulos específicos. O estudo particularizado das mesmas permite fixar melhor a identidade dos institutos, bem como as características que as distanciam. A tutela cautelar visa proteger o processo com vistas a garantir a utilidade e eficácia do provimento final. A tutela antecipada objetiva tutelar o direito mesmo, esta antecipa os efeitos práticos da sentença. Nesse sentido, a primeira prioriza a prevenção do dano, ao processo, a segunda, ao direito propriamente dito. Essa estreita relação entre as tutelas cautelar e antecipada é objeto de estudo do trabalho que pontua suas semelhanças e diferenças. Verifica-se certo embaraço quanto à sua aplicação diante do caso concreto. O Estado-juiz, no monopólio da Justiça, regulador das relações sociais deve estar atento à legislação para previsão de mecanismos processuais que entreguem uma resposta a tutela jurisdicional pretendida. Nesse mote de questões, com enfoque para as medidas preventivas, foi disciplinado o princípio da fungibilidade no art. 273, § 7 º, do Código de Processo Civil para o auxílio dos operadores do Direito quanto às tutelas urgentes, para sua melhor aplicação no sistema processual civil. The {{purpose of}} this Master?s Dissertation in Business Law {{in the area of}} Civil Procedures at Londrina State University studies the urgency {{protective}} measures consisting of the provisional protective measure in article 798 and following articles; and the anticipated protective measure in article 273, I, all from the Code of Civil Procedures; both protective measures have the preventive purpose of removing the risk of damage. Such preventive measures have their own characteristics, which are the object of discussion in specific chapters. The detailed study of such protective measures enables a better characterization of their identity, as well as to identify their differences. The provisional protective measure seeks to protect the legal process in order to guarantee the utility and effectiveness of the final sentence. The anticipated protective measure seeks to protect the right being discussed itself, by anticipating the practical effects of the sentence. Thus, the first has as its priority the prevention of damage to the process, and the second has as its priority the protection of the right itself. The narrow relationship between provisional and anticipated protective measures is the {{purpose of this}} study, which highlights their similarities and their differences. It was observed that there {{is a certain amount of}} confusion in their application in specific cases. The State, by the Department of Justice, which rules social relations, must attend to legislation so as to provide procedural mechanisms that offer suitable responses to the intended jurisdictional protective measure. Due to such issues, focusing on <b>preventive</b> measures, the <b>principle</b> of Fungibility was created in article number 273, paragraph number 7, in the Code of Civil Procedures, in order to assist legal staff concerning urgency protective measures, for a more appropriate application in the civil procedural system...|$|R
