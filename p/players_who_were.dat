50|$|Where goals {{resulting}} from penalties <b>are</b> concerned, the <b>player</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> fouled {{in the area}} receives an assist point (unless, that <b>is,</b> the <b>player</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> fouled subsequently executes the penalty himself).|$|R
5|$|All {{unprotected}} MLB {{and minor}} league players were eligible except those chosen in the amateur drafts of 1991 or 1992 and <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> 18 or younger when signed in 1990. <b>Players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> free agents after the 1992 season were {{not eligible for}} selection in the draft. The Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins, however, were not restricted in offering contracts to free agents. The Rockies signed their first free agent, Andrés Galarraga, to a one-year contract {{the day before the}} expansion draft.|$|E
5|$|Appearance {{and goal}} totals only include matches in La Liga, which was first {{established}} in 1928, <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> only active before then are included for their notability. Substitute appearances are included.|$|E
5|$|Major League Soccer {{clubs are}} allowed {{a roster of}} 28 players {{at any one time}} during the MLS season. <b>Players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> {{contracted}} to the club but never played a regular season MLS game are not listed.|$|E

50|$|To reduce injuries, any {{offensive}} <b>player</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> {{lined up}} in the backfield before the snap cannot chop block a defensive <b>player</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> already engaged above the waist by another offensive player.|$|R
50|$|As {{an example}} of the concept in action, <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> drafted by Major League Baseball teams as shortstops {{are far more likely to}} {{ultimately}} end up at a different position than <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> drafted as first basemen.|$|R
5|$|Several older star <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> left unprotected, {{including}} Danny Tartabull, Jack Morris, and Shawon Dunston, {{were not}} selected {{due to their}} high salaries and advanced age. Based {{on the results of}} the expansion draft, the Marlins were projected to have a higher payroll in 1993 than the Rockies. The Rockies' payroll appeared to be $4 million, less than what the Marlins would pay Bryan Harvey.|$|E
5|$|The OS X and Windows {{versions}} of the game were subject to harsh criticism from <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> expecting a high definition remake of the original 1998 Colin McRae Rally rather than a port of the mobile game. Acting {{in response to the}} negative reaction, Codemasters updated the product's description on Steam to clarify previous misunderstandings and offered refunds to customers for a period of time.|$|E
5|$|This list only {{covers the}} (West) Germany {{national}} team—the {{team of the}} DFB (German Football Association). It includes all players with 20 or more appearances, or 10 or more goals, for the German team, and all capped <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> in the squad for a World Cup or European Championship finals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Players</b> <b>who</b> have <b>been</b> {{substituted}} for may {{return to the}} game under certain conditions, though a <b>player</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> removed as pitcher may not return to pitch.|$|R
50|$|A {{strategy}} for trading where the optimal scenario is to trade away <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> outperforming their projected performance or are getting lucky and to acquire <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> under-performing {{and can be}} reasonably expected to perform better. An {{essential part of the}} strategy is to make sure to acquire a <b>player</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> more skilled than the one being traded away. Buying low and selling high is not useful if the players are of equal value or the one being acquired is less skillful.|$|R
50|$|<b>Players</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{eligible}} {{to play in}} the conference <b>are</b> those <b>who</b> have <b>been</b> competed in a collegiate league, enrolled freshmen, and transferees who have completed their residency period. All teams are mandatory to add two guest players for each squad, including <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still undergoing residency period.|$|R
5|$|A double-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in two of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. The most common double-double combination is points and rebounds, followed by points and assists. Double-doubles are fairly common in the NBA. During the 2008–09 season, 69 <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> eligible for leadership in the main statistical categories recorded at least 10 double-doubles during the season.|$|E
5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E
5|$|All five <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> charged pleaded {{no contest}} to the charges. On September 23, 2005, Artest, Jackson, and O'Neal were all sentenced to one year on probation, 60 hours of {{community}} service, a $250 fine, and anger management counseling. A week later, Harrison received the same sentence, and on October 7, 2005, Johnson, the last player to be charged, received a similar sentence (he was ordered to serve 100 hours of community service).|$|E

5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group of <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities {{in his role as}} a selector.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, {{tensions}} sometimes arose {{between the}} senior <b>players,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Davidson tended {{to abstain from}} alcohol. Teammate Ian Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded at an average speed of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers. In the end, the young players had {{to the majority of}} the fielding as their older colleagues were often still intoxicated during matches.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} period, the game was {{paused for a moment}} of silence in memory of four Swift Current Broncos <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> killed when their team bus crashed in Saskatchewan five days previous. There was a drop in {{intensity}} in the five minutes of play that followed. However, just after the six-minute mark, following a minor scuffle that sent two players from each team to the penalty box, the teams resumed shoving and slashing at each other. Each team also scored a goal, giving Canada a 4–2 lead halfway through the game.|$|E
5|$|Faced with dwindling attendances, the Kilcoynes {{decided to}} starve {{the club and}} sold off senior <b>players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> {{replaced}} by junior footballers. On a tour of Japan in 1975, Mick Meagan and Theo Dunne’s young side defeated the Japanese national team 3–2 in front of 60,000 spectators at the Olympic Stadium, but that victory was the highlight of a season that saw the team finish bottom {{of the table and}} re-apply for admission into the League of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Players</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> {{eligible}} {{for the first time}} who were not included on the ballot were: Paul Abbott, Andy Ashby, Danny Bautista, Darren Bragg, Brian Boehringer, Dave Burba, Greg Colbrunn, Mike Fetters, Brook Fordyce, Karim García, Tom Goodwin, Ricky Gutiérrez, Jimmy Haynes, Sterling Hitchcock, Curt Leskanic, Josías Manzanillo, Brent Mayne, Mark McLemore, Scott Service, Chris Stynes, Scott Sullivan, Todd Van Poppel, John Vander Wal, Fernando Viña, and Turk Wendell.|$|E
