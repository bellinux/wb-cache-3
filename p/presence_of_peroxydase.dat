40|$|The {{improved}} method <b>of</b> <b>peroxydase</b> reaction {{for human}} leukocyte analysis was studied comparing with the recommended clinical laboratory methods. This new method ”Benzidine-Zinc Method” differs from {{others in the}} pretreatment with ZnSO_ 4 solution, although it principally depends on the oxydation of benzidine by the peroxyde-peroxydase system. The main procedures of this method are following in order, fixation with 10 % formalin-alcohol, Giemsa staining, 1 % ZnSO_ 4 treatment and the benzidine-peroxide reaction lastly. The specificity of this reaction to leukocyte peroxydase was confirmed by careful comparison {{with the results of}} Sato-Sekitani's and Mc Junkin's methods. It is found that this method is more excellent at three points. First, the reaction products in blood cells are observable very clearly, that is intense blue in neutrophils, yellowish brown in acidophils and faint blue in monocytes. Secondly, identification of blood cell types is very easy according to per-staining wiith Giemsa solution. Thirdly, red corpuscles and blood platatelets are well preserved, and the pseudo-peroxydase reaction in red cells is negrigible. This method was applied to some Patients with leukemia and others, and the results obtained were discussed. Thus this ”Benzidine-Zinc Method” <b>of</b> <b>peroxydase</b> reaction seems to be reliable and excellent for clinical laboratory use...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} were to add {{information}} on the genetic structure of Cola sp. and to verify the possibility of classifying Cola sp. entries based on isoenzyme traits. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was employed to study the isoenzyme variation <b>of</b> <b>peroxydase,</b> polyphenoloxydase and amylase in forty nine accessions of three Cameroonian Cola species (Cola acuminata, Cola nitida and Cola anomala). Band frequencies were calculated for each entry and for each isoenzyme system. The intrapopulation variation was estimated by Shannon-Weaver (H`) diversity index. Based on the matrix of band frequencies and standardised data, the interpopulation variation was examined by cluster analysis. A total of 14 bands with frequency values ranging from 0 to 1 were observed including 12 polymorphic and monomorphic. The average value of H` estimated for each entry range from 0. 07 to 0. 63 suggesting that Cola sp. entries showed a wide polymorphism for all the enzyme systems being tested.

The second objective was to evaluate the browning capacity of the grape must during the alcoholic fermentation stage and in the resulting wine. During the alcoholic fermentation,the activity of the oxidative enzymes was reduced, thus the enzymatic activity <b>of</b> the <b>peroxydase</b> decreased by approximately 60 % of the initial activity, the enzymatic activity of the tyrosinase decreased by approximately 40 % of the initial enzymatic activity and the enzymatic activity of the laccase decreased by approximately 40 % of the initial enzymatic activity.

The enzymatic activity of the tyrosinase decreased by 25 - 60 % of the initial enzymatic activity. The enzymatic activity <b>of</b> the <b>peroxydase</b> was reduced appreciatively by 10 % of the initial enzymatic activity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{detection}} of low virus concentrations in biological matrices, especially stool samples, is facing significant limitations {{as far as}} common diagnostic methods (enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)) are considered. Here {{the development of a}} new immuno real-time PCR (iPCR) is described and its performance in the {{detection of}} human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in spiked stools is compared with those of ELISA and qPCR assays. For the iPCR, detection of the sandwich formed by the complexation of capture antibody-antigen-detection antibody was performed by qPCR thanks to the substitution <b>of</b> <b>peroxydase</b> by a chimeric DNA. This modification increased the detection sensitivity 200 -fold compared to ELISA. The direct qPCR results revealed that only 0. 3 – 9. 5 % of the spiked HAdV were detectable, resulting from important losses of DNA occurring at the extraction step. This step was not necessary in the iPCR workflow, avoiding this drawback. The losses of viral particles occurred at the elution step from the stool only. The recovery rate of the iPCR was thus better and ranged between 21 and 54 %. As a result, iPCR enabled the detection of lower virus concentrations in stool samples compared to those detected by ELISA and qPCR. The iPCR could be considered as a ‘hyper sensitive ELISA’ for early detection of HAdV infections, especially in the case of immunocompromised patients after haematopoietic stem cell transplant...|$|R
