5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E

25|$|An entity (person or a corporation) may be {{compelled}} to produce documentary evidence {{in accordance with the}} subpoena powers of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 as applied by Bankruptcy Rule 9016. The United States Bankruptcy Court has powers to compel <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> from a non-debtor corporation or person concerning transactions involving the debtor corporation or person. <b>Production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> can be challenged as being burdensome. Assets diverted to outside corporations or bank accounts/stock portfolios and such other assets as land holdings lie within the power to compel production under subpoena duces tecum. Federal law recognizes no accountant-client privilege. A subpoena duce tecum served pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2004 is not a violation of accountant-client privilege. 11 United States Code section 107 (a) provides that papers filed in cases under the Bankruptcy Code and dockets of the Bankruptcy Courts are public records and are to be open to examination at reasonable times without charge.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{cases and}} some states follow Federal Rule 27 (a) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure {{concerning}} the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> in pretrial discovery, including those pertaining to depositions.

In the Ninth Circuit, interpreting Rule 27 literally, it has been held that a party can simply produce the documents only, and in certain cases, avoid an oral deposition when presented with subpoena duces tecum.|$|E

The Fifth Amendment provides that no person “shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” The Supreme Court has, since 1976, applied the so-called “act-of-production doctrine.” Under this doctrine, a person can invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> only where the very act of producing the documents is incriminating in itself.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{a notice}} {{to a party}} {{deponent}} (a person called to testify in a deposition) may {{be accompanied by a}} request for <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and other tangible things during the taking of a deposition. The notice to produce (literally: [...] "bring these documents with you to the deposition") is served prior to the deposition. This follows the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The method of using a subpoena duces tecum is generally valid only to compel a witness to produce documents and other things {{at the time of the}} deposition. If a deponent is a non-party to the action (not involved directly in the litigation, but wanted for testimony), <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> can be compelled only through a proper subpoena duces tecum. Depending on the nature of the documents, and their volume, some may be obtained directly, and before deposition under FRCP 34. In cases where a large number of documents are potentially relevant to the hearing, the court may order them to be produced prior to the deposition. This forms a part of legal discovery and allows parties involved time to review them prior to the deposition or other hearing.|$|E

2500|$|Counterfeit {{money is}} {{imitation}} currency produced without the legal sanction {{of the state}} or government. Producing or using counterfeit money {{is a form of}} fraud or forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as money itself. Plated copies (known as Fourrées) have been found of Lydian coins which are thought to be among the first western coins. [...] Before the introduction of paper money, the most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or silver. A form of counterfeiting is the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. During World War II, the Nazis forged British pounds and American dollars. Today some of the finest counterfeit banknotes are called Superdollars because of their high quality and likeness to the real U.S. dollar. There has been significant counterfeiting of Euro banknotes and coins since the launch of the currency in 2002, but considerably less than for the U.S. dollar.|$|E

[...] Once this was accomplished, the subsequent proceeding under the bill would be carried out as if there was a legitimate writ. [...] By the 15th century, the bill would typically pray that a subpoena should be issued to secure the appearance and examination of the defendant. [...] At the bottom of the bill were the names of the pledges to prosecute. [...] These were similar to the bills issued by the Court of Eyre. [...] Those subpoenas issued in Chancery at the time of Henry VI of England were required to have a pledge attached. [...] Statute at that time prohibited the issue of a writ of subpoena until the plaintiff had found sureties to satisfy the defendant's damages if he did not prevail in his case. [...] When the defendant appeared, both the plaintiff and his witnesses, and the defendant and any witnesses which he might produce, were examined by the Chancellor. [...] <b>Production</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> could be demanded via subpoena duces tecum. [...] It has been suggested that the writ subpoena was very similar to the bill of Eyre.
