25|$|In July 2006, HKHRM {{submitted}} the second <b>periodic</b> <b>report</b> on the HKSAR of the People’s Republic of China {{in light of}} the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to the United Nations. The report provides a background of the general political structure in Hong Kong and gives an overview of women's substantive rights in Hong Kong. It discusses issues like equality in employment and labour rights, domestic violence in ethnic minority families and split families and right of abode.|$|E
25|$|Iran is a {{signatory}} to {{the convention}} to the elimination of racism. UNHCR found several positive aspects {{in the conduct of}} the Islamic republic with regards to ethnic minorities, positively citing its agreement to absorb Afghan refugees and participation from mixed ethnicities. However, the committee while acknowledging that teaching of minority languages and literature in schools is permitted, requested that Iran include more information in its next <b>periodic</b> <b>report</b> concerning the measures it has adopted to enable persons belonging to minorities to have adequate opportunities to learn their mother tongue and to have it used as a medium of instruction.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to state frustration over the workload in preparing these reports, the HRC in July 2010 proposed a new optional reporting procedure called the ‘List of Issues Prior to Reporting’ (LOIPR). The LOIPR system implements a new procedure whereby the committee sends the state {{a list of}} issues to address and the resulting report satisfies the requirements of Article 40 of the ICCPR. This system remains in the pilot stage until 2015 where the procedure will be reviewed “in terms of its practicality, effectiveness and capacity to improve {{the examination of the}} human rights situation in the State parties”. It is intended LOIPR will allow for time to be used more efficiently and provide focus to the report. A further advantage of the procedure will be that a state will not have to submit both a <b>periodic</b> <b>report</b> and LOIPR report (though initial reports will be required). LOIPR remains an optional report and states may elect to continue with the periodic reports system or may be required by the committee to prepare a full report.|$|E
