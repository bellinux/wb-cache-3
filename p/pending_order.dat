5000|$|In the mid-1980s, several Grumman 870 buses {{operated}} by the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) developed cracks in their [...] "A" [...] shaped underframes. This prompted NYCTA President David Gunn to remove the entire fleet from service. Soon, several other companies reported cracked 870 [...] "A" [...] frames. However, the frame issues primarily affected NYCTA 870s and not the 870s owned by the franchisees of the New York City Department of Transportation, which were the first buses built with the problem rectified the following year. NYCTA attempted to get the remainder of its <b>pending</b> <b>order</b> for new buses transferred to GM, but was barred from doing so unless they could prove that the 870s were flawed and unsafe. The buses were eventually returned to Flxible, and were rebuilt and resold to Queen City Metro and New Jersey Transit.

Ironically, NYCTA ordered fifty Metros in 1995, but Flxible closed its doors before the order was produced, and NYCTA obtained the remaining new buses from Orion instead.|$|E

We model, in this paper, {{the situation in which}} not all the ordered items are usable and the supply may contain a fraction of defec-tive items. The number of usable items is a random quantity. We consider a modified (s, S) policy which allows a finite number of <b>pending</b> <b>order</b> to be placed. We assume full back-logging of demands that occurred during stock out periods and that the recent backlogged demand may renege the system after an exponentially distributed amount of time. The limiting distribution of the inventory level is derived and shown to have matrix geometric form. The measures of system performance in the steady state are derived...|$|E

This led to the production process in the company is less than optimal. Based on these problems required a new scheduling method of shortest job first (SJF). Steps of the print production scheduling by this method starts by computing the time a print process, then sort the print processing time from small to large. This method was chosen because it had an average waiting time of most small i. e. by moving the job short of a long job ahead. By scheduling the production expected to increase processing time optimization of production so as to increase consumer services with the work orders more quickly. ...|$|E
