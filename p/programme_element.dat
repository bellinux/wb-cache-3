The document also outlines the implementation plans {{for most of}} the Foci, Activities and Tasks currently within the PAGES remit. The plan first introduces the scope and rationale of PAGES science and explains how PAGES is organized structurally and scientifically to achieve its goals. For all of the palaeosciences relevant to IGBP goals, PAGES has sought to identify and create the organizational structures needed to support continued work and progress. Models intended to predict future environmental changes must, in order to demonstrate their effectiveness, be capable of accurately reproducing conditions known to have occurred in the past. Through the organization of coordinated national and international scientific efforts, PAGES seeks to obtain and interpret a variety of palaeoclimatic records and to provide the data essential for the validation of predictive climate models. PAGES activities include integration and intercomparison of ice, ocean and terrestrial palaeorecords and encourages the creation of consistent analytical and data-base methodologies across the palaeosciences. PAGES has already {{played a crucial role in}} the archiving, management and dissemination of palaeodata. This is fully summarized in the recently published Global Palaeoenvironmental Data Workshop Report (95 - 2). The growing significance of this type of activity is evidenced by the steep increase in consultation and use of the data currently in the public domain and accessible electronically, and by the growing importance of such data for model validation and intercomparison...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Population level child {{measurement}} is {{an established}} international practice. However, {{there is limited}} clarity around the protocol and roles of school-based child measurement programmes (CMPs). Furthermore, questions remain about the positive and adverse outcomes associated with CMPs, {{as well as their}} longer-term sustainability. This research contributes new information by addressing these key unanswered questions. METHODS This thesis describes a three-part, mixed methods research project incorporating: a systematic literature review of existing CMPs; an in-depth case study of England’s National Child Measurement Programme; and the development, pilot implementation and evaluation of a CMP in Guernsey. This research was conducted sequentially; individual components informed and guided subsequent work. RESULTS Routine child measurement is a popular, complex and adaptive practice and offers significant epidemiological value. The principal roles of CMPs are delivery of local prevalence data and assessment of longitudinal trends. However, CMPs are often tasked with additional, diverse and changing roles that do not translate to acknowledged outcomes. Specifically, feedback of individual results represents an unproven <b>programme</b> <b>element.</b> Programme roles can evolve according to political, logistical, or other influences, without consideration of available evidence or wider-reaching implications. There is no evidence of short-term harm from CMPs. Evaluation of the pilot CMP in Guernsey demonstrated that these programmes are perceived to be feasible, acceptable and sustainable. CONCLUSIONS To maximise the broader utility of CMPs, there should be clarity and consistency around their aims, roles and outcomes. Overall, surveillance reflects the preferred programme type. All CMPs should incorporate a standardised, rigorously applied protocol and routine evaluation. These features are essential to ensure the accuracy and comparability of resultant data, as well as programme credibility. Population level CMPs should not function in isolation; instead, they should be integrated into comprehensive strategies for obesity management. This research has important implications for CMP stakeholders and the wider public health arena. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E

A research project in New South Wales, Australia, aimed to discover whether particular support programme(s) for {{children with a}} disability and their families significantly and positively influenced outcomes for the child and family, and if significant positive change did occur, which <b>programme</b> <b>elements,</b> strategies and/or techniques significantly contributed to positive client outcomes. Families in crisis and their support workers participated in the research and were followed and interviewed using quantitative and qualitative methods, at instigation of intervention, immediately post-intervention, at six and at twelve months post-intervention. Measurements of empowerment, emotional support, parent-child involvement, abuse potential, family functioning, symptom reduction, hope, happiness and worker-client alliance were used to gather data, as were qualitative interviews. Analyses indicated that the interventions improved families' levels of well-being and functioning and were significantly successful in reducing child abuse potential.

DESIGN: Data on students' dietary intakes were collected 1 - 4 weeks and 6 months after programme implementation. Teachers filled in a logbook on programme implementation after each lesson. The relationships between changes in students' dietary intakes and completeness of implementation of the programme and of specific <b>programme</b> <b>elements</b> were tested using mixed linear regression analyses. SETTING: Thirteen Dutch prevocational schools. SUBJECTS: Eight hundred and seventy-six of the 1117 participating students and eighteen of the twenty-two participating teachers. RESULTS: Completeness of programme implementation was positively related to an increase in fruit consumption in the short term. Completeness of implementation of food exposure activities and a practical lesson on advertisements were related to an increase in fruit consumption in the short as well as the longer term. No such relationships were found for sweets and breakfast consumption.

40|$|In 2010 ESA {{announced}} the Earthwatch <b>Programme</b> <b>Element,</b> Global Monitoring of Essential Climate Variables, (known as ‘ESA Climate Change Initiative’), to support climate modellers with highly stable, long-term satellitebased products, called Essential Climate Variables (ECV). The primary ECV of the “Fire-Disturbance” {{project is the}} Burnt Area (BA). In order to derive the BA with an accuracy fulfilling the GCOS requirements, improvements in data pre-processing are required for the generation of consistent time series. That is, consistency in the time series of a single sensor {{as well as between}} different sensors shall be achieved, and also including an assessment of the related error budgets. For our improved pre-processing chain we developed generic algorithms for image matching resulting in precise geolocation using the global Landsat Mosaic GLS 2000 as accurate reference. Additionally a global DEM is also used (W 42 database including SRTM and other sources). Land-water masking is performed using a learning algorithm. On one side external static reference data as e. g. the water body mask from SRTM radar data and the GSHHS, on the other side two different pre-classification algorithms are included. Regions with consistence in these three different water masks are assumed as water with high probability and therefore used as training data. On basis of this result the not included remaining water pixels of static mask are checked. At least the not included rest of pre-classifications will be tested with a strong classification algorithm. Cloud and snow/ice detection is performed developing generic parameter as e. g. brightness or flatness together with the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). When thermal bands are available as e. g. for (A) ATSR temperature information is used to discriminate clouds and snow/ice. Furthermore confidence levels for all masks are generated on a per pixel level for every scene. Finally atmospheric correction is performed using the newly developed wide swath ATCOR. Each scene is partitioned into cells guaranteeing that no steps in AOT, water vapour, and surface reflectance can be observed at cell borders. For each cell the radiative transfer functions calculated with the MODTRAN 5 code are updated concerning the sun-cell-sensor geometry by interpolating the information in the atmospheric LUT files. Topographic correction is included, requiring a DEM matched to the scene, and the corresponding derived maps of slope and aspect. For the AOT retrieval dark reference pixels are identified. The water vapour map is calculated on a per-pixel basis for MERIS using the atmospheric pre-corrected differential absorption. The (A) ATSR instruments have no water vapour bands in the reflective part of the spectrum. Thus, a fixed water vapour column can be used because the bands are located in atmospheric window regions. The ozone column for sea level is fixed at 330 DU, decreasing with elevation as defined in the mid-latitude summer atmosphere of the MODTRAN code. The overall processor is embedded in DLR’s CATENA chain allowing a distributed cluster-based calculation. The improved pre-processing is applied to all sensors for the 10 global test sites of the CCI project. Within CATENA, subsequently the Burnt Area products will be generated...|$|E
