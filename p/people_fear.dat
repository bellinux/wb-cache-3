5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
25|$|Employees {{develop and}} {{maintain}} various relationships within organizations. These relationships {{can influence the}} choices employees make about expressing dissent. Employees may feel uncomfortable voicing their dissenting opinions {{in the presence of}} others because they feel the best way to preserve relationships is to keep quiet. Homogeneous groups also place pressure on individuals to conform. Since many <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> being embarrassed in front of their peers, they can easily be lulled into consensus (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|A shark {{attack is}} {{an attack on a}} human by a shark. Every year over 70 attacks are {{reported}} worldwide. Despite their relative rarity, many <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> shark attacks after occasional serial attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and horror fiction and films such as the Jaws series. Out of more than 489 shark species, only three are responsible for a double-digit number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, tiger, and bull. The oceanic whitetip has probably killed many more castaways, but these are not recorded in the statistics.|$|E

500|$|Although {{alternative}} {{options to}} {{doing business with}} China are few for the business sector, many companies large and small, including within the important financial sector, are uneasy about the changing political climate. The head of the one business association in Hong Kong said: [...] "The middle-class, the professionals, even the accountants: people are just freaked out {{about what is going}} on... The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What we have left is our legal system, but <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> that this may be under attack too". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: [...] "The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [...] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong".|$|E
500|$|Duyệt was {{typically}} {{described as a}} stern, hot-tempered but fair man, which made him both feared and respected by people. Many lower-level bureaucrats and military officers were loath {{to speak to him}} directly, as were some higher officials. Some later accounts have portrayed his strict ways in a more negative light. According to the later imperial official Phan Thuc Truc, Duyệt sometimes fatally beat dogs and beheaded senior local officials for no reason. Duyệt was also regarded as an eccentric; he raised 30 members of the Montagnard hill tribes to act as servants, and kept exactly 100 chickens and 100 dogs at his home. Whenever he returned to his official residence after an assignment, he ordered a tiger and 50 dogs to march after him. In 1825, Michel-Duc Chaigneau, the nephew of Gia Long's French military mandarin Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau, visited Gia Định on a government mission and said that Duyệt [...] "has great talent both in battle and administration. <b>People</b> <b>fear</b> him, but he is heartily loved by people here because he is fair." ...|$|E
500|$|McVeigh's {{original}} plan {{had been to}} detonate the bomb at 11:00a.m., but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00a.m. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries—a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis ("Thus always to tyrants", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and [...] "The tree of liberty must be refreshed {{from time to time}} with the blood of patriots and tyrants" [...] (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the Thomas Jefferson slogan, [...] "When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> the government, there is tyranny." [...] Underneath, McVeigh had written, [...] "Maybe now, there will be liberty!" [...] with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.|$|E

500|$|One {{week after}} the {{official}} opening of the ride at Cedar Point, attraction reviewer Brian Krosnick of Theme Park Tourist submitted an online review {{saying that it was}} [...] "truly breathtaking". The review applauded [...] "the inclusion of on-ride audio and such an exemplary lighting package", commenting that it was [...] "more than anyone expected or could've asked for". Krosnick pointed out that, because of the location of the ride beside Lake Erie and the hot summers, the lights on the ride attract massive [...] "clouds" [...] of bugs. He felt the ride cycle might be too short for the type of ride, particularly the time spent at the top. On July 13, 2011, Nick Sim, also from Theme Park Tourist, reviewed the ride at Kings Island and made similar remarks. Los Angeles Times blogger Brady MacDonald complimented the [...] "impressive nighttime spectacular from anywhere in the park". He reported having thoroughly enjoyed the ride at Knott's Berry Farm and said that he would ride it every time he visited the park. Tom Sherer of the Sandusky Register praised Cedar Point's WindSeeker for having one of the best views of the park and commented that it [...] "isn't as extreme as a lot of <b>people</b> <b>fear,</b> unless you’re afraid of heights." [...] He criticized the name WindSeeker, pointing out that the ride closes in high winds. Another reviewer called the view from Knott's Berry Farm's version [...] "simply breathtaking" [...] and urged readers to [...] "get a ride on it as soon as you can". The same reviewer, however, also criticized the choice of music, suggesting that the park should have used [...] "themes from more 'southwestern' films" [...] to fit with the overall theme of the Fiesta Village area. Members of the general public have also applauded the addition.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} religious problems is that <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> having a relationship with God and consequently distance themselves from Him.

[...] "When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> the government, there is tyranny." [...] His remaining speech encouraged the Muslims and other minorities present, {{to be actively involved}} in the political process so they would not have to fear the government, but the government would have to fear them.|$|E

That people who fear death are showing their ignorance, because death {{might be a good}} thing, but that most <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> death as an evil thing, when they cannot possibly know death to be either good or evil.

In his address, he spoke of how [...] "Political leaders can help change the psychological climate which affects the quality of relationships among people." [...] His speech concluded with reflections {{on the importance of}} political process in overcoming differences: [...] "How are fears born? They are born because of differences in tradition and history; they are born because of differences in emotional, political and national circumstances. Because of such differences, <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> they cannot live together. If we are to overcome such fear, a credible and healthy political process must be carefully and painfully developed. A political process that does not aim to change the other or to overcome differences, but that allows each side to live peacefully in spite of their differences." ...|$|E

In this interview, Tatchell makes various counterarguments against Lee's point of view, such as: [...] "How can a young child understand sex and give meaningful consent?", [...] "Perhaps your friends were particularly mature for their age. Most young people are not so sophisticated about sex", [...] "Many people worry that the power imbalance in a relationship between a youth and an adult means the younger person can be easily manipulated and exploited", [...] "Many <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> that making sex easier for under-age teenagers will expose them to dangers like HIV.

In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many <b>people</b> <b>fear,</b> but too much of it. This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them that change is usually for the worse and best avoided." ...|$|E
2500|$|Various {{institutions}} have undertaken zero-tolerance policies, for example, in the military, in the workplace, and in schools, {{in an effort}} to eliminate various kinds of illegal behavior, such as harassment. Proponents hope that such policies will underscore the commitment of administrators to prevent such behavior. Others raise a concern about this use of zero-tolerance policies, a concern which derives from analysis of errors of omission versus errors of commission. Here is the reasoning: Failure to proscribe unacceptable behavior may lead to errors of omission—too little will be done. But zero tolerance may be seen as a kind of ruthless management, which may lead to a perception of [...] "too much being done". If <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> that their co-workers or fellow students may be fired, terminated, or expelled, they may not come forward at all when they see behavior deemed unacceptable. (This {{is a classic example of}} Type I and type II errors.) The Type Two error, where it occurs with respect to zero tolerance, leads to the situation where too stringent a policy may actually reduce reports of illegal behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Also in Sister Outsider is [...] "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" [...] Lorde {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed. [...] Many <b>people</b> <b>fear</b> {{to speak the truth}} because of how it may cause pain, however, one ought to put fear into perspective when deliberating whether to speak or not. [...] Lorde emphasizes that [...] "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger." [...] People are afraid of others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid." [...] People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth.|$|E
