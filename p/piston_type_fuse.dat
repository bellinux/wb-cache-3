40|$|Abstract>> As {{an initial}} step {{to develop a}} liquid {{hydrogen}} pump of <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> operated under cryogenic and high pressure, leakage and piston head shape for the piston pump were discussed with temperature and pressure. As the results, the leakage depended on correlation among density, viscosity, clearance area by the low temperature. In {{order to reduce the}} leakage, {{it was found that the}} air-tightness can be improved by minimizing contact surface between piston and cylinder, and also increasing pressure in-cylinder can reduce piston clearance. Among the proposed <b>piston</b> shapes, D <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> shape had the most air-tightness. D <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> had smaller contact surface than other piston shape and easier expansion of cup shape by pressure.

5000|$|The {{enthalpy}} of vaporization is {{the energy}} required to turn water into the gaseous form when it increases in volume by 1,700 times at standard temperature and pressure; this change in volume can be converted into mechanical work by steam engines such as reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> engines and steam turbines, which are a sub-group of steam engines. <b>Piston</b> <b>type</b> steam engines {{played a central role}} to the Industrial Revolution and modern steam turbines are used to generate more than 80% of the world's electricity. If liquid water comes in contact with a very hot surface or depressurizes quickly below its vapor pressure, it can create a steam explosion. Steam explosions have been responsible for many foundry accidents, and may also have been responsible for much of the damage to the plant in the Chernobyl disaster.|$|R
25|$|The {{manufacturer}} may {{specify the}} voltage drop across the fuse at rated current. There {{is a direct}} relationship between a fuse's cold resistance and its voltage drop value. Once current is applied, resistance and voltage drop of a fuse will constantly grow {{with the rise of}} its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The voltage drop should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications. Voltage drop often is not significant in more traditional wire <b>type</b> <b>fuses,</b> but can be significant in other technologies such as resettable (PPTC) <b>type</b> <b>fuses.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The first {{successful}} drills were the <b>piston</b> <b>type,</b> or [...] "reciprocators." [...] The drill steel piston and chuck moved together and reciprocated. In Leyner's hammer drill the steel was held loosely in a chuck {{attached to the}} cylinder itself, while the piston inside the cylinder reciprocated, striking blows on the blunt end of the drill steel. The hammer drill was lighter, speedier, and used less air than the reciprocating drill.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The water {{hydraulic}} reciprocating {{plunger pump}} driven by linear motor is suitable to deep sea application with high efficiency and variable control. Aiming {{to study the}} principle structure and working characteristics of the pump, two patterns of valve and piston distribution were designed. And the control method and the performance were analyzed by simulation based on the AMESim model. The {{results show that the}} pressure and flow pulsation of <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump are much smaller than the valve type, even though the <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> is large in scale and works at low flow rate. Compared with a valve distribution tri-linear-motor reciprocating plunger pump(VDTLMP), as the flow rate of the piston distribution double linear motor reciprocating plunger pump(PDDLMP) is decreased from 36. 7 L/min to 21. 2 L/min theoretically, the pressure pulsation amplitude is decreased from 46 % to 2 %, and the flow pulsation rate is also decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 007. These results contribute to the research on deep-sea water hydraulic power pack and direct drive pump with high efficiency and energy conservation...|$|R

5000|$|Lucas <b>type</b> <b>fuses</b> {{are used}} in old British-made or {{assembled}} automobiles. The physical length of this ceramic <b>type</b> of <b>fuse</b> is either 1 inch or 1.25 inch, with conical ends. Glass tube fuses have straight ends. Lucas <b>type</b> <b>fuses</b> usually use the same color-coding for the rated current. Lucas fuses have three ratings; the continuous current {{they are designed to}} carry, the instantaneous current at which they will fuse, and the continuous current at which they will also fuse. The figure found on Lucas fuses is the continuous fusing current which is twice the continuous ampere rating that the system should be using; this can be a source of confusion when replacing Lucas fuses with non Lucas fuses. The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube fuse have a different length as compared to the standard US item. The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube fuse is 1 and 5/32" [...] mm long, while the US standard 1/4" [...] glass tube fuse is 1 and 1/4" [...] mm long.|$|R
40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. <b>Piston</b> <b>type</b> pumps are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this type of pump due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump. The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different types of pumps. From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different types of pumps. QC 20121221 </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} floating <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> {{of media}} dispenser {{is based on}} the principle of an inductive pump. This design uses a floating piston housed inside of a cylinder (typically high-grade ferromagnetic stainless steel) and vibrated according to a magnetic pulse generated by a copper coil inside the cylinder and surrounding the piston. Oscillation of the piston {{back and forth in the}} cylinder causes aspiration of fluid into the cylinder at one end followed by ejection from the other end.|$|R

25|$|Diaphragm-type first stages {{are more}} complex and have more {{components}} than the <b>piston</b> <b>type.</b> Their design makes them particularly suited to cold water diving and to working in saltwater and water containing {{a high degree of}} suspended particles, silt, or other contaminating materials, since the only parts exposed to the water are the valve opening spring and the diaphragm, all other parts are sealed off from the environment. In some cases the diaphragm and spring are also sealed from the environment.|$|R
50|$|Multiple-pump {{pneumatic}} {{guns are}} also common. Many pneumatic pellet guns provide {{the ability to}} use BBs as a cheaper alternative to lead shot. Some of these guns have rifled barrels, but the slightly undersized BBs don't swage in the barrel, so the rifling does not impart a significant spin. These are the types of guns that will benefit most from using precision lead BB shot. The pneumatic BB gun can attain much higher velocities than the traditional spring <b>piston</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{splitting}} {{performance is}} very efficient {{in comparison with}} the predrilled hole-making. As the spacing between hole is near to front and side, the number of holes required are quite many. With manual type splitter , the wedge type splitter requires 20~25cm space, while <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> splitter requires 40~50cm.Larger size wedge splitter requires large spacing as much as 50~70cm. Large size piston splitter requires 60~100cm spacing [...] Large size wedge splitter or piston splitter is mounted on a vehicle like excavator.|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm <b>type</b> or the <b>piston</b> <b>type.</b> Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|R
