40|$|This {{contribution}} summarizes {{a presentation}} combining two topics in lattice QCD. Firstly, the gluon propagator in Landau gauge is calculated in quenched QCD {{on a large}} (32 ^ 3 x 64) lattice at beta= 6. 0. New structure seen in the infrared region survives conservative cuts to the lattice data, and serves to exclude a number of models that {{have appeared in the}} literature. Secondly, I report on a recent lattice QCD calculation of the strangeness magnetic moment of the nucleon. The result is G_M^s(0) =- 0. 36 +/- 0. 20. The strangeness Sachs electric mean-square radius was also found to be small and negative.

40|$|The {{formation}} of QGP in heavy ion collisions {{gives us a}} great opportunity for learning about nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. Semiholography provides a new consistent framework to combine perturbative and non-perturbative effects in a coherent way and can be applied to obtain an effective description for heavy ion collisions. In particular, it allows us to include nonperturbative effects in existing glasma effective theory and QCD kinetic theory for the weakly coupled saturated degrees of freedom liberated by the collisions in the initial stages in a consistent manner. We argue why the full framework should be able to confront experiments with only a few phenomenological parameters and present feasibility tests for the necessary numerical computations. Furthermore, we discuss that semiholography leads to a new description of collective flow {{in the form of a}} generalised non-Newtonian fluid. We discuss some open questions which we hope to answer in the near future.

40|$|In {{this article}} we report on a new {{proposal}} to treat the infrared problems of thermal QCD by taking into account explicitly the confining influence of the Gribov horizon. In order to make clear the possible value of such an approach, we briefly review the most important arguments why a straightforward perturbative description of finite-temperature QCD {{is unlikely to be}} successful. From the infrared problems of thermal perturbation theory one can conclude that confinement effects and bound states probably play an important role also in the high-temperature phase. To set the stage we recount the supposed role of the Gribov horizon for confinement, before we turn to the application to finite-temperature theory. In the current approach it has been found that the contributions to the free energy from the explicit inclusion of the horizon begin to set in at order $g^ 6 $ [...] precisely where the infrared problems of thermal QCD lead to a breakdown of ordinary perturbation theory. From the study of observables (free energy, anomaly, bulk viscosity) we also note that for thermodynamic observables the leading order term obtained by such an expansion in the coupling strongly deviates from the more complete numerical solution. This can be regarded as yet another sign for general problems of series expansions in thermal QCD.

In the deep infrared functional methods extract a one-parameter family of solutions generically showing a massive behavior referred to as 'decoupling' but also including the so-called 'scaling' solution with a conformal infrared behavior as a limiting case. We emphasize that the latter cannot be ruled out by technical arguments related to the removal of quadratic divergencies and transversality.

40|$|The {{critical}} baryon {{chemical potential}} for the onset of nuclear matter {{is a function of}} the vacuum mass and the binding energy. Both quantities are affected by an external magnetic field. We show within two relativistic mean-field models - including magnetic catalysis, but omitting the anomalous magnetic moment - that a magnetic field increases both the vacuum mass and the binding energy. For sufficiently large magnetic fields, the effect on the vacuum mass dominates and as a result the critical baryon chemical potential is increased.
