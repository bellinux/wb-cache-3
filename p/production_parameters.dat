This stand-alone system connects directly to the thermoformer and utilizes multiple sensors to record production-run data in real time including air pressure, temperature, tool strain gauge and other specifications. The system sends out multiple warnings and alerts whenever pre-set <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> are compromised during a run. This reduces machine down time, lowers startup time and decreases startup scrap.|$|E
50|$|Very-high-intensity recycle {{aquaculture}} systems (RAS), {{where all}} the <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> are controlled, are being used for high-value species. By recycling it, very little water is used per unit of production. However, the process does have high capital and operating costs. The higher cost structures mean that RAS is only economical for high-value products such as broodstock for egg production, fingerlings for net pen aquaculture operations, sturgeon production, research animals, and some special niche markets like live fish.|$|E
50|$|The {{most often}} studied {{dilemmas}} involve the two players and call them customer and supplier (or buyer-seller). There are also extensions of this simple model: the multiple customers with correlated demand and the multiple suppliers with different <b>production</b> <b>parameters.</b> Multi-echelon extensions are also conceivable, however, sparse in the literature. When the coordination is within {{a supply chain}} (typically a customer-supplier relation), it is called vertical, otherwise horizontal. An example for the latter is when different suppliers of the same customer coordinate their transportation.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in mid-1993, the {{reservoir}} was shut {{in for a}} period of nearly two years and the applied pressure was allowed to drop to essentially zero. In the spring of 1995, the system was re-pressurized and a third continuous circulation run of 66 days was conducted. Remarkably, the <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> observed in the two earlier tests were rapidly re-established, and steady-state energy production resumed at the same level as before. Observations during both the shut-in and operational phases of all these flow-testing periods provided clear evidence that the rock at the boundary of this man-made reservoir had been compressed by the pressurization and resultant expansion of {{the reservoir}} region.|$|E
50|$|Farm {{animals are}} artificially {{selected}} for <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> which sometimes impinge on the animals' welfare. For example, broiler chickens are bred {{to be very}} large to produce the greatest quantity of meat per animal. Broilers bred for fast growth have {{a high incidence of}} leg deformities because the large breast muscles cause distortions of the developing legs and pelvis, and the birds cannot support their increased body weight. As a consequence, they frequently become lame or suffer from broken legs. The increased body weight also puts a strain on their hearts and lungs, and ascites often develops. In the UK alone, up to 20 million broilers each year die from the stress of catching and transport before reaching the slaughterhouse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} two drawbacks {{associated with}} using SOAP RPC to invoke services in service-oriented environments. First, overlapping of <b>parameter</b> <b>production,</b> <b>parameter</b> transmission and service execution is not possible, since all parameters of a service call have to exist prior to service invocation; until all parameters are available, a service caller has to defer service invocation. Second, the XML format of SOAP is not suitable to transfer large binary parameters, because encoding consumes {{a considerable amount}} of time. In this paper, a new approach to invoke web services is presented, which enables post-invocation parameter transmission and efficient transmission of binary parameters, thus enabling the overlapping of <b>parameter</b> <b>production,</b> <b>parameter</b> transmission and service execution to reduce the overall processing time. To realize post-invocation parameter transmission, an extension of WSDL is proposed. It is shown how post-invocation parameter transmission enables the efficient implementation of streambased production/consumption of parameters and pipelining. Furthermore, measurement results are presented demonstrating a noticeable performance gain. I...|$|R

50|$|Anode: Carbon anodes have a {{specific}} situation in aluminium smelting and {{depending on the type}} of anode, aluminium smelting is divided in two different technologies; “Soderberg” and “prebaked” anodes. Anodes are also made of petroleum coke, mixed with coal-tar-pitch, followed by forming and baking at elevated temperatures. The quality of anode affects technological, economical and environmental aspects of aluminium production. Energy efficiency is related to the nature of anode materials, as well as the porosity of baked anodes. Around 10% of cell power is consumed to overcome the electrical resistance of prebaked anode (50-60 μΩm). Carbon is consumed more than theoretical value due to a low current efficiency and non-electrolytic consumption. Inhomogeneous anode quality due to the variation in raw materials and <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> also affects its performance and the cell stability.|$|E
50|$|The {{optimization}} {{of existing}} (production) processes always increases {{the competitiveness of}} the entrepreneur. The implementation of advanced process analysis into existing systems allows {{the performance of the}} plants to be optimized further. On a daily basis sensor technology provides new and improved options for the collection of measuring data. Processing data can consequently be compiled with much higher precision and at shorter intervals. This allows the optimization of <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> such as quality, pieces/minute, reject rate - no matter whether it's anticipatory (e.g. by assessing the products introduced into the process) or downstream (e.g. control {{at the end of each}} process stage). This is where the value of the information becomes most visible. Many production plants are still not yet operating to their performance capabilities. There are many possibilities for process analysis to further improve the quality achieved so far.|$|E
50|$|The {{decreased}} {{health status}} of pigs, {{as a consequence of}} roundworm infection, is reflected in general <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> like daily weight gain, feed conversion efficiency and meat quality. However, in farms with low infection levels, the effect of infection is expected to be minimal and the economical profitability of active Ascaris control can be questioned. It is difficult to determine the economical losses due to parasites that are not lethal. There are numerous interactions between the worm, the host, the presence of other diseases, the production system and many other factors. Recent evaluations of the economical performance of infected pig farms has indicated that the improved feed conversion, increased daily weight gain, lower mortality and better carcass quality act in a synergetic way. Hence, strategic deworming should result in a win-win effect on economic and environmental performances with gross profit margin increases of 3 to 12 euro per average present finisher per year. To distinguish between pig populations that suffer significant economical damage and those that are less affected, we depend on the availability of diagnostic tools to provide us with information on the presence and infection pressure of this parasite on a farm. If interpreted correctly, diagnostic tools can be of use to evaluate the applied control strategies and see whether efforts for parasite control need to be increased or changed.|$|E

40|$|The Neoclassical {{theory of}} {{production}} establishes a dual {{relationship between the}} profit value function of a competitive firm and its underlying production technology. This relationship, usually {{referred to as the}} duality theory, has been widely used in empirical work to estimate <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> without the requirement of explicitly specifying the technology. We analyze the ability of this approach to recover the underlying <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> and its effects on estimated elasticities and scale economies measurements, when data available for estimation features typical realistic problems. We design alternative scenarios and compute the data generating process by Monte Carlo simulations, so as to know the true technology parameters as well as to calibrate the dataset to yield realistic magnitudes of noise. This noise introduced in the estimation by construction prevents duality theory from holding exactly. Hence, the true <b>production</b> <b>parameters</b> may not be recovered with enough precision, and the estimated elasticities or scale economies measurements may be more inaccurate than expected.
