40|$|ABSTRACT. Soybean is a {{self-sufficient}} specie in nitrogen acquisition due {{to their}} efficient association with diazotrophs. Unlike bean, which requires nitrogen supplementation, soybean is not dependent on nitrogen fertilization. This interspecies difference {{may be related to}} the allocation pattern of <b>photosynthates</b> during their growth cycles. Distinct from soybean, common bean cannot maintain their active nodules until the end of their growth cycle due to the unavailability of <b>photosynthates</b> in their roots after flowering. To compare the partitioning of the phytomass in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) species during their ontogenetic cycles, a growth analysis experiment were conducted with Favorita BRS and BRS Pontal varieties, respectively. The results revealed that soybeans keep producing leaves, branches and roots even after flowering, indicating no limitation in the supply of <b>photosynthates</b> to its organs, especially to the roots, where a predominant allocation of <b>photosynthates</b> can favor nodule activity. After flowering in bean plants, allocation preferentially occurs to the pods at the expense of the other organs including the roots, which potentially affects their nodule activity...|$|R
40|$|During the prebloom and bloom stages, no {{movement}} of labeled <b>photosynthates</b> occurred from a shoot of Vitis vinifera L. fed with 14 CO 2, to an adjacent shoot {{on the same}} spur. Movement of labeled assimilates into the unfed shoot was induced when this shoot was sprayed with 2. 89 × 10 − 3 m gibberellic acid during the prebloom stage. During the bloom stage darkening or defoliation of the unfed shoot resulted in the import of labeled <b>photosynthates</b> from the adjacent fed shoot. Similarly, movement of 14 C into an untreated shoot was induced by removing the terminal 7. 5 centimeters and deblossoming the fed shoot. During the berry set stage, translocation of labeled <b>photosynthates</b> from a newly exporting leaf was upwards to the shoot tip, but the direction of movement was reversed by removal of the shoot tip or by darkening or removal of the leaves below the fed leaf. Translocation of <b>photosynthates</b> was predominantly basipetal from a fed leaf near {{the base of the}} shoot during the berry set stage, but upward movement was induced by darkening or defoliation of {{the upper part of the}} shoot...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTrees with {{sufficient}} nutrition {{are known to}} allocate carbon preferentially to aboveground plant parts. Our global study of 49 forests revealed an even more fundamental carbon allocation response to nutrient availability: forests with high-nutrient availability use 58 ± 3 % (mean ± SE; 17 forests) of their <b>photosynthates</b> for plant biomass production (BP), while forests with low-nutrient availability only convert 42 ± 2 % (mean ± SE; 19 forests) of annual <b>photosynthates</b> to biomass. This nutrient effect largely overshadows previously observed differences in carbon allocation patterns among climate zones, forest types and age classes. If forests with low-nutrient availability use 16 ± 4 % less of their <b>photosynthates</b> for plant growth, what are these used for? Current knowledge suggests that lower BP per unit photosynthesis in forests with low- versus forests with high-nutrient availability reflects not merely an increase in plant respiration, but likely results from reduced carbon allocation to unaccounted components of net primary production, particularly root symbionts...|$|R
25|$|The {{ability of}} the same AM fungi to colonize many species of plants has {{ecological}} implications. Plants of different species can be linked underground to a common mycelial network. One plant may provide the <b>photosynthate</b> carbon {{for the establishment of}} the mycelial network that another plant of a different species can utilize for mineral uptake.

25|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} are plant-parasitic nematodes {{from the}} genus Meloidogyne. They exist in soil {{in areas with}} hot climates or short winters. About 2000 plants worldwide are susceptible to infection by root-knot nematodes and they cause approximately 5% of global crop loss. Root-knot nematode larvae infect plant roots, causing the development of root-knot galls that drain the plant's <b>photosynthate</b> and nutrients. Infection of young plants may be lethal, while infection of mature plants causes decreased yield.|$|E
25|$|Fraser {{recorded}} {{the development of}} a single white spruce tree from 1926 to 1961. Apical growth of the stem was slow from 1926 through 1936 when the tree was competing with herbs and shrubs and probably shaded by larger trees. Lateral branches began to show reduced growth and some were no longer in evidence on the 36-year-old tree. Apical growth totalling about 340 m, 370 m, 420 m, 450 m, 500 m, 600 m, and 600 m was made by the tree in the years 1955 through 1961, respectively. The total number of needles of all ages present on the 36-year-old tree in 1961 was 5.25 million weighing 14.25kg. In 1961, needles as old as 13 years remained on the tree.The ash weight of needles increased progressively with age from about 4% in first-year needles in 1961 to about 8% in needles 10 years old. In discussing the data obtained from the one 11 m tall white spruce, Fraser et al. (1964) speculated that if the <b>photosynthate</b> used in making apical growth in 1961 was manufactured the previous year, then the 4 million needles that were produced up to 1960 manufactured food for about 600,000mm of apical growth or 730 g dry weight, over 12 million mm3 of wood for the 1961 annual ring, plus 1 million new needles, in addition to new tissue in branches, bark, and roots in 1960. Added to this would be the <b>photosynthate</b> to produce energy to sustain respiration over this period, an mount estimated to be about 10% of the total annual <b>photosynthate</b> production of a young healthy tree. On this basis, one needle produced food for about 0.19mg dry weight of apical growth, 3mm3 wood, one-quarter of a new needle, plus an unknown amount of branch wood, bark and roots.|$|E
5000|$|The {{partitioning}} {{of these}} sugars depends on multiple {{factors such as}} the vascular connections that exist, the location of the sink to source, the developmental stage, and the strength of that sink. Vascular connections exist between sources and sinks and those that are the most direct have been shown to receive more <b>photosynthates</b> than those that must travel through extensive connections. This also goes for proximity those closer to the source are easier to translocate sugars to. [...] Developmental stage plays a large role in partitioning, organs that are young such as meristems and new leaves have a higher demand, as well as those that are entering reproductive maturity—creating fruits, flowers, and seeds. [...] Many of these developing organs have a higher sink strength. Those with higher sink strengths receive more <b>photosynthates</b> than lower strength sinks. Sinks compete to receive these compounds and combination of factors playing in determining how much and how fast sinks receives <b>photosynthates</b> to grow and complete physiological activities.|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{the numbers}} of tartary {{buckwheat}} leaves decreases source-sink ratios and increases photosynthetic rates {{in a short period}} oftime. This compensating action can not make up for the great loss of the total <b>photosynthates</b> caused by reducing leaves, which decreases the rates of fertilization and fruiting. Removing flowers (inflorescences) increases source-sink ratios, but decreases the photosynthetic rates {{in a short period of}} time, resulting in over supplying <b>photosynthates,</b> and increasing the rates of fertilization and fruiting. During the flowering and fruiting periods, the lack of nutrients is an important factor that limits the rates of fertilization and fruiting...|$|R
30|$|Trade-offs are {{important}} {{for the survival of}} plants in infertile environments, which are common in the Arctic and subarctic. Instead of partitioning all <b>photosynthates</b> to tissues that support growth, slow growing species invest in storage and traits that conserve resources (Grime et al. 1997, Grime 2001, Díaz et al. 2004). Alternatively, plants may trade-off resource allocation between roots and shoots (Tilman 1988). Conifers, including spruce, tend to allocate <b>photosynthates</b> toward belowground biomass when either soil nutrients or water are scarce (Waring 1987, Grossnickle 2000). In some places, positive relationships between aboveground net primary productivity and belowground net primary productivity have been seen, but in boreal forests, there is often a negative relationship (Litton and Giardina 2008). In boreal forests, there is also a negative relationship between the mean annual temperature and total belowground carbon flux, presumably due to changes in resource allocations with increasing nutrient availability caused by rising temperatures (Litton and Giardina 2008). While our experiment focused on aboveground allocation only, as temperature increased, the seedlings showed differences in allocation by habitat type, indicating differences in their growth strategies. Seedlings above treeline increased total <b>photosynthates,</b> thereby increasing in height and the number of needles, perhaps also increasing in belowground biomass. Seedlings near treeline apparently allocated <b>photosynthates</b> mainly toward height and possibly some toward belowground structures, presumably due to lack of nutrient availability as indicated by their low foliar N (Waring 1987, Grossnickle 2000).|$|R

The sporophyte in mosses and liverworts {{consists of an}} unbranched stalk (a seta) bearing a single sporangium or spore-producing capsule. Even when capable of photosynthesis, as in mosses and hornworts, bryophyte sporophytes require additional <b>photosynthate</b> from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and are dependent on the gametophyte for their supplies of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.|$|E

2500|$|Increasing the plant's carbon {{supply to}} the AM fungi {{increases}} uptake and transfer of phosphorus from fungi to plant [...] Likewise, phosphorus uptake and transfer is lowered when the <b>photosynthate</b> supplied to the fungi is decreased.
