His common law-wife Simplicia survived him for over 20 years. A look at his will implies that, besides a life insurance policy payout and two <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land in the Dominican Republic, Betances died almost in poverty.|$|E
5|$|Development in Canberra {{has been}} closely {{regulated}} by government, both through planning processes {{and the use}} of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land.

50|$|When a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air rises, it expands, {{because the}} {{pressure}} is lower at higher altitudes. As the air parcel expands, it pushes the surrounding air outward, transferring {{energy in the form}} of work from that parcel to the atmosphere. As energy transfer to a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air by way of heat is very slow, it is assumed to not exchange energy by way of heat with the environment. Such a process is called an adiabatic process (no energy transfer by way of heat). Since the rising <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere {{to make up for the}} loss, the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air is losing energy, which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature <b>of</b> the air <b>parcel.</b> The reverse, <b>of</b> course, will be true for a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air that is sinking and is being compressed.|$|R

5|$|In 1893, the {{executive}} committee of the Berlin city council proposed a site {{on the banks of}} the river Spree, roughly corresponding to the current location of the Berlin Finance Department and the offices of the Social Association of Germany. The proposal was rejected by the full city council because it would overshadow the city hall. Further proposals were put on hold for several years. After discussing many locations, in 1898, chief of construction Ludwig Hoffmann became involved and the council agreed on Molkenmarkt. The 32 built-up <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land on the site were bought up and cleared.|$|E
5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

5|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Lawton {{underwent}} tremendous growth {{during the late}} 1940s and 1950s, leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka. In the late 1950s, the city purchased large <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land along East Cache Creek in northern Comanche County {{for the construction of}} a man-made lake with a dam built in 1959 on the creek just north of U.S. 277 west of Elgin. Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s. It offered additional water resources, but also recreational opportunities and flood control along Cache Creek.|$|E
5|$|John Sherman {{was born}} in Lancaster, Ohio on May 10, 1823 to Charles Robert Sherman and his wife, Mary Hoyt Sherman, the eighth of their eleven children. John Sherman's grandfather, Taylor Sherman, a Connecticut lawyer and judge, first visited Ohio {{in the early nineteenth}} century, gaining title to several <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land before {{returning}} to Connecticut. After Taylor's death in 1815, his son Charles, newly married to Mary Hoyt, moved the family west to Ohio. Several other Sherman relatives soon followed, and Charles became established as a lawyer in Lancaster. By the time of John Sherman's birth, Charles had just been appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, investors {{including}} William Henry Crocker bought adjoining <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land in Oakland {{for the purpose}} of erecting a movie palace to rival the nearby Fox Orpheum, intending that Miller and Pflueger build it. One of the largest studio and theater chains in the country, Paramount Publix, showed great interest, but wanted to use their own East Coast architect instead. Pflueger went to New York and convinced Paramount Publix to use his firm by demonstrating that past projects of his had stayed within budget, a concern of increasing importance in the cautious financial climate of early 1930.|$|E
5|$|The case {{is often}} {{referred}} to as Oneida II because it is the second of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating its land rights claims. It followed Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (Oneida I) (1974), holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction, and was followed by City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), rejecting the tribe's attempt in a later lawsuit to re-assert tribal sovereignty over <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land re-acquired by the tribe in fee simple.|$|E
5|$|The estate {{started to}} {{deteriorate}} {{after it was}} inherited by the Governor's illegitimate son George Ferguson, known as the Admiral because of his naval career. He was already heavily in debt when he became the fifth laird in 1821, but he still enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and undertook much extravagant construction on the estate, including the erection of follies. To cover his substantial gambling debts, he began to sell <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> estate land, and upon inheriting Pitfour he began selling furniture, books, farm equipment and other items, realising more than £9,000.|$|E

5|$|In late 1818, Jennings was {{appointed}} {{as a federal}} commissioner, along with Lewis Cass and Benjamin Parke, to negotiate a treaty with the Native Americans (Potawatomi, Wea, Miami, and Delaware), {{who lived in the}} northern and central parts of Indiana. The Treaty of St. Mary's allowed the State of Indiana to purchase millions of acres of land north of an 1809 treaty line and extending west to the Wabash River and two more <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land, which opened most of central Indiana to American settlement. The appointment created a crisis in Jennings's political career. Because the state constitution prohibited a person from holding a federal government position while exercising duties as the state's governor, Jennings's political enemies seized the opportunity to force him from office by arguing that he had vacated the governor's office when he accepted the federal appointment.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Moreton family declined during the English Civil War. As supporters of the Royalist cause, they found themselves isolated {{in a community of}} Parliamentarians. Little Moreton Hall was requisitioned by the Parliamentarians in 1643 and used to billet Parliamentary soldiers. The family successfully petitioned for its restitution, and survived the Civil War with their ownership of Little Moreton Hall intact, but financially they were crippled. They tried to sell the entire estate, but could only dispose of several <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land. William Moreton died in 1654 leaving debts of £3,000–£4,000 (equivalent to about £12–16 million as of 2010), which forced his heirs to remortgage what remained of the estate. The family's fortunes never fully recovered, and by the late 1670s they no longer lived in Little Moreton Hall, renting it out instead to a series of tenant farmers. The Dale family took over the tenancy in 1841, and were still in residence more than 100 years later. By 1847 most of the house was unoccupied, and the deconsecrated Chapel was being used as a coal cellar and storeroom. Little Moreton Hall was in a ruinous condition; its windows were boarded up and its roof was rotten.|$|E
50|$|A rising <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air {{containing}} water vapor, if {{it rises}} far enough, reaches its lifted condensation level: it becomes saturated with water vapor (see Clausius-Clapeyron relation). If the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air continues to rise, water vapor condenses and releases its latent heat {{to the surrounding}} air, partially offsetting the adiabatic cooling. A saturated <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air therefore cools less than a dry one would as it rises (its temperature changes with height at the moist adiabatic lapse rate, which is smaller than the dry adiabatic lapse rate). Such a saturated <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air can achieve buoyancy, and thus accelerate further upward, a runaway condition (instability) even if potential temperature increases with height. The sufficient condition for an air column to be absolutely stable, even with respect to saturated convective motions, is that the equivalent potential temperature must increase monotonically with height.|$|R
