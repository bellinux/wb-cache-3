40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} quantify the amount of projective error produced by an offset of projection centres in a panoramic imaging workflow. We have limited this research to such panoramic workflows in which several sub-images using planar image sensor are taken and then stitched together as a large panoramic image mosaic. The aim is to simulate how large the offset can be before it introduces significant error to the dataset. The method uses geometrical analysis to calculate the error in various cases. Constraints for shooting distance, focal length {{and the depth of}} the area of interest are taken into account. Considering these constraints, it is possible to safely use even poorly calibrated panoramic camera rig with noticeable offset in <b>projection</b> <b>centre</b> locations. The aim is to create datasets suited for photogrammetric reconstruction. Similar constraints can be used also for finding recommended areas from the image planes for automatic feature matching and thus improve stitching of sub-images into full panoramic mosaics. The results are mainly designed to be used with long focal length cameras where the offset of <b>projection</b> <b>centre</b> of sub-images can seem to be significant {{but on the other hand}} the shooting distance is also long. We show that in such situations the error introduced by the offset of the projection centres results only in negligible error when stitching a metric panorama. Even if the main use of the results is with cameras of long focal length, they are feasible for all focal lengths...|$|E
40|$|Portugal. Abstract. We {{propose a}} method for 3 D {{reconstruction}} of structured environments from a single omnidirectional image. It {{is based on a}} reduced amount of user information, in the form of 2 D pixelcoordinates, alignment and coplanarity properties amongst subsets of the corresponding 3 D points. Just a few panoramic images are sufficient for building the 3 D model, as opposed to a larger number of “normal ” images that would be required to reconstruct the same scene [11, 14]. One contribution of the paper is showing how to build these 3 D models with an omnidirectional camera equipped with a spherical mirror, in spite of not having a single <b>projection</b> <b>centre.</b> Additionally, we present concisely a simple method for single-view reconstruction. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the precision of GPS-coordinates of <b>projection</b> <b>centres</b> obtained in photogrammetric production in Poland. The second aim of the work was to estimate the reliability of this group of measurements in aerial triangulations performed for three scales of aerial photographs. The study was based on repeated processing of data from production blocks, in comply with conditions of a correct adjustment. Adjustments were preceded by the pre-adjustment detection of gross errors and improper division of data into GPS profiles. Production results originated from various measurement systems and adjustment softwares; and they were characterized by numerous imperfections related to functional and statistical model and being generally the result of the applied technologies. A set of 25 blocks was selected for testing, including three scales of aerial photographs: 1 : 13 000, 1 : 19 000 and 1 : 26 000, most frequently used in Poland. Number of photographs in one block varied from 136 to 3402, and the total number of photographs in all blocks was about 30 000. The corrected a priori standard deviation of GPScoordinates obtained from 25 adjustments reached 10. 7 cm on average. The analysis of global internal reliability of GPS-coordinate for particular scales revealed that in blocks of photographs at scale 1 : 13 000 the average redundancy numbers reached 0. 50 for X, 0. 48 for Y and 0. 75 for Z coordinate. So, it can be concluded, the reliability of GPS-coordinates of <b>projection</b> <b>centres</b> in these aerial triangulations was good. For scales 1 : 19 000 and 1 : 26 000, in 9 blocks out of 15 the global redundancy numbers of horizontal GPScoordinates were lower than 0. 25. 1...|$|R

40|$|Spherical imaging is a {{technical}} approach of collecting scenery by viewing {{it through a}} single perspective. A typical realization of spherical imaging is a panoramic mosaic covering {{a part of the}} hemisphere. According to a photogrammetric definition, we introduce here, spherical imaging is an exact central projection explicitly determined by its projection center. They are linear images without any geometric distortions within their spherical coverage. Their orientation, or georeferencing, is defined by three coordinates of the <b>projection</b> <b>centre</b> and by two directions of the attitude, namely the horizon and the azimuth, or, the Zenith and North. Spherical images are suitable for photogrammetric applications both in interior and exterior surroundings. The ease of use is a major advantage of spherical imaging. The procedure of utilizing them for surveying and mapping processes will be discussed. This includes methods for generating spherical images with rotating camera, methods for measuring 3 -D objects from spherical images, methods for building stereo pairs and visualizing the views, and methods for combining laser measurements with spherical images. 1...|$|E

When facing difficult accessibility of the terrain and large mapping areas, the aerial photogrammetry offers the best solution to this problem. Nevertheless, {{in the domain of}} avalanche studies the classical photogrammetry reaches its limits when volumes of snow are the parameters to be determined. The difficulties of installing durable signalization in such areas initiated the development of a system that uses a navigation solution to determine the parameters of exterior orientation. It integrates light aerial camera, GPS and INS components to a platform that is free of the helicopter in 6 degrees of freedom. Experimental studies performed in the avalanche test site of "Vallée de la Sionne " allow determining the correct ratio between the system accuracy versus its flexibility.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{upgrading}} a projective reconstruction to metric is presented. The reconstruction is first transformed by considering cheirality {{so that the}} convex hull of the set of camera <b>projection</b> <b>centres</b> {{is the same as}} in the metric counterpart. The method then proceeds iteratively and starting fiom such a reconstruction is a necessary condition for many iterative calibration algorithms to converge. The results show that in practice it is also most often sufficient, provided that the-minimised objective function is a geometrically meaningful quantity. The method has been found extretnely reliable for both large and small reconstructions in a large number of experiments on real data. When subjected to the common degeneracy of little or no rotation between the views, the method still yields a vety reasonable member of the family of possible solutions. Furthermore, the method is vety fast and therefore suitable for the purpose of viewing reconstructions. ...|$|R
