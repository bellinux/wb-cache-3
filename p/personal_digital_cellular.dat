50|$|Time-division {{multiple}} access (TDMA) is a channel access method for shared-medium networks.

40|$|Abstractâ€”The most {{computationally}} intensive {{part of a}} wideband receiver is the channelizer, which extracts individual radio channels {{from the}} output of the ADC. The computational complexity of Linear Phase Finite Impulse Response (LPFIR) filters employed in the channelizer is dominated by the number of adders (subtractors) used in the implementation of the multipliers. Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) has been proposed as an efficient method to minimize the number of adders in LPFIR filters. In this paper, two methods are proposed to efficiently implement the channel filters in a wideband receiver by optimizing CSE. We exploit the fact that significant amount of redundant multiplications exist in the filter bank channelizer as it extracts multiple narrowband channels from the wideband signal. By forming three and four nonzero-bit super-subexpression utilizing redundant identical shifts that exist between a two-nonzero-bit Common Subexpression (CS) and a third nonzero bit, or between two nonzero-bit CS, we show that the number of adders to implement the channel filters can be reduced considerably. Furthermore, the complexity of adders is analyzed and design examples of the channel filters employed in the Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (D-AMPS) and the <b>Personal</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Cellular</b> (PDC) channelizers show that the proposed methods offer considerable reduction in full adders when compared to conventional CSE methods...|$|E
