The first concerns {{the merits of the}} so-called `golden rule of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> investment' [...] the proposition that, over the cycle, government borrowing should not exceed government (net) capital formation.

40|$|This paper adopts an epistemic {{community}} framework to explicate the dual role of epistemic communities as influencers of accounting policy within regulatory space and as implementers who effect change within {{the domain of}} accounting. The context is the adoption and implementation of fair value accounting within local government in New South Wales (NSW). The roles and functions of Australian local government are extensive, and include the development and maintenance of infrastructure, provision of recreational facilities, certain health and community services, buildings, cultural facilities, and in some cases, water and sewerage (Australian Local Government Association, 2009). The NSW state Department of Local Government (DLG) is responsible for legislation and policy development to ensure that local councils are able to deliver ‘quality services to their communities in a sustainable manner’ (DLG, 2008 c). These local councils receive revenue from various sources including property rates, government grants and user-pays service provision. In July 2006 the DLG issued Circular 06 - 453 to councils (DLG, 2006 c), mandating the staged adoption of fair value measurement of infrastructure assets. This directive followed the policy of NSW State Treasury (NSW Treasury, 2007), 4 and an independent inquiry into the financial sustainability of local councils (LGSA, 2006). It {{was an attempt to}} resolve the inconsistency in <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>asset</b> valuation in NSW Local Governments, and to provide greater usefulness and comparability of financial statements. 5 The focus of this study is the mobilization of accounting change by the DLG within this wider political context. When a regulatory problem arises, those with political power seek advice from professionals with relevant skill and expertise (Potter, 2005). This paper explores the way in which professionals diffuse accounting ‘problems’ and the associated accounting solutions ‘across time and space’ (Potter, 2005, p. 277). The DLG’s fair value accounting policy emanated from a ‘regulatory space’ (Hancher and Moran, 1989) 6 as a result of negotiations between many parties, including accounting and finance professionals. Operating within the local government sector, these professionals were identified by the DLG as being capable of providing helpful input. They were also responsible for the implementation of the new olicy within local councils. Accordingly they have been dentified as an pistemic community with the ability to ranslate regulatory power by changing he domain of ccounting (Potter, 2005, p. 278). 7 The paper is organised as follows. The background to the LG’s decision to require the introduction of fair value accounting for infrastructure assets is explored. Following this, the method of the study is described, and the {{epistemic community}} framework outlined. In the next sections, evidence of the influencing and implementing roles of epistemic groups is provided. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the significance of these groups both within regulatory space in developing accounting regulation, and in embedding change within the domain of accounting...|$|E

This paper examines one of the critical financial challenges in Croatia: managing <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>assets</b> efficiently.

The lack of reliable information on public assets in place hinders determination of the assets’ value, budgeting for asset management activities and evaluating public asset portfolio performance.

As a preliminary to that discussion, the paper also presents recent trends in the State Budget position. The data {{presented in this paper}} illustrates that real value of NSW <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>assets</b> has increased consistently in the last decade or so. This has been driven predominantly by the revaluation of non-financial assets such as land and property, and also non-financial asset purchases. This growth has not been consistent across all NSW <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> organisations. Of those presented in this paper, it is evident that public trading enterprises with a high composition of land and property assets (such as the NSW Land and Housing Corporation) have experienced considerably higher real net asset value growth than other general government organisations (which are comprised of a higher proportion of operational assets subject to depreciation) ...|$|R

It is a well-known fact that coordinating the partnership for funding or managing the public projects initiated by governments is an enormously difficult task (Shah 2007).

Rather, the PPP borrowing is incurred by the private sector vehicle implementing the project. On PPP projects where the cost of using the service is intended to be borne exclusively by the end user, the PPP is, from the <b>public</b> <b>sector's</b> perspective, an [...] "off-balance sheet" [...] method of financing the delivery of new or refurbished <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>assets.</b> On PPP projects where the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> intends to compensate the private sector through availability payments once the facility is established or renewed, the financing is, from the <b>public</b> <b>sector's</b> perspective, [...] "on-balance sheet"; however, the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> will regularly benefit from significantly deferred cash flows. Generally, financing costs will be higher for a PPP than for a traditional public financing, because of the private sector higher cost of capital. However, extra financing costs can be offset by private sector efficiency, savings resulting from a holistic approach to delivering the project or service, and from the better risk allocation in the long run.|$|R

The factor leading to successful project of PPP is value for money achieved and the profound problems of the PPP is the government interference...|$|R
40|$|Although accrual {{accounting}} {{has become increasingly}} more popular in many governments over recent years, some issues remain unresolved. Previous literature questioned whether non-business-like governmental assets can be adequately capitalized. Whereas these studies mostly focussed on specific types of assets, such as infrastructure, military assets or heritage assets, this paper expands these views by taking a holistic approach to their treatment. Because such specific types of assets share fundamental characteristics, they could be called “specific governmental assets”. The analysis distinguishes between business-like government assets used in provision of public services and “specific governmental assets” which provide their services directly to the public, such as public art galleries, museums and parklands. It is argued that GAAP definitions of assets {{cannot be applied to}} the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> for business-like <b>assets</b> without modification to allow for the replacement of cash generation for the owning entity by service provision to the public and not to the government as owner. However this amended definition of assets does not embrace “specific governmental assets” because these assets provide their services directly to public users of them, and the assets cannot normally be valued in financial terms because they have been removed from business-like markets by government decision. The paper highlights the problems caused by the misapplication of business accounting techniques to the <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> capital <b>assets,</b> New <b>Public</b> Management, governmental accounting, public goods, governmental assets, recognition...|$|R
40|$|The global {{economic}} situation is putting increasing pressure on <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> funding and so innovation {{is now being}} recognised as an essential mechanism for maintaining the quality and scope of services whilst reducing costs. This report describes new research into {{a specific type of}} <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> innovation – commercialisation: partnerships between the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> and commercial organisations which enable new or enhanced services to be developed. A crucial aspect of such partnerships is that they can lead to the development of new services which create new value. This enables financial and other benefits for both the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> and commercial partners. The research conducted for this report consisted of a survey of civil servants’ views on commercialisation and two case studies of successful innovation—the <b>Public</b> <b>Sector</b> Broadband Aggregation (PSBA) in Wales and the Met Office Healthy Outlook ® service. The survey enabled barriers to commercialisation to be identified, such as lack of guidance and support, lack of clarity in the remit of the <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> and inadequate awareness of the opportunities. The two case studies enabled the key characteristics of commercialisation to be determined, particularly the need to start early discussions with potential commercial partners, to gain board level sponsorship for projects, and to ensure that the value of the innovation is shared. Contrasting the results of our research to the way innovation is managed in the private sector, allows us to make four main recommendations on maximising the value of commercial partnerships: - The focus of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> innovation must go beyond service efficiency, and the exploitation of internally generated ideas. To gain the maximum value from <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>assets,</b> suitable discussions need to be held with potential commercial partners. - Discussions with the commercial sector have the potential to create innovative ideas for new services. The <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> will need to become adept at conducting early stage discussions with commercial organisations, if it is to gain the maximum value from public assets. Suitable partners need to be identified, where the capabilities of the commercial sector complement the unique expertise and <b>assets</b> of the <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> Making such partnerships work will require trust on both sides and sharing of the value generated from the innovation developed. - Managers in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> urgently require more guidance and support on how to apply the concept of commercialisation and achieve the benefits. - <b>Public</b> <b>sector</b> innovation is very different from innovation in the commercial sector. Therefore, although there are some points to be learned from the commercial sector, appropriate tools need to be developed for the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> and these need to be disseminated to civil servants...|$|R
