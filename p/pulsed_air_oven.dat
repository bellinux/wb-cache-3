30|$|In {{this section}} a {{comparison}} study {{was carried out}} between <b>pulsed</b> and continuous <b>air</b> flushing mode conducted for remediation of soil contaminated with lubricant oil. Such comparison was carried out to determine which air flushing mode will consumed lower energy. Both of continuous (direct injection) and <b>pulsed</b> <b>air</b> flushing modes (on/off intervals) were applied to remediation course soil contaminated with 10  wt% waste lubricant oils in absence and presence of 3  wt% surfactant concentration. The results found in Tables  2 and 3 shows that both air flushing modes are succeeded to remove the same percentage from pollutant (93  wt%) at different time 600 and 40  s for continuous and <b>pulsed</b> <b>air</b> flushing, respectively, this means the performance of using the <b>pulsed</b> <b>air</b> flushing mode over the continuous mode for soil remediation. Therefore, the <b>pulsed</b> <b>air</b> flushing mode was applied with coarse soil contaminated with 25 and 50  wt% waste lubricant oils in presence of 3  wt% nonionic surfactant.|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} to {{evaluate}} and compare the Diametral Tensile strength of Phosphate bonded Investment materials (Wirovest, Cromocasting Fast and Accuvest) after drying by Air dried method, Conventional Hot <b>air</b> <b>oven</b> method and Microwave oven method. A total of 90 cylindrical specimens were prepared from three different commercially available phosphate bonded investment materials. Thus 30 samples for each material were prepared and 10 of each were Air dried for 60 minutes, 10 were dried in a Conventional Hot <b>air</b> <b>oven</b> for 60 minutes t 265 c to 300 ˚c nd 10 were dried in Microw ve oven with 600 w tts t frequency of 2450 MHz for 10 minutes. All the samples were subjected to diametral compression test using a computer coordinated Universal testing machine at 2 hour interval at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 cm/min.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} treatment methods on {{the stability and}} antioxidant capacity of the bioactive phenolic compounds of litchi pericarps were investigated.

The total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and individual procyanidins, and antioxidant activity were analyzed. The combination of blanching and drying at 60 °C significantly (p < 0. 05) improved the release of phenolic compounds, individual procyanidins, and the extracts′ antioxidant capacity compared with the unblanched hot air oven-dried and open air–dried pericarps. Drying of fresh unblanched litchi pericarps in either open air or a hot <b>air</b> <b>oven</b> caused significant losses (p < 0. 05) in phenolic compounds and individual procyanidins, leading {{to a reduction in}} the antioxidant activity.

All of these Si substrates were cleaned chemically following a standard procedure and then dipped in a dilute HF solution (HF/H 2 O = 1 : 20), before being loaded into an electron gun evaporation chamber. A 30 -nm-thick Cu thin film with a 30 -nm-thick Ti adhesion layer was deposited on the Si substrates to act as the electrode during the subsequent Cu electrodeposition process. The base pressure in the evaporation chamber was better than 1 × 10 - 5 Pa. The Cu electroplating electrolyte was composed of 0.3 M copper sulfate (CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O) and 2.7 M sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4). The electrodeposition of pure Cu films on the Cu/Ti film-coated Si substrates was carried out at room temperature using a DC power supply with an applied voltage of 0.2 V. After the Cu electroplating process, the obtained samples were cleaned in a 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution to remove any surface contaminants and the native oxide layer, then washed with deionized water and blown dry with N 2 gas.

In this work, a comparison study {{was carried out}} between two air-flushing modes, namely, continuous <b>air</b> flushing and <b>pulsed</b> <b>air</b> flushing, which was conducted to remediate soil contaminated with waste-lubricant oil. Therefore, coarse sand was artificially polluted and mixed well with waste-lubricant oil at different concentrations of 10, 25 and 50  wt% to give the soil an oil blend. Then a laboratory glass column was established and backed with contaminated soil to study the effect of flow rate, pollutant and surfactant concentrations on the removal of waste-lubricant oil from soil. The contaminated soil was washed with pure water and flushed with both air-flushing modes at a pressure of 2  kPa and flow rate of 6  L min− 1. After that fixed 300  mL nonionic surfactant solutions (NPEO 9.3) at concentrations of 3, 5 and 7  wt%, were poured individually along with air injection {{at the same pressure}} and flow rate. The treated soil was washed several times with pure water to eliminate the residual surfactant solutions. It was found that water washing and air injection remove 27  % of oil; however, air injection along with surfactant solutions increased the oil removal efficiency up to 90  %. Moreover, both air-flushing modes succeeded in removing the pollutant with majority to <b>pulsed</b> <b>air</b> mode over continuous mode; therefore, <b>pulsed</b> <b>air</b> flushing was applied for 25 and 50  wt% waste lubricant oils in presence of 3  wt% nonionic surfactant.|$|R
