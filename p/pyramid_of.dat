5|$|Abuwtiyuw {{appears to}} have been a sighthound, a lightly built hunting dog similar to a greyhound, with erect ears and a curly tail. The tomb in which his tablet was {{discovered}} is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, close to the western side of the Great <b>Pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Giza (<b>Pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Khufu/Kheops).|$|E
5|$|The main {{innovation}} of the <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Unas is {{the first}} appearance of the Pyramid Texts, {{one of the oldest}} religious texts in Egypt to have survived to this day. In doing so, Unas initiated a tradition that would be followed in the <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties, {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom circa 200 years later.|$|E
5|$|Unas had {{a pyramid}} built {{for himself in}} North Saqqara, between the <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Sekhemkhet and the southwestern corner of the pyramid complex of Djoser, in {{symmetry}} with the <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Userkaf located at the northeastern corner. In the process, workers leveled and covered older tombs located in the area, most notably {{the tomb of the}} Second Dynasty pharaoh Hotepsekhemwy (c. 2890 BC).|$|E

5|$|Djedkare {{may have}} left {{some of his}} monuments {{unfinished}} at his death, as suggested by several relief-bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> king Unas. Their original setting remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Hence, the Pyramid Texts of the <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Unas {{incorporate}} {{instructions for}} ritual actions and words to be spoken, {{suggesting that they}} were precisely those performed and recited during {{the cult of the}} king in his mortuary temple.|$|E
5|$|Neither the dog's grave nor mummy {{have been}} recovered. The tomb {{in which the}} tablet was {{unearthed}} is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, close to {{the western side of}} the Great <b>Pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Giza (<b>Pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Khufu/Kheops). The white limestone tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2cm (21.3×11.1×9.1in) and is inscribed with ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated from each other by vertical lines. Part of a leash is visible on the upper-right corner, suggesting that the tablet displayed an image of Abuwtiyuw with his owner.|$|E

5|$|The <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Userkaf was {{apparently}} {{the object of}} restoration work in antiquity under the impulse of Khaemweset (1280–1225 BC), fourth son of Ramses II. This is attested by inscriptions on stone cladding showing Khaemweset with offering bearers.|$|E

5|$|After his {{investigations}} Perring {{buried the}} robbers tunnel which remains inaccessible to this day. The <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Userkaf entered the official records {{a few years}} later in 1842 when Karl Richard Lepsius catalogued it in his list of pyramids under number XXXI. Since Perring had already buried the robbers tunnel by that time, K. R. Lepsius did not investigate the pyramid any further.|$|E

5|$|Russell's {{teaching}} that the Great <b>Pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Giza was built under God's direction was overturned in 1928, when Rutherford asserted {{that it had}} been built under the direction of Satan for the purpose of deceiving God's people in the last days.

5|$|The West <b>Pyramid</b> <b>of</b> the E-Group {{produced}} ceramic evidence dating the Late Preclassic, Early Classic and Late Classic.

5|$|The {{disposition}} of the substructures of the layer pyramid is extremely similar to that found in the Buried <b>Pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Sekhemket. Consequently, Mark Lehner and others suggest that the two pyramids must have been constructed very close in time.|$|E

5|$|Alvarez {{proposed}} Muon tomography in 1965 {{to search}} the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{works on}} the <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died {{unexpectedly}} in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only one step of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The substructures, built in a large open pit {{at the center of}} the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.|$|E
5|$|The Layer Pyramid (known locally in Arabic as el haram el midawwar, , meaning 'rubble-hill pyramid') is {{a ruined}} step pyramid {{dating to the}} 3rd Dynasty of Egypt (2686 BC to 2613 BC) and located in the {{necropolis}} of Zawyet El Aryan. Its ownership is uncertain and may be attributable to pharaoh Khaba. The pyramid architecture, however, {{is very similar to}} that of the Buried <b>Pyramid</b> <b>of</b> king Sekhemkhet and for this reason is firmly datable to the 3rd Dynasty.|$|E
