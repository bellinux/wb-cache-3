The unusual harmonic progressions in the leitmotifs which structure the piece, {{as well as the}} heavy chromaticism of act 2, make it a difficult work to parse musically.|$|E

5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up <b>pitches</b> <b>and</b> be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, he {{was chosen}} to play for England {{for the first time}} and rose to {{prominence}} during a tour to Australia in 1932–33. Afterwards, he played regularly for England and achieved the best performance of his career when he took 15wickets against Australia in a Test match at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1934. However, critics claimed he was ineffective on good batting <b>pitches,</b> <b>and</b> he was occasionally left out of the England team over the following years.

5|$|The American League's closers then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, {{but he could not}} come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his <b>pitches</b> <b>and</b> walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E
