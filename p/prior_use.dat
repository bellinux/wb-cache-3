500|$|During the Ferguson {{unrest in}} 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white {{policeman}} who {{shot and killed}} an unarmed black adolescent was not indicted, state-controlled press coverage in Russia was highly critical of racism in the United States. Writing for The Moscow Times, journalist Allison Quinn posited that coverage of the protests in Ferguson served as an optimal method to distract media from the Ukrainian crisis. Quinn noted: [...] "American racism provided a go-to argument of American hypocrisy for years under the Soviet Union, with phrases like 'Well, you lynch negroes' hurled back at the U.S. in response to any allegations of human rights violations in the Soviet Union." [...] She compared the Ferguson unrest coverage by Russia state-controlled media to <b>prior</b> <b>use</b> of this phrase {{as a form of}} Soviet propaganda. Writing for the Americal liberal magazine The New Republic during the Ukrainian crisis, Julia Ioffe made a similar comparison as Quinn regarding Soviet versus 2014 use of the technique. Ioffe wrote that the phrase took the form of a [...] "cartoonish reply", and had been extended after the fall of Soviet Russia to a similar strategy used by Vladimir Putin. Writing for American Thinker, Kim Zigfeld referenced the phrase in discussing a Soviet tactic of denigrating their detractors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{adopt the}} {{framework}} of sparse stochastic processes of [1] and investigate the sparse/compressible priors obtained by linearly measuring the processes. We show such priors are necessarily infinitely divisible. This property is satisfied by many <b>priors</b> <b>used</b> in statistical learning such as Gaussian, Laplace, and {{a wide range of}} fat-tailed distributions such as Student’s-t and α-stable laws. However, it excludes some popular <b>priors</b> <b>used</b> in compressed sensing including all distributions that decay like exp(−O(|x | p)) for 1 < p < 2. This fact can be considered as evidence against the usage of ℓp-norms for 1 < p < 2 in regularization techniques involving sparse priors. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a general class of multivariate priors for group-sparse {{modeling}} within the Bayesian framework. We show that special cases of this class correspond to multivariate versions of several classical <b>priors</b> <b>used</b> for sparse modeling. Hence, this general prior formulation is helpful in analyzing the properties of different modeling approaches and their connections. We derive the estimation procedures with these <b>priors</b> <b>using</b> variational inference for fully Bayesian estimation. In addition, we discuss {{the differences between the}} proposed inference and deterministic inference approaches with these priors. Finally, we show the flexibility of this modeling by considering several extensions such as multiple measurements, within-group correlations and overlapping groups. I...|$|R
