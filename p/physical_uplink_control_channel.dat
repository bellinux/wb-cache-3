30|$|LTE uplink {{comprises}} three physical channels: physical {{random access}} channel (PRACH), {{physical uplink shared channel}} (PUSCH), and <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) [27]. In particular, PUSCH is used to deliver user data and control information for active users in the uplink, which makes it an important component to be dimensioned and optimized. This section outlines how the main PUSCH features, namely the power control algorithm and the physical resource block (PRB) allocation scheme, are modeled in this work.|$|E
30|$|In LTE networks, each UE {{performs}} {{random access}} (RA) procedures to transmit data during the access grant time interval (AGTI) or RA slots over a time-frequency radio resource called physical {{random access channel}} (PRACH). A UE initiates the RA mechanism in two cases [42]. Firstly, when a UE is turned on and the uplink timing synchronization is either lost or not yet achieved. Secondly, whenever a handover mechanism is performed from a serving eNB to a target eNB. In LTE, UEs perform the RA procedure for several reasons such as for establishing a communication link, re-initiating a radio link after a failure, for radio resources in case of no uplink resource grant, and scheduling requests {{in the absence of}} dedicated <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> (PUCCHs).|$|R

The PRB defines the resource allocation granularity in LTE. Herein, a transmission bandwidth of 10 MHz is allocated for uplink and thus there are 48 PRBs available for data transmission on the <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> shared channel (PUSCH) and 2 PRBs are reserved to the <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|R

40|$|We propose {{improvements}} for the <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) format 2 control signaling in 3 GPP-LTE systems. These improvements can {{be useful}} for low-cost UE design and optimization planned for the future LTE releases. In the proposed method, instead of repeating a single QPSK symbol across the 12 subcarriers in each OFDM symbol of a resource block as done in the current release of the standard, we pick two QPSK symbols from two independent resource blocks and repeat them across 6 subcarriers each. The proposed method has a performance gain of about 5. 5 dB and 1. 85 dB over the conventional method with one and two receiving antennas at the base station, respectively. These gains can be achieved {{without the use of}} any additional transmission power, time-frequency resources or receiver complexity. The cell-specific QPSK sequences specified in the standard for PUCCH transmission are chosen according to the conventional repetition across the 12 subcarriers, hence we suggest new cell-specific QPSK sequences which minimize the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of the PUCCH signal with the proposed method...|$|E

There are four <b>Control</b> <b>channels</b> available in LTE for both uplink and downlink. The <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is PUCCH.

40|$|Long Term Evolution (LTE) {{defines a}} number of {{physical}} channels to carry information blocks received from the MAC and higher layers. This paper presents two types of Physical channels: the first type is downlink physical channels which consist of Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH), Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), Physical Multicast Channel (PMCH), Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH) and Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH). The second type of Physical channels is uplink physical channels which consist of Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Channel</b> (PUCCH) and Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). This paper also highlights the structure of PDSCH and PUSCH, discuss the algorithms of {{the two types of}} physical channel and each of its features.

40|$|Advanced Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (Advanced E-UTRA), called LTE-Advanced, {{has been}} {{standardized}} in the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) {{as a candidate}} for IMT-Advanced. LTE-Advanced supports spatial orthogonal-resource transmit diversity (SORTD) [1], [2] for ACK/NACK signals and scheduling requests (SRs), which are used to control downlink hybrid automatic repeat requests (HARQs) and manage uplink radio resources based on uplink data traffic, respectively. Both ACK/NACK signals and SRs are carried via a <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) [3], and a common PUCCH format is used for both ACK/NACK signals and SRs. If SORTD is used, the base station assigns mutually orthogonal resources to each antenna included in the user equipment (UE) for ACK/NACK signals and SRs; hence, the number of required resources increases with the number of transmitting antennas in the UE. In this paper, we study the resource reduction method for ACK/NACK signal and SR in case of SORTD using the concept of common resource. In addition, we investigate a phase rotation scheme for common resources to improve the SR detection performance...|$|E
30|$|In case of more bursty data traffic, like web-browsing, the {{feedback}} {{information can be}} sent between the different data bursts only on the <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Channel</b> (PUCCH). Because of the limited capacity of the PUCCH, {{the feedback}} information can be sent typcially every 20, 40 or even 80 ms only, depending {{on the number of}} mobile stations in a radio cell. Therefore, inaccurate or even outdated feedback information {{at the start of a}} data burst—especially in combination with the so-called ‘TCP slow start’ effect—can result in a reduced user throughput [11]. In order to mitigate these effects in case of a high number of mobile stations like in machine-to-machine scenarios, the feedback information is sent automatically less frequently, e.g. only every 80 ms, in case of a low mobility environment. Otherwise, the capacity of the PUCCH has to be increased automatically, which results in a reduced capacity of the PUSCH in turn. Alternatively, part of the traffic can be offloaded either in a micro or pico cell of a heterogeneous network or in a macro cell of another frequency layer. Only for fast-moving mobile stations like trains the transmission has to be downgraded to the more robust transmisson modes like TM 3 or even TM 2.|$|E
30|$|ICIC is a SON function, {{which aims}} to {{minimize}} interference among cells using the same spectrum. It involves the coordination of physical resources between neighboring cells to reduce interference from one cell to another.

ICIC can be static, semi-static, or dynamic. Dynamic ICIC relies on frequent adjustments of parameters, supported by signaling among cells over X 2 interface. To support proactive coordination among cells, the high interference indicator (HII) and the relative narrowband transmit power (RNTP) indicators have been defined, while to support reactive coordination, the overload indicator (OI) has been introduced [33]. Parameters that may be tuned are the transmission power, the pilot power, antenna parameters (azimuth and tilt), and the support of coordinated almost blank subframes (ABS).|$|R

30|$|Despite the {{tremendous}} capacity and system enhancements implemented by LTE, cellular networks {{are known to}} be, as any kind of wireless network, vulnerable to radio jamming. Although {{it is a simple}} and well-known attack, radio jamming is the most common way to launch a localized denial of service (DoS) attack against a cellular network[4]. The impact of such attacks is very local and mainly constrained by the transmitted power of the jamming device. The attacker is only able to deny the service locally to UEs located in its vicinity. However, more sophisticated attacks have been discovered as a potentially more effective way to jam LTE networks[5, 6]. These smart jamming attacks aim to saturate specifically the main downlink broadcast channel of LTE networks in order to launch a local DoS attack that requires less power, making it stealthier. Further complex attacks, such as low-power smart jamming, identify the actual physical resource blocks (PRBs) assigned to essential <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> by capturing the unprotected broadcast messages sent from the base station (eNodeB). The interception of such unencrypted network configuration data allows the attacker to selectively saturate <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> in order to extend the range of the attack to an entire cell or sector. Note that network configuration contained in the broadcast channel can also be leveraged to deploy an effective rogue base station and other kinds of attacks.|$|R
40|$|LTE is a next {{generation}} mobile {{system from the}} 3 GPP {{with a focus on}} wireless broadband. The aim of LTE is to achieve high data rates in both uplink & downlink, and to achieve high spectral efficiencies. The main focus of the work is to develop baseband algorithms in the uplink in order to achieve uplinksynchronization between the user and the base station and also for the detection of the control data that is transmitted. For the base station to obtain the knowledge of the presence of the user and also about its position, the user has to transmit synchronization signals to the base station, which are transmitted on the Physical Random Access CHannel (PRACH) in LTE. These signals are used to obtain the uplink timing correction and hence synchronize with the base station. It is very important for the base station to detect the control data that has been transmitted by the user on <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> <b>Control</b> <b>CHannel</b> (PUCCH). The control data may consist of the response of the UE to the data packets that were transmitted by the base station, request for resource allocation etc. So efficient algorithms are necessary for the accurate detection of the control data at the base station. The current work presents algorithms that are essential for obtaining uplink synchronization and also for efficient detection of the control channel data...|$|E
30|$|In our work, we {{concentrate}} on FDD scheme with particular {{attention given to}} LTE/LTE-A systems. Our motivation behind such a selection is to provide new technological solutions, while keeping the backward compatibility with current standards. In other words, one may notice {{that many of the}} existing wireless standards (including practical deployments of LTE) are based on FDD mode. Thus, it is highly expected that the existing infrastructure will be utilized as effectively as possible, and flexible usage of frequency bands in such a scenario {{can be one of the}} interesting solutions. Moreover, we assume that the amount of traffic in the DL direction is much higher than in the opposite direction, as this represents a typical situation in crowded areas where the role of the dominating service is played by mobile video streaming [9]. Clearly, an opposite situation is also possible (one can consider mass events where many persons decide to upload the photos or videos), but it is not as popular as the previous one. Finally, in such a context, the selection of LTE-based systems is natural, as this is the technology that permanently supersedes 3 G systems in many places in the world. However, the application of flexible duplexing (FD) in FDD-LTE is not straightforward, due to the continuous transmission of control signals in PUCCH in the UL band (PUCCH stands for <b>physical</b> <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel).</b> It means that (potentially) every time there is a useful signal present in the uplink band, and it is not possible to allocate the whole UL band for downlink transmission without interfering to the base station.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, Machine-Type Communications (MTC) {{has become}} one of the most {{attractive}} technologies in the area of wireless networking. Different sources are predicting a large grow of smart grid machine-to-machine deployments in several decades, which also means that the total number of wireless devices will increase dramatically. In connection to this problem, the choice of the standard, which will satisfy all the MTC requirements without harming current wireless deployments has become very relevant. Because of these reasons, many companies are proposing to modify one (or several) of the current wireless standard in a way that it will be possible to use for MTC purposes. This will be perfect from point of view of interference problems, because they will be already included in a standard itself. Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE- A) is one of the most rapidly developing wireless technologies, that seems to be an ideal candidate for future MTC implementation. However, while the capacity of typical LTE-A network should be enough to satisfy trafﬁc demands of large number of MTC devices, the signaling is not ready to face new requirements. In this Thesis, we are considering and partly solving problems, that could occur in LTE-A signaling channels under MTC conditions. Particularly, these are data access mechanisms, which could be realized via <b>Physical</b> <b>Uplink</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Channel</b> (PUCCH) and Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). Speaking about assessment methods, the research made in this work is based on 2 approaches: simulation and analysis. Both of them are also in details described in the pages of this Thesis. As a conclusion it could be said that PUCCH channel is not suitable for the MTC data access, while PRACH is having problems only in heavily loaded (overloaded) cases and should be slightly modiﬁed to face them...|$|E

40|$|In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, {{acquisition}} of the channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT) is crucial. In this paper, a practical CSIT estimation scheme is proposed for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Specifically, each received pilot symbol is first quantized to one bit per dimension at the receiver side and then the quantized bits are fed back to the transmitter. A joint one-bit compressed sensing algorithm is implemented at the transmitter to recover the channel matrices. The algorithm leverages the hidden joint sparsity structure in the user channel matrices to minimize the training and feedback overhead, which {{is considered to be}} a major challenge for FDD systems.

30|$|In this article, {{we present}} a low-rate {{feedback}} method for co-layer interference mitigation and cell balancing in the downlink of a closed-access femtocell. Using a combination of practical TBF methods and simple channel-aware inter-cell scheduling algorithms, we show that resources (i.e., degrees of freedom in the spatial and temporal domains) can be transferred from a cell operating in high SINR regime to a cell that is operating with low SINR. In other words, the proposed method is able to effectively balance the downlink data rate that is achieved at each cell, requiring only {{the presence of a}} low-rate <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> between the interfering femto access point (FAP) and the victim femto user equipment (FUE). We note that a similar method, known as enhanced codebook-based transmission, was presented in [20] and references therein as one potential solution for performance enhancements in single- and multi-cell LTE-Advanced networks. Nevertheless, the main difference with our proposal {{lies in the fact that}} in a FAP, the number of associated FUEs is expected to be much lower than the number of potential candidates to be served in a macro base station. This limitation precludes the possibility of finding a best companion (for user pairing) and worst companion (for interference coordination) to be served simultaneously at each transmission time instant.|$|R
40|$|The {{autocorrelation}} of a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence with a non-zero cyclically shifted {{version of}} itself is zero. Due to the interesting property, ZC sequences {{are widely used}} in the LTE air interface in the primary synchronization signal (PSS), random access preamble (PRACH), <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) etc. However, this interesting property of ZC sequence is not useful in the random access initial uplink synchronization problem due to some specific structures of the underlying problem. In particular, {{the state of the}} art uplink synchronization algorithms do not perform equally for all ZC sequences. In this work, we show a systematic procedure to choose the ZC sequences that yield the optimum performance of the uplink synchronization algorithms. At first, we show that the uplink synchronization is a sparse signal recovery problem on an overcomplete basis. Next, we use the theory of sparse recovery algorithms and identify a factor that controls performance of the algorithms. We then suggest a ZC sequence design procedure to optimally choose this factor. The simulation results show that the performance of most of {{the state of the art}} uplink synchronization algorithms improve significantly when the ZC sequences are chosen by using the proposed technique.

30|$|The {{long-term}} evolution (LTE) is {{the newly}} adopted technology to offer enhanced capacity and coverage for current mobility networks, which experience a constant traffic increase and skyrocketing bandwidth demands. This new cellular communication system, built upon a redesigned physical layer {{and based on}} an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) modulation, features robust performance in challenging multipath environments and substantially improves {{the performance of the}} wireless channel in terms of bits per second per Hertz (bps/Hz).

This proof of concept paper overviews a series of new effective attacks (smart jamming) that extend the range and effectiveness of basic radio jamming. Based on these new threats, a series of new potential security research directions are introduced, aiming to enhance the resiliency of LTE networks against such attacks. A spread-spectrum modulation of the main downlink broadcast channels is combined with a scrambling of the radio resource allocation of the <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> and an advanced system information message encryption scheme.

However, the DFT operation is carried at the receiver on N consecutive incoming samples cut out from a stream of incoming samples. As such, time-domain windowing with N-length rectangular window is used. The reception filter characteristic of a single subcarrier has a sinc-like shape. If there is a DL signal (transmitted as stated above {{in the middle of the}} UL band) observed by the cell B receiver, high power sidelobes of a sinc function will cause interference on the used subcarrier (conveying control information). In order to overcome this problem, time-domain windowing or filtering should be applied at the receiver.|$|R
