5|$|During the First Indochina War, Lê Duẩn was {{an active}} revolutionary leader in South Vietnam. He headed the Central Office of South Vietnam, a party organ, from 1951 until 1954. During the 1950s Lê Duẩn became {{increasingly}} aggressive towards South Vietnam and called for reunification through war. By the mid-to-late 1950s Lê Duẩn had become the second-most powerful <b>policy-maker</b> within the Party, eclipsing former party First Secretary Trường Chinh. By 1960, he was officially the second-most powerful party member, after party chairman Hồ. Throughout the 1960s Hồ's health declined and Lê Duẩn assumed more of his responsibilities. On 2 September 1969, Hồ died and Lê Duẩn became the most powerful figure in the North.|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of future}} <b>policy-makers</b> substantially influences future greenhouse gas emissions. Uncertainty about {{the motives of}} future <b>policy-makers</b> may thus strongly influence the climate policy strategies of current <b>policy-makers.</b> Analytical and numerical analyses in this paper confirm this hypothesis. If current <b>policy-makers</b> want to constrain emissions accumulated over a prolonged period of time, and if future <b>policy-makers</b> tend, with a certain chance, to a less ambitious climate policy, then current <b>policy-makers</b> should intensify their efforts to reduce emissions {{and the cost of}} emission reduction. In this setting, if current <b>policy-makers</b> want to meet a cumulative emission contraint in expectation, then the preferred policy trajectory does not qualitatively deviate from one suggested by a standard cost-effective trajectory. If, however, the constraint is to be met with a certain probability, then the importance of early action is enhanced relative to that of postponed action. Costs substantially increase if current <b>policy-makers</b> want to set long-term goals without the full cooperation of future <b>policy-makers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} policy-makers' horizons on the sustainability of international cooperation. We describe a prisoners' dilemma game between two infinitely-lived organizations (countries) run by agents (<b>policy-makers)</b> with a shorter tenure. The agents' mandates are finite but potentially renewable and staggered across different organizations. We show that the efficient cooperative equilibrium is only sustainable when <b>policy-makers</b> are re-electable. Moreover, re-election incentives {{can act as a}} discipline device, making it easier to sustain cooperation between <b>policy-makers</b> with renewable mandates than between <b>policy-makers</b> who are automatically re-elected. However, if the chances of re-election depend significantly on recent performance, <b>policy-makers</b> will collude to get re-elected. In this case, term limits may help to sustain international cooperation. overlapping generations; re-election incentives; self-enforcing cooperation...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued in {{previous}} issues of this journal that health technology assessment {{can be used as}} a tool to assess the eciency of pharmaceutical care by linking its impact on clinical and humanistic outcomes to the resources required to achieve these outcomes. Additionally, as <b>policy-makers</b> appreciate the need to evaluate projects on the basis of their costs and benefits, the application of health technology assessment to pharmaceutical care may serve as a way of communicating with <b>policy-makers</b> and informing policy on pharmaceutical care. This article elaborates on this idea by arguing that <b>policy-makers</b> will be more likely to appreciate the value of pharmaceutical care if researchers pay more attention to some methodological principles underlying health technology assessment in the context of pharmaceutical care, and if they take into account the decision-making context facing <b>policy-makers.</b> In order to raise the methodological quality of studies, researchers need to take care to define better the pharmaceutical care intervention; to evaluate the costs of the intervention and its impact on the utilization of other health services; and to aggregate the various clinical and humanistic outcome measures that are commonly used in this type of research. In order to increase the usefulness of study findings to <b>policy-makers,</b> researchers need to identify the multiple objectives that <b>policy-makers</b> pursue, and show how study findings will aid <b>policy-makers</b> in attaining these objectives. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|The Union grew rich {{fighting}} the war, as the Confederate economy was destroyed. The Republicans in control in Washington had a Whig {{vision of an}} industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories, productive farms, national banks, and high-speed rail links. The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit; with the South gone, and Northern Democrats very weak in Congress, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At {{the same time they}} passed new taxes to pay for part of the war, and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for the most of the rest. (The remainder can be charged to inflation.) They wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy. The key <b>policy-maker</b> in Congress was Thaddeus Stevens, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He took charge of major legislation that funded the war effort and revolutionized the nation's economic policies regarding tariffs, bonds, income and excise taxes, national banks, suppression of money issued by state banks, greenback currency, and western railroad land grants.|$|E

40|$|We use {{a simple}} {{model of a}} closed economy to study the {{recommendations}} of monetary <b>policy-makers</b> attempting to respond optimally to an asset-price bubble whose stochastic properties they understand. We focus on the impact which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates has on the recommendations of such <b>policy-makers.</b> For a given target inflation rate, we identify several different forms of ‘insurance’ which <b>policy-makers</b> could potentially take out against encountering the ZLB due to the future bursting of a bubble. Even with perfect knowledge of the bubble process, however, which of these will be optimal varies from one type of bubble to another and, for certain bubbles, from one period to the next. It is therefore difficult to draw general conclusions {{as to whether the}} ZLB should cause <b>policy-makers</b> to operate policy more tightly or loosely than otherwise, while a bubble is growing – even after abstracting from the informational difficulties they face in practice. We also examine the implications of the ZLB for policy-makers’ preferences as to their inflation target. <b>Policy-makers</b> who wish to avoid concerns about the ZLB should take care not to set too low a target, especially if the neutral real interest rate is low. Such <b>policy-makers</b> should also set a higher target inflation rate if the economy’s natural propensity to rebound from a shock to output is weak, or if output is relatively unresponsive to real interest rate settings. monetary policy; asset-price bubbles; zero lower bound...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Research {{findings}} {{are increasingly being}} recognized as an important input {{in the formation of}} health policy. There is concern that research {{findings are}} not being utilized by health <b>policy-makers</b> {{to the extent that they}} could be. The factors influencing the utilization of various types of research by health <b>policy-makers</b> are beginning to emerge in the literature, however there is still little known about these factors in developing countries. The object of this study was to explore these factors by examining the policy-making process for a pharmaceutical policy common in developing countries; an essential medicines list. Methods A study of the selection and updating of Mali's national essential medicines list was undertaken using qualitative methods. In-depth semi-structured interviews and a natural group discussion were held with national <b>policy-makers,</b> most specifically members of the national commission that selects and updates the country's list. The resulting text was analyzed using a phenomenological approach. A document analysis was also performed. Results Several factors emerged from the textual data that appear to be influencing the utilization of health research findings for these <b>policy-makers.</b> These factors include: access to information, relevance of the research, use of research perceived as a time consuming process, trust in the research, authority of those who presented their view, competency in research methods, priority of research in the policy process, and accountability. Conclusion Improving the transfer of research to policy will require effort on the part of researchers, <b>policy-makers,</b> and third parties. This will include: collaboration between researchers and <b>policy-makers,</b> increased production and dissemination of relevant and useful research, and continued and improved technical support from networks and multi-national organizations. <b>Policy-makers</b> from developing countries will then be better equipped to make informed decisions concerning their health policy issues. </p...|$|R
