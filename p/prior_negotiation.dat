40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the viability of the}} exclusionary rule against <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> in the interpretation of contracts in Singapore. It argues that the exclusionary rule should no longer be followed in Singapore through three main points. First, the Singapore courts retain entire freedom to depart from the exclusionary rule as it is not of legislative origin. Second, the Singapore courts should exercise this freedom because there is already local precedent, wherein the Singapore courts have referred to <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> in the interpretation of contracts. Even if these local precedents are wrong, there remain convincing, independent reasons as to why the exclusionary rule should be rejected. Primarily, the rule is not supported as a matter of history and evolved through a misstep in a series of early- 20 th-century cases. Third, the rejection of the exclusionary rule does not mean that <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> are always admissible in the contractual interpretative exercise: the challenge for the Singapore courts is to recognise exactly why such evidence is inadmissible, instead of following a blanket rule that is (as will be argued) unsupported by either its supposed longevity or substantive justifications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML), an OASIS {{standard}} {{language for}} the specification of access control rules, {{has been widely}} deployed in many Web-based systems.

This makes collaboration between and integration over applications and domains using disparate policy language difficult and requires <b>prior</b> <b>negotiation</b> and agreement between them. Rule Interchange Format (RIF) is an interlingua being developed at W 3 C to allow the exchange of rules between rule systems. We propose to express XACML as RIF in order to enable XACML policy rules to be understood by any RIF based system. In this paper, we present the design of our translator from/to XACML to/from RIF by mapping XACML constructs to RIF.

40|$|A reason {{justifying}} the exclusionary rule against <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{in the interpretation}} of contracts is its longevity. Yet, the authorities commonly cited in support of the exclusionary rule are mostly traceable to Lord Wilberforce’s speech in the relatively recent case of Prenn v Simmonds. This article suggests that the law took a wrong turn in that case and caused later courts to support the exclusionary rule by recourse to policy-oriented justifications, instead of principle-based ones. The emphasis on policy-oriented justifications, and the recantation of Prenn v Simmonds as reason enough for the exclusionary rule, support an independent rule against <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> that was never meant to be. The consequence is the judicial (and academic) acknowledgement of the exclusionary rule’s uncertain boundaries, and the simultaneous maintenance of its legitimacy...|$|R

5000|$|One {{point of}} {{controversy}} was Lord Hoffmann's acceptance {{that the courts}} would not look at <b>negotiations</b> <b>prior</b> to the contract {{as an aid to}} interpretation. Professor G McMeel has argued that, [...] "The best way forward is for the matter to be one of weight rather than admissibility." [...] In other words, that evidence of negotiations may not necessarily weigh very heavily in the face of contradictory evidence in a contract itself, but it should not be barred entirely. Declarations of subjective intent, <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> and subsequent conduct should not be ruled out as irrelevant where they could be a valuable aid to interpretation. Lord Nicholls has also been supportive of this view, and has argued that in fact evidence of <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> and conduct subsequent to the conclusion of a contract are already admissible for cases on rectification (e.g. The Karen Oltman 1976 2 Lloyd’s Rep 708). He argues the courts are well accustomed to determining what weight should be place on admissible evidence. Finally, the absolute bar on admissibility on <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> also stands at odds with art 5-102(a), Principles of European Contract Law. This document, which draws on principles found across most European Union member states that preliminary negotiations are relevant to interpretation. The exclusion may also be seen to be at odds with the leading case on statutory interpretation, Pepper v Hart, in which the House of Lords held that it would have recourse to authoritative statements of purpose by ministers or promoters of Bills in Hansard when ascertaining the meaning of a statute.|$|R

This {{may not always be}} compatible with the duty of care for the resource and its environment expressed in Agenda 21 of UNCED. It is suggested here how ancillary considerations, with the consensus of all interested parties, might be included in a resource allocation negotiation, following a procedure which could have broader applications elsewhere. A distinction is made in the negotiating process between the proposal of technical factors by interested parties, their quantification for each party, best accomplished by an impartial review panel, and the relative weightings finally given to each technical factor, decided by negotiation. Negotiations could efficiently focus on these weightings within a spreadsheet matrix of numerical values by interested party and factor. From a hypothetical example, it seems that <b>prior</b> <b>negotiation</b> on which factors to include may be unnecessary with multiple participants: any factor not achieving general consensus will have a low weighting, and a relatively minor influence on the final allocations. ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting {{the modern}} {{position}} since unfair terms legislation was enacted, the most quoted passage in English courts on the canons of interpretation {{is found in}} Lord Hoffmann's judgment in ICS Ltd v West Bromwich BS. Lord Hoffmann restated the law that a document's meaning is {{what it would mean}} (1) to a reasonable person (2) with knowledge of the context, or the whole matrix of fact (3) except <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> (4) and meaning does not follow what the dictionary says but meaning understood from its context (5) and the meaning should not contradict common sense. The objective is always to give effect to the intentions of the parties. While it remains the law for reasons of litigation cost, there is some contention over how far evidence of <b>prior</b> <b>negotiations</b> should be excluded by the courts. It appears increasingly clear that the courts may adduce evidence of negotiations where it would clearly assist in construing the meaning of an agreement. This approach to interpretation has some overlap with the right of the parties to seek [...] "rectification" [...] of a document, or requesting from a court to read a document not literally but with regard to what the parties can otherwise show was really intended.|$|R

40|$|CloudAnchor is a multiagent {{e-commerce}} platform {{which offers}} brokerage and resource trading services to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers and consumers. The {{access to these}} services requires the <b>prior</b> <b>negotiation</b> of Service Level Agreements (SLA) between the parties. In particular, the brokerage SLA (bSLA), which is mandatory for a business {{to have access to}} the platform, specifies the brokerage fee the business will pay every time it successfully trades a resource within the platform. However, while the negotiation of the resource SLA (rSLA) includes the uptime of the service, the brokerage SLA was negotiated for an unspecified time span. Since the commercial relationship – defined through the bSLA – between a business and the platform can be long lasting, it is essential for businesses to be able to renegotiate the bSLA terms, i. e., renegotiate the brokerage fee. To address this issue, we designed a bSLA renegotiation mechanism, which takes into account the duration of the bSLA as well as the past behaviour (trust) and success (transactions) of the business in the CloudAnchor platform. The results show that the implemented bSLA renegotiation mechanism privileges, first, the most reliable businesses, and, then, those with higher volume of transactions, ensuring that the most reliable businesses get the best brokerage fees and resource prices. The proposed renegotiation mechanism promotes the fulfilment of SLA by all parties and increases the satisfaction of the trustworthy businesses in the CloudAnchor platform. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} process by which decisions are made in magistrates' courts as to whether adult defendants charged with either way offences should be tried or sentenced in that court or at the Crown Court. An empirical study of three magistrates' courts in England suggests that a series of piecemeal initiatives geared explicitly towards a policy objective of restricting the number of cases reaching the Crown Court have only had a limited impact because they have failed {{to become part of the}} culture of the lay magistracy. It is argued that there is a lack of impetus coming from within magistrates' courts to complete more cases as court participants in general do not appear to acknowledge the validity of that objective. A secondary objective has been the enhancement of consistency between courts when determining which cases can be completed by magistrates in the public interest. The findings of this study suggest that the prime explanation for variations between courts lies in individual court culture and the effect that this has on the working practices of all court participants. It is suggested that most mode decisions are effectively not taken by magistrates, but are the outcome of <b>prior</b> <b>negotiation</b> between lawyers. But this negotiation is conducted within the context of a shared understanding as to which cases that particular court was likely to retain and which were likely to be committed to the Crown Court...|$|E

' This is the idea that competition among large countries (US/EU) to negotiate preferential arrangements with smaller countries or regions will lower barriers, and eventually add fresh impulse to new multilateral WTO negotiations. In commercial policy terms, the US interest in such an arrangement lies in improved access to a smaller but more protected market where the EU already has preferential arrangements, and the SACU interest lies in improved access to a much larger but less protected market. There is also a SACU interest in weakening the trade restrictive effects of MFA quotas in the US for apparel imports. The risk of entrapment in extremely complex rules of origin arrangements which at times close markets (as in NAFTA and other US bilaterals) is a concern for SACU. Also, gains to SACU may be only temporary because of the US proposal to eliminate non agricultural tariffs entirely in the WTO by 2015. In key non commodity trade areas (services, investment, intellectual property, temporary entry of business persons), if other US bilaterals are any guide most liberalization requested will be heavily asymmetric if not unilateral on the SACU side. SACU does not currently cover any of these items since it is only a customs union, and <b>prior</b> <b>negotiation</b> will be needed among SACU countries. SACU also clearly has an interest in coordinating its negotiation with other US bilateral negotiating partners. These and other barriers to negotiation (including negotiating capacity constraints in several SACU members) will influence the outcome of negotiations. ...|$|E

However because bio-industry feature long research and development time, high investment risks, intensive research and development costs, and a high degree of concentration of intellectual property (IP), the promotion of such industry needs deliberation. With regard to IP management and protection, how to effectively utilize the various intangible properties derived from during or after the R&D process will be a critical issue in deciding whether biotechnology industry in Taiwan a success or failure. In recent years, the idea of ‘patent pool' has become a trend in maneuvering intellectual resources within certain industries. The immediate positive effects of adopting patent pool can be many: providing easy access to a cluster of intellectual properties necessary for specific product, understanding potential competitor's strength and weakness, avoiding likely IP litigation, saving resources on <b>prior</b> <b>negotiation</b> and subsequent dispute settlement. Moreover, a patent pool will facilitate efficient licensing activities, provide crucial industrial information and enhance technology transfer. These advantages are very much needed in dealing with the problems that small and middle Chinese herbal medicine companies of limited resources and poor IP portfolio are facing. This study attempts to propose a working model aiming at Chinese herbal medicine industry and apply to the current industry to examine whether it will fit or not. By means of on-site interview with the CEOs from the leading companies, the study wishes to collect opinions as objective as possible to feedback on modifying the working model.
