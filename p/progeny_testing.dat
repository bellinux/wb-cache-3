In addition to evaluations of growth and conformation in the live animals, carcases, including fat composition, are evaluated.

Female progeny go to a test station in Moussour in Corrèze, where they are inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The test station evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their daughters are identified as Maternal Qualities (in French Qualités Maternelles, abbreviated to QM).|$|E

The tests were made by International Poultry Testing Station in Ústrašice and methodology {{was based on the}} guidelines for the implementation of poultry performance testing. Parental test consisted of rearing parents until the age of 210 days, the laying preparation period of 211 ? 285 days, the rearing period at duration 160 days and from two fattening <b>progeny</b> <b>tests</b> lasting for 56 and 112 days. Higher live weight at 1 day, 56 day and 210 days of age during parental test was found out at gangers compare to geese. The higher number of eggs in the initial stage (66. 3 eggs) and number of hatched goslings (46. 4 heads) were found out at two-year-old geese. The above-average temperatures in May caused premature drop of lying at three-year-old geese. The highest breast muscle weight (430 g) at 1 st fattening <b>progeny</b> <b>test</b> at 56 days of age was at three-year old geese. It was only about 14 g higher in comparison with progeny of two-year-old geese and about 30 g higher in comparison with one-year-old geese.

40|$|Large <b>progeny</b> <b>test</b> {{networks}} are typical for conventional forest tree breeding programmes.

Several approaches have been introduced to manage the unbalanced and diverse nature of the data generated by <b>progeny</b> <b>tests.</b> This report presents a procedure for ranking breeding material {{on the basis of}} ”messy ” data. Plot means were used as input values and missing plots were estimated from least squares. The differences between test means and variances were standardised by the performance level method. The different precision of the tests was quantified through the reliability coefficient. In order to facilitate the selection of plus trees for different purposes, all the available test results were combined into a single variable that was used for ranking. Three different kinds of ranking variable were calculated and each of them proved to be more useful for the selection of plus trees than an arithmetic or weighted mean. One of them, WMEAN, relied on the reliability and number of the <b>progeny</b> <b>tests,</b> while the others, WCONF 0. 50 and WCONF 0. 10, relied on the standard error of the plus tree mean, thus emphasising the precision of the values obtained. The analyses were carried out with SAS ® procedures, which require only moderate skills in statistics, programming and data processing technology. The procedure has functioned well throughout an eightyear development phase.
