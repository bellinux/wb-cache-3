50|$|One common {{mechanism}} for synthesizing hydroxyurea {{is by the}} reaction of calcium cyanate with hydroxylamine nitrate in absolute ethanol and by the reaction of salt (i.e. sodium or <b>potassium)</b> <b>cyanates</b> and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in aqueous solution. Hydroxyurea has also been prepared by converting a quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin from the chloride form to the cyanate form with sodium cyanate and reacting the resin in the cyanate form with hydroxylamine hydrochloride.

40|$|The bifunctional enzyme ribulosebisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4. 1. 1. 39) {{provides}} a common link between photosynthetic CO(, 2) fixation and photorespiration in higher plants. In {{spite of its}} abundance and physiological importance, relatively little is known concerning the essential amino acids and localization of large subunit binding domains involved in the catalytic functions and metabolite regulation of this key photosynthetic enzyme. ^ Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) inactivation of Rubisco at pH 6. 0 exhibited rate saturation, a second order rate constant of 2. 5 M(2 ̆ 7 - 1) s(2 ̆ 7 - 1) and a reaction order of 0. 92. Excellent protection against inactivation was afforded by the phosphorylated substrate RuBP and the competitive inhibitors sedoheptulosebisphosphate and inorganic phosphate. The formation of ethoxyformyl histidine residues was accompanied {{by an increase in}} absorbance at 239 nm ((DELTA) A(, 239)). Verification that all of the Rubisco amino acid residues modified by DEP at pH 6. 0 were histidine was accomplished by simultaneous determination of (DELTA) A(, 239) and (2 ̆ 714) CDEP-incorporation. We have demonstrated the presence of a single histidyl residue per 69 -kilodalton enzyme protomer which appears to be essential for activity and resides in the large catalytic subunit by modification with DEP at pH 6. 0. This histidyl residue may, indeed, function as the base required to create the carbanion at C- 2 of RuBP in the proposed carboxylase reaction mechanism. Chemical modification by rose bengal, methylene blue, pyridoxal 52 ̆ 7 -phosphate, <b>potassium</b> ferrate, <b>cyanate</b> and periodate were attempted, but problems with each experimental system allowed no definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding essential groups for catalysis or effector modulation in Rubisco. ^ Characterization of homogeneous Rubisco isolated from diploid and tetraploid cultivars of perennial ryegrass reportedly differing in photorespiration revealed virtually identical K(,m) (CO(, 2)) values for fully CO(, 2) /Mg(2 ̆ 72 +) -activated enzyme and CO(, 2) /Mg(2 ̆ 72 +) -activation and deactivation kinetics. The doubling of ploidy also had no effect on the quantity of total soluble protein or Rubisco protein in young, fully expanded ryegrass leaves. ^ Hydroxylamine, a reported differential modulator of Rubisco, was found to inhibit both the carboxylase and oxygenase activities when assayed separately or simultaneously. Two inhibitory processes were observed: a slow reaction of hydroxylamine with RuBP and a rapid, direct inhibition of the enzyme. ...|$|R

The final step is a claisen condensation of 15 with ethyl quininate 16, which after acidic workup yields racemic quinotoxine 17. The desired enantiomer is obtained by chiral resolution with the chiral dibenzoyl ester of Tartaric acid. The conversion of this compound to quinine is based on the Rabe/Kindler chemistry discussed in the timelime.|$|E
5000|$|Vitalism {{survived for}} a while even after the rise of modern atomic theory and the {{replacement}} of the Aristotelian elements by those we know today. It first came under question in 1824, when Friedrich Wöhler synthesized oxalic acid, a compound known to occur only in living organisms, from cyanogen. A more decisive experiment was Wöhler's 1828 synthesis of urea from the inorganic salts <b>potassium</b> <b>cyanate</b> and ammonium sulfate. Urea had long been considered an [...] "organic" [...] compound, as it was known to occur only in the urine of living organisms. Wöhler's experiments were followed by many others, in which increasingly complex [...] "organic" [...] substances were produced from [...] "inorganic" [...] ones without the involvement of any living organism.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{carbonate}} crystals {{are destroyed}} by the melting process so that the urea can react with almost all potassium ions to convert to <b>potassium</b> <b>cyanate</b> {{at a higher rate}} than when {{in the form of a}} salt. This makes it easier to reach higher purities above 95%. It can also be made by oxidizing potassium cyanide at a high temperature in the presence of oxygen or easily reduced oxides, such as lead, tin, or manganese dioxide, and in aqueoues solution by reacting with hypochlorites or hydrogen peroxide. Another way to synthesize it is to allow an alkali metal, cyanide, to react with oxygen in nickel containers under controlled conditions. It can be formed by the oxidation of ferrocyanide. Lastly, it can be made by heating potassium cyanide with lead oxide.|$|E

The (±)-cis isomers are the form used recreationally.The (±)-cis isomers (1:1-mixture) of the (4R,5S)-isomer generally synthesized from dl-phenylpropanolamine in one step by cyclization with cyanogen bromide (sometimes prepared in situ by reacting sodium cyanide with bromine). Alternate synthesis routes generally involve more steps, such as replacing cyanogen bromide with sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>cyanate</b> {{to form an}} intermediate and then reacting it with concentrated hydrochloric acid. A method reported in microgram replaced {{the need for a}} separate addition of hydrochloric acid by starting with the hydrochloride salt of the dl-phenylpropanolamine but side-products are noted. The (±)-trans isomers (1:1-mixture) of the (4S,5S)-isomer are synthesized in the same manner above but dl-norephedrine is used as the starting material instead. The cyanate reaction proceeds differently from the cyanogen bromide and transforms norephedrine into trans-4-methylaminorex instead, as noted in the DEA micrograph. The cyanogen bromide, by comparison, transformed norephedrine into the cis isomer and norpseudoephedrine into the trans isomers of the final product.|$|E

40|$|The recent use of urea as a {{treatment}} for the crisis phase of sickle-cell anemia has prompted us to investigate the possibility that cyanate, which is in equilibrium with urea in solution, might itself prevent the sickling of erythrocytes. We have found that in contrast to the high concentration of urea (1 M) needed to prevent reversibly the in vitro sickling of 80 % of the cells, <b>potassium</b> <b>cyanate</b> (0. 01 - 0. 10 M) irreversibly inhibits sickling to the same extent. The prevention of sickling {{is a function of the}} amount of [14 C]cyanate incorporated into acidprecipitable protein (0. 1 - 1. 0 mol of cyanate per mol of hemoglobin). Most of the radioactivity is accounted for by carbamylation of the NH 2 -terminal valine residues of hemoglobin; there is no detectable carbamylation of the lysine or cysteine residues. The reactive species, HN=C=O (isocyanic acid), may be an analog of O=C=O since both compounds bind to the same valine residues of hemoglobin.

The proportion of free amino groups in the carbamyl-LDL was negatively correlated (r = - 0. 95) with the time of incubation in <b>potassium</b> <b>cyanate</b> (ranged from 5 to 360 min). The carbamylation did not change the chemical composition or the flotation characteristics of the LDL particles.

The carbamyl-LDL had substantially decreased binding to the LDL apoB/E receptors of the bovine adrenocortical membranes {{when compared to the}} control-LDL. The reduced binding was already observed when only 9 % of the free amino groups were derived from carbamyl. A minor carbamylation of LDL (less than 20 % of the free amino groups) decreased the in vivo clearance of LDL from rabbit plasma.

LDL isolated from uremic patients was cleared in rabbits at a slower rate than LDL isolated from a control subject.
