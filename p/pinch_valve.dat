The sleeve material can be selected upon the corrosiveness and abrasiveness of the flow media, a suitable synthetic polymer can be chosen.

The greater efficiency of the jet ejector is achieved by properly mixing propelled and motive streams.

40|$|Among {{many other}} {{potential}} applications, intermittent solid slug feeders {{can be used}} to effectively inject biomass materials into fluidized bed reactors for pyrolysis. In particular, these feeders {{can be used to}} convey biomass materials that are highly cohesive to prevent plugging or undesirable reaction in the feeding tube. Although feeders of this design have been shown to work very effectively, they have not been studied in detail or optimized for the pyrolysis process. In addition, the operating conditions required to obtain predictable and consistent mass flow rates and slugs of desirable characteristics need to be established. The purpose of this work was to design, build and demonstrate the operation of a horizontal intermittent solid slug feeder and to test it with sawdust as the feed material. Sawdust is an extremely cohesive and difficult biomass to inject, but one that holds great potential as an important renewable feedstock for pyrolysis. The intermittent feeder designed for this work consisted of a pressurized vertical solids storage silo leading to a pneumatic <b>pinch</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>pinch</b> <b>valve,</b> controlled by solenoid valves connected to a relay timer, released the feed into a horizontal feeding tube at a ninety degree angle. Within the silo, a rotating mixer prevented the bridging of solids. Intermittent pulses of gas from a control volume were fed into the horizontal feeding tube, as well as, in some cases, a continuous gas flow. The timing of the pulses was controlled by solenoid valves with a relay timer. While the <b>pinch</b> <b>valve</b> is opened, solids fall into the horizontal feeding tube forming a plug, which is then propelled by the pulsating gas into the reactor. The solid mass flow rate was experimentally measured by collecting the solids and continuously measuring the mass using a digital balance. Several variables were tested in order to optimize the performance of the feeder and the consistency of the feeding rate. They included the silo pressure, mixing rate, gas pulse pressure and volume, continuous gas mass flow rate, and the open pinch-valve time interval. The goals of this optimization were (a) to maximize the solid-to-gas ratio of mass flow rates, since the gas mass flux must be minimized to avoid wasting energy, and (b) to define operating conditions required to inject consistent biomass mass flow rates suitable for a laboratory scale pyrolysis reactor, and (c) to propose initial design criteria and a calibration procedure for intermittent solid slug feeders. The results demonstrated that the intermittent solid slug feeder system successfully achieved the desired objectives and showed how to efficiently select its optimum operating conditions...|$|E

Several steps are required for nucleic acids extraction, impurity washes, and DNA/RNA elution. Careful sample {{preparation is}} vital to the obtaining of reliable diagnosis, especially with low copies of pathogens and cells. This paper describes a low-cost, disposable lab cartridge for automatic sample preparation, which is capable of handling flexible sample volumes of 10 μl to 1 ml. This plastic cartridge contains all the necessary reagents for pathogen and cell lysis, DNA/RNA extraction, impurity washes, DNA/RNA elution and waste processing in a completely sealed cartridge. The entire sample preparation processes are automatically conducted within the cartridge on a desktop unit using a pneumatic fluid manipulation approach. Reagents transportation is achieved with a combination of push and pull forces (with compressed air and vacuum, respectively), which are connected to the pneumatic inlets at the bottom of the cartridge. These pneumatic forces are regulated by <b>pinch</b> <b>valve</b> manifold and two pneumatic syringe pumps within the desktop unit. The performance of this pneumatic reagent delivery method was examined. We have demonstrated the capability of the on-cartridge RNA extraction and cancer-specific gene amplification from 10 copies of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells.

40|$|Relief {{organizations}} and governments strive to provide {{safe drinking water}} to natural disaster survivors as quickly as possible. However, drinking water is typically provided either as bottled water or via mobile water treatment equipment, both {{of which can be}} difficult or expensive to transport rapidly into disaster zones. An alternative is the waterbag point-of-use treatment device developed at Cal Poly that allows survivors to produce safe drinking water from contaminated local sources. The waterbag is a 10 -L bladder designed for use with Procter 2 ̆ 6 Gamble Purifier of Water (PŪR®) sachets, which contain coagulant and chlorine compounds. Following treatment with PŪR®, treated water in the waterbag is flowed through an outlet port to a filter, primarily for parasitic cyst removal. Currently, the commercial version of the waterbag uses an effective but expensive hollow-fiber membrane microfilter (3 ̆e 10 each). This cost will likely decrease the use of the waterbag by relief organizations responding to large disasters. The goal of the present thesis research was to develop a novel, low cost (5), effective, low-profile filter to be used with the waterbag in large-scale disaster relief. This new filter is referred to as an envelope filter due to its geometry and size. Various prototype envelope filters were constructed using layers of nonwoven polypropylene filter cloth. Two types of cloth were used: a nominally-rated 1 -µm pore size cloth and an absolute-rated 1 -µm cloth. The filters tested were both internal and external to the waterbag and of various geometries. Filters were attached to the waterbag and used to filter defined test water after it had been treated with a PŪR® sachet. Test water for design experiments consisted of tap water with addition of standard dust (to increase turbidity) and seasalts (to increase salinity). In addition to this basic test water, mock U. S. EPA Challenge Water # 2 with added bacteria and cyst surrogates (fluorescent microspheres) was used to evaluate the filter prototype designs prior to testing according to U. S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers in a commercial laboratory. The filter design and mock challenge experiment results indicated that a 2 -ply filter with one nominal and one absolute layer was the optimal filter design. In the mock U. S. EPA challenge tests, a flowrate of 20 mL/min allowed this filter met the turbidity, bacteria, and microsphere removal requirements determined by the WHO and The Sphere Project for emergency drinking water treatment as well as the U. S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers [...] This filter design was further tested using the U. S. EPA Challenge Water # 2 with triplicate waterbags at the U. S. EPA-certified BioVir Laboratories in Benicia, Calif. All three waterbags with envelope filters met the recommendations for turbidity (3 ̆c 5 3 ̆eNTU) and for virus removal (3 ̆e 4 -log removal). Two of the three waterbags met the bacteria and microsphere removal requirements (3 ̆e 6 - and 3 ̆e 3 -log removal, respectively). The failure of one of the prototypes to meet the requirements could have been due to improper setting of valve that throttled the flowrate through the filter or due to a slightly leaking hose <b>pinch</b> <b>valve.</b> Future work should include incorporating more reliable valves and improving the envelope filter design and materials to achieve higher allowable flowrates...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis was aimed at developing the understanding of two regimes in vertical gas-liquid flow in tubes, namely annular flow and churn flow. In annular flow, there is a continuous gas passage at {{the centre of the}} pipe with a film of liquid travelling upwards at the wall. Part of the liquid phase in annular flow may be entrained as droplets in the core gas flow. In churn flow there is also a gas core (which the present work has shown to be continuous) and a liquid film; however, the flow direction of the liquid in this film varies with time. Thus, the liquid flows upwards in large waves {{on the surface of the}} film; between the waves, the film may change direction and flow downwards towards the next wave. Such flows are extremely complex and there are aspects of their behaviour which are poorly understood. In the work {{described in}} this thesis, several areas have been studied. Disturbance waves are of central importance in annular flows. Such waves are characterised by their large amplitudes relative to the mean film thickness, their high translation velocities relative to the mean film speed, and their circumferential coherence (i. e. their “ring-like” structure when fully developed). An important part of the present work was concerned with the existence, development and translation of disturbance waves in upwards, gas-liquid annular flows. At very low liquid flow rates, disturbance waves are not formed (and, as other work has shown, the entrainment of droplets from the liquid film is negligible). In the present work, multiple conductance probe units have been employed to study the growth and development of disturbance waves. From the results, it is found that disturbance waves begin to appear and to start to achieve their circumferential coherence from lengths as short as 5 – 10 pipe diameters downstream of the liquid injection location; this coherence gradually strengthens with increasing distance from the inlet. It is further shown that the spectral content of the entire interfacial wave activity shifts to lower frequencies with increasing axial 3 distance from the inlet, with the peak frequency levelling off after approximately 20 pipe diameters. Interestingly, on the other hand, the frequency of occurrence of the disturbance waves first increases away from the inlet as these waves form, reaches a maximum at a length between 7. 5 and 15 pipe diameters depending on the flow conditions, and then decreases again. This trend becomes increasingly evident at higher gas and/or liquid flow-rates. Both wave frequency measures increase monotonically at higher gas and/or liquid flowrates. Important evidence regarding the mechanisms of disturbance waves and the associated droplet entrainment can be obtained by the axial view photography technique. This technique is described in Chapters 3 and 6. The technique was used to visualise the wave characteristics, in particular of the two entrainment mechanisms (bag break up and ligament break up mechanisms) proposed previously by Azzopardi (1983). The axial view photography technique provided visual evidence for the existence of the two mechanisms, although in contrast to Azzopardi’s findings, both break up mechanisms were observed to occur simultaneously. The axial view photography technique was also used in the present work to provide further insights into the inception of disturbance waves. It was found that the initiation mechanism for disturbance waves was the occurrence of a disturbance at a given location around the tube periphery. This is consistent with the idea of a link between turbulent burst phenomena and disturbance waves first proposed by Azzopardi and Martin (1986). The initial disturbance links up with similar disturbances to ultimately form the characteristic ring-like structure characteristic of fully developed disturbance waves. In churn flow the present work concentrated on three aspects: The use of axial view photography to explore the continuity of the gas core in churn flow. The development (in collaboration with two other research students –Deng Peng and Masroor Ahmad) of a correlation for entrainment rate and hence entrained fraction in churn flow. Measurements of 4 pressure gradient and holdup in churn flow, from which an average wall shear stress can be deduced. In the first task, it was shown (it is believed for the first time) that there is a continuous path for the gas phase near the tube axis. In churn flow the behaviour of entrained fraction is extremely complex and conventional methods for measuring it are no longer valid. Barbosa etal (2002) studied entrainment in churn flow using iso-kinetic sampling probes and the correlation referred to above was based on this data. The correlation has been widely used in predicting the entrained fraction at the transition between churn and annular flow. Since the direction of flow of the liquid film near the channel wall fluctuates, it is difficult to estimate the instantaneous value of wall shear stress. However, if measurements are made of total pressure gradient and liquid holdup, then the mean value of wall shear stress can be estimated. This procedure was pursued by Govan (1990) who used mechanically operated quick-closing valves to measure holdup. In the current work, a new measurement technique was utilised, namely quick closing <b>pinch</b> <b>valve</b> which offer a great accuracy and are easy to install. Pressure gradient and hold up data were collected over a wide range of gas and liquid flowrate. An averaged wall shear stress was then calculated based on these measurements. At higher liquid mass flow rates, the results were in good qualitative agreement with those of Govan (1990) but (at lower mass fluxes) anomalies occur which need further investigation.

Instrumentation and systems were developed to interface such cartridge systems: (i) implementing microfluidic handling, (ii) executing thermal control during biochemical protocols and (iii) detection of biomolecules associated with inherited or infectious disease. This system implements biochemical protocols for DNA extraction, amplification and detection. A digital microfluidic chip (ElectroWetting on Dielectric) manipulated droplets of sample and reagent implementing sample preparation protocols. The cartridge system also integrated a planar magnetic microcoil device to generate local magnetic field gradients, manipulating magnetic beads. For hybridisation detection a fluorescence microarray, screening for mutations associated with CFTR gene is printed on a waveguide surface and integrated within the cartridge. A second cartridge system was developed to implement amplification and detection screening for DNA associated with disease-causing pathogens e. g. Escherichia coli. This system incorporates (i) elastomeric <b>pinch</b> <b>valves</b> isolating liquids during biochemical protocols and (ii) a silver nanoparticle microarray for fluorescent signal enhancement, using localized surface plasmon resonance. The microfluidic structures facilitated the sample and reagent to be loaded and moved between chambers with external heaters implementing thermal steps for nucleic acid amplification and detection. In a technique allowing probe DNA to be immobilised within a microfluidic system using (3 D) hydrogel structures a prepolymer solution containing probe DNA was formulated and introduced into the microfluidic channel. Photo-polymerisation was undertaken forming 3 D hydrogel structures attached to the microfluidic channel surface. The prepolymer material, poly-ethyleneglycol (PEG), was used to form hydrogel structures containing probe DNA. This hydrogel formulation process was fast compared to conventional biomolecule immobilization techniques and was also biocompatible with the immobilised biomolecules, as verified by on-chip hybridisation assays. This process allowed control over hydrogel height growth at the micron scale...|$|R
40|$|Aeroengines {{incorporate}} various bearing chambers {{that house}} the shaft bearings {{and the oil}} used to cool and lubricate these bearings must subsequently be recovered from these chambers. Effective oil removal (scavenge) is essential to avoid heat generation through unnecessary working of the oil {{which can lead to}} excessive heat generation and reduced overall efficiency. Therefore the design of the scavenge region (sump) in a bearing chamber, as well as the ability to assess its performance is very important. An ongoing research program into bearing chamber scavenge comprising experimental and computational components is being conducted at the University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems. This program is enhancing understanding of sump performance and design. In this paper an experimental study into a simplified but representative scavenge is reported. This experimental work helps to further understanding of the complex two-phase flow physics in a bearing chamber, particularly in the scavenge region, by means of various measurements and flow visualization. For the study a bespoke test rig has been built. It consists of a simplified, generic bearing chamber with simple sump geometry constructed entirely of Perspex to allow visualization. A shaft in the centre of the chamber capable of rotating up to 15, 000 rpm is employed to introduce a windage flow in the chamber. Water (the working fluid) is fed to the chamber via an inlet pump and an outlet pump removes liquid from the chamber, closing the circuit. Several pneumatic <b>pinch</b> <b>valves</b> are installed in the flow circuit to allow residence volume measurement. A completely air-tight reservoir with internal baffle functions as a simple liquid-gas separator, allowing measurement of gas volumetric flow rate in the off-take pipe; hence the scavenge ratio (ratio of total exit volume to liquid volume) can be obtained. Residence volume measurements highlight the importance of sump geometry as an ill-designed sump can lead to an undesirable increase in residence volume. Copyright © 2010 by Rolls-Royce pl...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the magnetic field}} simulation of magnetorheological fluid using finite element method. Magnetorheological fluid (MRF) is a smart material fluid carrying small magnetic particles. There are four operational mode of MRF that is squeeze mode, valve mode, shear mode and pinch mode. This thesis will focus on pinch mode which is named as magnetic gradient pinch mode (MGP). The objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} design concept of a magnetic gradient <b>pinch</b> mode <b>valve.</b> It is very important to develop a concept design because it can help in finding the possible design configuration in producing a magnetic gradient pinch shape inside the valve from the reaction of the electromagnetic. From the concept design, simulation was conducted using Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) software to get the magnetic flux density, B and magnetic field intensity, H produced by MGP valve. By getting the magnetic flux density from the finite element analysis, magnetic saturation was prevented in the valve. Magnetic saturation happened when the magnetic flux density at the valve gap is more than the maximum magnetic flux density of the MRF at 0. 78 T. Magnetic field intensity, H, determine the generated maximum yield stress. One of the proposed design which is the third design, was exhibit highest magnetic flux density, B than other two design. Therefore, the thrird design is suitable for MGP valve due to abality to produce highest yield stress, thus, can withstand higher pressure when applied...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we have {{design a}} model {{presents}} {{an example of}} pressure-driven flow and electrophoresis in a micro channel system. Researchers often use a device {{similar to the one}} in this model as an electro kinetic sample injector in biochips to obtain well-defined sample volumes of dissociated acids and salts and to transport these volumes. The model presents a study of a <b>pinched</b> injection cross <b>valve</b> during the focusing, injection, and separation stages. Focusing is obtained through pressure-driven flow of the sample and buffer solution, which confines the sample in the focusing channel. When the system reaches steady state, the pressure-driven flow is turned off and an electric field is applied along the channels. This field drives the dissociated sample ions in the focusing zone at right angles to the focusing channel and through the injection channel. A clean separation of the sample ions is important, so the model examines the effect on ion separation of different configurations of the electric field. This specific case does not account for electro osmosis because the channel surfaces are subjected to a treatment that minimizes the extension of the electric double layer...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{elastomers}} {{have demonstrated}} tremendous potential as high-strain electromechanical transducers for {{a myriad of}} novel applications across all engineering disciplines. Because their soft, viscoelastic mechanical properties {{are similar to those}} of living tissues, dielectric elastomers have garnered a strong foothold in a plethora of biomedical and biomimetic applications. Dielectric elastomers consist of a sheet of stretched rubber, or elastomer, coated on both sides with compliant electrode materials; application of a voltage generates an electrostatic pressure that deforms the elastomer. They can function as soft generators, sensors, or actuators, and this last function is the focus of this dissertation. Many design configurations are possible, such as stacks, minimum energy structures, interpenetrating polymer networks, shape memory dielectric elastomers, and others; dielectric elastomers are already being applied to many fields of biomedicine. The first part of the original research presented in this dissertation details a PDMS microfluidic system paired with a dielectric elastomer stack actuator of anisotropically prestrained VHB(TM) 4910 (3 M(TM)) and single-walled carbon nanotubes. These electroactive microfluidic devices demonstrated active increases in microchannel width when 3 and 4 kV were applied. Fluorescence microscopy also indicated an accompanying increase in channel depth with actuation. The cross-sectional area strains at 3 and 4 kV were approximately 2. 9 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. The device was then interfaced with a syringe pump, and the pressure was measured upstream. Linear pressure-flow plots were developed, which showed decreasing fluidic resistance with actuation, from 0. 192 psi/(microL/min) at 0 kV, to 0. 160 and 0. 157 psi/(microL/min) at 3 and 4 kV, respectively. This corresponds to an ~ 18 % drop in fluidic resistance at 4 kV. Active de-clogging was tested in situ with the device by introducing ~ 50 µm diameter PDMS microbeads and other smaller particulate debris into the system. After a channel blockage was confirmed, three actuation attempts successfully cleared the blockage. Further tests indicated that the device were biocompatible with HeLa cells at 3 kV. To our knowledge this is the first pairing of dielectric elastomers with microfluidics in a non-electroosmotic context. Applications may include adaptive microfilters, micro-peristaltic pumps, and reduced-complexity lab-on-a-chip devices. Dielectric elastomers can also be adapted to manipulate fluidic systems on a larger scale. The second part of the dissertation research reports a novel low-profile, biomimetic dielectric elastomer tubular actuator capable of actively controlling hydraulic flow. The tubular actuator has been established as a reliable tunable <b>valve,</b> <b>pinching</b> a secondary silicone tube completely shut in the absence of a fluidic pressure bias or voltage, offering a high degree of resistance against fluidic flow, and able to open and completely remove this resistance to flow with an applied low power actuation voltage. The system demonstrates a rise in pressure of ~ 3. 0 kPa when the dielectric elastomer valve is in the passive, unactuated state, and there is a quadratic fall in this pressure with increasing actuation voltage, until ~ 0 kPa is reached at 2. 4 kV. The device is reliable for at least 2, 000 actuation cycles for voltages at or below 2. 2 kV. Furthermore, modeling of the actuator and fluidic system yields results consistent with the observed experimental dependence of intrasystem pressure on input flow rate, actuator prestretch, and actuation voltage. To our knowledge, this is the first actuator of its type that can control fluid flow by directly actuating the walls of a tube. Potential applications may include an implantable artificial sphincter, part of a peristaltic pump, or a computerized valve for fluidic or pneumatic control. The final part of the dissertation presents a novel dielectric elastomer band with integrated rigid elements for the treatment of chronic acid reflux disorders. This dielectric elastomer ring actuator consists of a two-layer stack of prestretched VHB(TM) 4905 with SWCNT electrodes. Its transverse prestretch was maintained by selective rigidification of the VHB(TM) using a UV-curable, solution-processable polymer network. The actuator exhibited a maximum vertical (circumferential) actuation strain of 25 % at 3. 4 kV in an 24. 5 g weighted isotonic setup. It also exhibited the required passive force of 0. 25 N and showed a maximum force drop of 0. 11 N at 3. 32 kV during isometric tests at 4. 5 cm. Modeling was performed to determine the prestretches necessary to achieve maximum strain while simultaneously exerting the force of 0. 25 N, which corresponds to a required pinching pressure of 3. 35 kPa. Modeling also determined the spacing between and number of rigid elements required. The theoretical model curves were adjusted to account for the passive rigid elements, as well as for the addition of margins; the resulting plots agrees well with experiment. The performance of the DE band is comparable to that of living muscle, and this is the first application of dielectric elastomer actuators in the design of a medical implant for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Related applications that could result from this technology are very low-profile linear peristaltic pumps, artificial intestines, an artificial urethra, and artificial blood vessels...|$|R
