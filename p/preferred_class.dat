The results indicate that the subject is fundamental in the training of future biologists. Practical classes are the means to apply theory taught previously and may lead to alterations in views on relevant topics. Static viewing as well as equality noting between cell types are examples of conceptions modified due to the application of distinct methodological practices. The application of a questionnaire showed that views differed in bachelor of science (BS) Teacher Certification (TC) classes.

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that such a concept can have grand effects if it were to be practiced both in the present and in the past. Referring again to the example of slavery, if the slave-owners were forced through the veil of ignorance to imagine that they {{themselves}} may be slaves, then suddenly slavery may no longer seem justifiable. Perhaps the entire practice would have been abolished without the need for a war to settle things. A grander example would be if each individual in society were to base their practices off the fact that they could be the least advantaged member of society. In this scenario, freedom and equality could possibly coexist in a way that has been the ideal of many philosophers. For example, in the imaginary society, one might or might not be intelligent, rich, or born into a <b>preferred</b> <b>class.</b> Since one may occupy any position in the society once the veil is lifted, the device forces the parties to consider society from the perspective of all members, including the worst-off and best-off members.|$|E

First, we examine the impact of class size on student evaluations of instructor performance using a sample of approximately 1400 economics classes held at the University of Munich from Fall 1998 to Summer 2007. We offer confirmatory evidence for the recent finding of a large, highly significant, and nonlinear negative impact of class size on student evaluations of instructor effectiveness that is robust to the inclusion of course and instructor fixed effects. Beyond that, we run a survey based on the contingent valuation method and a representative sample of all Munich students of management science to quantify the welfare surplus of <b>preferred</b> <b>class</b> size. We find the average monetary value students ascribe to their <b>preferred</b> <b>class</b> size to lie between 5 and 300 Euros per semester and student.

40|$|Among the {{possible}} explanations for the puzzling observations of cosmic rays above the GZK cutoff there is growing interest in the ones that represent kinematical solutions, based either on general formulations of particle physics with small violations of Lorentz symmetry or on a quantum-gravity-motivated scheme for the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry. An unappealing aspect of these cosmic-ray-puzzle solutions is that they require {{the existence of a}} <b>preferred</b> <b>class</b> of inertial observers. Here I propose a new kinematical solution of the cosmic-ray puzzle, which does not require the existence of a <b>preferred</b> <b>class</b> of inertial observers. My proposal is a new example of a type of relativistic theories, the so-called "doubly-special-relativity" theories, which have already been studied extensively over the last two years. The core ingredient of the proposal is a deformation of Lorentz transformations in which also the Planck scale E-p (in addition to the speed-of-light scale c) is described as an invariant. Just like the introduction of the invariant c requires a deformation of the Galileian transformations into the Lorentz transformations, the introduction of the invariant E-p requires a deformation of the Lorentz transformations, but there is no special class of inertial observers. The Pierre Auger Observatory and the GLAST space telescope should {{play a key role in}} future developments of these investigations. I also emphasize that the doubly-special-relativity theory here proposed, besides providing a solution for the cosmic-ray puzzle, is also the first doubly-special-relativity theory with a natural description of macroscopic bodies, and may find applications in the context of a recently-proposed dark-energy scenario...|$|E
