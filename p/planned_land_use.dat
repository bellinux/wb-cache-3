In Slovenia the guide of how to plan the space is given in the Spatial Planning Strategy of Slovenia and other strategic and implementation documents of the spatial planning. In spatial planning it is necessary to consider both legal provisions and wishes of users of the space, and it should be directed according to the guidelines and trends of space. In the diploma thesis we analyzed the spread of built up areas and <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> regarding to the urbanization trends in the selected municipalities - the Municipality of Maribor (MOM), Hoče-Slivnica Municipality and Miklavţ na Dravskem polju Municipality, which were both part of the Municipality of Maribor until 1999. The primary purpose of the diploma thesis was to establish the trend of spreading of the planning building areas regarding the demographic and economic situation of selected municipalities and consequently to establish changes of surface in spatial acts designed for agricultural areas, forests and building land. We studied the trends in line with the demographic and economic indicators. We compared the results of demographic and economic analyses with the spatial analyses, where we have established space changes of <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> for individual categories in separate municipality over the selected time period (for the period from 1996 to 2004 or 2008). On the basis of space changes of the individual category of <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> in the municipality we have determined the indicators of spatial development and tried to find out the connection of those with demographic and economic trends. In the conclusion of the diploma thesis we found that the trend of spreading of the <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> does not necessarily follow the trends of demographic and economic development of municipalities...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Governance and Development, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 82 - 86). Bangladesh {{is one of the}} most densely populated country in the world. With the growing population, and their rising needs in diverse sectors, land use patterns are undergoing a quantitative and qualitative change in which the areas under the net cultivable land, water bodies and forest land is gradually shrinking. Besides, unplanned infrastructure development is devouring productive land. In Bangladesh, about 1 % of agricultural land in each year is transferred to another use (SFYP, 2011). If this process continues, all of our agricultural land would diminish within 100 years (Tariquzzaman, 2009). This terrible situation is very crucial for an agro-based economy. The Ministry of Land formulated a National Land Use Policy in 2001 to ensure best possible use of land resources for sustainable development. The policy highlighted the need for carrying out a National Land Zoning Program for integrated planning and management of the country’s land resources. Planned use of land according to Land Zoning Maps prepared on the basis of present and potential land uses will be ensured through enforcement of the provisions of relevant laws. The current research is an attempt to study the pattern of land use change and agricultural land transformation at Charchartala union in Asuganj Upazila, Brahmanbaria. The research also analyzed the land zoning process and established a logical approach for saving cultivable land, <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and systematic development. Compulsory Efficient Use of Land (CEUL) is the most accountable and feasible systematic approach for favorable land use and planned land zone in Bangladesh. CUEL is related to various quantitative and qualitative aspects of land resource. Holding different cartographic information, CUEL facilitates capturing, retrieval, and querying of information and provides tools to perform different analyses. Based on the primary and secondary data, this research is aimed at studying the synchronization and diachronization of land use pattern, and recommending feasible interventions and strategy of CUEL for creating an efficient and <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> policy for Bangladesh.

40|$|In rapidly {{developing}} countries where master plans quickly {{lead to new}} cities, planning professionals still lack a robust methodology for the appraisal of land use at the proposal stage. This research proposes a novel approach to master-plan appraisal based on examining whether {{the relationship between the}} <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> pattern and the proposed street layout follows a systematic spatial logic, with land use allocation correlated to accessibility characteristics of a location. Each land use zone is given a score that reflects the degree to which it is connected to every other land use zone in the master plan. The scores are derived from topological analysis of the urban street grid using sDNA (spatial domain network analysis) methodology. 1 Our analysis supports the hypothesis of a systematic link between connectivity and land use class in general and also reveals certain specific features of land use decision-making in the city. This includes a tendency for public uses to be located on small sites and in the periphery. This is consistent with profit-maximizing behaviors of local government. The potential for application of this methodology for evaluating urban-scale master plans is discussed...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to clarify}} how {{changes in the}} legal system {{combined}} with changing social, economic, and environmental pressures have affected approaches taken for land use control. Our emphasis is on how historical transitions {{in the legal system}}, particularly in the use of local government ordinances (Development Permission Ordinances and voluntary ordinances concerning land use management) have contributed to land use control in suburban areas. Our results show that because of the revision of the City Planning Law in 2000, more municipalities are introducing <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> control in suburban areas. These are local efforts that consider the local situation. However, planned lands use has also been used to relax regulations, thereby promoting traditional growth and expansion trends. This has been especially true in the Kanto region, where development pressure is high. Therefore, it is necessary to design land use control systems that are consistent with the goals of making compact urban areas and a stable society. To do so, it is critical to clarify planning goals through public participation, evaluate the municipality’s administrative abilities and applicant responsibilities, identify those developments that are to be regulated, and guide development with flexibility. It is also recommended that financial and technical support should be provided for public participation...|$|E

The advantage of using a computer program compared with calculations made by hand is evaluated and discussed. The computer programs {{that have been used}} for studies and a sequence of testing of the possibilities are Autodesks Storm and Sanitary Analysis and DHIs Mike Urban. Focus on sustainable development now permeates the building industry. As a result stormwater investigations have been conducted in an increasing extent the recent years. Stormwater is water produced due to precipitation, such as rain and snowmelt. Stormwater investigations normally contain descriptions of existing land use, <b>planned</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and suggestions of measures and technical solutions for the future disposal of stormwater. The initial part of the thesis consisted of literature studies on stormwater and stormwater investigations to understand the science. Further literature studies where related to hydraulic and hydrologic modeling. An analysis of the interest and way of applying these methods among municipalities and sewer companies where performed. Literature studies and situation analysis formed the basis for the design of the evaluation methodology where a number of key points were chosen and followed-up for both programs. The results of the thesis shows that there is a big advantage in using computer simulations for accurate mapping of the pipe networks provided that you also have the means to calibrate the hydrologic and hydraulic models.

The IUCN {{protected area}} category system is a typology based on management objectives. It documents protected area types and is increasingly used in laws, policy and planning. As its role grows, the category system must be reactive to opinions and open to modifications. In response to requests from members IUCN undertook a 4 -year consultation and recently published revised guidelines for the categories. These made subtle but important changes to the protected area definition, giving greater emphasis to nature conservation, protection {{over the long term}} and management effectiveness. It refined some categories and gave principles for application. Debates during revision were intense and highlighted many of the issues and challenges surrounding protected areas in the early 21 st century. There was a consensus on many issues including the suitability of different governance models (such as indigenous and community conserved areas), sacred natural sites, moving the emphasis of Category IV from habitat manipulation towards species and habitat protection, and recognition of legally defined zones within a protected area as different categories. However, there was considerable disagreement about the definition of a protected area, the appropriateness of some categories with extensive human use, the possibility of linking category classification with biodiversity outcomes, and recognition of territories of indigenous peoples.
