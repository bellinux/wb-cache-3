2500|$|Another {{process which}} uses aminoallyl {{labeling}} is NASBA ( [...] Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification), a highly sensitive technique for amplifying RNA. In this specific case, the aaUTP modified RNAs were tagged with fluorescent market Cy3. NASBA combined with aminoallyl-UTP labeling is very useful for many {{different areas of}} microbial diagnostics including environmental monitoring, bio threat detection, industrial <b>process</b> <b>monitoring</b> and clinical microbiology. DNA microarray is another method which utilizes specifically AA-NTP's making DNA microarray testing quicker and cheaply.|$|E
2500|$|HACCP is {{believed}} to stem from a production <b>process</b> <b>monitoring</b> used during World War II because traditional [...] "end of the pipe" [...] testing on artillery shell's firing mechanisms could not be performed, and {{a large percentage of}} the artillery shells made at the time were either duds or misfiring. HACCP itself was conceived in the 1960s when the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) asked Pillsbury to design and manufacture the first foods for space flights. Since then, HACCP has been recognized internationally as a logical tool for adapting traditional inspection methods to a modern, science-based, food safety system. Based on risk-assessment, HACCP plans allow both industry and government to allocate their resources efficiently in establishing and auditing safe food production practices. In 1994, the organization of International HACCP Alliance was established initially for the US meat and poultry industries to assist them with implementing HACCP and now its membership has been spread over other professional/industrial areas.|$|E

2500|$|Two provinces {{have neither}} {{rejected}} nor embraced the covenant in full. On 9 July 2012, the General Synod of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia resolved {{that it was}} [...] "unable to adopt the proposed Anglican Covenant due to concerns about aspects of Section 4, but subscribes to Sections 1, 2, and 3 as currently drafted to be a useful starting point for consideration of our Anglican understanding of the church." [...] This resolution further stated that the General Synod of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia [...] "Affirms {{the commitment of the}} Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia {{to the life of the}} Anglican Communion; including the roles and responsibilities of the four Instruments of Communion as they currently operate." [...] Two days later, on 11 July 2012, the Episcopal Church in the United States of America chose to neither accept nor reject the Anglican Covenant, instead opting for a [...] "pastoral response" [...] that recognised the [...] "wide variety of opinions and ecclesiological positions" [...] within the province. The Episcopal Church voted to continue its participation in the Anglican Covenant <b>process,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and studying the text and its reception, throughout the Anglican Communion during the next three years.|$|E

This <b>process</b> can <b>monitor</b> a power regulator to read power values from the device through the parameters provider.

40|$|Many {{enterprises}} nowadays use business processes, {{based on}} the BPEL standard, to achieve their goals. These are complex, often distributed, <b>processes.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> the execution of such processes for interesting patterns is critical for enforcing business policies and meeting efficiency and reliability goals. BP-Mon (Business <b>Processes</b> <b>Monitoring)</b> is a novel query language for <b>monitoring</b> business <b>processes,</b> that allows users to visually define monitoring tasks and associated reports, using a simple intuitive interface, {{similar to those used}} for designing BPEL processes. We describe here the BP-Mon language and its underlying formal model. We also present the language implementation and describe our novel optimization techniques. An important feature of the implementation is thatBP-Mon queries are translated to BPEL processes that run on the same execution engine as the <b>monitored</b> <b>processes.</b> Our experiments indicate that this approach incurs very minimal overhead, hence is a practical and efficient approach to monitoring. 1...|$|R
