40|$|The {{fraction}} of fresh gas flow useful for gas exchange during mechanically controlled venti-lation in partial rebreathing systems {{is equal to}} alveolar ventilation (Conway, 1976). This is, however, difficult to estimate in clinical practice. Non-alveolar rebreathing affects only deadspace and {{is not likely to}} affect end-tidal or arterial carbon dioxide tensions. If, on the other hand, alveolar rebreathing occurs, the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension increases. During mechanically controlled ventilation in T-piece systems the {{fraction of}} fresh gas flow that participates in gas exchange varies with minute ventilation (FE) and with fresh gas flow (FGF) (Nightingale, Richards and Glass, 1965; Conway, 1976; Rose and Froese, 1979). Froese and Rose (1982) made recommendations for FGF and VE designed to produce predictable arterial carbon dioxide tensions in children weighing between 10 and 30 kg. In order to evaluate the degree of alveolar rebreathing at different FGF in infants and young children ventilated in a <b>partial</b> <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system,</b> and to test the recommendations made by Froese and Rose (1982), inspired and end-tidal car-bon dioxide tensions were measured at different fresh gas flow settings and at various in-spiratory: expiratory (I:E) ratios.

The study parameters were: heart rate, medium arterial pressure, right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt, hematocrit, hemoglobin, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen, mixed venous oxygen saturation, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, partial pressure of water in the alveoli. RESULTS: Shunt results were significantly different between the two groups - GI data were higher than GII in all the evaluated moments. Hence, the group with nonrebreathing (GI) developed a superior grade of intrapulmonary shunt when compared with the rebreathing group (GII).

40|$|Background: We {{measured}} Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) of {{the lungs}} with a CO 2 <b>partial</b> <b>rebreathing</b> technique, first in a mechanical lung analog, and then in mechanically ventilated animals before, during, and subsequent to an acute lung injury induced by oleic acid. We compared the FRC from <b>partial</b> CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> with those of a nitrogen washout reference method. Materials and Methods: Using an approved animal protocol, general anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol in six swine (38. 8 - 50. 8 kg). In both the mechanical lung analog and the animals, a <b>partial</b> CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> monitor (NICO 2, Respironics Inc., Wallingford, CT) {{was placed in the}} breathing circuit between the endotracheal tube and the Y-piece. The <b>partial</b> CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> signal obtained from this monitor was used to calculate FRC. FRC was also measured with a nitrogen washout measurement technique. In the animals, we collected data from healthy lungs and then subsequent to a lung injury that simulated the conditions of ARDS/ALI which was created by intravenously infusing 0. 09 mL/kg of oleic acid over a 15 -minute period. At each stage of the experiment, the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set to 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg H 2 O. At each PEEP level, we compared the average of three FRC measurements from CO 2 rebreathing to the average of three nitrogen washout reference measurements. Results: The correlation coefficient for the linear regression between CO 2 rebreathing and nitrogen washout measurements in the animals was r 2 = 0. 89 (n = 50). The average error of the CO 2 washout system was - 87 mL with limits of agreement (LOA) ± 263 mL. In the mechanical lung, the average error in the FRC measured by the CO 2 wash-in system was 37 mL with LOA ± 103 mL, which was equivalent to 1. 7 % of the true FRC.

Materials and Methods: After granting consent to an IRB-approved protocol, each of the 20 healthy volunteers participated in FRC measurement by three methods, including body plethysmography, carbon dioxide (CO 2) rebreathing, and nitrogen washout. Gas concentration and volume {{data were collected from}} the distal side of a mouthpiece during spontaneous ventilation for the washout and rebreathing measurements. The FRC was measured twice with a nitrogen washout measurement technique and then signals from five <b>partial</b> CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> measurement cycles were collected. Finally, the nitrogen washout FRC measurements were repeated twice. We compared the average CO 2 rebreathing FRC measurements and the average nitrogen washout FRC measurements to the body plethysmography FRC measurements for each subject through statistical methods of linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman Analysis. Results: The squared correlation coefficient for the linear regression between nitrogen washout and body plethysmography measurements was r 2 = 0. 91 (n = 35).

40|$|CONTEXT: Thermodilution, {{which is}} {{considered}} to be a standard technique for measuring the cardiac output in critically ill patients, is not free from relevant risks. There is a need to find alternative, noninvasive, automatic, simple and accurate methods for monitoring cardiac output at the bedside. OBJECTIVE: To compare cardiac output measurements by thermodilution and <b>partial</b> carbon dioxide <b>rebreathing</b> in patients with acute lung injury at two levels of severity (lung injury score, LIS: below 2. 5, group A; and above 2. 5, group B). TYPE OF STUDY: Comparative, prospective and controlled study. SETTING: Intensive Care Units of two university hospitals. METHODS: Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution and <b>partial</b> carbon dioxide <b>rebreathing.</b> Twenty patients with acute lung failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 300) who were under mechanical ventilation and from whom 294 measurements were taken: 164 measurements in group A (n = 11) and 130 in group B (n = 9), ranging from 14 to 15 determinations per patient. RESULTS: There was a poor positive correlation between the methods studied for the patients from groups A (r = 0. 52, p < 0. 001) and B (r = 0. 47, p < 0. 001). The application of the Bland-Altman test made it possible to expose the lack of agreement between the methods (group A: - 0. 9 ± 2. 71 l/min; 95 % CI = - 1. 14 to - 0. 48; and group B: - 1. 75 ± 2. 05 l/min; 95 % CI = - 2. 11 to - 1. 4). The comparison of the results (Student t and Mann-Whitney tests) within each group and between the groups showed significant difference (p = 0. 000, p < 0. 05). DISCUSSION: Errors in estimating CaCO 2 (arterial CO 2 content) from ETCO 2 (end-tidal CO 2) and situations of hyperdynamic circulation associated with dead space and/or increased shunt possibly explain our results. CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of this study, the results obtained allow us to conclude that, in patients with acute lung injury, the cardiac output determined by <b>partial</b> <b>rebreathing</b> of CO 2 differs from the measurements obtained by thermodilution.

40|$|Decreases in {{functional}} {{residual capacity}} (FRC), the residual respiratory volume following an expiration, {{are associated with the}} application of anesthesia and supine body positioning, both common in the ICU. We are developing two non-invasive methods of measuring the FRC on patients under mechanical ventilation. FRC increases are typically accomplished by increasing the Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) until the arterial O 2 content is saturated; however, increased PEEP may also cause a decrease in cardiac output due to the increased thoracic cavity pressure, resulting in a net decreased O 2 delivery. Measurement of the FRC will be useful in optimizing the application of PEEP to maximize O 2 delivery. FRC determination as a function of PEEP was made on a test lung using a <b>partial</b> CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> method and an N 2 washout method in order to compare their accuracy. The CO 2 rebreathing method uses Fick’s principle along with a perturbation of gas concentrations initiated by <b>partial</b> <b>rebreathing.</b> The N 2 washout method also utilizes Fick’s principle, but creates the perturbation through an increase in inspired O 2 concentration. Preliminary FRC measurements were made using the NICO 2 system which includes a pneumotachograph for volumetric measurements and a CAPNOSTATTM sensor for CO 2 concentration measurement. Although both methods correlated to measured FRC volumes in the test lung, the N 2 washout method resulted in greater precision and less variability, most likely due to the greater magnitude of perturbation that is made and the use of data from multiple breaths. Both methods will require further bench testing to verify their accuracy within typical ranges of mechanical ventilation variables, followed by en vivo studies in order to characterize any inherent physiologic implications and to determine repeatability...|$|R
40|$|The PCO 2 in {{arterial}} blood (PaCO 2) {{is a good}} parameter for monitoring ventilation and acid-base changes in ventilated patients, but its measurement is invasive and difficult to obtain in small children.

Studies have revealed that, unfortunately, the differences between PETCO 2 and PaCO 2 are too variable to be clinically useful. We hypothesized that end-inspiratory rebreathing, previously shown to equalize PETCO 2 and PaCO 2 in spontaneously breathing humans, would also be effective with positive pressure ventilation. Eight newborn Yorkshire pigs were mechanically ventilated via a <b>partial</b> <b>rebreathing</b> circuit to implement end-inspiratory rebreathing. Arterial blood was sampled and tested for PaCO 2.

The rate of {{endogenous}} {{carbon monoxide}} production (Vco), de-termined by the closed <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system</b> technique, was elevated above {{the normal range}} in four of five patients studied with ineffective erythropoiesis (four patients with primary refractory anemia, one with thalassemia). The mean molar ratio of Vco to Vheme (rate of circulating heme catabolism, de-termined from 51 Cr red cell survival curves) was 3. 0 ± 0. 6 (SE), indicating {{that most of the}} CO originated from sources other than circulating erythrocyte hemoglobin, in contrast to previous findings in patients with hemolytic ane-mia, where Vco paralleled Vheme closely. After administration of glycine- 2 - 4 C to these patients, endogenous CO was isolated by washout of body CO stores at high PO 2 or by reacting peripheral venous blood samples with ferricyanide. The CO was then oxidized to CO 2 by palladium chloride and trapped for counting in a liquid scintillation spec-trometer. "Early labeled " peaks of 14 CO were demonstrated which paralleled "early labeled " peaks of stercobilin and preceded maximal labeling of circu-lating heme. Production of "early labeled " 14 CO in patients with ineffective erythropoiesis was greatly increased, up to 14 times that found in a normal subject. The increased Vco and "early 14 CO " production shown by these patients are presumably related mainly to heme catabolism in the marrow.

All patients received 30 μg. kg- 1 alfentanil, 3 mg. kg- 1 propofol, 0. 5 mg. kg- 1 atracurium, sevoflurane in different concentrations monitored by BIS (values close to 60) and N 2 O in a non <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system.</b> Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, expired sevoflurane concentration (EC), sevoflurane consumption (ml. min- 1) and emergence time were evaluated. Emergence time was defined as time elapsed between the end of anesthesia and patients' spontaneous movements trying to extubate themselves, crying and opening eyes and mouth. Results - There were no differences among groups as to systolic and diastolic blood pressure, EC, sevoflurane consumption and emergence time. Heart rate was lower in G 3 group. Conclusions - Sevoflurane has provided hemodynamic stability. Premedication with clonidine and midazolam did not influence emergence time, inhaled anesthetic consumption or maintenance of anesthesia with sevoflurane. Anesthesia duration has also not influenced emergence time. Hypnosis monitoring was important for balancing anesthetic levels and this might have been responsible for the similarity of emergence times for all studied groups...|$|R

40|$|Ten healthy adult horses male or female, mean {{body weight}} of 424 ± 44. 1 kg, were anesthetized with romifidine, tiletamine/zolazepam and {{halothane}} for 60 minutes using a modified to-and-fro <b>rebreathing</b> anesthetic <b>system,</b> added of 1 liter mechanical dead space. The {{gas flow rate}} was 10 liters oxygen/minute during all inhalation anesthetic time. Variables analysed were arterial blood pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO 2) and oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2), and respiratory rate (RR). The horses were allowed to breath spontaneously, and were positioned in right lateral recumbency the arterial O 2 values were significantly higher during halothane anesthesia {{when compared to the}} baseline values, and significantly lower after induction with tiletamine/zolazepam although arterial hypoxemia were not present. The arterial PaCO 2 values were significantly higher from baseline values during halothane anesthesia occurring arterial hypercapnia and mild respiratory acidosis. The arterial pH changes paralleled the changes in PaCO 2. Respiratory rate values were significantly lower during halothane anesthesia when compared to baseline values. All values remained within accepted range for lateral recumbent spontaneously breathing anesthetized horses...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Retinal {{vascular}} reactivity is impaired {{in patients}} with diabetes and {{is thought to be}} involved in the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Previous studies that have utilized hyperoxia to assess retinal vascular reactivity have been limited due to confounding factors associated with the administration of oxygen and have used a variety of different instruments to measure retinal blood flow. The influence of blood glucose at the time of blood flow assessment has also not been systemically investigated. The specific aims of each Chapter are as follows: Chapter 3 : To compare three systems used to administer hyperoxia to human subjects. Chapter 4 : To quantify the magnitude and timeline of change of retinal hemodynamic parameters induced by an isocapnic hyperoxic stimulus. Chapters 5, 6 and 7 : To quantify the magnitude of change of retinal hemodynamic parameters induced by hyperoxia, hyperglycemia and combined hyperoxia / hyperglycemia, respectively, in groups of diabetic patients with no clinically visible, and mild-to-moderate, DR and in age-matched subjects without diabetes. Methods Chapter 3 : Subjects breathed air followed by oxygen, or oxygen plus carbon dioxide using a non-rebreathing system, or air followed by oxygen using a sequential <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system.</b> The magnitude of change and variability of CO 2 concentrations was compared between systems. Chapter 4 : Baseline retinal blood flow data was acquired while the subjects breathed air using a sequential <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system.</b> An isocapnic hyperoxic stimulus was initiated and maintained for 20 minutes. Air was then re-administered for 10 minutes. Retinal blood flow measurements were acquired every minute over the course of the study. The magnitude of change of each hemodynamic parameter was determined by fitting individual data with a sigmoidal function. For Chapter 5, 6 and 7 diabetic patients with no clinically visible, and mild-to-moderate, DR were stratified into groups based upon their retinopathy status. Age-matched non-diabetic subjects were recruited as controls. Baseline retinal blood flow data was acquired while subjects breathed air. Retinal blood flow measurements were then acquired after exposure to (a) hyperoxia, (b) hyperglycemia and (c) combined hyperoxic / hyperglycemic stimuli. Change in hemodynamic parameters was compared between groups and correlated with objective measures of retinal edema. Results Chapter 3 : The difference in group mean end-tidal CO 2 levels between baseline and hyperoxia was significant for oxygen administration using a non-rebreathing <b>system.</b> The sequential <b>rebreathing</b> technique resulted in a significantly lower variability of individual CO 2 levels than either of the other techniques. Chapter 4 : An ~ 11 % decrease of diameter, ~ 36 % decrease of velocity and ~ 48 % decrease of blood flow was observed in response to isocapnic hyperoxia in young, healthy subjects. A response time of 2. 30 ± 0. 53 minutes and 2. 62 ± 0. 54 minutes was observed for diameter and velocity, respectively. Chapter 5 : Retinal blood velocity, flow, and WSR significantly decreased in response to isocapnic hyperoxia in all groups. The magnitude of the reduction of blood flow was significantly reduced with increasing severity of retinopathy. There was a significant relationship between baseline objective edema index values and retinal vascular reactivity. Chapter 6 : A significant change in blood glucose level was observed for all groups. No significant change in any hemodynamic parameter was found {{in patients with}} diabetes and in age-matched subjects without diabetes. Chapter 7 : Retinal blood velocity and flow significantly decreased in all groups in response to combined hyperoxic / hyperglycemic provocation. The vascular reactivity response was not significantly different across the groups. Conclusions Chapter 3 : Control of CO 2 is necessary to attain standardized, reproducible hyperoxic stimuli for the assessment of retinal vascular reactivity. Chapter 4 : Arteriolar retinal vascular reactivity to isocapnic hyperoxic provocation occurs within a maximum of 4 minutes. Although there was a trend for diameter to respond before velocity, the response characteristics were not significantly different between diameter and velocity. Different response characteristics of the retinal vasculature to transmural pressure mediated autoregulation as opposed to metabolic mediated vascular reactivity are suggested. Chapter 5 : The vascular reactivity response in terms of the reduction of blood flow relative to baseline was significant in all groups but the magnitude of the change in flow was significantly reduced with increasing severity of retinopathy. A loss of retinal vascular reactivity is indicated in patients with moderate DR without clinically evident diabetic macular edema (DME), and in patients with DME. Chapter 6 : Unaltered retinal arteriolar blood flow was found 1 hour after glucose ingestion in patients with diabetes and in age-matched subjects without diabetes. These results do not support the theory that retinal blood flow is affected by an acute increase of blood glucose in diabetic patients and in subjects without diabetes. Chapter 7 : The vascular reactivity response to a combined hyperoxic / hyperglycemic provocation produced a pronounced reduction in blood flow. Unlike the response to hyperoxia alone, the vascular reactivity response was not significantly different across the groups. This suggests that hyperglycemia may influence the retinal vascular reactivity response to hyperoxia...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{maintenance}} of adequate oxygen delivery {{is essential to}} preserve organ function. The circulatory and respiratory systems interact closely to accomplish this. Optimising the function of these systems is of fundamental importance in critically ill patients. This requires adequate monitoring techniques. Availability of non-invasive, bedside, continuous techniques for monitoring the effects of circulatory and respiratory interventions are limited. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate alternative techniques to monitor central hemodynamics and lung volume changes and to use these techniques to {{study the effects of}} lung recruitment manoeuvres. Methods: A transoesophageal echo-Doppler technique measuring descending aortic blood flow and a <b>partial</b> CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> technique for cardiac output determination were evaluated in unstable hemodynamic conditions and compared with cardiac output measured by thermodilution using pulmonary artery catheter. Electric impedance tomography was used to monitor global and regional lung volume changes and ventilation distribution during different recruitment manoeuvres in experimental acute lung injury (ALI). Results: The transoesophageal echo-Doppler rapidly and accurately followed marked changes in central blood flow during liver transplantation and experimental cardiac tamponade. <b>Partial</b> CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> technique showed good agreement with the reference technique, despite several possible sources of error. By continuously monitoring aortic blood flow, pronounced circulatory depression was detected during lung recruitment using rapid high airway pressure manoeuvres especially in endotoxin- induced ALI. Monitoring blood pressure underestimated the true circulatory impairment. These negative circulatory effects could be attenuated by prior volume expansion or by using a slow, lower pressure recruitment manoeuvre. This recruitment manoeuvre increased lung volume, compliance and improved gas exchange equally well as high-pressure manoeuvres. Electric impedance tomography revealed the changes in ventilation distribution from non-dependent to dependent areas induced by lung recruitment. Conclusions: The investigated minimally invasive monitoring techniques are useful for monitoring changes in central hemodynamics in critically ill patients. Adequate monitoring techniques are required to detect rapid changes in blood flow like those seen during recruitment manoeuvres. Lung recruitment can be achieved by a slow, lower pressure manoeuvre with less circulatory side-effects. Electric impedance tomography is a promising technique for bedside monitoring of global and regional lung volume changes...|$|R

40|$|Objective: PRRSV {{is one of}} {{the most}} causative agents in {{respiratory}} diseases in swine. This study aimed to evaluate respiratory disorders caused by PRRSV in spontaneous breathing pigs using noninvasive methods. Animals and Methods: In this negative controlled study altogether 48 German Hybrid Pigs at the age of eight weeks were included and divided into four groups. Twelve pigs were experimentally infected (intranasally and intramuscularly) with US PRRSV isolate VR 2332 (substudy 1), with EU PRRSV isolate 205817 (substudy 2), respectively, while the two control groups received physiological saline. Beside daily clinical examination of all pigs, pulmonary function tests (PFT) were performed in eight pigs per group until 18 days post infection (dpi) to evaluate i) breathing pattern, ii) respiratory mechanics, iii) diffusion of oxygen from the lung into the blood, iv) functional residual capacity and v) parameters of CO 2 -elimination. Therefore the methods impulse oscilloresistometry, <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system</b> (He, CO) and capnovolumetry (each Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany) were applied via a tightly fitting face mask. Four pigs per group (without PFT) were sacrificed at 10 dpi and eight pigs per group (with PFT) at 21 dpi for pathological examination. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test (P ≤ 0. 05). Results: Pigs infected with PRRSV developed fever, increased respiratory rates as well as cough, dyspnoea and reduced behavior accompanied of reduced appetite. Compared to controls, lung functions in pigs challenged with PRRSV were characterized by - obstructions of peripheral airways due to bronchospasms (increased respiratory resistance at frequencies ≤ 5 Hz, increased resistance of distal airways, increased ratios of the mixing volume expired between 50 and 75 % of the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration and the inspired volume) - upper airway opening (increased respiratory resistance at frequencies ≥ 10 Hz, decreased resistance of proximal airways) - restrictions (decreased respiratory reactance) - ventilatory asynchronisms due to obstructions and restrictions (changes in morphology of the curve of the capnogram, especially increase of slope II and III of the capnogram) - development of ‚trapped air’ in pigs challenged with PRRSV-EU due to obstructions (increased functional residual capacity) - increased death space ventilation (increased ratios of dead spaces and tidal volume according to Langley, Threshold and Bohr) - deteriorations in pulmonary gas exchange (reduced transferfactor of the lung for carbon monoxide) due to interstitial pneumonia, alveolar exsudate, ‘trapped air’, disturbances in ventilation to perfusion ratio and reduced alveolar volume - fast and superficial breathing pattern (increased respiratory rate, reduced tidal volume) Pigs challenged with PRRSV isolate 205817 developed more severe clinical signs compared to pigs challenged with PRRSV isolate VR 2332. It is not ecxluded if the retrospective determined coinfection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae had had an influence on the degree of the severty of the clinical pattern and pulmonary dysfunction. Conclusions: Acute infections with PRRSV were associated with obstructive and restrictive disorders, ventilatory asynchronisms as well as deteriorations in pulmonary gas exchange. These pulmonary dysfunctions are responsible for compensatory changes in breathing pattern and are inducing the clinical symptom dyspnoea...|$|R
40|$|At the Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine, {{second year}} {{veterinary}} {{students are taught}} anaesthesia by means of lectures and anaesthesia laboratories. One of these laboratories in particular teaches the assembly and operation of the anaesthetic machine and drug calculations for patients. The students assemble the machine, do all the operational checks and calculate drug rates. In order to improve the students’ ability to identify components, assemble and operate the anaesthesia machine, an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was developed, that focused on thirteen critical aspects of the process. The OSCE {{was carried out by}} means of a Dispomed® complete unused anaesthetic machine and a RescueCritters® intubation simulator. The thirteen areas were: * identify anaesthetic machine components * describe components functions * identify breathing systems * calculate reservoir bag size * assemble <b>rebreathing</b> and non-rebreathing <b>systems</b> * leak test a <b>rebreathing</b> and non-rebreathing <b>system</b> * demonstrate gas supply knowledge * calculate fresh gas flow rates * list breathing system differences * calculate breathing system time constants * describe proper intubation protocols * demonstrate proper tracheal intubation * demonstrate proper endotracheal tube cuff inflation All second-year students (n= 120) were examined by means of the OSCE. They were graded on a scale from 5 (superior) to 1 (deficient). Students that scored grades of 1 and 2 were considered unsatisfactory. Students that scored 3, 4 or 5 passed the examination. Ninety-four percent (113 / 120) of students passed the OSCE. In conclusion, the highest scoring focus areas involved mathematical calculations. The lowest scoring focus areas involved assembly and functional operation of the machine.

40|$|Avaliou-se o efeito da dexmedetomidina sobre o ritmo cardíaco em 20 cães, sem raça definida, de ambos os sexos e considerados sadios, anestesiados pelo sevofluorano e submetidos a doses crescentes de adrenalina. Os animais foram, aleatoriamente, distribuídos em dois grupos (placebo e dexmedetomidina). No grupo placebo, os animais receberam, por via intravenosa, solução de NaCl a 0, 9 %, na dose de 0, 3 ml/kg. Foram considerados dois momentos, M 0 e M 1, imediatamente antes e após a aplicação, respectivamente. Após 10 minutos, realizou-se a indução anestésica com sevofluorano, por meio de máscara facial vedada, até a perda do reflexo laringotraqueal. Em seguida, procedeu-se à intubação orotraqueal e a manutenção da anestesia foi realizada com a administração de sevofluorano na concentração de 1, 5 CAM, em circuito anestésico com reinalação parcial de gases. Decorridos 20 minutos da indução anestésica, iniciou-se a administração intravenosa contínua de solução de adrenalina a 2 % em doses crescentes de 1, 2, 3, 4 e 5 mg/kg/min, por meio de bomba de infusão, com aumento da dose em intervalos de 10 minutos. Imediatamente antes desse acréscimo eram feitas as mensurações (M 2 a M 6). No grupo dexmedetomidina empregou-se a mesma metodologia substituindo-se a solução de NaCl a 0, 9 % por hidrocloridrato de dexmedetomidina, na dose de 1 µg/kg. Foram registradas as pressões arteriais, em M 0 e em M 2 a M 6, e o traçado eletrocardiográfico, na derivação DII (M 2 a M 6), considerando-se para efeito estatístico o número total de bloqueios atrioventriculares (BAV) de primeiro e segundo graus e de complexos ventriculares prematuros (ESV), coincidentes com cada dose de adrenalina. Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância seguida pelo teste de Tukey (P The {{effect of}} {{dexmedetomidine}} on the cardiac rhythm in twenty healthy mongrel dogs {{of both sexes}} anesthetized with sevofluorane and submitted to increasing doses of adrenaline was evaluated. The animals were randomly allotted to different treatment groups. Animals of placebo group were intravenous injected with 0. 9 % NaCl solution at 0. 3 ml/kg/IV. Two moments were considered, M 0 and M 1, the moments immediately before and after application, respectively. Ten minutes later, the dogs were anesthetized using sevofluorane via face mask until lost of their laringotracheal reflex. Then, orotracheal intubation was performed and maintenance of anesthesia was kept with 1, 5 MAC sevofluorane using an anesthetic circuit with a <b>rebreathing</b> <b>system.</b> Twenty minutes after anesthesia induction, continuous IV administration of 2 % adrenaline solution was given at increasing doses of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg/kg/min., every ten minutes, respectively. The moments M 2 to M 6 were measured immediately before the next increase of dose. In dexmedetomidine group, the same technique was used replacing 0. 9 % NaCl by dexmedetomidine hydrochloride at 1 mg/kg. Blood pressures were recorded at M 0 and M 2 to M 6. Electrocardiography line in the derivation DII (M 2 to M 6) was used to observe the number of atrioventricular blocks (AVB) of first and second degrees and ventricular premature complexes (VPC).

40|$|The hemodynamic status {{monitoring}} of high-risk surgical patients and critically ill patients inIntensive Care Units {{is one of}} the main objectives of their therapeutic management. Cardiac output {{is one of the}} mostimportant parameters for cardiac function monitoring, providing an estimate of whole body perfusion oxygen deliveryand allowing for an understanding of the causes of high blood pressure. The purpose of the present review is thedescription of cardiac output measurement methods as presented in the international literature. The articles documentthat there are many methods of monitoring the hemodynamic status of patients, both invasive and non-invasive, themost popular of which is thermodilution. The invasive methods are the Fick method and thermodilution, whereasthe non-invasive methods are oeshophaegeal Doppler, transoesophageal echocardiography, lithium dilution, pulsecontour, <b>partial</b> CO 2 <b>rebreathing</b> and thoracic electrical bioimpedance. All of them have their advantages and disadvantages,but thermodilution is the golden standard for critical patients, although it does entail many risks. The idealsystem for cardiac output monitoring would be non-invasive, easy to use, reliable and compatible in patients. A numberof research studies have been carried out in clinical care settings, by nurses as well as other health professionals, for thepurpose of finding a method of measurement that would have the least disadvantages.
