25|$|In June 1987 {{the joint}} venture's <b>pre-feasibility</b> <b>study</b> was completed. It {{postulated}} {{that the project}} was technically feasible and financially viable. It envisaged a purpose-built high-speed line from Sydney to Canberra via Bowral and Goulburn, and either a coastal route from Canberra to Melbourne via Cooma, east Gippsland and the La Trobe Valley – or an inland route though Wagga Wagga, Albury–Wodonga, Wangaratta and Seymour.
