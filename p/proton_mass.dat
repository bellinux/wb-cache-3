2500|$|The {{charge of}} a uranium nucleus, we found, was indeed large enough to {{overcome}} {{the effect of the}} surface tension almost completely; so the uranium nucleus might indeed resemble a very wobbly unstable drop, ready to divide itself at the slightest provocation, such as the impact of a single neutron. But there was another problem. After separation, the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence a very large energy, about 200MeV in all; where could that energy come from? ...Lise Meitner... worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula E= mc2, and one-fifth of a <b>proton</b> <b>mass</b> was just equivalent to 200MeV.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of ATLAS was to investigate a missing piece of the Standard Model, the Higgs boson. [...] The Higgs mechanism, which includes the Higgs boson, gives mass to elementary particles, leading to differences between the weak force and electromagnetism by giving the W and Z bosons mass while leaving the photon massless. [...] On July 4, 2012, ATLAS (together with CMS – its sister experiment at the LHC) reported evidence for the existence of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson at the level of 5 sigma, with a mass around 125 GeV, or 133 times the <b>proton</b> <b>mass.</b> This new [...] "Higgs-like" [...] particle was detected by its possible decay into two photons and its decay to four leptons. In March 2013, {{in the light of the}} updated ATLAS and CMS results, CERN announced that the new particle was indeed a Higgs boson. Having analyzed two and a half times more data than was available for the discovery announcement in July, the confidence of observation has risen to 10 sigma. The experiments were also able to show that the properties of the particle as well as the ways it interacts with other particles were well-matched with those of a Higgs boson, which is expected to have spin 0 and parity +. Analysis of more properties of the particle and data collected in 2015 and 2016 confirmed this further. In 2013 two of the theoretical physicists who predicted the existence of the Standard Model Higgs boson, Peter Higgs and François Englert were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the mass}} of {{ordinary}} matter has its origin from quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A similar strong dynamics, dark QCD, could exist to explain the mass origin of dark matter. Using infrared fixed points of the two gauge couplings, we provide a dynamical mechanism that relates the dark QCD confinement scale to our QCD scale, and hence provides an explanation for comparable dark baryon and <b>proton</b> <b>masses.</b> Together with a mechanism that generates equal amounts of dark baryon and ordinary baryon asymmetries in the early universe, the similarity of dark matter and ordinary matter energy densities can be naturally explained. For a large class of gauge group representations, the particles charged under both QCD and dark QCD, necessary ingredients for generating the infrared fixed points, are found to have masses at one to two TeV, which sets the scale for dark matter direct detection and novel collider signatures involving visible and dark jets.
