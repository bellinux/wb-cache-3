5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the <b>painting</b> was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was {{displayed}} {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. The <b>painting</b> was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the <b>painting</b> was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the <b>painting</b> has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the <b>painting</b> to be shown. The <b>painting</b> is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The <b>painting</b> was restored in 2007.|$|E

5|$|When King {{bought the}} <b>painting</b> it {{consisted}} of 13 panels sewn together and rolled into one piece. To more easily store and transport the <b>painting</b> King unstitched the 13 panels and stored them individually together with two separate panels of scenery {{used to make the}} <b>painting</b> a bit longer depending on the exhibition space. The 13 panels along with the two extra scenery panels bring the <b>painting</b> to 410 feet long according to King. The <b>painting</b> has, for the most part, remained rolled up since 1933, though it was donated by King to Wake Forest University upon his death in 1996. The university sold the <b>painting</b> in 2007 to an anonymous group of Raleigh, North Carolina, investors. The <b>painting</b> has been appraised at a value of US$5.5 million, but the value of the sale remains unknown. The group intends to resell the <b>painting</b> to a new buyer who will commit to restoring the work and building a suitable structure to house it.|$|E
5|$|A Vision of the Last Judgement is a <b>painting</b> by William Blake {{that was}} {{designed}} in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The <b>painting</b> was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the <b>painting</b> disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of the <b>painting</b> to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the <b>painting,</b> a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Paint</b> {{is used as}} {{top coat}} in Automobile Refinishing that is divided into 1 K <b>paint</b> of base type and 2 K <b>paint</b> of {{urethane}} type. after using 1 K <b>paint,</b> it can be reusable. However 2 K <b>paint</b> is not available that is mixed {{a certain amount of}} base with hardner, so 2 K <b>paint</b> has to be used all at a time or discarded the rest. This study covered that colored Urethane <b>paint</b> and colorless urethane <b>paint</b> in top coating process of AR. Top coat urethane <b>paint</b> is divided into colored urethane <b>paint</b> and transparent urethane <b>paint</b> like clear coat. Colored urethane <b>paint</b> is used for <b>paint</b> that contains resin, pigment, solvent and additives. It is color such as black and white. While transparent urethane <b>paint</b> is used for <b>paint</b> that contains resin, solvent and additives. Urethane <b>paint</b> has a <b>paint</b> system that cur after several hours of mixing base and hardner. By a <b>paint</b> technician of a field and empirical data, we can also recognize that according to worker's <b>paint</b> style and experience, although he or she <b>paint</b> same car model and area, <b>paint</b> use of one's is different. There aren't guidelines workers refer to about <b>paint</b> use by car models and work scope because ARP works various car models that are in different color, size and area. After using urethane <b>paint,</b> the rest of <b>paint</b> has come, and there are highs and lows in <b>paint</b> use each time he or she works. Therefore, this study suggest a basic guideline to use <b>paint</b> efficiently and regularly by understanding area, the type of work, and <b>paint</b> use that are appropriate for each car model and regardless of workers and work scopes in AR...|$|R

5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the <b>painting</b> {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the <b>painting</b> unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the <b>painting</b> became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|After this rejection, the <b>painting</b> {{was sold}} to a Swedish art {{collector}} who offered {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million Swedish kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if the <b>painting</b> belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that the <b>painting</b> was both an unsurpassed masterpiece of Swedish art and a work of suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by Sotheby's in London to a Japanese art collector.|$|E

2500|$|Important {{painters}} of this period, roughly 480 to 425 BC, include the Providence <b>Painter,</b> Hermonax, and the Achilles <b>Painter,</b> all following {{the tradition of}} the Berlin <b>Painter.</b> The Phiale <b>Painter,</b> probably a pupil of the Achilles <b>Painter,</b> is also important. New workshop traditions also developed. Notable examples include the so-called [...] "mannerists", most famously among them the Pan <b>Painter.</b> Another tradition was begun by the Niobid <b>Painter</b> and continued by Polygnotos, the Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> and the Dinos <b>Painter.</b> The role of bowls decreased, although they were still produced in large numbers, e.g. by the workshop of the Penthesilea <b>Painter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Varrese Painter's {{workshop}} also {{employed the}} Wolfenbüttel Painter; his influence {{has been noted}} {{not only on the}} predecessors of the Darius <b>Painter,</b> but also on the Ginosa <b>Painter,</b> the <b>Painter</b> of Bari 12061, the Metope <b>Painter,</b> the <b>Painter</b> of Louvre MNB 1148 and the Chamay <b>Painter.</b>|$|R

5|$|Another {{work from}} this time is The Green Feather, which Knight painted, and {{reworked}} due {{to a change in}} the weather, outdoors in a single day and shows the model Dolly Snell in an emerald evening dress with a hat and a large feather. Knight sent the <b>painting</b> to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast <b>painting</b> Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, <b>painting</b> in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the <b>painting</b> unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} <b>painting</b> met with mixed {{reactions}} from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history <b>painting,</b> and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the <b>painting</b> was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{feature in}} a wide variety of art forms, {{including}} in <b>painting,</b> sculpture, poetry and prose, film and fashion.

5|$|Clarkson's {{book had}} an {{important}} influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a <b>painting</b> at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship. The <b>painting</b> depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the <b>painting,</b> such as the shackles worn by the slaves, {{appear to have been}} influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. The <b>painting</b> was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The <b>painting</b> was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood {{as one of the few}} truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began <b>painting</b> in 1971, {{assisted}} by teacher Geoffrey Bardon.
