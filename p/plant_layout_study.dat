40|$|Every {{manufacturing}} {{company wants to}} improve and adapt their operating system {{in order to survive}} the industry competition. In manufacturing organizations, to improve their system it might mean to reduce the operating costs that come from the wastes in production line. By using the ARENA simulation in this study, the productivity improvement can be experimented without physically affect the real system and reduced the cost because designing, building, testing, redesigning, rebuilding and retesting can be an expensive project. This study focus on the flow in the production line processes in one piston {{manufacturing company}}. The existing <b>plant</b> <b>layout</b> was <b>studied</b> and formulated into ARENA simulation software as well as to enhance the productivity rate by improving certain parameters. The problems identified in this production line are the effect of the bottleneck process which resulting some idle time in some workstations and the increased piston demands from the customers. The data acquired and was translated into the ARENA simulation software and studied in order to simulate the existing <b>plant</b> <b>layout</b> design. Hence, the problems occurred in the production line can be seen clearly to determine room for productivity improvement. New designs are proposed by constructing several models to acquire the best solution to improve productivity capacity and meet the forecasting demand of customer. In these proposed models, the parameters of the actual system are modified accordingly in the terms of material handling such as human resources, machine cycle time, the number of machines, shape and area of <b>plant</b> <b>layout.</b> From the simulation results, the significant contribution factor that influenced the rate of productivity was by adding certain machines to do the same process to cover the buffer while the material handling did not have a huge effect on the production line...|$|R
40|$|Materials surface {{characteristics}} can {{be investigated}} analysing their spectral response when properly energised by a suitable source. When the source {{is represented by}} a light spectra of known characteristics the surface material response can thus be evaluated adopting a spectrophotometric approach. The analyses of the detected spectra can give useful information concerning the material characteristics and/or surface properties and status. In this perspective digital spectrophotometry {{can be considered as}} one of the basic techniques to characterise materials. The application of such a technique is usually confined in “high-tech” environments and can results quite expensive and difficult to apply in industrial “on-line” processes. In this paper recent advances in imaging spectrophotometry devices and techniques are presented with reference to the possibility to recognise different glass fragments (cullets) according to their colour and the presence of transparent polluting fragments, that is the distinction between glass from ceramic glass fragments. The work will identify the main factors influencing the selection of the proper hardware to perform the analysis and the different possible solutions in terms of installations and <b>plant</b> <b>layouts.</b> Case <b>studies</b> will be presented and analysed with particular reference to different classes of bulk products, glass and ceramic glass waste product to recycle, presenting different physical and surface status properties...|$|R

40|$|In {{preparation}} for and {{in support of}} a detailed R and D Plan for the Accelerator-Based Conversion (ABC) of weapons plutonium, an ABC <b>Plant</b> <b>Layout</b> <b>Study</b> was conducted at the level of a pre-conceptual engineering design. The plant layout is based on an adaptation of the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) detailed conceptual design that was completed in the early 1070 s. Although the ABC <b>Plant</b> <b>Layout</b> <b>Study</b> included the Accelerator Equipment as an essential element, the engineering assessment focused primarily on the Target; Primary System (blanket and all systems containing plutonium-bearing fuel salt); the Heat-Removal System (secondary-coolant-salt and supercritical-steam systems); Chemical Processing; Operation and Maintenance; Containment and Safety; and Instrumentation and Control systems. Although constrained primarily to a reflection of an accelerator-driven (subcritical) variant of MSBR system, unique features and added flexibilities of the ABC suggest improved or alternative approaches to each of the above-listed subsystems; these, along with the key technical issues in need of resolution through a detailed R&D plan for ABC are described on the bases of the ``strawman`` or ``point-of-departure`` plant layout that resulted from this study...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of <b>plant</b> <b>layout</b> is central in a manufacturing process. This question {{becomes even more}} important in a mass customization context, when large product diversity has to be managed. The manufacturing process, and specifically the <b>plant</b> <b>layout,</b> has to be designed taking into account this characteristic. When all products are similar, manufacturing <b>plant</b> <b>layouts</b> are relatively easy to design; difficulties come when most products are different and require specific manufacturing operations. This paper proposes a methodology based on data mining techniques to define manufacturing <b>plant</b> <b>layouts</b> {{in a context of}} diversified products. Different steps are proposed to achieve this goal. The methodology considers: 1 / identification of representative sets of products; 2 / identification of manufacturing processes and the relevant layout (for each set of products); 3 / categorization of new products (identification of the closest set of products). The focus is on data transformations that enable to extract relevant information for the manufacturing <b>plant</b> <b>layout.</b> Key words: product families, <b>plant</b> <b>layout,</b> data transformation, data mining. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{good deal}} of {{literature}} dealing with the facility layout problem has focused on greenfield layout design. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to the facility re-layout problem.
