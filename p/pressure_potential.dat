This states that, in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid along a streamline is the same at all points on that streamline. This requires that the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy and internal energy remains constant. Thus an increase in the speed of the fluid – implying an increase in [...] both its dynamic pressure and kinetic energy – occurs with a simultaneous decrease in (the sum of) its static <b>pressure,</b> <b>potential</b> energy and internal energy.

To obtain a quantitative evaluation of the data, Fast Fourier Transform was performed on the signals and their derivatives which were auto- and cross-correlated. While there was no obvious relation between <b>pressure</b> and <b>potential</b> in the unperfused colon, there was clear visual qualitative evidence that, during steady state conditions of perfusion, an increase in intraluminal pressure was accompanied by a decrease in potential differences, while impedance of the recording system re-mained unchanged.

40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of soil hydraulic properties is of crucial importance for reliable applications of recently developed distributed models to environmental studies and land-use planning. To provide such {{information in a}} cost-effective way, indirect estimation of water transport parameters from easily measurable or already available soil data using pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) is becoming increasingly popular. However, distributed hydrological modeling requires that soil hydraulic characterization also takes account of the description of spatial variability. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate some published PTFs in the light of their ability to quantify the spatial structure and variability of soil water retention adequately. Four PTFs were tested: two provided only values of water content at specific <b>pressure</b> <b>potentials</b> (PTF Group A), whereas the remaining two estimated the parameters of closed-form relations describing the water retention function (PTF Group B). Measured data for testing were obtained from undisturbed soil samples taken from the top layer of different soils along a 5 km transect with constant spacing of 50 m. Overall, summary statistics and sample distributions of the PTF-estimated retention characteristics at selected <b>pressure</b> <b>potentials</b> are close to those of the retention variables used as reference for comparisons. The largest discrepancies are related to the use of PTFs pertaining to Group A. Although the quality of kriged interpolations based on soil property data obtained by simplified methodologies still gives cause for concern, results show that the structure of spatial variability exhibited by the variables considered along the study transect is described well enough when using PTFs for determining soil water retention characteristics...|$|R

50|$|Osmosis is the {{movement}} of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane. The net movement of water molecules through a partially permeable membrane from a solution of high water potential to an area of low water potential. A cell with a less negative water potential will draw in water but this depends on other factors as well such as solute potential (pressure in the cell e.g. solute molecules) and <b>pressure</b> <b>potential</b> (external pressure e.g. cell wall). There are three types of Osmosis solutions: the isotonic solution, hypotonic solution, and hypertonic solution. Isotonic solution is when the extracellular solute concentration is balanced with the concentration inside the cell. In the Isotonic solution, the water molecules still moves between the solutions, but the rates are the same from both directions, thus the water movement is balanced between {{the inside of the}} cell as well as the outside of the cell. A hypotonic solution is when the solute concentration outside the cell is lower than the concentration inside the cell. In hypotonic solutions, the water moves into the cell, down its concentration gradient (from higher to lower water concentrations). That can cause the cell to swell. Cells that don't have a cell wall, such as animal cells, could burst in this solution. A hypertonic solution is when the solute concentration is higher (think of hyper - as high) than the concentration inside the cell. In hypertonic solution, the water will move out, causing the cell to shrink.|$|E
50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (in-line circulating pump, typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in <b>pressure</b> (<b>potential</b> energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating pump rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive suction head (NPSH).|$|E

Populations of T. repens showed a site-specific growth response; plants from 'dry' habitats were least affected by low soil moisture levels, whereas those from 'wet' habitats were quite adversely affected by low soil moisture status. Such differential response suggested the possible existence of these populations as ecotypes. More evidence was supplied by the reciprocal growth of plants from wet and dry sites on both sites in the field; each performed better when grown on its original site. Physiological differences between ecotypes of T. repens at - 1. 0 MPa in the rooting medium, provided by solutions of polyethylene glycol (m. w. 4000), were investigated.
