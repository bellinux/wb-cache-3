25|$|The most {{controversial}} {{moment of his}} presidency was when the Assembly of the Republic passed a bill for the holding of a <b>pre-legislative</b> referendum on the legalization of abortion in Portugal without any restrictions in the 10 first weeks of pregnancy. After the parliamentary approval of the bill summoning the referendum, Cavaco Silva referred the matter to the Portuguese Constitutional Court, which declared both the proposed legalization and the referendum constitutional by a narrow 7-6 margin. Cavaco Silva, who could still have vetoed the referendum bill, decided to sign it into law despite pressure from some pro-life sectors, and thus allowed the referendum. The majority of the Portuguese electorate abstained from the referendum, but the vote for legalization prevailed among those who chose to cast their ballot.|$|E

A <b>pre-legislative</b> {{referendum}} was held in Scotland in 1997 with two questions: [...] whether to create a devolved Parliament for Scotland and whether it should have limited tax-varying powers. Following a clear 'yes' vote on both questions, {{a referendum on the}} proposal for creating a devolved Assembly was held two weeks later. This produced a narrow 'yes' vote. Both measures were put into effect and the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly began operating in 1999. The first election to the Scottish parliament saw the creation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition with Donald Dewar as First Minister. In Wales, the Labour Party achieved a complete majority with Alun Michael as the Welsh First Minister. In the 2007 Scottish election, the Scottish National Party gained enough seats to form a minority government with its leader Alex Salmond as First Minister.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{referendum}} that have been held by the UK Government, <b>pre-legislative</b> (held before proposed legislation is passed) and post-legislative (held after legislation is passed). To date the previous three UK-wide referendums in 1975, 2011 and 2016 were all post-legislative. Referendums are not legally binding, so legally the Government can ignore the results; for example, even if the result of a <b>pre-legislative</b> referendum were a majority of [...] "No" [...] for a proposed law, Parliament could pass it anyway, because parliament is sovereign.|$|E

50|$|Study of the {{question}} of the legal status of the aircraft had been the subject of debate from as early as the pioneering work of the French jurist Paul Fauchille in 1902 and had been frequently visited by early organisations such as, inter alia, the Comité International Technique d'Experts Juridiques Aériens (International Technical Committee of Aerial Legal Experts), the Institut de Droit International (Institute of International Law), the International Criminal Police Commission and the International Law Association. The question remained {{as one of the most}} important legal problems until the 13-year-long <b>pre-legislative</b> efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization culminated in the Convention on Offenses and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft coming into force on 4 December 1969.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, a draft Heritage Protection Bill {{was subject}} to <b>pre-legislative</b> {{scrutiny}} before its passage through UK Parliament.

The proposal was that the existing registers of buildings, parks and gardens, archaeology and battlefields, maritime wrecks, and World Heritage Sites be merged into a single online register that will [...] "explain what is special and why". English Heritage would become directly responsible for identifying historic assets in England and there would be wider consultation with the public and asset owners, and new rights of appeal.

50|$|In 1977 the Labour Government and the Liberal Party {{agreed the}} Lib-Lab pact {{by which the}} Liberals agreed to support the Government in return for <b>pre-legislative</b> consultation. The pact lasted for a year before lapsing in July 1978; {{at which point the}} Liberal Party {{declared}} that they supported a general election as soon as possible and would therefore support any no confidence motions. Callaghan was widely expected to call an election in September 1978 but decided against this, hoping he would fare better in a year's time once the economy had improved. However the winter saw a prolonged period of industrial unrest known as the Winter of Discontent which severely reduced Labour's popularity. The government survived a motion of no confidence in December 1978 by ten votes after negotiating the support of the Ulster Unionists (draft legislation was before the House to give Northern Ireland more Parliamentary seats; it cleared the House of Commons on 17 January 1979).|$|E

50|$|Anne Hurst, {{spokeswoman}} for Maypole Women, an organisation that supports women through divorce, said:The proposed change will increase children's exposure to conflict and abuse, increase economic inequality, and create no incentive for fathers' increased involvement from their child's birth. Children who actively reject a parent — either the abusive or non-abusive parent — usually {{do so in}} a context of high parental conflict and domestic abuse. Cutting off contact can be a response to alienation tactics, or a coping mechanism. It also did not fully reflect the position of Fathers4Justice, and the group criticised the Coalition for not implementing its agenda in full. The Justice Select Committee considered the draft Children & Families Bill in <b>pre-legislative</b> hearings, but F4J chose to not participate, applying 'late' to give oral evidence, and on issues outside the remit of the Committee. At point 144, the Select Committee's report noted:The organisation Fathers 4 Justice contacted us in the late stages of our inquiry and asked for an invitation to provide oral evidence. They had not responded to our original Call for Evidence nor to the Government's Co-operative Parenting Consultation. We offered them the opportunity to provide written evidence on matters within our terms of reference for the inquiry, but they declined. We have not, therefore, had the benefit of their views. This meant the group's position on shared parenting was not reflected in the draft Bill, yet the group criticised the Bill nonetheless. The group later also refused offers from MPs sitting on the Bill Committee to table amendments on behalf of the group, meaning the group missed the chance of amending the Bill to better reflect its objectives.|$|E
50|$|This Bill {{required}} a referendum {{to be held}} {{on the question of}} the UK’s continued membership of the European Union before the end of 2017. The bill does not contain any requirement for the UK Government to implement the results of the referendum, nor set a time limit by which a vote to leave the EU should be implemented. Instead, this is a type of referendum known as <b>pre-legislative</b> or consultative, which enables the electorate to voice an opinion which then influences the Government in its policy decisions. The referendums held in Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland in 1997 and 1998 are examples of this type, where opinion was tested before legislation was introduced. The UK does not have constitutional provisions which would require the results of a referendum to be implemented, unlike, for example, the Republic of Ireland, where the circumstances in which a binding referendum should be held are set out in its constitution. In contrast, the legislation which provided for the referendum held on AV in May 2011 would have implemented the new system of voting without further legislation, provided that the boundary changes also provided for in the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 were also implemented. In the event, there was a substantial majority against any change. The 1975 referendum was held after the re-negotiated terms of the UK’s EC membership had been agreed by all EC Member States and the terms set out in a command paper which later became known as the Referendum Act 1975 and was passed by both Houses. The Bill became law when it received Royal Assent sent on 15 December 2015.|$|E
