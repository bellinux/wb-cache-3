40|$|Large-scale PRB testing {{during the}} current quarter was cut short due to the {{inability}} of the coal mill to meet the 85 MMBtu/h design firing rate. The project was therefore redirected toward design, installation and testing of the 85 -million Btu/h preheater for bituminous coal. Based on extensive pilot-scale testing completed earlier in the project, 2 -D modeling and preliminary design activities were started based on the use of staged, annular protective air films to control temperature and prevent deposition on the preheater walls. A total of 14 2 -D modeling cases were completed for the modified preheater for bituminous coal. The preheater concept modeled was based on an expanding preheater chamber where the diameter of the chamber is increased in steps along its length and annular cooling/protective air is introduced at each step. A process flow diagram for the bituminous <b>coal</b> <b>preheating</b> system and a preliminary preheater design drawing were developed based on the modeling results.

A second version of the PC burner in which the secondary air channels were closed and replaced with six air nozzles was then tested with PRB coal. Plans were developed with RPI for the next phase of testing at the 100 million Btu/h scale using RPI's Coal Burner Test Facility (CBTF).

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} CFD {{model has}} been developed to simulate the gasification process within an air-blown updraft coal gasifier. Updraft fixed bed gasification processes are characterized by complex behavior, since they involve different space- and time-dependent sub-processes where <b>coal</b> <b>preheating,</b> drying, de-volatilization and char reactions take place.

40|$|A {{pilot plant}} using the Koppelman Series C Process was designed, constructed, and {{operated}} near Gillette, Wyoming, {{as part of}} Phase I of this project. Construction was completed in late fall of 1993, and the shakedown was completed in early 1994. The initial series of tests performed to prove the process and to characterize the effluents was conducted {{during the first half}} of 1994. The results of those tests are described in the final report for Phase I. This report describes the activities conducted during Phase II of the project the objective of which was to move the process, which was proven during Phase I, a step closer to commercialization. Specifically, the work was planned to lower the cost of the process by developing a high-capacity processor, increasing the already high efficiency of the process by using a feed <b>coal</b> <b>preheated,</b> increasing the bulk density of the product by using mixed particle size extrudate, and preparing a preliminary scoping design for the water treatment plant for a 500, 000 ton per year commercial plant...|$|R

40|$|Preparations for {{conducting}} large-scale combustion tests with caking bituminous coal continued during {{the start of}} this quarter. Major project accomplishments related to bituminous coal testing included: a CFD preheat model and evaluation, an update of the process flow diagram and a detailed preheat burner mechanical design (suitable for construction) for firing bituminous coal. Installation and testing of the 85 MMBtu/h bituminous <b>coal</b> <b>preheating</b> system was planned to take place before the end of December. Based on the inability to conduct testing in Riley's Commercial Burner Test Facility (CBTF) during freezing weather, a schedule review indicated required site work for testing bituminous coal at the CBTF could not be completed before freezing weather set in at the site. Further bituminous preheat modification work was put on hold and efforts turned to securing the test facility over the winter season. Bituminous coal tests are therefore delayed; April-May 2005 is earliest estimate of when testing can resume. A request for a time extension was submitted to DOE to extend the project through September 2005 to allow time to secure additional funding and complete the bituminous coal testing. Removal of the PRB PC Preheater from the CBTF burner deck was completed. Decommissioning of the CBTF for the winter was also completed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} a performance analysis of an updraft moving bed gasifier, forming {{part of a}} small (700 kg/h, or 5 MWt) pilot gasification and gas treatment plant for hydrogen production under construction at the Sotacarbo Research Centre in Sardinia. The gasifier will be fed with imported, low sulphur coal and with Sardinian, high sulphur coal (Sulcis coal). Performance has been analysed {{by means of a}} computer simulation model developed at the DIMECA, which considers a “two zone” gasification process (coal drying and devolatilisation zone and char combustion and gasification zone), assuming thermodynamic equilibrium for the char combustion and gasification zone. The simulation model determines the mass and energy balance of the gasifier as well as the main characteristics of the syngas produced during gasification (composition, mass flow, temperature, lower heating value, etc.), for known composition and mass flow of coal, steam and oxidant (oxygen enriched air if required). The results have also been compared with a second simulation model developed using Aspen Plus 12. 1 simulation software. This model enables to schematise, in more detail, the gasifier in different zones: <b>coal</b> <b>preheating</b> and drying, devolatilisation, gasification, combustion and oxidant preheating. However the results achieved with the two gasification models are very similar and compare favourably with the expected performance specified by the gasifier manufacture...|$|R
30|$|The {{consumption}} of solid fossil fuel is gaining importance in world energy production. There {{has been an}} increase in studies on coal since it is an alternative to petrol and has a high reserve. The pulverized coal injection is used to obtain high heat capacity and high burning efficiency in thermal reactors and boilers based on coal. For this purpose, coals are ground at a micron size and then sent to boilers to achieve maximum calorific value. Comminution of coal is essential for effective utilization through combustion, carbonization, gasification and/or beneficiation (Prasher 1987). <b>Preheating</b> a <b>coal</b> in an oven has been shown to reduce grind strength, although it is unlikely that this would be an economically viable method, at least not through associated energy requirements (Harrison and Rowson 1997). The grindability of coal is an important practical and economical property to coal handling and utilization aspects. Thus engineering experiments wish to find the grinding conditions under which a certain process reaches its response optimum. The optimum could be either a maximum or a minimum of a function of the design parameters. One of the methodologies is the surface response methodology (Kwak 2005). Grinding media charge ratio in a conventional grinding system is approximately 40  %. This leads to a better delivery of the grinding energy (Kincl et al. 2005; Lester et al. 2005; Barranco et al. 2006). Grinding in a ball mill has shown that the ball charge has a significant effect on the product fineness for same specific energy consumption and increases power draws of the mill linearly (Tuzun 1994 and Jankovic 2001). The ball size should be just heavy and large so that the charge should be grinded efficiently. In the present work the ball size is kept constant and these are considered to be efficient for the grinding media. In the grinding of Turkish coal and ore, the charge ratio, Bond work index and the ball diameter were taken as the variables in the experiments however, time of grinding is also a significant parameter in the grinding experiments (Aslan and Cebeci 2007; Edadnejad et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{model has been}} developed using the Aspen Plus computer simulation code for predicting performance of small scale updraft moving bed gasifiers, attractive in mid term for reducing dependence on oil and gas and promoting the use of alternative fuels. The Aspen model schematizes the gasifier into several different zones: <b>coal</b> <b>preheating</b> and drying, devolatilization, gasification, combustion and oxidant preheating, assuming char gasification at thermodynamic equilibrium. The model {{can be used to}} evaluate the mass and energy balance in each zone and the main characteristics of the syngas produced by the gasification process (composition, mass flow, temperature, lower heating value, etc.), for given coal composition and coal, steam and oxidant (air or oxygen-enriched air) mass flows. Gasifier mass and energy balances and raw gas composition also influence downstream gas cleaning and treatment systems {{and they need to be}} preliminarily estimated for the design, analysis and performance evaluation of the overall system (gasification, gas cleaning, desulphurisation, CO-shift conversion, CO 2 and hydrogen separation, etc.). Here the model is used to predict the performance of an updraft moving bed gasifier fed by low sulphur coal and high ash, high sulphur Sulcis coal from Sardinia. The gasifier is part of a pilot gasification and gas treatment plant for hydrogen production under construction at the Sotacarbo Research Centre in Sardinia. The results obtained with the Aspen model compare favourably with the expected performance specified by the gasifier manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall project}} {{objective}} {{is the development}} and validation of an innovative combustion system, based on a novel <b>coal</b> <b>preheating</b> concept prior to combustion, that can reduce NO{sub x} emissions to 0. 15 lb/million Btu or less on utility pulverized coal (PC) boilers. This NO{sub x} reduction should be achieved without loss of boiler efficiency or operating stability, and at more than 25 % lower levelized cost than state-of-the-art SCR technology. A further objective is to ready technology for full-scale commercial deployment to meet the market demand for NO{sub x} reduction technologies. Over half of the electric power generated in the U. S. is produced by coal combustion, and more than 80 % of these units utilize PC combustion technology. Conventional measures for NOx reduction in PC combustion processes rely on combustion and post-combustion modifications. A variety of combustion-based NO{sub x} reduction technologies are in use today, including low-NO{sub x} burners (LNBs), flue gas recirculation (FGR), air staging, and natural gas or other fuel reburning. Selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) are post-combustion techniques. NO{sub x} reduction effectiveness from these technologies ranges from 30 to 60 % and up to 90 - 93 % for SCR. Typically, older wall-fired PC burner units produce NO{sub x} emissions {{in the range of}} 0. 8 - 1. 6 lb/million Btu. Low-NO{sub x} burner systems, using combinations of fuel staging within the burner and air staging by introduction of overfire air in the boiler, can reduce NO{sub x} emissions by 50 - 60 %. This approach alone is not sufficient to meet the desired 0. 15 lb/million Btu NO{sub x} standard with a range of coals and boiler loads. Furthermore, the heavy reliance on overfire air can lead to increased slagging and corrosion in furnaces, particularly with higher-sulfur coals, when LNBs are operated at sub-stoichiometric conditions to reduce fuel-derived NOx in the flame. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize the need for overfire air by maximizing NO{sub x} reduction in the burner. The proposed combustion concept aims to greatly reduce NO{sub x} emissions by incorporating a novel modification to conventional or low-NO{sub x} PC burners using gas-fired <b>coal</b> <b>preheating</b> to destroy NO{sub x} precursors and prevent NO{sub x} formation. A concentrated PC stream enters the burner, where flue gas from natural gas combustion is used to heat the PC up to about 1500 F prior to coal combustion. Secondary fuel consumption for preheating is estimated to be 3 to 5 % of the boiler heat input. This thermal pretreatment releases coal volatiles, including fuel-bound nitrogen compounds into oxygen-deficient atmosphere, which converts the coal-derived nitrogen compounds to molecular N{sub 2 } rather than NO. Design, installation, shakedown, and testing on Powder River Basin (PRB) coal at a 3 -million Btu/h pilot system at RPI's (Riley Power, Inc.) pilot-scale combustion facility (PSCF) in Worcester, MA demonstrated that the PC PREHEAT process has a significant effect on final O{sub x} formation in the coal burner. Modifications to both the pilot system gas-fired combustor and the PC burner led to NO{sub x} reduction with PRB coal to levels below 0. 15 lb/million Btu with CO in the range of 35 - 112 ppmv without any furnace air staging...|$|R

Based on these results, modifications to the gas-fired preheat combustor and PC burner were defined, along with a modified testing plan and schedule.

Modeling activities were continued {{to develop and}} verify revised design approaches for both the Preheat gas combustor and PC burner. Reactivation of the pilot test system was begun with BBP personnel. A presentation on the project results to date was given at the NETL-sponsored 2002 Conference on SCR and SNCR for NO{sub x} Control on May 15 - 16, 2002 in Pittsburgh PA.

40|$|Coal {{gasification}} {{is becoming}} commercially even more import {{due to its}} potential application in hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and other chemicals and clean fuels production, other than power generation, together with carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. In this framework the technological development is also addressed, with a renewed interest, to simplified processes and plant solutions based, for example, on gasification with air (or air enriched with oxygen) and on moving or fluidised bed gasifiers, of interest for small and medium scale plants. The design, analysis and performance evaluation of the overall system (gasification, gas clean-up, desulphurisation, CO-shift conversion, CO 2 and hydrogen separation, etc.) require a preliminary estimation of gasifier mass and energy balances and raw gas composition, which influence the whole downstream gas clean-up and treatment systems. The present study reports a process analysis and performance evaluation of updraft moving bed gasifiers, which {{have been carried out}} by a computer simulation model developed using the Aspen Plus 12. 1 software, The model schematises the gasifier in several different zones: <b>coal</b> <b>preheating</b> and drying, devolatilization, gasification, combustion and oxidant preheating, under the hypothesis of char gasification at thermodynamic equilibrium.

In this paper the model is applied to predict the performance of two updraft moving bed gasifiers (sized respectively for 35 kg/h and 700 kg/h of low sulphur coal and high sulphur coal (Sulcis).

40|$|Coal and biomass co-gasification {{could be}} an {{attractive}} option {{to contribute to the}} reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in distributed combined heat and power (CHP) generation. In this framework, several studies on coal and biomass gasification are currently under development by Sotacarbo in its CO 2 Technology Centre of Sulcis (South-West Sardinia, Italy). In particular, an experimental activity is currently under development in the demonstration-scale gasification plant. The unit is mainly composed by a fixed-bed up-draft gasifier (characterized by an inner diameter of 1. 3 m) operating at atmospheric pressure. As known, gasification phenomena are very complex, involving drying, devolatilisation, pyrolysis, heterogeneous (solid-gas phase) and homogenous (gas phase) reactions, with a large number of intermediate and final products. Gasification processes are also influenced by reaction kinetics and fluid-dynamical effects, such as temperature and concentration gradients. In order to optimize the experimental campaigns in the demonstration unit (considering the high cost of each test), the performance of the gasifier has been predicted by a steady-state simulation model developed by DIMCM (the Department of Mechanical, Chemical and Materials Engineering of the University of Cagliari). The steady-state fixed-bed gasification (SFBG) model schematizes the gasifier into several different zones: <b>coal</b> <b>preheating</b> and drying, devolatiliza-tion, gasification, combustion and oxidant preheating, assuming char gasification at thermody-namic equilibrium.

40|$|Proper {{rock dusting}} {{practices}} {{have proven to}} be an effective means of preventing coal dust explosions. Rock dust (generally pulverized limestone dust) serves as a heat sink material that prevents or suppresses a propagating coal dust explosion through the absorption of thermal energy from the heated gases and absorption of radiant energy, which reduces the <b>preheating</b> of unburned <b>coal</b> particles ahead of the flame front. Therefore to effectively suppress a coal dust explosion, sufficient quantities of dispersible rock dust must be entrained into the mine entry by the expanding explosion pressure wave to inert the coal dust, also entrained in the entry. The in-mine application of rock dust dates back to the early 1900 s. Since that time, significant technological improvements to rock dust application methods have been implemented along with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and inspections to ensure adequate quantities of rock dust are applied to the roof, ribs, and floor throughout the mine. Even with enhancements to the rock dusting application methods and equipment, coal mining operations still experience compliance issues associated with meeting the current total incombustible content (TIC) requirement of at least 80 % for all mine dust samples. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted general surveys of rock dusting practices at nine underground coal mining operations and met with Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) mine inspectors and District personnel {{to gain a better understanding}} of the rock dusting practices and associated compliance issues during this survey period. These surveys included obtaining the following from each of the nine mines: 1. Mine dust samples to assess the incombustible content (IC) for determining any rock dust deficient areas common to all nine mines, 2. Information and issues related to rock dusting, and 3. Rock dusting sampling practices. This report discusses research that was conducted in the NIOSH laboratories, experimental mine, and in operating mines to evaluate the potential explosion hazard associated with excessive coal dust accumulating on elevated surfaces, the efficacy of wet rock dusting, and the need for mines to develop comprehensive rock dusting programs. Taken as a whole, this report provides proactive approaches to current rock dusting practices that will improve the application of rock dust in all underground areas of a coal mine.
