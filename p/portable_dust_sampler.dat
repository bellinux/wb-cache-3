40|$|Background: Lahore {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{polluted}} metropolis of Pakistan and only a few studies have been conducted in this country so far, for the assessment of pollution levels prevalent in relation to the ever increasing roadside automobile traffic. This study was carried out to assess the roadside dust and autoexhaust gaseous levels at 23 busy road-crossings of Lahore. Methods: The roadside dust levels were determined by using ‘High volume <b>portable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>sampler</b> ’ and autoexhaust gaseous levels were estimated by using ‘Drager tubes ’ for Carbon monoxide, Sulphur dioxide and Nitrogen dioxide gases with ‘Drager suction pump’. Results: Twenty three sites were sampled for dust and gaseous level estimation. Out of all these; dust concentration was 3. 0 mg/m 3 /hr at 6 (26 %) sites. Regarding gaseous levels, more than 7 (30 %) sites had Carbon monoxide level in excess of 9 ppm, whereas 7 (30 %) sites had sulphur dioxide level of 20 ppm. Nitrogen dioxide levels were hardly above 0. 20 ppm or below detection limits, due to being lower than the minimum detection limit of the available nitrogen dioxide testing Drager tubes. Conclusion: The levels of roadside dust and autoexhaust gaseous pollutants present in the tested areas are quite high and this is by all means a health hazard to the public at large and inhabitants of these areas in particular. Some sort of preventive / protective measures need to be taken to safeguard the health of the people at risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the precision of coal mine dust concentration measurements made with state-of-the-art gravimetric techniques and samplers incorporating flow control technology. Using a specially designed, <b>portable</b> <b>dust</b> chamber, twenty-two tests were conducted in an underground coal mine. Each test consisted of collecting 16 simultaneous <b>dust</b> <b>samples,</b> using 16 coal mine <b>dust</b> <b>sampler</b> units, symmetrically mounted in a container with a central inlet. Dust filter capsules were weighed in the same laboratory before and after exposure, with pre- and post-exposure weights recorded to the nearest µg (0. 001 mg). The average weight gain observed within tests ranged from 62 µg, collected over a 325 -minute sampling period, to 6750 µg, collected over 320 minutes. Based on a weighted least squares, repeated measures regression analysis, a point estimate for the standard deviation of error in recorded weight gain is 9. 1 µg, with an upper one-tailed 95 %-confidence limit (UCL) of 10. 3 µg. The corresponding estimate of measurement imprecision deriving from other sources (including inter-sampler variability) is 4. 3 percent (UCL = 6. 8 %).

In this study, <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from various microenvironments in The Netherlands (houses, cars), Greece (houses), and Sweden (apartments, cars, furniture stores, electronics stores) and analyzed for RBDPP and BPA-BDPP. Additionally, the <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> from The Netherlands were analyzed for decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209) for comparison and for TPHP, which is a byproduct in the RBDPP and BPA-BDPP technical products. BPA-BDPP was detected in almost all <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> from The Netherlands, Greece, and Sweden. Highest concentrations were found in <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> collected on electronic equipment from all three countries with BPA-BDPP levels ranging from < 0. 1 to 1300 μg/g and RBDPP levels from < 0. 04 to 520 μg/g.

40|$|Exposure to {{endotoxin}} in home environments {{has become}} a key issue in asthma and allergy research. Most studies have analyzed floor or mattress dust endotoxin, but its validity {{as a proxy for}} airborne exposure is unknown, while active airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> is not feasible in large-scale population studies because of logistic and financial limitations. We therefore developed and evaluated a simple passive airborne dust collection method for airborne endotoxin exposure assessment. We explored an electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC), consisting of a 42 - by 29. 6 -cm-sized folder with four electrostatic cloths exposed to the air. The EDC was tested during two 14 -day periods in seven nonfarm and nine farm homes and in farm stables. In parallel, active airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> was performed with Harvard impactors and floor dust collected by vacuuming, using nylon sampling socks. The endotoxin levels could be measured in all EDC cloth extracts. The levels (in EU/m 2) between EDCs used simultaneously or in different sampling periods in the same home correlated strongly (r > 0. 8). EDC endotoxin also correlated moderately to strongly (r = 0. 6 to 0. 8) with the endotoxin measured by active airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> and living room floor <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> and—in farm homes—with the endotoxin captured by the EDC in stables. In contrast, endotoxin levels measured by floor <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> showed only a poor correlation with the levels measured by active airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling.</b> We therefore conclude that measuring endotoxin levels with the EDC is a valid measure of average airborne endotoxin exposure, while reproducibility over time is at least equivalent to that of reservoir dust analyses...|$|R

Specificities of available anti-beta-(1, 3) -glucan antibodies were defined by direct and inhibition experiments. Three suitable antibody combinations were selected for sandwich EIAs. beta-(1, 3) -Glucans in passive airborne dust collected with an electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC) and floor dust from seven homes were measured with the three EIAs. Floor <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were additionally analyzed in the inhibition EIA. The sandwich EIAs were sensitive enough for airborne glucan measurement and showed different specificities for commercial glucans, while the beta-(1, 3) -glucan levels in house <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> correlated strongly.

40|$|Objectives: Organic dust {{contains}} several dierent components {{which may}} cause pulmonary eects, and many health {{problems have been}} associated with the collection and recycling of organic waste. It is often dicult to obtain a precise measurement of the exposure to each component in dust, and organic <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from dierent workplaces may vary profoundly in composition. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the inflammatory potential of dust from dierent waste handling plants. Furthermore, we set out to investigate the role of endotoxin in the inflammatory potential of <b>dust.</b> Methods: <b>Dust</b> <b>samples</b> were obtained from four incineration plants, three samples from a plant sorting household waste, five paper-sorting plants, two mail centres, four bottle-sorting plants, and two combined paper-sorting and composting plants. The samples were tested in a bioassay with the lung epithelial cell line A 549. Cells were stimulated for 24 h with <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> at six concentrations, and subsequently the interleukin 8 (IL- 8) secretion into the growth medium was measured. The initial slope of the dose response curves was used to calculate the potency factor (PF) of the <b>dust</b> <b>samples,</b> and correction against positive control samples was used to reduce day-to-day variation. The concentration of endotoxin in the dus...|$|R
40|$|Paired kitchen-living room <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> from 30 UK {{houses were}} {{collected}} {{for the analysis}} of BFRs, including PBDEs, HBCDDs and PBEB, EH-TBB, BTBPE, BEH-TEBP, DBDPE. Ninety-six plastic kitchen utensils were collected, screened for Br concentration by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, with 30 of these samples analysed for BFR concentrations. A simulated cooking experiment was conducted to evaluate BFR exposure. Temporal and geographical differences in concentrations of BFRs in indoor <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were investigated via comparing BFR concentrations in UK samples in 2006 - 07 and 2015 and comparing 116 indoor house <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> collected between 2014 - 15 from 6 countries (Finland, Greece, Spain, Jordan, US and Mexico) respectively. Concentrations of BDE- 209 in living room dust were significantly lower and those of DBDPE significantly higher (p< 0. 05) compared to concentrations in 2006 - 07 in UK dust. All target BFRs were present at higher concentrations in living rooms than kitchens. Considerable BFR transfer from kitchen utensils to cooking oils was observed and estimated exposure via cooking was 60 ng/day. US dust showed the highest Penta-BDE concentrations, followed by Mexico. Jordanian <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> contained the highest concentrations of Octa-BDE. US and Mexican samples were found to display a similar composition to that found in the FireMaster® 550 formulation (EH-TBB:BEH-TEBP= 4 : 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Cotton <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> for {{monitoring}} worker exposure was traditionally performed by work area sampling. A change to an exposure limit {{based on personal}} sampling has recently been agreed. The choice of sampling head for personal monitoring exposure was hampered {{by the use of}} two different sampling heads in the major epidemiological studies of textile workers which had incorporated personal sampling techniques. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the results of exposure measurements using these two sampling heads. This study has examined the performance of the two sampling heads, by performing dual sampling on cotton operatives during normal working activities. Each operative included wore two samplers randomly allocated to left or right side. A minimum of 200 minutes of sampling was accepted and the relative concentrations calculated. The IOM total <b>dust</b> <b>sampler</b> produced repeatedly higher measurements than the Manchester head. The ratio overall was 1. 33 (95 % C. I. 1. 20 - 1. 49). The performance was similar across three ranges of dust exposure from low ( 3 mg/m'-ratio 1. 24). The two heads give reproducibly proportionate dust measurements with approximately 30 % greater results obtained with the IOM total <b>dust</b> <b>sampler.</b> Either <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> head could be used for worker monitoring and the results adjusted accordingly for reference to the Maximu...|$|R
