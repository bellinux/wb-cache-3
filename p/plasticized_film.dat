In this study, five systems of plasticized and unplasticized polymer electrolyte films i. e. PAN-EC, PAN-LiCF(3) SO(3), PAN-NaCF(3) SO(3) PAN-EC-LiCF(3) SO(3) and PAN-EC-NaCF(3) SO(3) {{systems have been}} prepared. The structural and morphological properties of the films were studied using infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while the conductivity study was done by using impedance spectroscopy. The infrared results revealed that interaction had taken place between the nitrogen atoms of PAN and Li(+) and Na(+) ions from the salts. SEM micrographs showed that the <b>plasticized</b> <b>film,</b> PAN-EC-NaCF(3) SO(3) has bigger pores than PAN-Er-LiCF(3) SO(3) film resulting in the film containing NaCF(3) SO(3) salt being more conductive. On addition of salts and plasticizer, the conductivity of pure PAN increases to three orders of magnitude. The <b>plasticized</b> <b>film</b> containing NaCF(3) SO(3) salt has a higher conductivity compared to that containing LiCF(3) SO(3) salt. This result showed that the interaction between Li(+) -ion and the nitrogen atom of PAN was stronger than that of Na(+) -ion. The conductivity-temperature dependence of the highest conducting film from each system follows Arrhenius equation in the temperature range of 303 to 353 K. The conductivity-pressure study {{in the range of}} 0. 01 - 0. 09 MPa showed that the conductivity decreased when pressure was increased. This can be explained in term of free volume model...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that {{the inclusion of a}} small amount of the co-solvent 1, 8 -diiodooctane in the preparation of a bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic device increases its power conversion efficiency by 20 %, through a mechanism of transient plasticisation. We follow the removal of 1, 8 -diiodooctane directly after spin-coating using ellipsometry and ion beam analysis, while using small angle neutron scattering to characterise the morphological nanostructure evolution of the film. In PffBT 4 T- 2 OD/PC 71 BM devices, the power conversion efficiency increases from 7. 2 % to above 8. 7 % {{as a result of the}} coarsening of the phase domains. This coarsening process is assisted by thermal annealing and the slow evaporation of 1, 8 -diiodooctane, which we suggest, acts as a plasticiser to promote molecular mobility. Our results show that 1, 8 -diiodooctane can be completely removed from the film by a thermal annealing process at temperatures ≤ 100 [*]°C and that there is an interplay between the evaporation rate of 1, 8 -diiodooctane and the rate of domain coarsening in the <b>plasticized</b> <b>film</b> which helps elucidate the mechanism by which additives improve device efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate {{on the effects}} of glycerol/water and sorbitol/water on the plasticization of hydroxyethylacryl chitosan (HC) /sodium alginate (SA) films. The HC/SA films were prepared with different amount of glycerol or sorbitol as a plasticizer (25, 40 and 50 % w/w) and kept at different relative humidity (0 % RH and 50 % RH) in order to restrict the content of water within the films. The results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the miscibility of polymer and plasticizers (glycerol and sorbitol) for all blend compositions. A remarkable reduction of glass transition temperature (Tg) could be obtained by adding glycerol over 40 % w/w. For sorbitol <b>plasticized</b> <b>films,</b> although the addition of sorbitol could reduce Tg, it was still higher than room temperature. It was claimed that glycerol could gain more effective plasticizing than sorbitol in the HC/SA films. In the cooperation with water as co-plasticizer (glycerol/water or sorbitol/water), the Tg values of all films were dramatically decreased to - 50 °C for glycerol/water <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> and down to 0 °C for sorbitol/water <b>plasticized</b> <b>films.</b> The reasonable flexible films could be obtained by the use of either glycerol/water or sorbitol/water as couple plasticizers...|$|R

Three plasticizers comprising sorbitol (SOR), glycerol (GLY) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were studied over {{a range of}} concentration from 20 to 60 %. Increasing concentration of these plasticizers resulted in decreased tensile strength (TS) concomitant {{with an increase in}} elongation at break (E), water vapor permeability (WVP) and film solubility (FS). SOR <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> were the most brittle, with the highest tensile strength (TS, 26. 06 MPa). However, its effect on WVP was low (5. 45 g. mm/m 2. day. kPa). In contrast, GLY and PEG <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> had a flexible structure contradictory to a low TS (14. 31 MPa and 16. 14 MPa, respectively) providing a high WVP (14. 52 g. mm/m 2. day. kPa and 14. 69 g. mm/m 2. day. kPa, respectively).

Nine moisture sorption models were applied to experimental data. Moisture content of the film increased at elevated water activity. The time to reach equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was about 20 - 24 days at lower humidity and 13 - 16 days at higher humidities.

40|$|Chitosan {{was used}} as the host polymer with lithium acetate (LiOAc) as the doping salt and Palmitic Acid (PA) and Oleic Acid (OA) as plasticizers. The highest {{conductivity}} value was obtained for film containing salt 55 wt. % CA and 45 wt. % LiOAc. At this composition, the surface of the film shows clusters of needle or dendrite-like structures. The x-ray diffractogram shows peaks at 2 θ = 16 °, 21 °, 26 ° and 31 ° attributed to the salt. The peaks are small and relatively broad in comparison to sample with equal amounts of polymer and salt. The surface of the film shows that the salt has recrystallized out of the film. This could reduce the number of mobile lithium ions in the film and thus lower the conductivity of this sample. Both films formed from solution containing 1. 0 g chitosan + 0. 20 g oleic acid and containing 1. 0 g chitosan + 0. 40 g oleic acid have a porous surface.

To modify their functional properties, kafirin films were cast, with and without plasticizer, from glacial acetic acid (GAA) and aqueous ethanol (AE), then heated using microwave energy. A power of 80 W for 2 min caused an approximately two- and fourfold increase in the tensile strength of non-plasticized and <b>plasticized</b> <b>films,</b> respectively. Film glass transition temperature increased by about 15 %. Film biodegradability was slowed. However, only the digestibility of the non-plasticized films cast from AE heated {{for the longest time}} (4 min) was decreased, by about 25 %; while that of the other films was not affected. GAA cast films had higher digestibility than AE cast ones, possibly as a result of acid-mediated deamidation of kafirin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated heat-induced kafirin oligomers. Scanning electron microscopy of heated <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> showed more wrinkled structures compared to non-heated films, whereas the non-plasticized films appeared more brittle with heating.

Regardless of plasticizer types, the tensile strength of <b>plasticized</b> SPS <b>films</b> decreased, whereas their elongation at break (E%) increased as the plasticizer concentrations were raised. However, the E% for G and GS-plasticized films significantly decreased at a higher plasticizer concentration (45 % w/w) due to the anti-plasticization effect of plasticizers. Change in plasticizer concentration showed an insignificant effect on the thermal properties of S-plasticized films.

These factors are critical when metalloporphyrins are incorporated in <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> as anion ionophores. 	Scandium porphyrins proved to be useful as fluoride-selective ionophores in optical and electrochemical fluoride sensors. These sensors exhibited excellent selectivity for fluoride over other anions. A novel bis(µ-fluoride) dimer structure was identified by X-ray crystallography and optical selectivity was further improved based on the Soret band shift induced by the dimer-monomer equilibrium in response to fluoride. 	Since gallium porphyrins were found to complex fluoride in both monomeric and dimeric forms within <b>plasticized</b> PVC <b>films,</b> the dimer-monomer equilibrium was actively utilized to improve sensitivity and selectivity for detecting fluoride. Weakening dimerization by doping the film with appropriate additives led a lowered detection limit for optical fluoride sensing. However, enhancing dimerization by covalently connecting two porphyrins improved selectivity for fluoride over other anions. This study demonstrated alternative approaches to improve sensor properties when a dimer-monomer equilibrium is present. 	The dimer-monomer response mechanism was examined using a sub-micron thick optical film in the planar waveguide configuration. This study was based on the dimer-monomer equilibria of indium porphyrins as a model system. The fast response time (< 2 sec) for detection of aqueous chloride ion and gaseous amines showed this equilibrium is fast enough to be potentially applied to prepare flow-through optical detectors for analytical instruments such as GC and LC.

Different types of biodegradable substances, all authorized for food contact according to the European regulation, i. e., acetyltributyl citrate (ATBC), glycerol triacetate (GTA) and (PEG) at different molecular weights, were tested at different percentages (5, 10 and 20 wt %). Thermal and mechanical characterization of PHBV/plasticizer blends showed that a significant plasticizing effect was obtained using hydrophobic substances such as ATBC and GTA, with an increase of the elongation at break from 1. 8 % up to about 6 % for an additive content of 10 wt %. However, the incorporation of WSF in plasticized PHBV led to a dramatic decrease in the elongation at break of composites, neutralizing the increase of this parameter {{by the addition of}} the plasticizers. The stress at break of <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> was also significantly decreased by the introduction of fibers. Such a loss of ductility was mainly explained by the occurrence of microscopic defects in the materials induced by the presence of fibers and to a poor adhesion at the fiber/matrix interface...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{experimental}} researches of electroconductivity of PVC <b>films,</b> <b>plasticized</b> by patented modifier, at fields below the breakdown level are described. A possibility of {{management of the}} repeated transitions between two states with high and relatively low conductivity with conservation of reversibility is found out. A simple qualitative model of abnormal conductivity based on representation of polymer film as a sequence p-n of transitions is offered. For samples of <b>plasticized</b> PVC <b>films</b> with thickness 30 - 50 microns specific volume resistance of steady states was of an order of 10 E 4 Om*m × 10 E 6 Om*m, accordingly. A simple qualitative model describing abnormal character of conductivity of polymeric films is offered. The model considers the presence of known non-uniform plasticized polymer structure with discrete domains in which quasi-free moving of charges can occur. At imposing of an external field semi-condictive domains form sequence of p-n transitions which provides presence of two states of conductivity, in analogy with dinistors.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{possibility}} of substituting an unrefined biodiesel coproduct stream (BCS) for refined glycerol as a polymer plasticizer we have prepared cast gelatin <b>films</b> <b>plasticized</b> with a simulated BCS, i. e., mixtures of glycerol {{and some of the}} typical components found in BCS (methyl linoleate, methyl oleate, linoleic acid, and oleic acid). We measured the tensile properties as a function of plasticizer composition, and analyzed the specific effect of each individual component on tensile properties. We found that it is the unrecovered alkyl esters that largely determine the tensile properties, and that BCS can be successfully used to <b>plasticize</b> cast gelatin <b>films</b> as long as the BCS contains 11 parts by weight, or less, of unrecovered alkyl esters per 100 parts glycerol...|$|R
40|$|DB is a whitish to {{yellowish}} resin, characterized initially {{in terms}} of solubility, acid value, molecular weight (Mw), polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) and glass transition temperature (Tg). Neat <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> of DB (Damar Batu) are investigated for mechanical, water vapor transmission and moisture absorption properties. To improve the mechanical properties of the free films dibutyl sebacate, a hydrophobic plasticizer was added to film composition. The biomaterial was further investigated for sustaining the drug release from spherical units (multiparticulates). The core of pellet was prepared using Diclofenac sodium (10 % w/w) as a model drug by extrusion and speronization. The drug containing pellets were coated using DB plasticized film-coating solutions. With 2 % coat build-up, sustained drug release up to 10 h was achieved with coating solution containing 20 % and 30 % w/w (based on DB weight) plasticizers. Less than 3 % drug was released in the first 2 h which may be explained {{in terms of}} the insolubility of DB and the drug in acidic milieu. The release from pellets coated using DB film coating solution containing 20 % and 30 % plasticizers followed first order release pattern. DB seems to be a promising film former for pharmaceutical coating due to its reasonably good mechanical properties, low water vapor transmission and sustained release capability...|$|R
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Informa Healthcare [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]In the development of bioadhesive patch devices for percutaneous local anesthesia, the tensile properties of the films produced after the casting of the gel intermediates is of key importance to the clinical compliance of the product, and its effective delivery of the local anesthetic agent. A range of bioadhesive patches were formulated and their mechanical and in vitro permeation properties determined. Altering formulation significantly altered the mechanical properties of films. The tensile properties of the films could be modified to allow concomitant benefits in the mechanical and drug permeation properties of the films, ensuring that patches not only exerted clinically beneficial effects, but are also mechanically robust. Tetracaine was found to <b>plasticize</b> <b>films</b> and while this effect was weak, it was significant both statistically and potentially also in the effect it has on the clinical use of these devices. Drug release from tetracaine patches demonstrate the same trends as found previously across polydimethylsiloxane films. By altering the formulation of the patch device, the drug release from the device to the skin is readily and accurately controlled, and was not solely a function of the stratum corneum barrier properties but additionally of the formulation.

40|$|The results {{refer to}} changes of {{mechanical}} properties of thin-walled nickel-chromium alloy tube specimens after multistage cold drawing. The {{goal was to}} analyze the possibilities of changing the kinetics of hardening and destruction under influence of deposited metal oxide films. It has been noticed that under ultimate strain by drawing strength of coated tube specimens {{is much more than}} that of specimens without films. Specifically, the ultimate value of strain for coated tube specimens increases. At the same time the coated specimens have relatively high plasticity. The strength of coated specimens after ultimate strain is 14 – 23 % higher and plasticity is 4 times more. Specifically, that the ability of alloy to stand multistage ultimate strain can be increased more. It can be done by overlaying the film each time the specimen is drawn. In addition, there are the technological advantages of using the films under drawing. These advantages are the better quality of surface and decrease of drawing force. The possibility of effective application of <b>plasticizing</b> <b>films</b> to machining tools has been noted. The plasticity effect in this case is 50 – 70 % of that when films are deposited on material. Besides, they work as solid lubricants, decreasing power consumption for working and wear of tool. In explosive stamping tests of titanium-base alloy coating with oxide films resulted in double increase of plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Arabinoglucuronoxylan was {{extracted}} from Norway spruce and films prepared by casting from aqueous solution. The sugar analysis and NMR {{confirmed that the}} spruce xylan was composed of arabinose, 4 -O-methyl-glucuronic acid and xylose in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 11 respectively. Substitutions of 4 -O-methyl-alpha-D-GlcpA at O- 2 and of alpha-L-Araf at O- 3 on the xylose backbone were found by NOE analysis. NOE cross-peaks indicated as well that {{there is at least}} one free xylose on the main chain present between two substitutions. Whether the distribution of side chains was random or in blocks was uncertain. The average molecular weight of the sample was determined by size exclusion chromatography to be 12, 780 g/mol. Arabinoglucoronoxylan casting yielded transparent flexible films with an average stress at break of 55 MPa, strain at break of 2. 7 % and a Young's Modulus 2735 MPa. Wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis showed that the arabinoglucuronoxylan films were totally amorphous. Addition of sorbitol as plasticizer resulted in less strong but more flexible films (strain at break of 5 %). Peaks of crystallinity could be seen in X-ray which corresponds to sorbitol crystallizing in distinct phases. The dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the arabinoglucuronoxylan film softened at a later relative humidity (80 % RH) in comparison with <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> (60 % RH). The films showed low oxygen permeability and thus have a potential application in food packaging...|$|R

40|$|Solvent cast films {{comprising}} synthetic (polyethylene oxide — Polyox™ WSR 301 [POL]) {{and natural}} (carrageenan [CAR]) polymers together with streptomycin (antimicrobial) combined with diclofenac (anti-inflammatory) for synergisticaction, {{with the aim}} of achieving enhanced wound healing effects have been prepared. The films containing different ratios of POL and CAR, plasticized with glycerol were characterized by swelling and hydration capacity, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), texture analysis for mechanical properties and in vitro mucoadhesive properties. In vitro antibacterial studies using disk diffusion test and drug release profiles with Franz diffusion cell were conducted. SEM studies of unplasticized blank films showed presence of spherulitic crystals of POL with homogeneous interpenetrating polymer network. Both blank (BLK) and drug-loaded (DL) films showed homogeneous morphology. DSC results of pure streptomycin and diclofenac showed a melt peak at 146. 77 and 293. 96 °C, respectively; however, this peak was absent in DL films indicating molecular dispersion of the drug. Films containing 25 % w/w glycerol exhibited significantly (n = 3, p < 0. 001) high work of adhesion, stickiness and cohesiveness with high hydration and swelling index corresponding to unplasticized films. BLK films containing glycerol showed higher tensile strength (TS) (1. 1 – 12. 3 MPa) than DLf ilms (0. 7 – 9. 5 MPa). <b>Film</b> <b>plasticized</b> with 25 % w/w glycerol (1. 00 MPa TS, 1031 % elongation at break) revealed soft and tough formulation. Antibacterial studies showed that diclofenac and streptomycin significantly (n = 3, p < 0. 01) increased zone of inhibition (ZOI) in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in contrast to their individual ZOIs. Unplasticized films showed significantly (n = 2 p < 0. 0318) higher cumulative percent drug release of streptomycin and diclofenac (60. 07 ± 1. 56 %, 63. 39 ± 1. 92 %, respectively) compared to <b>plasticized</b> <b>films</b> (52. 11 ± 1. 34 %, 55. 26 ± 2. 25 %) within 72 hours.
