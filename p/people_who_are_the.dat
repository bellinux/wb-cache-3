2500|$|A dialect is {{a variety}} of {{language}} that is characteristic of a particular group among the language speakers. The group of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a register or a discourse, where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain {{the status of a}} language due to political and social reasons. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages too) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that [...] "a language is a dialect with an army and navy" [...] is attributed as a definition formulated by Max Weinreich.|$|E

[...] Commenting on then Cardinal Ratzinger, he said, [...] "Ratzinger, who is, in his mind-set, a Nazi" [...] because he is [...] "afraid to tell the truth," [...] and because he and John Paul II [...] "won't even let themselves be {{in the presence of the}} truth, because it would shatter their very stylised view of things."
