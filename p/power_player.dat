25|$|Before the 1970s, {{regardless}} of the not-so-good performance at world international tournaments, Puerto Rico started to emerge as a <b>power</b> <b>player</b> at regional tournaments, medaling in all the competitions it participated (the Pan American Games, the CentroBasket tournament and the Central American and Caribbean Games). The medal count included two golds at the 1962 and the 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games, failing to medal only at the 1967 Pan American Games, where it finished 5th.|$|E

[...] Some agreed with Safire, who had said that Hillary Clinton was [...] "a vindictive <b>power</b> <b>player</b> who used the FBI to ruin the lives of people {{standing}} in the way of juicy patronage." [...] Conservative commentator Barbara Olson would entitle her highly unflattering 1999book Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton, in reference to Clinton's Travelgate phrase. [...] However, these had little effect on Hillary Clinton's career, as she won the 2000election to the Senate, won re-election in 2006, became a strong contender for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2008 presidential election, then served as U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and then ran for president again in 2016, becoming the nominee.|$|E

500|$|At {{any given}} time, the four contestants who have {{accumulated}} {{the most money}} in their bouts live in [...] "Winners' Row," [...] an area of living quarters set {{up next to the}} hourglass. They are at risk of being displaced if someone else outscores them. During a [...] "Winner's Defense" [...] bout, the current [...] "Power Player" [...] chooses one of the four Winners' Row occupants (including himself/herself) to face off against the current Money Chair occupant. The winner claims the loser's entire winnings in addition to his/her own and assumes control of the Money Chair, while the loser is eliminated. In episode one, the <b>Power</b> <b>Player</b> was the contestant with the most winnings; starting with episode two, it was the contestant who had the highest number of correct answers from playing along in Winners' Row that day. Contestants who are defeated in the Winner's Defense bouts lose all winnings they have accumulated. All other defeated contestants, including those displaced from Winners' Row by being out-scored, may try out again for a chance to win their way back into the Money Chair.|$|E
2500|$|On August 23, 1985, at age 67, Riggs {{returned}} to the tennis spotlight when he partnered with Vitas Gerulaitis, {{at the time a}} top-20 player, to launch another challenge to female players. [...] He challenged Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver to a doubles match. Navratilova said that she accepted because she believed she and Pam had no weaknesses when playing doubles, and {{that they were going to}} 'do a Billie' and win, especially given Riggs' age. The match took place at The Atlantic City Convention Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. [...] Riggs' health had deteriorated somewhat from his last outing as he was now deaf and wore glasses. Moreover, because Riggs was a finesse player and not a <b>power</b> <b>player,</b> the women expected that defeating him would be easier than a retired <b>power</b> <b>player.</b> Riggs' return was short lived when the women won 6–3, 6–2, 6–4.|$|E
2500|$|A cranker or <b>power</b> <b>player</b> is a bowler who {{strives to}} {{generate}} revolutions using a cupped wrist or excessive wrist action. They have rev rates over 370 rpm. Crankers {{who rely on}} wrist action may have a high backswing and open their shoulders to generate ball speed. These bowlers often cup the wrist, but open the wrist {{at the top of}} the swing. Crankers may also muscle the ball with a bent elbow because their wrist is not strong enough to be cupped at the release. Crankers often use [...] "late" [...] timing, where the foot gets to the foul line before the ball; a technique known as plant and pull, hardly using any slide on their final step and pulling the ball upwards for leverage. The timing between the feet and the ball being delivered is only a fraction of a second. Even though the plant and pull bowler is sometimes used as another name for a cranker, it is rather misleading because some crankers slide more, while bowlers with other styles can also use this technique. The term [...] "cranking" [...] is used to describe the style of release and heavy wrist action that typifies crankers. Because of the high rev rate and power crankers have, they can throw powerful strikes even on less-than-perfect hits, but are more prone to splits rarely left by strokers or otherwise. Because many bowlers have a style that can be described as a cranker or a power stroker, the term <b>power</b> <b>player</b> is used for any bowler who can generate high revolutions or ball speed.|$|E
