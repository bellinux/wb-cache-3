25|$|According to kin {{selection}} theory, relatedness {{is extremely}} important in reproductive behavior. This is because by favoring offspring that are close relatives, this individual can {{increase the likelihood of}} its genes being passed into the next generation. Like most Vespula wasps, V. acadica has high effective paternity(>2). This derived trait is the measure of queen mating frequency, and it also takes into account the use of sperm. Evidence indicates that the opportunity for multiple matings is present for V. acadica, even though the queens do not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> matings.|$|E

25|$|Artists who <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> arts {{in front}} of an {{audience}} are called performers, including actors, comedians, dancers, musicians, and singers.

This is called Performance art. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of props. Dance was often referred to as a plastic art during the Modern dance era.|$|E
