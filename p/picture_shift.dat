40|$|The {{extension}} of human hunger for knowledge is also extends its root to {{the domain of}} rural studies. Attempts are moving ahead across the globe to understand the structure and functioning pattern of village community. India, the land of villages is not lagging behind in this race. Good number of attempts has been made by socio-anthropologists to understand the diversified Indian villages. But {{the primary focus of}} our rural studies continued to be the institutions of caste, family, kinship and religion. Even though the village <b>picture</b> <b>shifted</b> from book view which barrowed from classical Hindu scripture to authentic field view, understand the rural scenario as a whole through an Indigenous way is lagging in our rural studies. One can easily identify the shadow of western influence on Indian rural studies.

This piece of writing is going to criticize the early rural studies in hand, on the other hand it emphasizes on the present day need towards Indian village studies...|$|R

40|$|In Baddeley 2 ̆ 7 s {{working memory}} model, verbalizable visual {{material}} such as pictures are recoded into a phonological form and then rehearsed, while auditory material is rehearsed directly. The recoding and rehearsal processes are mediated by articulatory control {{process in the}} left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Developmentally, the phonological strategy for serially-presented visual material emerges around 7. years of age, while that for auditory material is consistently present by 4. years of age. However, the strategy change may actually be correlated with memory ability as this usually increases with age. To investigate {{the relationship between the}} strategy for pictures and memory ability, we monitored the left VLPFC activation in 5 to 11. year-old children during free recall of visually- or auditorily-presented familiar objects using event-related near-infrared spectroscopy. We hypothesized that the phonological strategy of rehearsal and recoding for visual material would provoke greater activation than only rehearsal for auditory material in the left VLPFC. Therefore, we presumed that the activation difference for visual material compared with auditory material in the left VLPFC may represent the tendency to use a phonological strategy. We found that the activation difference in the left VLPFC showed a significant positive correlation with memory ability but not with age, suggesting that children with high memory ability make more use of phonological strategy for pictures. The present study provides functional evidence that the strategy in short-term memory for <b>pictures</b> <b>shifts</b> gradually from non-phonological to phonological as memory ability increases in childhood...|$|R

40|$|The spatial {{organisation}} {{of museums}} {{and its influence}} on the visitor experience {{has been the subject}} of numerous studies. Previous research, despite reporting some actual behavioural correlates, rarely had the possibility to investigate the cognitive processes of the art viewers. In the museum context, where spatial layout is one of the most powerful curatorial tools available, attention and memory can be measured as a means of establishing whether or not the gallery fulfils its function as a space for contemplating art. In this exploratory experiment, 32 participants split into two groups explored an experimental, non-public exhibition and completed two unanticipated memory tests afterwards. The results show that some spatial characteristics of an exhibition can inhibit the recall of <b>pictures</b> and <b>shift</b> the focus to perceptual salience of the artworks...|$|R

50|$|Finally, {{the three}} {{individual}} films would jitter and weave slightly as the films {{moved through the}} projectors. This normal frame-to-frame movement is typically imperceptible to cinema audiences where only a single projector is in use. However, in Cinerama, this resulted in the center picture constantly moving slightly relative {{to each of the}} side <b>pictures.</b> The <b>shifting</b> displacements were perceivable at the two points where the center picture met the side pictures, resulting in what appeared to many viewers to be jittering vertical lines at one-third and two-thirds of the way across the screen as the two touching images constantly moved around relative to each other. Cinerama projectors used a device to slightly blur the join lines to make the jitter less noticeable. Future systems such as Circle-Vision 360° would correct for this by having masked areas between the screens. The jitters continued, but viewers were less aware of them with the adjoining pictures no longer so close together.|$|R

Seventy-two 24 -month-olds heard sentences containing target words denoting objects that were or were {{not present in}} a visual display.

Children hearing a familiar word that was an appropriate label for the currently fixated picture maintained their gaze. Children hearing a familiar word that could {{not apply to the}} currently fixated <b>picture</b> rapidly <b>shifted</b> their gaze to the alternative picture, whether that alternative was the named target or not, and then continued to search for an appropriate referent. Finally, children hearing an unfamiliar word shifted their gaze slowly and irregularly. This set of outcomes is interpreted as evidence that by 24 months, rapid activation in word recognition does not depend on the presence of the words' referents. Rather, very young children are capable of quickly and efficiently interpreting words in the absence of visual supporting context...|$|R
