5000|$|At Leeds Ionescu designed, {{created and}} {{implanted}} in the mitral position in humans, {{for the first time}} ever, porcine aortic valves attached to a Teflon cloth collar, starting in February 1967. This was followed by the creation of the Dacron covered titanium frame for mounting the porcine aortic valves to be able to implant them in all three cardiac locations (mitral, aortic, tricuspid). With various modifications and improvements, these stent mounted valves had been implanted in 87 patients between February 1967 and March 1969. All these valves were treated with formaldehyde and this was the main reason for their limited durability.In a continuous search to create a tissue heart valve which could be used without anticoagulant treatment, Ionescu created a novel artificial valve. Using autologous fascia lata tissue (the fibrous membrane which covers the outside aspect of the thigh muscles) taken from the patient and used to construct the valve during the operation by mounting the living fascia on a Dacron-covered titanium frame {{in the shape of a}} three cusp valve. He began the clinical implantation of these valves in April 1969. This procedure of valve construction and implantation had been used in many centres in the world for about three years until it was realised that fascia lata did not perform well over longer periods of time in the high pressure environment of the left heart.These valves became incompetent after various durations <b>post</b> <b>implantation</b> - from 3 to 12 years. However, two important facts were established by the use of such valves. The haemodynamic performance in both mitral and aortic positions was superior to all known artificial heart valves and that the risk of thrombosis and embolisation was minimal when compared with mechanical valves. Freehand insertion of stentless fascia lata aortic valves was also used in a small number of cases with similar results.|$|E

Cancer-cachexia {{is the most common}} manifestation of the advanced malignant disease, leading to death. Underlying mechanisms of cancer-cachexia are not well understood. Mitochondrial degeneration {{is associated}} with cancer-cachexia and may instigate skeletal muscle atrophy through pathways affiliated with reactive oxygen species signaling and energy demand. PURPOSE: Assess mitochondrial quallity and function throughout the progression of cancer-cachexia. METHODS: Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells (LLC) or Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, control) were injected into the hind-flank of C 57 Bl 6 /J mice at 8 weeks age, and tumor allowed to develop for 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks. Muscle size was assessed by muscle wet weights and cross sectional area (CSA). Mitochondrial function was assessed in permeabilized adult myofibers for each time point. In order to measure mitochondrial degeneration, the reporter gene pMitotimer were inserted to the Flexor Digitorum Brevis muscle 2 weeks before LLC or PBS injection and imaged in whole-mounted muscle at harvest by fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Muscle wet weights were significantly decreased by ~ 10 - 20 % at 4 weeks <b>post</b> LLC <b>implantation</b> when compared to PBS. Average CSA decreased by ~ 40 % by 4 -week <b>post</b> LLC <b>implantation.</b> Mitochondrial function was disrupted by 3 -week <b>post</b> LLC <b>implantation</b> indicated by a ~ 25 % decrease in Respiratory Control Ratio. Mitochondria displayed significant signs of degeneration by 2 -weeks <b>post</b> LLC <b>implantation</b> when compared to PBS control, portrayed by a 50 % increase in pMitotimer Red/Green ratio, indicating general degeneration of the network, and 400 % increase in pure red puncta, revealing the presence of completely degenerated mitochondria marked for degradation. CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial degeneration appears to occur prior to the onset of skeletal muscle atrophy in the progression of cancer-cachexia. This study indicates novel potential early stage mechanisms leading to muscle wasting in cancer-cachexia...|$|R
50|$|A Southern German {{team led}} by the University Eye Hospital in Tübingen, was formed in 1995 by Eberhart Zrenner to develop a subretinal prosthesis.The chip is located behind the retina and {{utilizes}} microphotodiode arrays (MPDA) which collect incident light and transform it into electrical current stimulating the retinal ganglion cells.As natural photoreceptors are far more efficient than photodiodes, visible light is not powerful enough to stimulate the MPDA. Therefore, an external power supply is used to enhance the stimulation current. The German team commenced in vivo experiments in 2000, when evoked cortical potentials were measured from Yucatán micropigs and rabbits. At 14 months <b>post</b> <b>implantation,</b> the implant and retina surrounding it were examined {{and there were no}} noticeable changes to anatomical integrity. The implants were successful in producing evoked cortical potentials in half of the animals tested. The thresholds identified in this study were similar to those required in epiretinal stimulation.The latest reports from this group concern the results of a clinical pilot study on 11 participants suffering from RP. Some blind patients were able to read letters, recognize unknown objects, localize a plate, a cup and cutlery. The results were to be presented in detail in 2011 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.In 2010 a new multicenter Study has been started using a fully implantable device with 1500 Electrodes Alpha IMS (produced by Retina Implant AG, Reutlingen, Germany), 10 patients included so far; first results have been presented at ARVO 2011. The first UK implantations took place in March 2012 and were led by Robert MacLaren at the University of Oxford and Tim Jackson at King's College Hospital in London. David Wong also implanted the Tübingen device in a patient in Hong Kong. In all cases previously blind patients had some degree of sight restored, confirming that despite the complexity of surgery, the device can be implanted successfully at other specialist centers around the World.|$|E

40|$|Dental implant {{is one of}} the {{restorative}} {{methods to}} replace missing teeth. As implants are directly anchored into bones, they provide stability, a more natural appearance, and minimize the risk of bone resorption and atrophy. However, studies found that diabetes mellitus patients had a slower healing process after surgery because of the reduction of vascular supply due to microangiopathies, decreased host defense, formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), reduction of collagen production and increased collagenase activity. Diabetes mellitus patients may pose contraindications to dental implants. As a result of that, dental implantation failure rate in diabetic patients is much higher than that in non-diabetic patients. In this clinical experiment, we compared the amount of blood cells, and cytokines production 24 h <b>post</b> <b>implantations,</b> and the implant mobility 90 days post-surgery between controlled type 2 diabetic patients and the non-diabetic patients. It was aimed to investigate the suitability of diabetic patients to have dental implants and the efficacy of the amount of dental implants related to the success rates. 138 patients with type 2 diabetics and 140 healthy subjects, who had one to three adjacent edentulous spaces, were selected. Dental implantation surgeries were performed under local anesthesia. Wounds were sutured and all subjects were given 0. 2 % chlorohexidine mouthwash for 14 days. Complete blood picture and cytokines production were assayed before operation, as well as on days 1, 2, and 5 after implantation. Implant mobility and periodontal wound healing were monitored once in a fortnight up to 90 days. There were no statistically significant differences in the production of cytokines.

Histological analysis confirmed the formation of well-structured subchondral trabecular bone and hyaline-like cartilage tissue in the multi-layered scaffold group by 12 months with restoration of the anatomical tidemark. Demonstration of improved healing following treatment with this natural polymer scaffold, through the recruitment of host cells with no requirement for pre-culture, shows the potential of this device {{for the treatment of}} patients presenting with osteochondal lesions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, two open porous calcium {{phosphate}} (CaP) ceramics, β tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and hydroxyapatite (HA) were compared in a critical-sized femoral defect in rats. Previous comparisons {{of these two}} ceramics showed significantly greater osteoinductive potential of β-TCP upon intramuscular implantation and a better performance in a spinal fusion model in dogs. Results {{of the current study}} also showed significantly more bone formation in defects grafted with β-TCP compared to HA, however both ceramics were not capable of increasing bone formation to such extend that it bridges the defect. Furthermore, a more pronounced degradation of β-TCP was observed as compared to HA. Progression of inflammation and initiation of new bone formation were assessed for both materials at multiple time points by histological and fluorochrome-based analyses. Until twelve days <b>post</b> <b>implantation,</b> a strong inflammatory response in absence of new bone formation was observed in both ceramics, without obvious differences between the two materials. Four weeks <b>post</b> <b>implantation,</b> signs of new bone formation were found in both β-TCP and HA. At six weeks, inflammation had subsided in both ceramics while bone deposition continued. In conclusion, the two ceramics differed in the amount of bone formed after eight weeks of implantation, while no differences were found in the duration of the inflammatory phase after implantation or initiation of new bone formation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Intracranial hemorrhages {{associated}} with new generation left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are increasingly reported {{as the use}} of these life saving devices is becoming more common, but few data are currently available to guide the acute management of these critically ill patients. Methods: This is a case presentation of a 33 -year-old woman status <b>post</b> LVAD <b>implantation</b> on therapeutic anticoagulation who developed acute headache followed by rapidly progressive impairment of consciousness secondary to spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage and hydrocephalus. Results: After discontinuation of heparin infusion, the patient underwent external ventricular drain placement(EVD) and her mental status fully recovered. Her work-up was negative for aneurysmal sources of bleeding. She received daily aspirin for 7 days for antiplatelet effect during which she did not experience any thromboembolic events related to the LVAD. At day 6 the EVD was clamped for 24 hours and her neurological exam remained intact. The EVD was removed and she was restarted on heparin infusion without further complications. Conclusions: Our experience suggests that in case of subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with LVADs, temporary suspension of anticoagulation and EVD placement is safe and can lead to good neurological outcome...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intraperitoneal mesh {{implantation}} {{is often}} associated with formation of adhesion to the mesh. This experimental study examines the potential of minimally invasive pneumoperitoneal-MRI to assess these adhesions in a preclinical context. Methods Uncoated polyethylene terephthalate meshes were placed intraperitoneally in rats, in regard to the caecum previously scraped to promote petechial bleeding and subsequent adhesions. Examinations were performed 2 -weeks <b>post</b> mesh <b>implantation</b> using a rodent dedicated high field MRI. Respiratory-triggered T 2 -weighted images were acquired prior to and after intraperitoneal injection of 8 – 10 mL gas to induce a mechanical stress on the abdominal wall. Results Adhesions are occasionally seen in sham-operated rats as opposed to rats receiving polyethylene terephthalate meshes. On high-resolution images, meshes can be detected due to their characteristic net shape. However, evidence of adherence is only found if intraperitoneal gas injection is performed, when a 1 -cm elevation of the abdominal wall is observed. When adherence occurs between the mesh and the caecum, the latter remains in contact with the wall. Looser adherences between visceral tissue and meshes are also observed. Conclusions T 2 -weighted pneumoperitoneal-MRI is a powerful tool for assessing adherence after intraperitoneal mesh implantation. According to the mini-invasive procedure adopted here, this approach may allow a temporal follow-up of adherence fate...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundCheyne-Stokes {{respiration}} (CSR-CSA) {{is often}} observed {{in patients with}} chronic heart failure (CHF). Although cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is effective for CHF patients with left ventricular dyssynchrony, it is still unclear whether adaptive servo ventilation (ASV) improves cardiac function and prognosis of CHF patients with CSR-CSA after CRT. Methods and resultsTwenty two patients with CHF and CSR-CSA after CRT defibrillator (CRTD) implantation {{were enrolled in the}} present study and randomly assigned into two groups: 11 patients treated with ASV (ASV group) and 11 patients treated without ASV (non-ASV group). Measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (before 3, and 6 months later) and echocardiography (before and 6 months) were performed in each group. Patients were followed up to register cardiac events (cardiac death and re-hospitalization) after discharge. In the ASV group, indices for apnea-hypopnea, central apnea, and oxyhemoglobin saturation were improved on ASV. BNP levels, cardiac systolic and diastolic function were improved with ASV treatment for 6 months. Importantly, the event-free rate was significantly higher in the ASV group than in the non-ASV group. ConclusionsASV improves CSR-CSA, cardiac function, and prognosis in CHF patients with CRTD. Patients with CSR-CSA and <b>post</b> CRTD <b>implantation</b> would get benefits by treatment with ASV...|$|R
