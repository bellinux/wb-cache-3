500|$|Kaif's <b>paternal</b> <b>parentage</b> {{has been}} {{questioned}} by {{some members of the}} film industry. In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: [...] "We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too... religious?... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great". Kaif called Shroff's comments [...] "hurtful".|$|E
50|$|Regardless of {{the place}} of birth, a child acquires Norwegian {{citizenship}} at birth if either parent is a Norwegian citizen. Originally, citizenship was only {{passed on to the}} children of Norwegian mothers, as they were the only provable parents, but over time a presumption of <b>paternal</b> <b>parentage</b> created citizenship for the child, and eventually even excluded the maternal jus sanguinis. In more recent times, as of 1 January 1979, mothers' rights to automatically pass on their Norwegian citizenship has been reestablished. The requirement that the mother and father be married to one another was abolished on 1 September 2006.|$|E

5000|$|Both the <b>paternal</b> and {{maternal}} <b>parentage</b> of Bermudo II {{have been subject}} to scholarly debate. On the paternal side, the primary chronicle sources simply call him son of king Ordoño, without specifying which former king of that name. Traditionally his father has been identified as Ordoño III and the modern consensus agrees with this assignment, but at least one prominent modern Leonese historian, Manuel Carriedo Tejedo, has concluded that he instead was son of Ordoño IV. [...] The question is seemingly resolved by a charter in the cartulary of Santa María de Carracedo, in which Bermudo names his father Ordoño and his grandfather Ramiro, making his father Ordoño III and not Ordoño IV, the son of Alfonso.|$|R

Parentage {{of a mass}} spawn of this species has not been evaluated nor has the maternal and paternal contribution {{of each of these}} functional hermaphrodites to the progeny. Genotypes of 6 spawners and 374 resulting progeny at 6 microsatellite loci were coupled with mitochondrial DNA sequencing to assign maternal and <b>paternal</b> <b>parentage.</b> After the identification of a high proportion of null alleles (9. 7 %), microsatellite data revealed that 51. 7 % of the progenies were full siblings, with a significant, unequal contribution of the 6 spawners to the progeny. Three progenies were the result of self-fertilization. All spawners contributed paternally (though unequally); however, 2 spawners were the maternal parents of all but 7 progenies resulting in a variance effective population size of 3. 52. DNA sequencing confirmed 4 microsatellite mutations within 4476 alleles scored, all in the paternal germ line. With minor exception, the loci conformed to Mendelian rules of segregation when null alleles were accounted for, and 2 loci were found to be linked. These results lend insight to the genetic composition of induced mass spawns and provide a basis for the development of more effective spawning techniques. Natural populations of the lion-paw scallop (Nodipecten subnodosus) are distributed along both the Pacific and Gulf of California coasts of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico...|$|E
40|$|Complete {{pedigree}} {{information is}} a prerequisite for modern breeding and the ranking of parents and offspring for selection and deployment decisions. DNA fingerprinting and pedigree reconstruction can substitute for artificial matings, by allowing parentage delineation of naturally produced offspring. Here, we report on the efficacy of a breeding concept called "Breeding without Breeding" (BwB) that circumvents artificial matings, focusing instead on a subset of randomly sampled, maternally known but paternally unknown offspring to delineate their <b>paternal</b> <b>parentage.</b> We then generate the information needed to rank those offspring and their paternal parents, using a combination of complete (full-sib: FS) and incomplete (half-sib: HS) analyses of the constructed pedigrees. Using a random sample of wind-pollinated offspring from 15 females (seed donors), growing in a 41 -parent western larch population, BwB is evaluated and compared to two commonly used testing methods that rely on either incomplete (maternal half-sib, open-pollinated: OP) or complete (FS) pedigree designs. BwB produced results superior to those from the incomplete design and virtually identical to those from the complete pedigree methods. The combined use of complete and incomplete pedigree information permitted evaluating all parents, both maternal and paternal, as well as all offspring, a result that could not have been accomplished with either the OP or FS methods alone. We also discuss the optimum experimental setting, in terms of the proportion of fingerprinted offspring, the size of the assembled maternal and paternal half-sib families, the role of external gene flow, and selfing, as well as the number of parents that could be realistically tested with BwB...|$|E
40|$|For many tree species, {{mating system}} {{analyses}} have indicated potential {{variations in the}} selfing rate and paternity correlation among fruits within individuals, among individuals within populations, among populations, and from one flowering event to another. In this study, we used eight microsatellite markers to investigate mating systems at two hierarchical levels (fruits within individuals and individuals within populations) for the insect pollinated Neotropical tree Tabebuia roseo-alba. We found that T. roseo-alba has a mixed mating system with predominantly outcrossed mating. The outcrossing rates at the population level were similar across two T. roseo-alba populations; however, the rates varied considerably among individuals within populations. The correlated paternity results at different hierarchical levels showed {{that there is a}} high probability of shared <b>paternal</b> <b>parentage</b> when comparing seeds within fruits and among fruits within plants and full-sibs occur in much higher proportion within fruits than among fruits. Significant levels of fixation index were found in both populations and biparental inbreeding {{is believed to be the}} main cause of the observed inbreeding. The number of pollen donors contributing to mating was low. Furthermore, open-pollinated seeds varied according to relatedness, including half-sibs, full-sibs, self-sibs and self- half-sibs. In both populations, the effective population size within a family (seed-tree and its offspring) was lower than expected for panmictic populations. Thus, seeds for ex situ conservation genetics, progeny tests and reforestation must be collected from a large number of seed-trees to guarantee an adequate effective population in the sample.
