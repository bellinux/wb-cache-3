40|$|Powder {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most important parts in manufacturing industry when materials applied in large quantities of solid particles. <b>Dispensing</b> technology for <b>powders</b> <b>can</b> significantly improve operation efficiency in manufacturing processes. The <b>powder</b> <b>dispensing</b> technologies have a broad range of applications. The powders exhibit different flow behaviours due to different physical properties. This project aims to reveal the dispensing mechanism and pharmaceutical powder flow behaviour in a designed dispensing hopper under the ultrasonic mechanical vibration, and to develop a powder dosing system to achieve the precise <b>dispensing</b> of pharmaceutical <b>powders.</b> The experimental work focuses on the dispensing device design and pharmaceutical <b>powder</b> <b>dispensing</b> tests by using ultrasonic vibration dosing system. The experimental results indicate that the ultrasonic vibration dosing system is capable of fast (less than one second) and precise (RSD< 5 %) pharmaceutical <b>powder</b> <b>dispensing</b> in small-dose (milligram scale) and large-dose (gram scale). A dome-control mechanism is identified in the ultrasonic vibration <b>dispensing</b> process. <b>Powder</b> dome formed in the dispensing hopper as a “valve” of powder flow under the ultrasonic vibration. The dispensing results represent that the parameters of dispensing hopper, i. e. orifice size, hopper angle, and working voltage signal, i. e. vibration duration, are the critical factors for the powder flow rate and dosage uniformity of the dispensing. Additionally, the working voltage signal properties and mechanical vibration performance are investigated in the ultrasonic vibration dispensing device by using the digital oscilloscope and the 3 D scanning vibrometer...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{introduces}} a pneumatic dispensing system {{to control the}} velocity of nanoliter droplets with small variation of volume. The system consists of a flexible membrane integrated with a backflow stopper. This unique <b>dispensing</b> mechanism <b>can</b> control the velocity of droplets according to applied positive pressures regardless of other operating conditions and design parameters. The range of droplet velocities is shifted by the flow resistance at the outlet under the same cross-section area. Our <b>dispensing</b> system <b>can</b> eject droplets of desired volume at a velocity {{that can be easily}} controlled by selecting design parameters and operating conditions. This dispensing system will provide a reliable performance within an optimized condition stably to deposit droplets onto accurate locations.|$|R

The concept is the rapid heating of biomass at moderate temperatures around 500 °C with short reaction times of up to 2 seconds in an oxygen-free environment to optimize the yield of liquids. Pyrolytic bio-oils contain a significant amount of reactive oxygenated species {{and they have to be}} stabilized and deoxygenized to be compatible with traditional fuels. Catalytic pyrolysis is an approach that allows a partial deoxygenation before vapor condensation. To produce upgraded bio-oils, a semi-continuous pyrolysis experiment on lab-scale was developed. It consists of a quartz tube containing two porous frits. The first retains the wood and char, while the second holds the catalyst. This reactor is placed inside a cylindrical oven. Beech wood chips are introduced into the top part of the reactor by means of a solid <b>powder</b> <b>dispensing</b> system (Parimix). A flow of nitrogen of 500 mL/min inerts the biomass injector and drives pyrolysis vapors through the catalyst fixed bed (catalyst-to-biomass ratio of 1 : 10). At the reactor exit a condenser collects the bio-oil at 4 °C. This condenser is followed by an electrostatic trap to capture the very fine oil droplets and to protect the micro-GC used for on-line gas analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the term}} powder horn is {{sometimes}} used {{for any kind}} of powder flask, it is strictly a sub-category of flask made from a hollowed bovid horn. Powder flasks were made in a great variety of materials and shapes, though ferrous metals that were prone to give off sparks when hit were usually avoided. Stag antler, which could be carved or engraved, was an especially common material, but wood and copper were common, and in India, ivory. Apart from the horns, common shapes were the Y formed by the base of an antler (inverted), a usually flattened pear shape with a straight spout (poire-poudre or [...] "powder pear" [...] is a French term for these), a round flattened shape, and for larger flasks a triangle with concave rounded sides, which unlike the smaller flasks could be stood upright on a surface. Many designs (such as horn and antler types) have a wide sealed opening for filling, and a thin spout for dispensing. Various devices were used to load a precise amount of <b>powder</b> to <b>dispense,</b> as it was important not to load {{too much or too little}} powder, or the <b>powder</b> was <b>dispensed</b> into a <b>powder</b> measure or [...] "charger" [...] (these survive much less often).

Furthermore, because the <b>dispensing</b> technology <b>can</b> be easily integrated with computer-assisted manufacturing systems, it can use solid free-form fabrication to precisely form complex 3 D cellular structures [16, 17].

Although home-based {{hormonal}} contraceptive dispensing {{is a common}} approach to reduce unintended pregnancy around the world, it is a novel intervention in the United States. Design and Sample : We conducted a qualitative study to gather nurses' perceptions about adding a contraceptive dispensing intervention to five nurse home-visiting programs in Washington State. Approach : Using 5 focus groups with 24 nurses, we assessed the feasibility, scope of practice and safety of in-home contraceptive dispensing. Results : Although some nurses expressed skepticism, most described the intervention as safe and within their scope of practice, as long as certain conditions were met. Specifically, the nurses recommended appropriate training, protocols, standing orders, and ongoing clinical and logistical support. Conclusions : Home-based {{hormonal contraceptive}} <b>dispensing</b> <b>can</b> reach at-risk women who desire to prevent unintended pregnancy and {{who may not have}} access to clinic based family planning services...|$|R
