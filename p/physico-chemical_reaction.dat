40|$|The fate of {{contaminant}} migration {{through the}} subsurface environment {{as well as}} their potential hazard to humans, animals, and aquatic life {{has become one of the}} major current concerns of the scientific community. Accordingly, various theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted on the saturated soil by many researchers. The literature review emphasizes that the problem of the unsaturated transport of contaminants through porous media has received little attention. Thus, the present work is carried out to contribute to the study of heavy metals migration within unsaturated clay soil through mathematical modeling of the mechanisms and parameters which influence the transport phenomenon. For successful modeling, it is imperative that parameters which affect the transport phenomenon be investigated and determined properly. Hence, the study was conducted through two principal parts. The first part is an experimental investigation to quantify the various soil-water (solution) interactions that have an effect on the flow and contaminant transport and to derive the constitutive relationships required in mathematical modeling. The second part develops a contaminant migration mathematical model which includes unsaturated flow, hydrodynamic dispersion, and <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> between the solid and the liquid phase, employing the theory of mass transport. The experimental investigation contains two main sets of laboratory tests: (i) some independent tests in order to isolate and better understand the individual processes, and (ii) some tests on experimental models of the real phenomena to verify the related parameters in a combined kinetic situation. The results of all experiments are followed by discussion, in order to better understand the phenomenon behavior, and to realize the relationships among the various processes. Based on the above mechanisms, the governing equations of the problem are derived to provide a quantitative account of the behavior of the phenomenon. Finally, a finite volume algorithm is developed, on the basis of the mathematical model, in order to solve the contaminant transport equations numerically. Using experimental results, the numerical model is then calibrated and verified. The developed computer code provides the ability to predict the contaminant migration for any depth and period of time. Based on this capability the concentration variations of the solution along the soil profile, especially for long time periods, are predicted and illustrate...|$|E
40|$|In many sub-{{tropical}} {{and tropical}} and {{regions of the}} world, marly soils (marls) and lime or cement stabilization of marl soils are used as a convenient and expedient means for development of foundation base courses and inexpensive wearing courses for transport purposes. The failure {{of many of these}} natural and stabilized marls to perform their function have been reported. This study uses <b>physico-chemical</b> (<b>reaction)</b> factors to explain the general basic causes for deterioration of the support capability for these types of soil. The presence of palygorskite and sepiolite in marl soils provides it with some very unique features in its natural state, and particularly when it is stabilized with lime or cement. Formation of an expansive mineral ettringite as a transformation product of palygorskite increases the swelling potential of the stabilized soil. The exact mechanism of these failures is still not well known. Reactions between lime, alumina (released from the clay fraction of soil) and sulfates present in the soil pore fluid can cause the formation of ettringite. The possible contribution of palygorskite and sepiolite to the post-stabilization failure due to ettringite formation were investigated. It is shown that the general geotechnical/physical criteria used to evaluate stabilized soil performance not be reliable for the evaluation of stabilized marl due to the possible formation of ettringite and its resultant behaviour. A set of physico-chemical studies, which include specific surface area measurements (SSA) and x-ray diffraction (XRD), are needed for a more complete and realistic evaluation of the long-term stability of stabilized marl. In this study, a soil washing method for extraction of pure palygorskite or clay fraction from the soil mixture is developed and validated by XRD analysis. Based on the presented results, the pervious classification of marly soils is developed and a new classification for marly soils is proposed. Following establishment of the significant role of palygorskite and sepiolite, through the experimental studies, the current XRD techniques for quantitative mineral analysis of clay soils are evaluated. The accuracy of these methods are investigated by preparation of a series of artificial soil mixtures. Finally, a quantitative XRD method for marly soils and ettringite is presented. In the last part of this study, the major difference in the kinetics of ettringite when artificially formed is compared with that of a stabilized soil, and the role of sulfate, alumina, and calcium on the ettringite formation is investigated. Furthermore, for soil stabilization, the contribution of different clay minerals in ettringite formation is investigated. Among the clay minerals studied, palygorskite was found to be the most rich in alumina, providing the highest source of alumina for ettringite formation. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Power and Generator Transformers are {{important}} and expensive elements of a power system. Inadvertent failure of Power Transformers would cause long interruption in power supply with consequent loss of reliability and revenue to the supply utilities. The mineral oil impregnated paper, OIP, is an insulation of choice in large power transformers in view of its excellent dielectric and other properties, besides being relatively inexpensive. During the normal working regime of the transformer, the insulation thereof is subjected to various stresses, the more important among them are, electrical, thermal, mechanical and chemical. Each of these stresses, appearing singly, or in combination, {{would lead to a}} time variant deterioration in the properties of insulation, called Ageing. This normal and inevitable process of degradation in the several essential properties of the insulation is irreversible, is a non-Markov <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> kinetic process. The speed or the rapidity of insulation deterioration is a very strong function of the magnitude of the stresses and the duration over which they acted. This is further compounded, if the stresses are in synergy. During the processes of ageing, some, or all the vital properties undergo subtle changes, more often, not in step with the duration of time over which the damage has been accumulated. Often, these changes are non monotonic, thus presenting a random or a chaotic picture and understanding the processes leading to eventual failure becomes difficult. But, there is some order in this chaos, in that, the time average of the changes over short intervals of time, seems to indicate some degree of predictability. The status of insulation at any given point in time is assessed by measuring such of those properties as are sensitive to the amount of ageing and comparing it with earlier measurements. This procedure, called the Diagnostic or nondestructive Testing, has been in vogue for some time now. Of the many parameters used as sensitive indices of the dynamics of insulation degradation, temporal changes in temperatures at different locations {{in the body of the}} transformer, more precisely, the winding hot spots (HST) and top oil temperature (TOT) are believed to give a fairly accurate indication of the rate of degradation. Further, an accurate estimation of the temperatures would enable to determine the loading limit (loadability) of power transformer. To estimate the temperature rise reasonably accurately, one has to resort to classical mathematical techniques involving formulation and solution of boundary value problem of heat conduction under carefully prescribed boundary conditions. Several complications are encountered in the development of the governing equations for the emergent heat transfer problems. The more important among them are, the inhomogeneous composition of the insulation structure and of the conductor, divergent flow patterns of the oil phase and inordinately varying thermal properties of conductor and insulation. Validation and reconfirmation of the findings of the thermal models can be made using state of the art methods, such as, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Over the years, different criteria have been prescribed for the prediction of terminal or end of life (EOL) of equipment from the standpoint of its insulation. But, thus far, no straightforward and unequivocal criterion is forth coming. Calculation of elapsed life in line with the existing methodology, given by IEEE, IEC, introduces unacceptable degrees of uncertainty. It is needless to say that, any conformal procedure proposed in the accurate prediction of EOL, has to be based on a technically feasible and economically viable consideration. A systematic study for understanding the dynamical nature of ageing in transformers in actual service is precluded for reasons very well known. Laboratory experiments on prototypes or pro-rated units fabricated based on similarity studies, are performed under controlled conditions and at accelerated stress levels to reduce experimental time. The results thereof can then be judiciously extrapolated to normal operating conditions and for full size equipment. The terms of reference of the present work are as follows; 1.

In soils most organic matter is found as organo-mineral complexes, the interactions between inorganic and organic matter have been studied by Schnitzer and Kodama (1992). The physical domains of organic matter involve hierarchical units of aggregates and particle size fractions (Oades and Waters, 1991). The chemical domains involve chemically extracted humic substances (Schnitzer and Kodama, 1975), or several chemical classes of compounds in whole soil as characterized in mass spectrometry studies (Schnitzer and Schulten, 1992).

Changing the thermodynamic equilibrium by an increase of the total pressure is the principle for decarburisation and degassing.

This layer is used as a mineralization site for cells and finally allows an intimate bond between the bioactive glass and osseous tissues. This binding is typical of bioactivity, which can be modulated through several parameters of the glass, like composition and textural properties. In this work we present clear evidence of the effect of porosity on the bioactivity of sol-gel derived glasses. Using templating techniques (surfactants and polystren beads respectively), both mesostructured and organized macroporous glasses have been prepared.

By keeping cell-sugar lyophilisates at defined temperatures and water activities, storage above and below Tg could be realized. In order to characterize the temperature dependence of T 2 and k, the results were fitted using the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) and Arrhenius models. T 2 was found to be solely dependent on the temperature interval between Tg and the storage temperature, Tp. In case of inactivation kinetics this temperature interval could not fully explain the results. In contrast to molecular mobility, the microbial inactivation was supposed to be influenced additionally by the absolute storage temperature. This is due to fact that microbial inactivation is a highly complex process which is dependent on a number of <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> with some being more while some are less diffusion limited.

Similarly morning and evening samples have significant deviations. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that, coal is extremely heterogeneous and getting affected by weathering. Such weathering occurs due to various <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> at in situ of coal surface which is governed by many parameters like hydrocarbon structure of coal, mineral matter composition, moisture, coal porosity, rainfall, fog etc. Hence, rate of oxidation of coal is not uniform for each coal particles. Also higher the temperature, greater is the rate of oxidation and heat buildup. Whether fire occurs or not, the temperature increases and progressive reaction with atmospheric oxygen gradually impairs certain properties of coal. Coal oxidation leads to chemisorption of oxygen at the coal surface along with formation of acid functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl and other that leads to subsequent thermal decomposition and decrease in the aliphatic and alicyclic carbon and hydrogen content. Hence results of morning and evening samples, month by month may deviate significantly. However, to minimize such errors in results, collections of higher no’s of samples are necessary. In the present study two different samples from same locations during morning and evening were collected and average value are reported. The average value for each month reports the decline in coal properties values across different months of year.|$|R

The idea of using temperature as a quantitative tracer is growing in the hydrogeophysical community, especially to simulate geo/hydrothermal systems. However, plenty of physico-chemical processes are influenced by temperature {{and most of them}} impact directly resistivity measurements. Therefore, one needs to take them into account to retrieve quantitative temperature estimates from resistivity measurements but, up to now, it is seldom the case. The experiment we conducted consisted in simulating an ERT monitoring of heat storage in a sandy aquifer. We show that using experimental relationships between fluid electrical conductivity and temperature alone does not allow reliable temperature estimates, simply because rock-water interactions are neglected. Worst, from a certain temperature (45 °C here), the bulk resistivity starts to increase with temperature although this is not expected from the experimental law. Chemical analyses made on water samples collected during the experiment highlight the importance of accounting chemical reactions (e. g. calcite precipitation with increasing temperature) occurring when temperature changes as well as their kinetics. Finally, other parameters as surface conductivity cannot always be neglected when estimating temperature from resistivity measurements. This means that retrieving reliable temperatures from bulk resistivity measurements (e. g. time-lapse ERT) requires the knowledge of water mineralization as well as the rock / soil mineralogy in order to fully integrate <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> between groundwater and the host rock, for example with a joint inversion scheme...|$|R

ResultsAt a HR of 100 beats/min, lower temperature resulted in a highly significant decrease in maximal elastance (100 % at 37 °C, 29 ± 3. 5 % at 31 °C, p < 0. 0001). At 37 °C, increasing HR increased contractility (80 beats/min 100 %, 120 beats/min 205. 9 %, p = 0. 0021); however, at 33 °C contractility fell with increasing HR (80 beats/min 100 %, 120 beats/min, 53. 7 %, p = 0. 0014). ConclusionAt normothermia LV contractility has a direct relationship with HR. In hypothermic conditions this relationship inverses. Clinical strategies maintaining higher HRs at colder temperatures result in reduced contractility. These factors are important in the management of cardiac surgical patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrokinetics is a developping {{technology}} that is intended to separate and extract heavy metals, radionuclides, and organic contaminants from saturated or unsaturated soils, sludges and sediments, and groundwater. The goal of electrokinetic remediation is to effect the migration of subsurface contaminants in an imposed electric field. This technique is known as electrokinetic remediation, electroreclamation, electrochemical decontamination, electrorestoration, electromigration or electrochemical soil processing. Electrokinetics involves the installation of electrodes into the subsurface surrounding the contaminated region. After the electrodes are in place, a low electrical potential is applied across the anode(s) (positively charged electrode) and the cathode(s) (negatively charged electrode). As {{a result of the}} electrical gradient, different <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> occur and contaminant transport occurs due to various mechanisms within the soil and groundwater. Generally, for the migration to be significant, the contaminants should be in a soluble form. If they are not soluble, they need to be desorbed, dissolved, and/or solubilized into the pore solution before they can be adequately transported from the soil to an electrode wells/reservoirs. Different types of contaminants have been investigated and research has been conducted to optimize the electrokinetic variables. The present study was undertaken to systematically investigate the effect of initial sludge water content, and heating on the electrokinetic remediation of alumium-contaminated sludge. A total of four laboratory experiments were conducted using drinking water sludge. The first two tests studied the effect of variation of initial sludge water content under an ambient temperature, and the last two tests studied the effect of heating on electrokinetic remediation under conditions of both constant saturation and applied voltage...|$|R
40|$|Short-term <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> at the {{interface}} between bioactive glass particles and biological fluids are studied and we focus our attention on the measurements of O/Si atomic ratio. The studied bioactive glass is in the SiO 2 -Na 2 O-CaO-P 2 O 5 -K 2 O-Al 2 O 3 -MgO system. The elemental analysis is performed at the submicrometer scale by STEM associated with EDXS and EELS. We previously developed an EDXS quantification method based on the ratio method and taking into account local absorption corrections. In this way, we use EELS data to determine, by an iterative process, the local mass thickness which is an essential parameter to correct absorption in EDXS spectra. After different delays of immersion of bioactive glass particles in a simulated biological solution, results show the formation of different surface layers at the bioactive glass periphery. Before one day of immersion, we observe {{the presence of an}} already shown (Si,O,Al) rich layer at the periphery. In this paper, we demonstrate that a thin electron dense (Si,O) layer is formed on top of the (Si,O,Al) layer. In this (Si,O) layer, depleted in aluminium, we point out an increase of oxygen weight concentration which can be interpreted by the presence of Si(OH) 4 groups, that permit the formation of a (Ca,P) layer. Aluminium plays a role in the glass solubility and may inhibit apatite nucleation. After the beginning of the (Ca,P) layer formation, the size of the electron dense (Si,O) layer decreases and tends to disappear. After two days of immersion, the (Ca,P) layer grows in thickness and leads to apatite precipitatio...|$|R
40|$|Most energy {{studies on}} the {{traditional}} ceramic manufacturing process focus on the firing stage {{because this is the}} process stage that consumes the greatest amount of thermal energy. At present in Europe, using typical technologies, about 50 % of the energy input in the firing stage is still lost through the kiln stacks. A key issue in energy studies is the accurate determination of the energy efficiency of the process, an issue that may become crucial in coming years to enable the energy management of different facilities and products to be compared. To reliably determine energy efficiency, accurate determination is required of the energy needed for the necessary physico-chemical transformations to develop in the material in the firing stage. This energy is also the only strictly unrecoverable energy, as the energy contained in other streams could, potentially at least, be partly recoverable. The present study was undertaken to develop an analytical methodology for estimating the heat of reaction of seven different traditional ceramic products, involving a broad spectrum of compositions, with peak firing temperatures ranging from 850 oC to 1200 oC. The following industrial ceramic compositions were studied: four ceramic tile compositions (red-body stoneware tile, porcelain tile, red-body earthenware wall tile, and white-body earthenware wall tile); two structural ceramics compositions (white brick and roof tile), and a porcelain tableware composition. To estimate the energy involved in the <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> in the firing stage, an analytical methodology was developed, based on the mineralogy data of the unfired body composition and on the enthalpy of formation of the minerals in the fired tiles. The methodology was validated by comparing the results with experimental data.

40|$|Increased {{understanding}} of plasma-polymer interactions {{is required to}} further the technological use of such processes, and elucidates heterogeneous <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> which occur under bombardment by complex combinations of energetic species. This thesis presents a systematic investigation into the effect of exposing organic and inorganic polymeric surfaces to controlled non-isothermal plasmas. Concurrently, a novel process is presented by which metal oxide gas barrier coatings are synthesized on polymer substrates by non- isothermal plasma treatment. Organic polymers exhibiting a range of structures were modified using non-isothermal plasmas at atmospheric and low pressure. The extent of atmospheric discharge oxygenation, measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), correlated with the polymers' ozonolysis rate constants. Surface physical disruption, studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), after atmospheric discharge treatment was more pronounced than after low pressure plasma treatment. During low pressure oxygen plasma treatment, polymers containing phenyl groups were oxygenated to an extent which varied with the strength of π-π* valence band excitation in XPS C(1 s) spectra of the untreated polymers, suggesting a dominance of reaction of plasma atomic oxygen at polymer radical sites excited by plasma vacuum ultraviolet radiation. The size of globules, observed by AFM, on the plasma modified surfaces correlated with the extent of surface chemical modification, inkeeping with a mechanism of chemically driven agglomeration of plasma oxidized low molecular weight polymer material. Oxygen plasma was more effective than water plasma in chemically modifying the surface of films of zirconium-normal-butoxide spin coated on polyester substrates, and the resulting optimized treatment produced {{a significant reduction in}} gas permeation of the substrate. XPS studies showed that oxygen plasma treatment of a polyphenylsilsesquioxane film on polyester film created a SiO(_ 2) layer less than 8 nm thin, which reduced O(_ 2) and Ar permeation of the coated film by 37. 5 % and 31. 6 % respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{macromolecular}} {{structure of}} humic substances (HS), i. e. molecular size, shape, conformation, and weight {{is believed to}} control key <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> in aquatic systems. However, these properties of HS are still deeply a matter of debate. Furthermore, they are affected by solution physico-chemical parameters such as ionic strength, pH, and chemical composition, etc. To better understand aggregation processes of HS in natural waters, the effects of cation concentration and type, water composition, and pH on the size and conformation of the Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) were investigated with synthetic solutions. The size and the conformation of the SRHA in NaCl and CaCl 2 solutions at different concentrations (0. 001 – 0. 5 M) and pH (4. 5 – 9. 3) were determined using the photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. In addition, dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples collected from the Adour estuary along a salinity gradient were imaged by TEM. The average size of the SRHA measured by PCS increased with pH and ionic strength. This behavior was confirmed by TEM micrographs. The increase in pH and CaCl 2 engendered aggregation of the SRHA. Two aggregation steps were identified, a big increase in HS size occurred for small changes in CaCl 2 concentrations in the range 0. 02 M CaCl 2. The parallel analysis of SRHA by PCS and TEM allowed overcoming the limits for both techniques. Comparable results were found for the DOM samples from the Adour estuary (South West of France). The conformation {{and size of the}} HS network of these samples varied with the salinity gradient. TEM images demonstrated that, HS have a branched open network in freshwater whereas they have a more compacted and close network with increasing salinity...|$|R
40|$|Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods Abstract As water mediates <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> (i. e. Maillard reactions, phase {{changes of}} sugars and minerals, protein {{conformational}} changes), water-powder interactions during storage {{are critical for}} dairy powder stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first {{was to examine the}} effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30 %) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85 % of protein (MPC- 85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22. 5, 43. 2, 65. 4 and 84. 3 %) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11. 3, 22. 5, 32. 8, 43. 2, 52. 9, 65. 4, 75. 3 and 84. 3 %) at 25 °C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-valu...|$|R

Due to low commercial value, these wastes are disposed in landfill, which if not managed properly may cause environmental problems. Currently, environmental {{laws and regulations}} pertaining to the pollution from agricultural waste streams by regulatory agencies are stringent and hence the application of toxic solvents during processing has become public concern. Recent development in valuable materials extraction from the decomposition of agricultural waste by sub-critical water treatment from the published literature was review. <b>Physico-chemical</b> characteristic (<b>reaction</b> temperature, reaction time and solid to liquid ratio) of the sub-critical water affecting its yield were also reviewed.

40|$|Process {{simulation}} models used across the wastewater industry have inherent limitations due to over-simplistic descriptions of important <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>reactions,</b> especially for mineral solids precipitation. As {{part of the}} efforts towards a larger Generalized Physicochemical Modelling Framework, the present study aims to identify a broadly applicable precipitation modelling approach. The study uses two experimental platforms applied to calcite precipitating from synthetic aqueous solutions to identify and validate the model approach. Firstly, dynamic pH titration tests are performed to define the baseline model approach. Constant Composition Method (CCM) experiments are then used to examine influence of environmental factors on the baseline approach. Results show that the baseline model should include precipitation kinetics (not be quasi-equilibrium), should include a 1 st order effect of the mineral particulate state (Xcryst) and, for calcite, have a 2 nd order dependency (exponent n= 2. 05 ± 0. 29) on thermodynamic supersaturation (σ). Parameter analysis indicated that the model was more tolerant to a fast kinetic coefficient (kcryst) and so, in general, {{it is recommended that}} a large kcryst value be nominally selected where insufficient process data is available. Zero seed (self nucleating) conditions were effectively represented by including arbitrarily small amounts of mineral phase in the initial conditions. Both of these aspects are important for wastewater modelling, where knowledge of kinetic coefficients is usually not available, and it is typically uncertain which precipitates are actually present. The CCM experiments confirmed the baseline model, particularly the dependency on supersaturation. Temperature was also identified as an influential factor that should be corrected for via an Arrhenius-style correction of kcryst. The influence of magnesium (a common and representative added impurity) on kcryst was found to be significant but was considered an optional correction because of a lesser influence as compared to that of temperature. Other variables such as ionic strength and pH were adequately captured by the quasi-equilibrium description of the aqueous-phase and no further kinetic corrections were required. The baseline model is readily expandable to include other precipitation reactions. For simple representations, large values for kcryst with n= 2 (or n= 2 or 3 for other minerals, as appropriate) should be selected without corrections to kcryst. Where accuracy is required (e. g., in mechanistic studies), machine estimation of kcryst should be performed with robust process data and kcryst should at least be corrected for temperature...|$|R
