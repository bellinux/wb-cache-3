50|$|Increasing (or decreasing) the <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> {{increases}} (or decreases) the focusing system's magnification {{in order}} to fit the projection screen in use (or sometimes just to accommodate the room setup). Increasing the <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> also means that {{the same amount of}} light is spread over a larger screen, resulting in a dimmer image. With a change in the <b>projection</b> <b>distance,</b> the focusing must be readjusted for a sharp image. However, the condensing optics (Fresnel lens) is optimized for one particular vertical position of the lens, corresponding to one <b>projection</b> <b>distance.</b> Therefore, when it is focused for a greatly different <b>projection</b> <b>distance,</b> part of the light cone projected by the Fresnel lens towards the focusing lens misses that lens. This has the greatest effect towards the outer edges of the projected image, so that one typically sees either blue or brown fringing {{at the edge of the}} screen when the focus is towards an extreme. Using the projector near its recommended <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> allows a focusing position where this is avoided and the intensity across the screen is approximately uniform.|$|E

In literature 3, the way of combining the FDA (Fisher discriminant analysis) and the GLVQ was investigated and evaluated to be effective for handwritten Chinese character recognition employing the minimum Euclidian distance classifier. In this paper, the <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> and the modified <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> are employed besides the Euclidian distance, and handwritten numerals as well as Chinese characters are used for the evaluation test. The result of experiment shows that the learning of reference vectors by GLVQ improves the recognition accuracy of not only the Euclidian distance classifier but also the <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> classifier and the modified <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> classifier. The highest accuracy (98. 41 %) for the Chinese character recognition was obtained when the FDA, GLVQ and the modified <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> were employed.

40|$|The most {{important}} factor in pedestrian injuries from vehicle collisions is the impact velocity. In cases where the impact configuration can be ascertained, the most common method now used to determine vehicle speed involves the pedestrian <b>projection</b> <b>distance.</b> The more traditional method of using tyre brake marks is losing applicability as ABS braking systems become more common. The two most common impact configurations are wrap projection and forward projection, these being determined by the vehicle/pedestrian geometry and the initial conditions of the impact. In this paper, two models are presented for pedestrian forward and wrap projection impacts. These models are predicated on separating the total <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> into the individual projection distances occurring during three principal phases of the collision. The models are novel as they use a rigid single-segment body representation of the pedestrian, include explicit modelling of the impact phase, and also allow for uncertainty in the input parameters. Published data are used to provide distributions for the input variables such as pedestrian and vehicle masses, etc. The model predictions of impact speed from overall <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> are validated by comparison with real-world accident data...|$|E

In particular, principal curves are saddle points of the mean-squared <b>projection</b> <b>distance,</b> which poses severe challenges for estimation and model selection. This paper demonstrates that the difficulties in model selection associated with the saddle point property of principal curves are intrinsically tied to the minimization of the mean-squared <b>projection</b> <b>distance.</b> We introduce a new objective function, facilitated through a modification of the principal curve estimation approach, for which all critical points are principal curves and minima.

Enough profiles need to be constructed to characterize 3 D variations in geologic structure at a scale that is appropriate for the available data.

40|$|Segmentation is an {{important}} step to obtain quantitative information from tomographic data sets. However, it is usually not possible to obtain an accurate segmentation based on a single, global threshold. Instead, local thresholding schemes can be applied that use a varying threshold.

Recently, the concept of <b>projection</b> <b>distance</b> was proposed by the authors as a new criterion for evaluating the quality of a tomogram segmentation [1].
