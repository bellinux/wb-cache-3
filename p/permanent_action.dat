And yet, according to my feelings, {{it is a very}} inferior kind of poetry, in which, as in the French tragedies, men are made to talk in a style which few indeed even of the wittiest can be supposed to converse in, and which both is, and on a moment's reflection appears to be, the natural produce of the hot-bed of vanity, namely, the closet of an author, who is actuated originally by a desire to excite surprise and wonderment at his own superiority to other men,--instead of having felt so deeply on certain subjects, or in consequence of certain imaginations, as to make it almost a necessity of his nature to seek for sympathy,--no doubt, with that honorable desire of <b>permanent</b> <b>action</b> which distinguishes genius.--Where then is the difference?--In this that each part should be proportionate, though the whole may be perhaps impossible.

K3.1 channels are responsible for the high frequency firing of action potentials.

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} theory of bisimulations for a simple {{language}} containing communicating transactions, obtained by dropping the isolation requirement of standard transactions. Such constructs have emerged as a useful programming abstraction for distributed systems. In systems with communicating transactions actions are tentative, waiting for certain transactions to commit before they become permanent. Our theory captures this by making bisimulations history-dependent, in that actions performed by transactions need to be recorded. The main requirement on bisimulations is the systems being compared need to match up exactly in the <b>permanent</b> <b>actions</b> but only those. The resulting theory is fully abstract {{with respect to a}} natural contextual equivalence and, as we show in examples, provides an e↵ective verification technique for comparing systems with communicating transactions. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the perception of}} public school teachers {{in the city of}} Aracoiaba- CE, Brazil, on health promoting actions and healthy environments. Methods: This was a case study conducted in public school, in April 2009, with the participation of 26 elementaryschool teachers. For collecting data we used the technique of group interview. Content analysis of Laurence Bardin was applied for data analysis. Results: The perception of teachers interviewed in relation to health promoting actions and healthy environments was restricted to focal experiences. Therefore, it was necessary to consider how teachers work the health issue in school environment, as well as the link between education for health and the scheduling of all school subjects. Conclusion: The knowledge of teachers on health seemedto be relevant but lacking of a better insight into the concepts.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Leptospira zanoni {{was used to}} produce chronic renal infections in young white mice. A variant of this strain {{produced}} an acute disease with over 50 % mortality. The responses of both forms of disease to chemotherapy were studied. When treatment of the acute disease was initiated before jaundice occurred, suitable single doses of streptomycin, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, erythromycin, oxytetracycline and oxytetracycline (in oil) prevented death and chronic renal infection in {{a high percentage of}} mice. Bicillin, a long-acting penicillin preparation, was more effective than other penicillins, but it prevented the development of chronic renal infection in only half the treated mice. Streptomycin was the only antibiotic of which a single administration regularly cured the chronic renal infections: chlortetracycline, tetracycline and oxytetracycline (in oil) were partially effective. Oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, Bicillin, fortified penicillin, procaine penicillin and potassium penicillin had no <b>permanent</b> <b>action.</b> The suitability of mice as laboratory animals in the study of experimental leptospirosis and the need for complete cure of carriers of chronic renal infection are emphasized.

40|$|Out of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} concepts or pillars of Indian religious thinking the present paper aims at disclosing the meaning and significance {{of the law of}} universal causality that binds man and cosmos, and condemns the former to an indefinite transmigration, i. e. the law of karma. This pan-Indian term will be underlined as it is reflected in the most important Upanishads and in Bhagavad Gītā, the gospel of Hindu spirituality. On the final part a parallel – between this concept and the teaching about the role of facts in the process of salvation according to the Orthodox Christian theology – will be drawn. In short, karma is a sort of law of causality that makes any action committed by individual leaving behind it a kind of force that causes the joys and sorrows of life, as the action was good or bad. According to Orthodox Church’s teaching good deeds is, along with faith and grace the subjective conditions of salvation, i. e. personal appropriation by every man of the objective redemption brought about by Jesus Christ, the God-man. This appropriation called salvation or sanctification is not simply a gift from God, but a <b>permanent</b> <b>action</b> that lasts throughout human life. If the law of karma acts implacably and independently to the will of man, stamping a fatalist character to life and undermining the human freedom, in Orthodoxy, however, man is not alone, but permanently assisted by the divine grace. But grace does not work irresistibly; it respects human freedom, so the facts present an obvious synergetic character. Therefore, between the Christian teaching on facts and the philosophy of the act, as it emerges from the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gītā is an abysmal distance that comes to differentiate these two religions on this level as well...|$|E
