The <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> rule states that where there is written evidence, oral testimony cannot be introduced to the court if it contradicts that evidence. Since secret trusts are oral and normally exist outside of the will (a written document) this causes problems. In Re Keen, the issue came up, and the Court of Appeal decided that the <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> rule extended to secret trusts, and such trusts could not be enforced if they contradicted written documents. More generally, the problem is proving that the testator intended to create a trust. As in McCormic v Grogan, the standard is high; the person trying to enforce the trust must show [...] "most clearly and distinctly" [...] that it exists.|$|E
50|$|To put it simply, (1) If {{the parties}} intend a {{complete}} {{integration of the}} contract terms, no <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> {{within the scope of}} agreement is permitted. (2) If the parties intended a partial integrated agreement, no <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> that contradicts anything integrated is permitted. And (3), if the <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> is collateral, meaning it regards a different agreement, and does not contradict the integrated terms, and are not terms any reasonable person would always naturally integrate, then the rule does not apply and the evidence is admissible.|$|E
50|$|In most jurisdictions {{there are}} {{numerous}} exceptions to this rule, and in those jurisdictions, extrinsic evidence may be admitted for the following purposes. This is called the Admission Rule. It favors liberalizing the admission of evidence {{to determine if the}} contract was fully integrated and to determine if the <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> is relevant. In these jurisdictions, such as California, one can bring in <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> even if the contract is unambiguous on its face, if the <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> creates ambiguity. The policy is to get to the actual truth.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} possible {{racial discrimination}} {{in the context of}} discretionary parole release. We develop a rational choice model of release whereby a parole board must balance parolees' risk of violation with the cost of not releasing prisoners who may not violate their parole. A color-blind parole board would release all individuals below a certain risk threshold. To test this prediction, we take advantage of a unique data set that reports all prisoners released on parole between 1983 and 2003 in the U. S. We apply the outcome test methodology recently used to assess racial profiling in police search decisions. Here, a higher rate of parole violation within a group suggests that the parole board used a less restrictive paroling criterion, and is thus biased in favor of that group. To overcome the concern of inframarginality that traditionally plagues outcome tests we provide evidence that parole boards strategically time the release of parolees. In turn, both minority and White prisoners become marginal from the perspective of their probability of parole violation. Parole boards operating under an indeterminate sentencing regime appear biased against White prisoners whose violation rate is significantly smaller than that of African Americans. In contrast, this gap is smaller or null when there is no discretion in the <b>paroling</b> system. Further <b>evidence</b> rules out post-release discrimination. We propose different hypotheses to account for the evidence. discrimination; outcome test; parole release; race...|$|R

50|$|In a {{minority}} of U.S. states, (Florida, Colorado, and Wisconsin), the <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> rule is extremely strong and extrinsic evidence is always barred from being used to interpret a contract. This is called the Four Corners Rule, and it is traditional/old. In a Four Corners Rule jurisdiction, {{there are two basic}} rules. First, the court will never allow <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> if the parties intended a full and completely integrated agreement, and second, the court will only turn to <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> if the terms available are wholly ambiguous. The policy is to prevent lying, to protect against doubtful veracity, to enable parties to rely dearly on written contracts, and for judicial efficiency.|$|E

50|$|The {{importance}} {{of the distinction between}} partial and complete integrations is relevant to what evidence is excluded under the <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> rule. For both complete and partial integrations, evidence contradicting the writing is excluded under the <b>parol</b> <b>evidence</b> rule. However, for a partial integration, terms that supplement the writing are admissible. To put it mildly, this can be an extremely subtle (and subjective) distinction.|$|E

50|$|It was {{one thing}} to create an {{exception}} that displaced the need for a memorandum in writing, but something else to completely nullify the Statute’s operation.

Thus, part performance might be an exception, but it could not, in effect, mean that the underlying contract could be proven by <b>parol</b> <b>evidence.</b> In developing the “part performance” exception, a balancing of the competing considerations was required.
