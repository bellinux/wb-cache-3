5|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional <b>precipitant.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the <b>precipitant</b> is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their <b>precipitant</b> has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} self-perception of seizure <b>precipitants</b> in 149 adult {{subjects with}} epilepsy: 71 % {{of the subjects}} reported at least one factor that, according to the perception, increased the risk of suffering from a seizure. The subjects most often reported psychological stress, change of weather and sleep deprivation. Among the disease-related factors, seizure frequency {{and the state of}} consciousness {{at the onset of the}} seizures influenced perception of <b>precipitants.</b> Furthermore the perception of some <b>precipitants</b> was dependent on such social variables as rural versus urban surroundings. It is argued that the perception of seizure <b>precipitants</b> is the result of a combination of physiologically based temporal and causal correlations and of beliefs of the patient about such relationships. Hence reports of seizure <b>precipitants</b> are determined by somatic as well as psychological factors. Efforts to clarify the relationship between possible <b>precipitants</b> and the occurrence of seizures should be intensified. In addition the great importance of seizure <b>precipitants</b> in lay theories of epilepsies should be considered in counselling patients with epilepsies...|$|R
50|$|Attack <b>precipitants</b> {{are usually}} {{physical}} in nature, such as defecation, eating, or taking medicine. Some less common <b>precipitants</b> are micturition, coitus, and painful stimuli. There are also non-physical <b>precipitants,</b> {{such as the}} thought or sight of food. In general attacks tend {{to occur in the}} precipitated area, though this is not always the case. While some individuals have described a build-up to attacks, in general they tend to be abrupt. The duration of these attacks can be from a few seconds to two hours.|$|R

25|$|People with FHM are {{encouraged}} to avoid activities that may trigger their attacks. Minor head trauma is a common attack <b>precipitant,</b> so FHM sufferers should avoid contact sports.

25|$|Sarcoidosis is {{a disease}} of unknown cause {{that leads to the}} {{development}} of granulomas in various organs. While the lungs are typically involved, other organs may equally be affected.

It is unknown which characteristics predispose sarcoidosis patients to brain or spinal cord involvement.|$|E
25|$|There is {{currently}} no vaccine available. The primary method of disease prevention is minimizing mosquito bites, as {{the disease is}} only transmitted by mosquitoes. Typical advice includes use of mosquito repellent and mosquito screens, wearing light coloured clothing, and minimising standing water around homes (e.g. removing Bromeliads, plant pots, garden ponds). Staying indoors during dusk/dawn hours when mosquitos are most active may also be effective. Bush camping is a common <b>precipitant</b> of infection so particular care is required.|$|E
50|$|Those with {{photosensitive}} epilepsy can have seizures triggered by flashing lights. Other <b>precipitants</b> can trigger an epileptic seizure {{in patients who}} otherwise would be susceptible to spontaneous seizures. For example, children with childhood absence epilepsy may be susceptible to hyperventilation. In fact, flashing lights and hyperventilation are activating procedures used in clinical EEG to help trigger seizures to aid diagnosis. Finally, other <b>precipitants</b> can facilitate, rather than obligately trigger, seizures in susceptible individuals. Emotional stress, sleep deprivation, sleep itself, heat stress, alcohol and febrile illness are examples of <b>precipitants</b> cited by patients with epilepsy. Notably, the influence of various <b>precipitants</b> varies with the epilepsy syndrome. Likewise, the menstrual cycle in women with epilepsy can influence patterns of seizure recurrence. Catamenial epilepsy is the term denoting seizures linked to the menstrual cycle.|$|R
40|$|AbstractProtein {{solubility}} is {{a problem}} for many protein chemists, including structural biologists and developers of protein pharmaceuticals. Knowledge about how intrinsic factors influence solubility is limited due to the difficulty of obtaining quantitative solubility measurements. Solubility measurements in buffer alone are difficult to reproduce, because gels or supersaturated solutions often form, making it impossible to determine solubility values for many proteins. Protein <b>precipitants</b> can be used to obtain comparative solubility measurements and, in some cases, estimations of solubility in buffer alone. Protein <b>precipitants</b> fall into three broad classes: salts, long-chain polymers, and organic solvents. Here, we compare the use of representatives from two classes of <b>precipitants,</b> ammonium sulfate and polyethylene glycol 8000, by measuring the solubility of seven proteins. We find that increased negative surface charge correlates strongly with increased protein solubility and may be due to strong binding of water by the acidic amino acids. We also find that the solubility results obtained for the two different <b>precipitants</b> agree closely with each other, suggesting that the two <b>precipitants</b> probe similar properties that are relevant to solubility in buffer alone...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence and nature of self-perceived seizure <b>precipitants</b> in epilepsy patients, and evaluate whether anxiety level, depression, or health locus of control influence self-perception of seizure <b>precipitants.</b> MethodsAdults aged 18 and older who had epilepsy for at least 1 year were recruited in either the inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit or the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Thomas Jefferson University in 2006. Patients anonymously filled out a questionnaire, which included data about age, sex, education, seizure control, and three questionnaires including identification of seizure <b>precipitants,</b> Hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale, and Form C of the multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC). Discriminant function analysis was used for statistical analysis. ResultsTwo hundred patients participated, with a mean age of 40. 3 ± 16 years. One hundred thirty (65 %) patients reported one or more seizure <b>precipitants.</b> Stress (49. 5 %), lack of sleep (35. 5 %), and fatigue (32. 5 %) were the most common seizure triggers reported. Seizure control, anxiety level, and powerful others subscale in HLC scores were significantly related to self-perception of seizure <b>precipitants.</b> Subjective seizure triggers (stress, lack of sleep) were related to psychological factors. ConclusionsThe perception that certain triggers precipitate seizures is related to anxiety, health locus of control, and seizure control. Hence, seizures might be misattributed to irrelevant <b>precipitants</b> because of an underlying psychological predisposition. Alternatively, there may be a physiological relationship between seizures and the triggers. Prospective studies are required to clarify the relationship between seizure <b>precipitants</b> and seizure occurrence...|$|R
25|$|Loneliness {{has been}} linked with depression, and is thus {{a risk factor for}} suicide. Émile Durkheim has {{described}} loneliness, specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others, i.e. for friendships or altruistic ideas, as the main reason for what he called egoistic suicide. In adults, loneliness is a major <b>precipitant</b> of depression and alcoholism. People who are socially isolated may report poor sleep quality, and thus have diminished restorative processes. Loneliness has also been linked with a Schizoid character type in which one may see the world differently and experience social alienation, described as the self in exile.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Fowler suggested to Edward Ardern, his chief chemist, and William Lockett, the chief research assistant, that they research {{ways to reduce the}} growth of algae. They lowered the light levels, as sunlight often triggered the growth of algae, and kept the <b>precipitant</b> floc, which contained many bacteria, from one experiment to the next. Each subsequent experiment was more successful than the last, as the sludge showed better clarifying properties as it got older. Ardern and Lockett had discovered the Activated Sludge Process, which was soon being used worldwide. The research was carried out at Manchester University, and Fowler presented the results at the Grand Hotel in Manchester in April and November 1914.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{psychotic}} {{symptoms are}} common in psychiatric emergency service settings. The determination {{of the source of}} the psychosis can be difficult. Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency service setting {{will not be able to}} provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered <b>precipitant,</b> such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effects of behavioural treatment on seizure recurrence, on seizure <b>precipitants,</b> and on associated psychiatric disturbances in 22 adolescents and young adults (age range 16 – 32 years, male : female ratio 10 : 12) with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) who showed seizure relapses despite rational AED therapy. The neurological assessment and a systematic search for seizure <b>precipitants</b> preceded to the use of psychiatric interviews and rating scales for anxiety and depression. After a structured counselling aiming at the elimination of seizure <b>precipitants,</b> the patients were assigned to one of two treatment modalities (an antistress programme or an individual cognitive behavioural therapy). Structured counselling was associated with complete seizure control in eight patients. In other 14 subjects with uncontrolled seizures, the psychotherapeutic treatment had two types of effects. First, the patients’ fears and other unadapted responses, in the form of anxiety states and/or insomnia were significantly decreased during behavioural treatment. Second, a significantly lower rate of relapses occurred during behavioural treatment than during the baseline period. The results encourage the use of adjunctive behavioural treatment methods in decreasing seizure frequency, seizure <b>precipitants</b> and some types of comorbid psychopathology in patientswith JME...|$|R

2500|$|Protein {{precipitate}} formation {{occurs in a}} stepwise process. [...] First, a precipitating agent is added and the solution is steadily mixed. [...] Mixing causes the <b>precipitant</b> and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or flocculating. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean shear rate and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

40|$|Polysomnography (PSG) is {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} diagnosis of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias, however its diagnostic yield has been rarely reported. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of polysomnography in different categories of patients with suspected NREM parasomnia and define variables that can affect the outcome. 124 adults referred for polysomnography for suspected NREM parasomnia were retrospectively identified and divided into clinical categories based on their history. Each polysomnography was analysed for features of NREM parasomnia or different sleep disorders and for presence of potential <b>precipitants.</b> The impact on the outcome of number of recording nights and concomitant consumption of benzodiazepines and antidepressants was assessed. Overall, PSG confirmed NREM parasomnias in 60. 5 % patients and showed a different sleep disorder in another 16 %. <b>Precipitants</b> were found in 21 % of the 124 patients. However, PSG showed limited value when the NREM parasomnia was clinically uncomplicated, since it rarely revealed a different diagnosis or unsuspected <b>precipitants</b> (5 % respectively), but became essential for people with unusual features in the history where different or overlapping diagnoses (18 %) or unsuspected <b>precipitants</b> (24 %) were commonly identified. Taking benzodiazepines or antidepressants during the PSG reduced the diagnostic yield. PSG has a high diagnostic yield in patients with suspected NREM parasomnia, and can reveal a different diagnosis or <b>precipitants</b> in over 40 % of people with complicated or atypical presentation or those with a history of epilepsy. We suggest that PSG should be performed for one night in the first instance, with leg electrodes and respiratory measurements and after benzodiazepine and antidepressant withdrawal...|$|R
40|$|A {{turning points}} {{analysis}} {{is used to}} capture the negotiating dynamics that occur within {{the structure of the}} GATT and the WTO.
