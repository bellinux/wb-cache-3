Some samples of citrus fruit, exotic fruit [ [...] . ] contained perchlorate concentrations that can {{have undesirable effects on}} health if large portions are consumed on a one-time basis (BfR Opinion no. 022 / 2013). The EU Commission has commissioned the EFSA to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment. As a <b>provisional</b> <b>enforcement</b> approach until this assessment is completed, the EU Commission has initially proposed a general reference value of 0. 5 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of food for perchlorate concentrations in fruit and vegetables. The proposal was adapted following discussions with the member states, and the following <b>provisional</b> <b>enforcement</b> approach was adopted on 16 July 2013 : the reference value is 0. 2 mg per kg for citrus fruit, pome fruit, root and tuber vegetables, table grapes, spinach, melons and water melons, 1. 0 mg per kg for leaf vegetables (apart from spinach), fresh herbs and celery grown in glasshouses/under cover, and 0. 5 mg per kg for all other fruit and vegetable products. The BfR welcomes the partial lowering of reference values to 0. 2 mg per kg. However, the BfR does not consider the adopted values to be suitable to adequately protect consumers against potential health risks due to the consumption of large portions of fruit and vegetable products with perchlorate residues. The BfR believes that only a concentration of 0. 05 mg per kg would be acceptable for all fruit and vegetable products based on the assessment methodology used for pesticides. As it is still not ultimately clear how perchlorate finds its way into foods, it is also unclear whether the presence of perchlorate in foods should be considered a "contaminant" or a "residue".

40|$|Enforced {{execution}} is {{the legal}} way by which the Creditor under an enforceable order protects his rights by resorting to coercive force of the state. When the Debtor does not comply voluntarily, the Creditor may appeal to the Bailiff to commence the enforced execution in all manner prescribed by law. Of course, the start of compulsory execution {{is limited by the}} conditions of admissibility imperatively specified in the law, principally the condition to exist an enforceable order owned by the Creditor. Regarding the order to be enforced, it can be represented either by an enforceable or final judgement, with <b>provisional</b> <b>enforcement</b> or any other document that can be enforced. Procedurally, the provisions of Art. 712 of the Civil Procedure Code allow the introduction by a Creditor who has a litigation to execution against the execution itself, against the Closures issued by the Bailiff, and against any other act of enforcement. Jurisdiction of the Court in this matter will be of the Executor Court or the Court in whose district the Debtor is situated, on the date of the appeal. The appeal of the Debtor questions the Parties not only over the acts of execution because the appeal is also allowed over the explanations relative to the meaning, scope or application of the enforceable order, but in the conditions limited by the legal nature of this order. Thus, according to the law when enforceable order is not issued by a Court or Arbitration may be invoked before an Executor Court including reasons of fact or law which could not be discussed during an earlier trial, in the first instance or in an appeal. Basically, if enforced execution is under an enforceable order that is not from a Court, these reasons can be invoked when there is no other processual mean for its abolition. There also can be submitted a complaint against the Closure by which was upheld the appeal for an enforced execution, and the act of execution concerning the division of the common property or common goods. For the purposes of the foregoing ideas, the article details the mean of introduction the execution appeal for recovery of emoluments arising from a legal labour relationship. Creditor’s debt is represented by the financial rights related to the management function held in a public institution. Regarding the enforcement order it is the Decision of the Appeal Court by which the Debtor public institution is obliged to cover the material damage suffered by the Creditor civil servant, starting from the time of his dismissal from the management function until effectively reintegration on the same position. There are analysed the Debtor’s appeals requesting the annulment of execution acts issued by the Bailiff, and the execution itself, the appeal motivation, the defences of the parties in fact and in law, {{and the role of the}} Court during the course of the procedure...|$|E
40|$|The present Chronique {{examines}} {{the law on}} enforcement of judgments in ten European jurisdictions. (The term 'enforcement' rather than 'execution' is used because of the relatively narrow meaning of execution of a judgment within English law.) In {{the last seven years}} a number of the jurisdictions under consideration have made more or less extensive revisions of their laws on enforcement of judgments. Most notable is the complete overhaul of the law in France contained in L. 91 - 650 and D. 92 - 755. Less complete, but still substantial, revisions have been made in Portugal (Decree law 329 -A/ 95 of 12 December 1995 as modified by Decree law 180 / 96 of 25 December 1996) and Austria (Exekutionsordnungs Novellen 1991 and 1995). Changes have also been introduced in all of the other laws under consideration. Areas which have attracted reform in several jurisdictions include in particular the specification of the property of the debtor which remains immune from execution, and the obtaining of information from the debtor as to his assets. Clearly the Chronique cannot hope to provide an exhaustive comparison, but it attempts to highlight key similarities and differences in approach that are adopted within Europe. Before looking at the methods of execution themselves, the Chronique deals with a number of preliminary issues. An introductory section sets out the various kinds of obligation that may be recognised in a judgment and provides a brief overview of the different methods of execution that may be employed for each type of obligation. The Chronique then goes on to consider the formal requirements that may need to be satisfied before enforcement of a judgment can take place. It is noted at this point that a judgment is just one form of enforceable title. Other titles are also enforceable under the laws of all states considered, although considerable variations exist as to the types of title that are recognised. The varying approaches of the legal systems under consideration as to <b>provisional</b> <b>enforcement</b> are also considered in this section. If an enforceable title exists, further formal requirements that may have to be satisfied before execution of the judgment can take place include proof of enforceability and service of the judgment. A further preliminary issue is the variety of personnel that may be involved in the enforcement process. Considerable differences between systems exist both as to the allocation of tasks between courts, lawyers and bailiffs, and as to the regulation and training of bailiffs. An important section is devoted to the question of effectiveness of the creditor's title. This involves consideration of the mechanisms available to assist the creditor to find out information about the debtor's assets; the extent to which evasive action {{on the part of the}} debtor, by effecting dispositions of property, may be counteracted; the immunities and exemptions recognised by the law of each jurisdiction; and the extent to which measures exist to deal with debtors who have acquired an unmanageable burden of debt. On each issue considerable diversity of approach can be identified, although in relation to assets immune from seizure there is a strong core of shared values. The Chronique then moves on to look at the methods of execution themselves. This part of the Chronique is divided into three sections. It looks first at enforcement of money obligations, through the seizure of movable property, garnishment and seizure of immovable property. It then deals with obligations to perform a certain act or abstain from certain conduct, which are dealt with by mechanisms such as substitute performance, fines, sequestration and imprisonment. The final section concerns obligations to deliver property, which are mainly enforced via seizure of the property and fines. Particular attention is drawn to the differences between legal systems as to the circumstances under which enforcement agents may gain access to the premises of the debtor, the degree of intrusion that may be imposed on third parties, the legal effects o...|$|E
50|$|While it {{was true}} that the <b>Provisional</b> Government lacked <b>enforcement</b> ability, {{prominent}} members within the Government encouraged bottom-up rule. Politicians such as Prime Minister Georgy Lvov favored devolution of power to decentralized organizations. The Provisional Government did not desire the complete decentralization of power, but certain members definitely advocated more political participation by the masses in the form of grassroots mobilization.|$|R
