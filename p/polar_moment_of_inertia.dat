Some control animals were sacrificed initially at time zero and increased mechanical usage and age-matched control animals were sacrificed after 2, 10, 18, and 26 weeks of treatment.

Despite this, there remains an unacceptable high risk of pathologic fracture following radiation treatment. Zoledronic acid (ZA) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are therapeutic candidates for decreasing this fracture risk post-irradiation. Due to differing mechanisms, we hypothesized that the combined treatment with ZA and PTH would significantly improve bone healing more than ZA or PTH treatment alone. Using an orthotopic model of canine osteosarcoma in athymic rats, we evaluated bone healing following clinically-relevant doses of radiation therapy (12 Gy x 3 fractions, 36 Gy total). Groups included 36 Gy SRT only, 36 Gy SRT plus ZA, 36 Gy SRT plus ZA and PTH, 36 Gy SRT plus PTH, and 36 Gy SRT plus localized PTH treatment.

40|$|Background. Obesity and osteoporosis, two {{possibly}} related conditions, {{are rapidly}} expanding health concerns in modern society. Both {{of them are}} associated with sedentary life style and nutrition. To investigate the effects of diet-induced obesity and voluntary physical activity we used high resolution micro-computed tomography (μCT) together with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) to examine the microstructure of the distal femoral metaphysis in mice. Methods. Forty 7 -week-old male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were assigned to 4 groups: control (C), control + running (CR), high-fat diet (HF), and high-fat diet + running (HFR). After a 21 -week intervention, all the mice were sacrificed and the left femur dissected for pQCT and μCT measurements. Results. The mice fed the high-fat diet showed a significant weight gain (over 70 % for HF and 60 % for HFR), with increased epididymal fat pad mass and impaired insulin sensitivity. These obese mice had significantly higher trabecular connectivity density, volume, number, thickness, area and mass, and smaller trabecular separation. At the whole bone level, they had larger bone circumference and cross-sectional area and higher density-weighted maximal, minimal, and <b>polar</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> Voluntary wheel running decreased all the cortical bone parameters, but increased the trabecular mineral density, and decreased the pattern factor and structure model index towards a more plate-like structure.

40|$|Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (ESO) is a {{relatively}} new design tool used to improve and optimise the design of structures. It is a heuristic method where a few elements of an initial design domain of finite elements are iteratively removed. Such a process is carried out repeatedly until an optimum design is achieved, or until a desired given area or volume is reached. There have been many contributions to the ESO procedure since its conception back in 1992. For example, a provision known as Bi-Directional ESO (BESO) has now been incorporated where elements may not only be removed, but added. Also, rather than deal with elements where they are either present or not, the designer now has the option to change the element's properties in a progressive fashion. This includes the modulus of elasticity, the density of the material and the thickness of plate elements, and is known as Morphing ESO. In addition to the algorithmic aspects of ESO, a large preference exists to optimise a structure based on a selection of criteria for various physical processes. Such examples include stress minimisation, buckling and electromagnetic problems. In a changing world that demands the enhancement of design tools and methods that incorporate optimisation, the development of methods like ESO to accommodate this demand is called for. It is this demand that this thesis seeks to satisfy. This thesis develops and examines the concept of multicriteria optimisation in the ESO process. Taking into account the optimisation of numerous criteria simultaneously, Multicriteria ESO allows a more realistic and accurate approach to optimising a model in any given environment. Two traditional methods � the Weighting method and the Global Criterion (Min-max) method have been used, as has two unconventional methods � the Logical AND method and the Logical OR method. These four methods have been examined for different combinations of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) solver types. This has included linear static FEA solver, the natural frequency FEA solver and a recently developed inertia FE solver. Mean compliance minimisation (stiffness maximisation), frequency maximisation and <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> maximisation are an assortment of the specific objectives incorporated. Such a study has provided a platform to use many other criteria and multiple combinations of criteria. In extending the features of ESO, and hence its practical capabilities as a design tool, the creation of another optimisation method based on ESO has been ushered in. This method concerns the betterment of the bending and rotational performance of cross-sectional areas and is known as Evolutionary <b>Moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inertia</b> Optimisation (EMIO). Again founded upon a domain of finite elements, the EMIO method seeks to either minimise or maximise the rectangular, product and <b>polar</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> This dissertation then goes one step further to include the EMIO method as one of the objectives considered in Multicriteria ESO as mentioned above. Most structures, (if not all) in reality are not homogenous as assumed by many structural optimisation methods. In fact, many structures (particularly biological ones) are composed of different materials or the same material with continually varying properties. In this thesis, a new feature called Constant Width Layer (CWL) ESO is developed, in which a distinct layer of material evolves with the developing boundary. During the optimisation process, the width of the outer surrounding material remains constant and is defined by the user. Finally, in verifying its usefulness to the practical aspect of design, the work presented herein applies the CWL ESO and the ESO methods to two dental case studies. They concern the optimisation of an anterior (front of the mouth) ceramic dental bridge and the optimisation of a posterior (back of the mouth) ceramic dental bridge. Comparisons of these optimised models are then made to those developed by other methods...|$|R

Also, they are usually controlled using proportional, integral and derivative controllers, which are set up as modally uncoupled parallel and tilt rotor axes.

An exact analysis was then the derived dynamic stiffness matrix. are derivatives of the general case have discussed. A three stage program was developed to compute various static and dynamic properties of thin-walled closed or open section composite beams. In the first stage, equivalent elastic constants (overall laminate moduli) were evaluated for a given stacking sequence and material properties. In the second stage, various sectional properties were computed. When the outputs from these two stages were combined, valuable data on sectional rigidities, mass per unit length, <b>polar</b> mass <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> and shear centre location from the centroid were obtained. In the third stage of the program, all these properties were used to compute the natural frequencies and normal mode shapes of thin-walled composite structures. These programs can be used individually as well as in a combined manner. An experimental investigation of composite thin plates with varying degrees of bending-torsion coupling was conducted. Flexural and torsional rigidities, natural frequencies, normal mode shapes and flutter speed and frequency were experimentally determined. The results obtained were in close agreement with the theoretical predictions. Various open composite sections were experimentally studied for their static and dynamic properties. The results demanded a more refined investigation of the theory. In addition to the experimental study of composite open sections, a parametric study of uncoupled and coupled frequencies of such sections with common boundary conditions was also conducted.
