25|$|In 1971, the Cityliner was {{introduced}} to the public. This design had a passenger platform above the driver's cab, and included an onboard toilet. The vehicle also made use, of glass-fibre reinforced plastic for certain areas of the body, this was the first instance when this technique was used. In 1973, the Jetliner {{was introduced}}, featuring a large one-piece windshield, with the driver and door windows sloping from the <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> line {{down to the bottom of}} the windshield level.|$|E
25|$|At 6:14am, as {{the police}} were taking details, {{they were told that}} a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on the same road. The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the {{passenger}} door and shattering the <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Golf, which ran over him. He was certified dead at the scene at 6:35am.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{introduced}} on the EM/ET class sets, {{several of}} the DM/D sets refurbished for the Johnsonville Branch were later repainted in this livery during the late 1980s. The car body was repainted in olive green with a grey roof and black underfloor equipment and running gear. A white band surrounded the windows {{on the sides of}} the car, ending between the first <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> and the driver's cab window. The doors and ends were painted yellow with white block numbers and classification letters on the side and black numbers on the '1' and '2' ends of the train. The cab windows and headlight mounting were painted with a black surround.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} how, but several Gulf Cartel members traced {{one of their}} stolen loads to a stash house of {{suspected}} dealers in Elsa, Texas on 1 November 2011. The cartel then called on an American-based prison gang to go and buy the loads to learn {{the location of the}} stash house. The gang dealers then went and bought the drugs from the dealers, but realized that it was not at the stash house were the goods were allegedly hidden. In an attempt to disclose the information to the dealers, the gang members kidnapped them, and that was when two country sheriffs received an emergency call a possible kidnapping. The policemen then spotted the gang member's Ford F-150 pickup truck and ordered the drivers to stop. While one of the policemen was speaking to the driver, the other approached the <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> and was shot with a 9 mm gun. The policeman managed to survive because he was wearing a bullet vest. One of the gang members, however, was killed; the other {{was shot in the head}} and remained in critical condition.|$|E
2500|$|Gotti and Gravano {{arrived at}} the {{restaurant}} shortly before 5 o'clock and, after circling the block, parked their car across the intersection and within view of the entrance. Around 5:30, Gravano spotted Castellano's Lincoln Town Car stopped at a nearby intersection and, via walkie talkie, alerted the team of hitmen stationed outside the restaurant of Castellano's approach. Castellano's driver, Thomas Bilotti, pulled the car up {{directly in front of}} the entrance. As Castellano and Bilotti exited the Lincoln, the roughly half dozen shooters moved in and opened fire, killing both men in a barrage of bullets. As the hat-and-trench-coat-adorned men slipped away into the night, Gotti calmly drove the car past the front of the restaurant to get a look at the scene. Looking down at Bilotti's body from the <b>passenger</b> <b>window,</b> Gravano remarked, [...] "He's gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{justify the}} use of deadly force, it is not enough, however, for the police officer to merely express a {{subjective}} fear of death or great bodily harm. Unreasonable fear cannot justify {{the use of}} deadly force. The use of deadly force must be objectively reasonable and necessary, given {{the totality of the}} circumstances. Based upon our thorough and exhaustive review of the facts of this case, it is my conclusion that the use of deadly force by Officer Yanez was not justified, and that sufficient facts exist to prove that to be true. Accordingly, we filed a criminal complaint this morning in Ramsey County.In his press conference announcing his decision to prosecute Yanez, Choi noted facts not consistent with a justified fear of Castile, namely that Yanez's partner, Officer Kauser, who was standing at the car's <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> during the shooting, [...] "did not touch or remove his gun from its holster",and that in his answers to questioning by Saint Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde immediately after the shooting, Yanez [...] "stated he did not know where [...] gun was".

50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the interior was largely designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau http://www.poltronafrau.com/portal/page/portal/UI/webpages/poltronafrau/home?lang=en of Italy, whom they had previously worked with on the larger Q45. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement from the larger Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior door pull handle.|$|E

Details included on a printed ticket are generally the location and operator of the machine, expiry time, fee paid and time entered.|$|E
