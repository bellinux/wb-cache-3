5|$|Bears are carnivoran mammals of {{the family}} Ursidae. They are {{classified}} as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing {{in a wide variety}} of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, <b>plantigrade</b> paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{footprints}} {{show that}} pterosaurs stood {{with the entire}} foot {{in contact with the}} ground (<b>plantigrade),</b> {{in a manner similar to}} many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs walked with an erect posture with their four limbs held almost vertically beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern birds and mammals, rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} {{assumption}} {{that there is no}} spatial structure in small-scale recruitment variability of rocky shore mussels, we examined spatial dependence in the distribution of density of recruits (late plantigrades: 0. 5 to 3. 5 mm; larger recruits: 3. 5 to 10 mm) and adults of the brown mussel Perna perna within local scales (30 lags ranging between 0. 35 and 10. 5 m) in mid- and upper mussel beds. Spatial heterogeneity was estimated by analyzing scaling properties of semivariograms using a fractal approach. Relationships between density of mussel recruits and adults and biomass of the red alga Gelidium pristoides at the different scales were examined by cross-semivariograms. We found that the distribution of adults showed spatial dependence at all transects, often with higher spatial heterogeneity (higher fractal dimension, D) at smaller scales (1 st scaling region). The distribution of larger recruits exhibited spatial dependence at all transects, revealing a spatial structure, which was related to that of adults. In contrast, the distribution of late <b>plantigrades</b> showed mainly spatial independence (random pattern; 1. 97 < D ≤ 2). Densities of both size classes of recruits were positively related to those of adults at all transects and scales, but the relationship was stronger for larger recruits than late <b>plantigrades,</b> explaining why there was clearer spatial structure of larger recruits. The relationship with algae was mainly negative for larger recruits, while it tended to be positive at many scales for late <b>plantigrades.</b> Thus, both adult mussels and G. pristoides are suitable habitats for <b>plantigrades,</b> while mussels are the main habitat for larger recruits. This may mean that recruits on algae either die or migrate to mussel clumps at a certain size. This study highlights the importance of recruit size when analyzing recruitment patchiness of mussels, and has implications for sustainable management of P. perna...|$|R

This study describes improved technologies {{to control the}} settlement and adhesion of the important fouling organism Mytilus galloprovincialis by incorporating the nanofillers titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrices. The incorporation of TiO 2 prevented larval settlement when photoactivated with UV light, even at the lowest concentration of the nanofiller (3. 75 wt%). Notably, there was 100 % mortality of pediveligers exposed to photoactivated TiO 2. However, <b>plantigrades</b> initially settled to photoactivated TiO 2, but their adhesion strength was significantly reduced on these surfaces in comparison to blank PDMS. In addition, <b>plantigrades</b> had high mortality after 6 h.

They are also often shown as aerial predators similar to birds of prey, grasping human victims with their taloned feet. No pterosaur species known so far possesses prehensile feet; all known pterosaurs have flat, <b>plantigrade</b> feet with no opposable toes, often poorly muscled and, {{in the case of}} pteranodontians, generally proportionally small. However, some pterosaurs might have had raptorial tendencies; Thalassodromeus possesses powerful jaws akin to those of phorusrhacids, and Hatzegopteryxs short neck and more powerful jaws have been interpreted as a speciation on larger prey.|$|E
5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} mammals such as humans and bears—are <b>plantigrade,</b> {{walking on the}} whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E
5|$|Practically {{every imaginable}} posture has been {{suggested}} for Plateosaurus in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed digitigrade bipedality with erect hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked quadrupedally, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, <b>plantigrade</b> feet, and laterally undulating the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured a clumsy, kangaroo-like hopping, {{a change of heart}} for which he was mocked by German zoologist Gustav Tornier, who interpreted the shape of the articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen lagerstätte, also favoured a reptilian posture. Müller-Stoll listed a number of characters required for an erect limb posture that Plateosaurus supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions were correct. However, most of these adaptations are actually present in Plateosaurus.|$|E
40|$|The five {{most common}} growth models (Gompertz, Special von Bertalanffy, Richards, Logistic and Generalized von Bertalanffy) were fitted to growth data {{comprising}} different developmental stages (i. e. free-swimming larvae, <b>plantigrades,</b> post-larvae and juveniles/adults) of the Caribbean pearl oyster Pinctada imbricata. As criteria {{for determining the}} most suitable model, the mean deviation of {{the data from the}} estimated growth curve (= mean square error, MSE), the deviation of the estimated asymptotic length of the observed maximum length obtained from a natural population, and the plot of the residuals against estimates were used. The Special von Bertalanffy and Richards models produce pure asymptotic curves and are therefore unable to simulate the exponential growth of the first two developmental stages (free-swimming larvae and <b>plantigrades),</b> furthermore they tend to overestimate the asymptotic length. Gompertz, Logistic and the Generalized von Bertalanffy model, on the other hand produce sigmoid curves and thus are much better capable of modeling growth of the combined developmental stages, thereby underestimating asymptotic length. From all models the Generalized von Bertalanffy model yields the best fit which is explained and discussed as a special mathematical property of its surface factor D...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycles of}} several Mytilus populations in Carlingford Lough were investigated between November 1968 and May 1971. The annual cycle varied slightly from population to population though spawning began simultaneously at all {{stations in the}} spring months when sea temperature was rising rapidly between 7. 5 ° and 12 °C. A secondary phase of gametogenesis {{during the summer months}} was confirmed by oocyte counts and the onset of the secondary spawning period occurred from 4 - 8 weeks after the initial spring emission. Although no significant differences were recorded in oocyte size in the different populations immediately before spawning oocyte densities were greatest at the seaward stations. Similarly, low shore populations had higher oocyte densities than those higher in the littoral zone where feeding time is severely curtailed. Size did not seem to influence gametogenesis nor did the severely polluted conditions prevailing in Belfast Lough. Seasonal changes in glycogen and lipid content of the mantle were studied in relation to the annual reproductive cycle. Primary settlement of early <b>plantigrades</b> on algae occurred principally in summer and winter. Secondary settlement on artificial substrates coincided with the disappearance of early <b>plantigrades</b> from the algae...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{anatomical}} {{differences between}} the limbs of <b>plantigrades,</b> like humans, and both unguligrade and digitigrade limbs. Digitigrade and unguligrade animals have relatively long carpals and tarsals, and the bones which would correspond to the human ankle are thus set much higher in the limb than in a human. In a digitigrade animal, this effectively lengthens the foot, {{so much so that}} what are often thought of as a digitigrade animal's [...] "hands" [...] and [...] "feet" [...] correspond only to what would be the bones of the human finger or toe.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are <b>plantigrade.</b> They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E

40|$|The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is {{a common}} {{aquaculture}} species, and also a major fouling organism that has negative economic impacts. There are no standard assay conditions for this important species and therefore the initial study of this thesis (Chapter 2) quantified the effect of key factors on the settlement of pediveligers and <b>plantigrades</b> to provide a standardised and reproducible assay method. Density dependent settlement did not occur for either pediveligers or <b>plantigrades.</b> Settlement increased in drop assays in a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle, while bottom shade had no effect of any magnitude. In addition, settlement was significantly enhanced by storing pediveligers for between 4 and 24 days at 4 ºC. Overall, these data provide the template to optimise and standardise static laboratory settlement assays for mussels {{in order to develop}} materials that either enhance settlement for the aquaculture industry, or deter settlement for antifouling applications. Furthermore, simple mechanisms such as storage at 4 ºC can enhance settlement beyond current methods used in aquaculture hatcheries. In the third chapter of this thesis, key properties affecting the settlement and adhesion of marine invertebrate larvae were investigated. Surface wettability and microtopography can either enhance or deter larval settlement of many sessile marine organisms. To determine the effect of these surface properties on the settlement of pediveligers of M. galloprovincialis (Chapter 3), polymers spanning a range of wettability and microtextured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were used. Furthermore, the adhesion strength of settled pediveligers on microtextured PDMS surfaces was quantified using a flow chamber. Settlement was enhanced at the hydrophilic end of the wettability spectrum, where mean settlement on nylon reached 33. 5 ± 13. 1...|$|R

Early development of S. pugilis was examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. Rearing was conducted at 27 +/- 1 degrees C. Veligers were reared at 200 larvae l(- 1) in 4 -l containers. Larvae were fed with the microalgae Isochrysis galbana and Nanochloropsis oculata at a concentration of 1, 000 cell l(- 1). The protoconch at hatching measured 212 +/- 12. 14 mu m in length and the shell reached 1, 100 +/- 29. 11 mu m 29 d after hatching. Development characteristics are described from hatching to settlement. Newly hatched veligers possess two velar lobes, a larval shell consisting of 1. 5 whorls, eyespots and a single right tentacle. Late veligers (5 -d old larvae) have four velar lobes and two shell whorls and the left tentacle appears. Pediveligers show a functional adult heart at 11 d. Crawling behaviour and settlement were observed from 27 to 31 d. <b>Plantigrades</b> were observed after 29 d, when a functioning proboscis is observed and the velar lobes are lost.

40|$|The {{revision}} of materials from a constantly {{growing number of}} European sites has contributed to an increased focus on the investigation of human-bear relationships during the Palaeolithic (Fosse, et al., 2002; Auguste, 2003; Quilès, 2004; Stiner, 1999). In recent decades this has been enhanced by important evidence of hunting activity (Munzel & Conard, 2004, Morel 1993, Auguste, 1995). In North-Eastern Italy, {{towards the end of}} the Middle Palaeolithic, cave bears (Ursus spelaeus), brown bear (Ursus arctos) and human groups (Homo neanderthalensis) were potential competitors over the same environmental resources (both above and below ground). Fumane cave, 350 m. a. s. l., on the Lessini Mounts and Rio Secco Cave, 580 m. a. s. l., on the Pradis Plateau witnessed close human-ursidae interactions, as documented by discoid and levallois lithic industries found associated with the remains of <b>plantigrades.</b> Taphonomic evidence from the remains of both species quantitatively and qualitatively illustrates a well-established exploitation between 49 and 42 kycal BP. These two sites can be considered as rare examples of the accumulation of carcasses derived from violent death during phases of hibernation or close to its end.

40|$|The Bathymodiolinae are {{pervasive}} in reducing environments {{in the deep}} sea, yet data on post-larval and juvenile development and {{on the process of}} symbiont acquisition remain elusive. To understand how these opportunistic metazoans survive in ephemeral reducing habitats, individuals of the small bathymodiolin, Idas modiolaeformis, were examined histologically to trace their reproductive development, and with fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy to identify patterns of infection by their environmentally acquired bacterial symbionts. A size series of these mussels was retrieved from larval colonisation devices containing vegetative substrates, deployed for 51 weeks (November 2006 – 2007) in the central ‘Pockmarks’ region (site 2 A) of the Nile deep-sea fan in the eastern Mediterranean (NDSF), a zone where methane seepage can occur (N 32 ° 31. 97, E 30 ° 21. 18, 1, 693 m deep). Developmental patterns of germ cell migration, size at first maturity, and symbiont acquisition and localisation are presented for the post-larva to adult transition. The smallest mature adult was a male with shell length (SL) 2. 35 mm. All larger individuals in the series were male (maximum SL 6. 54 mm). Based on the absence of bacterial signals, <b>plantigrades</b> were asymbiotic, indicating strict heterotrophy in larvae and early post-larvae. During the early stages of dissoconch deposition, extracellular symbiont infection was non-specific. This was followed by increasing specificity on non-ciliated gill epithelia in adults.

500|$|Proboscideans {{experienced}} several evolutionary trends, such as {{an increase}} in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to [...] tall. As with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of elephants likely developed {{to allow them to}} survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally <b>plantigrade</b> and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support. Early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's centre of gravity. The skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. The number of premolars, incisors and canines decreased. The cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from C3-plants to C4-grasses, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago. Only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs. The upper second incisors grew into tusks, which varied in shape from straight, to curved (either upward or downward), to spiralled, depending on the species. Some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors. Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry, such as their middle ear anatomy and the internal testes of the males.|$|E

60|$|Although, however, Predication {{does not}} presuppose Classification, {{and though the}} theory of Names and of Propositions is not cleared up, but only encumbered, by intruding the idea of {{classification}} into it, there is nevertheless a close connection between Classification and the employment of General Names. By every general name which we introduce, we create a class, if there be any things, real or imaginary, to compose it; that is, any Things corresponding to the signification of the name. Classes, therefore, mostly owe their existence to general language. But general language, also, though {{that is not the}} most common case, sometimes owes its existence to classes. A general, which is as much as to say a significant, name, is indeed mostly introduced because we have a signification to express by it; because we need a word by means of which to predicate the attributes which it connotes. But {{it is also true that}} a name is sometimes introduced because we have found it convenient to create a class; because we have thought it useful for the regulation of our mental operations, that a certain group of objects should be thought of together. A naturalist, for purposes connected with his particular science, sees reason to distribute the animal or vegetable creation into certain groups rather than into any others, and he requires a name to bind, as it were, each of his groups together. It must not, however, be supposed that such names, when introduced, differ in any respect, as to their mode of signification, from other connotative names. The classes which they denote are, as much as any other classes, constituted by certain common attributes, and their names are significant of those attributes, and of nothing else. The names of Cuvier’s classes and orders, <b>Plantigrades,</b> Digitigrades, etc., are as much the expression of attributes as if those names had preceded, instead of grown out of, his classification of animals. The only peculiarity of the case is, that the convenience of classification was here the primary motive for introducing the names; while in other cases the name is introduced as a means of predication, and the formation of a class denoted by it is only an indirect consequence.|$|R
60|$|Sufficient {{evidence}} {{has now been}} advanced to prove that animals when first confined are eminently liable to suffer in their reproductive systems. We feel at first naturally inclined to attribute the result to loss of health, {{or at least to}} loss of vigour; but this view can hardly be admitted when we reflect how healthy, long-lived, and vigorous many animals are under captivity, such as parrots, and hawks when used for hawking, cheetahs when used for hunting, and elephants. The reproductive organs themselves are not diseased; and the diseases, from which animals in menageries usually perish, are not those which in any way affect their fertility. No domestic animal is more subject to disease than the sheep, yet it is remarkably prolific. The failure of animals to breed under confinement has been sometimes attributed exclusively to a failure in their sexual instincts: this may occasionally come into play, but there is no obvious reason why this instinct should be especially liable to be affected with perfectly tamed animals, except, indeed, indirectly through the reproductive system itself being disturbed. Moreover, numerous cases have been given of various animals which couple freely under confinement, but never conceive; or, if they conceive and produce young, these are fewer in number than is natural to the species. In the vegetable kingdom instinct of course can play no part; and we shall presently see that plants when removed from their natural conditions are affected in nearly the same manner as animals. Change of climate cannot be the cause of the loss of fertility, for, whilst many animals imported into Europe from extremely different climates breed freely, many others when confined in their native land are completely sterile. Change of food cannot be the chief cause; for ostriches, ducks, and many other animals, which must have undergone a great change in this respect, breed freely. Carnivorous birds when confined are extremely sterile, whilst most carnivorous mammals, except <b>plantigrades,</b> are moderately fertile. Nor can the amount of food be the cause; for a sufficient supply will certainly be given to valuable animals; {{and there is no reason}} to suppose that much more food would be given to them than to our choice domestic productions which retain their full fertility. Lastly, we may infer from the case of the elephant, cheetah, various hawks, and of many animals which are allowed to lead an almost free life in their native land, that want of exercise is not the sole cause.|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} what I {{have called the}} in direct action of changed conditions, namely, through the {{reproductive}} system of being affected, we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of this system being extremely sensitive to {{any change in the}} conditions, and partly from the similarity, as Kolreuter and others have remarked, between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even when the male and female unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in their native country! This is generally, but erroneously attributed to vitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered that a very trifling change, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds. I cannot here give the details which I have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, {{with the exception of the}} <b>plantigrades</b> or bear family, which seldom produce young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, breeding freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I may add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions--for instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches--showing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.|$|R
2500|$|The {{basic form}} of the {{vertebrate}} foot has five toes, however some animals will have evolved fewer than this, and some early tetrapods had more; Acanthostega had eight toes.

Most vertebratesthe amphibians, the reptiles, and some mammals such as humans and bearsare <b>plantigrade,</b> walking on {{the whole of the}} underside of the foot. [...] Many mammals, such as cats and dogs are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement.

A few mammals are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Knuckle-walking allows the foot (hand) to specialise for food gathering and/or climbing, as with the great apes and the extinct chalicotheres, or for swimming, as with the platypus. In animals where feet have evolved into functional hands, hand walking is also possible.|$|E

60|$|It {{has been}} disputed at what period of life {{the causes of}} variability, {{whatever}} they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception. Geoffroy St. Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined {{to suspect that the}} most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception. Several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the function of the reproductive system; this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the organisation, to the action of any change in the conditions of life. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even in the many cases when the male and female unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though living long under not very close confinement in their native country! This is generally attributed to vitiated instincts; but how many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few such cases it has been discovered that very trifling changes, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed. I cannot here enter on the copious details which I have collected on {9} this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may just mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, {{with the exception of the}} <b>plantigrades</b> or bear family; whereas carnivorous birds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature, perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not quite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents.|$|R
