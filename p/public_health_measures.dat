25|$|<b>Public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> are {{credited}} {{with much of}} the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic starting around that time the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} it was not known that this fatal disease was carried by mosquitoes, so <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> were unsuccessful. Remaining in the city to care for the sick, a number of Catholic Franciscan Sisters of Mary, Episcopalian nuns of the Sisterhood of St. Mary and clergymen sacrificed themselves. An {{epidemic}} also broke out in 1879, in which several hundred people died. So many people died or fled the epidemics that in 1879 Memphis lost its city charter and went bankrupt. Until 1893 Memphis was governed by the state as a Taxing District.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{is through}} <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> such as not {{handling}} dead animals {{in areas where}} plague is common. Vaccines have not {{been found to be}} very useful for plague prevention. Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline. Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected. Death, if it occurs, is typically within ten days. With treatment the risk of death is around 10%. Globally there are about 650 documented cases a year which result in ~120 deaths. The disease is most common in Africa.|$|E

Notwithstanding its world-wide recognition as a safe, efficient and cost-effective <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measure,</b> water fluoridation has increasingly found itself in the sociopolitical arena. Factors responsible for preventing the implementation of water fluoridation include public sensitivity, anti-fluoridation campaigns, negative reporting by the media, public debates and lack of professional involvement. Successful implementation of water fluoridation can only be achieved by a purposeful national strategy, active communication and involvement by all concerned. Publisher’s versio...|$|R

25|$|Average heights {{showed little}} change {{until the second}} quarter of the 19th century, with the Industrial Revolution. The growth of canals, steamboats, and railways, as well as the public school system, mass immigration, and urbanization, {{increased}} exposure to diseases. Food prices rose in the 1830s, and industrialization brought along with it growing wealth inequality and business depressions that further worsened the situations of the poor. As a result, average stature and life expectancy declined, and only rebounded from 1910 to 1950, as incomes rose, urban conditions became less crowded, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> were put in place.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{molecular}} diagnostic {{tools are}} another technological advancement {{that could help}} improve existing prevalence statistics. Recent {{research has focused on}} the development of a DNA-based tool {{that can be used for}} diagnosis of infection, specific identification of hookworm, and analysis of genetic variability in hookworm populations. Again this can serve as a major tool for different <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> against hookworm infection. Most research regarding diagnostic tools is now focused on the creation of a rapid and cost-effective assay for the specific diagnosis of hookworm infection. Many are hopeful that its development can be achieved within the next 5 years.|$|E

25|$|There {{have also}} been recent {{technological}} developments that will hopefully facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence. Some researchers have begun to use geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology. Brooker et al. utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of sub-Saharan Africa. By relating satellite derived environmental data with prevalence data from school-based surveys, {{they were able to}} create detailed prevalence maps. The study focused {{on a wide range of}} helminths, but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found. As compared to other helminths, hookworm is able to survive in much hotter conditions and was highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range. Hopefully this information along with more detailed prevalence maps can lead to more effective <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known works on the history of HIV is 1987's book And the Band Played On, by Randy Shilts. Shilts contends that Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to spread {{and hundreds of thousands of}} people to needlessly die. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power by Larry Kramer. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} a city of extreme social {{inequality}} between the so-called 'millocracy' and the workers; Elizabeth Gaskell once described an acquaintance attending a ball wearing £400 of lace and £10,000 in diamonds. The Gaskell family moved between the two worlds, allowing Gaskell not only to collect charitable subscriptions from their wide circle and promote longer-lasting changes from within the local bureaucracy, but also to understand the real concerns of those living in poverty, with whom he was probably more at ease. In 1833 he helped to found the non-denominational Manchester Domestic Home Mission, and he acted as its secretary for many years. Inspired by a visit from Boston minister Joseph Tuckerman, the mission gave practical assistance such as food and blankets to the poor. He {{was also a}}ctive in the District Provident Society, an organisation founded by James Kay and William Langton with similar pragmatic aims. Gaskell supported <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> and housing reform, sitting on the committee of the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, as well as another committee formed to regulate beer halls in the area.|$|E

2500|$|Ehrlich's {{approach}} of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring {{the effects of}} these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists, including Bayer scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk. [...] This work, also based in the testing of compounds available from the German dye industry, {{led to the development of}} Prontosil, the first representative of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics. [...] Compared to arsphenamine, the sulfonamides had a broader spectrum of activity and were far less toxic, rendering them useful for infections caused by pathogens such as streptococci. In 1939, Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery.

2500|$|There is {{continued}} {{disagreement over}} what [...] "innate" [...] and [...] "subluxation" [...] mean to chiropractic. Some chiropractors believe in Innate Intelligence, a faith-based, unscientific belief {{which has been}} a source of derision for chiropractors. Chiropractors historically were strongly opposed to vaccination based on their belief that all diseases were traceable to causes in the spine, and therefore could not be affected by vaccines; D.D. Palmer wrote, [...] "It is the very height of absurdity to strive to 'protect' any person from smallpox or any other malady by inoculating them with a filthy animal poison." [...] Many chiropractors continue to hold antivaccine views, despite vaccination being one of [...] "the most effective <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> of all time." [...] Early opposition to water fluoridation included chiropractors in the U.S. Some chiropractors oppose water fluoridation as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Although most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects, antivaccination sentiment is espoused by what appears to be a minority of chiropractors. Recently, other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health.|$|E
