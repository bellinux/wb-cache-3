40|$|For many homogeneously-broadened {{solid-state}} lasers, enforcing unidirectional {{operation of}} a ring laser can be both a convenient and efficient route to a reliable single frequency output. One attractive way to enforce unidirectional operation, first demonstrated for Ti:sapphire [1] and dye ring lasers [1],[2], {{is to use a}} travelling-wave acousto-optic modulator. This technique offers the advantages that it does not rely on <b>polarisation</b> <b>discrimination,</b> unlike the Faraday isolator approach, and requires only one additional intracavity component, so is well suited for use in low-gain, miniature diode-pumped solid-state lasers [3],[4]...|$|E
40|$|Restricted Access. We {{introduce}} here {{a scheme}} for two-dimensional imaging {{of an object}} hidden in a turbid medium using a low power continuous wave source and report its practical implementation. As already known, periodic polarisation modulation of an input continuous wave and subsequent <b>polarisation</b> <b>discrimination</b> enables {{the separation of the}} ballistic signal from the diffuse light. In the present work, this is achieved by modulating the input polarisation, recording a sequence of spatially filtered images using a CCD camera, and Fourier transforming the time sequence to extract the periodic ballistic signal. With this technique we have achieved sub-millimeter resolution imaging in scattering media that are more than 30 transport mean free paths thick...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present some}} {{experimental}} and theoretical results for {{a selection of}} two layered dichroic panels. This serves to illustrate the additional problems caused by evanescent mode coupling in such multiple layer configurations, and some methods of reducing these effects. The FSS considered are all arrays of simple dipole slots. These elements offer the advantage of simplicity in construction and in basis function representation in modal analysis. They give a passband transmission characteristic and have potential applications where their <b>polarisation</b> <b>discrimination</b> is an asset. They suffer, however, from consequences of their high resonant wavelength relative to their unit cell size. Some higher order modes are only weakly evanescent {{in the vicinity of}} the passband, resulting in detrimental consequences. This situation can occur with other commonly used array geometries, particularly multiple loop elements (double square loops, concentric rings) where the inner loops are, effectively, widely space...|$|E
40|$|The eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has {{experienced}} constant instability and conflict since 1996. With {{the collapse of}} the state of Zaire and the renaming of the country by the late Laurent Desire Kabila in late 1996, there were high expectations from the Congolese population that the country was going to move forward. However, in less than two years, the central government in Kinshasa was facing a new rebellion from the east of the country, followed by widespread violence and criminal activities by armed and militia groups. Although military intervention from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola halted the rebellion march to Kinshasa, the capital city of DRC, and allowed the DRC government to sign peace agreement with its opponents in 2002; since then, the prospect of peace in the eastern DRC, especially the North and South Kivus seems bleak. Since 2002, that region has been the theatre of armed and militia groups (both local and foreign), owing to, in the views of various experts, the presence of mineral resources to support their criminal activities, as well as the economic interests of regional actors to create proxy militia and armed groups in the absence of central government in much of eastern DRC. The purpose and rationale {{of this study is to}} critically identify actors in the postconflict reconstruction process, and examine the role of mineral resources among other perpetuating factors of the protracted conflict in eastern DRC, in order to arrive at a comprehensive analysis of the reasons for the failure of peace building and post-conflict reconstruction processes that have been undertaken. This study aims to fill a gap in available literature, by pointing to some conflict drivers and factors which have previously been overlooked in post-conflict reconstruction, and in existing research on the topic, especially the role of mineral resources in sustaining conflict. A thorough conceptualization of relevant conflict theory and a historical overview of the conflict in DRC were provided as a point of departure in order to understand other factors that contribute to the intractability of conflict in eastern DRC, this study found that those factors were rooted in the legacy of colonialism; the bad leadership under both the colonial powers and subsequent government of Joseph Mobutu, manipulation and politicization of ethnic identities especially in the South and North Kivu and the geopolitical location of the eastern DRC. This study further established that the presence of mineral resources in eastern DRC indeed contributes to the continued insecurity in that region by providing succour to armed groups, thus undermining peace agreements especially the Pretoria agreement that formally ended hostilities in 2002. Furthermore, the study found that the issue of mineral resources is not the sole driver of the eastern DRC conflict, as the issues of ethnic <b>polarisation</b> especially, <b>discrimination</b> against Kinyarwanda speaking Congolese in the east, and the view that only military means can solve this problem; coupled with other security threats including the presence of foreign militia groups motivate the neighbouring countries of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi to constantly meddle in DRC's internal affairs. The study suggests that additional research be conducted to further investigate the regional dimensions of the conflict and how perceived interests in mineral revenue contribute to the polarisation of the population in eastern DRC; leading to the proliferation of armed groups...|$|R
40|$|We {{study by}} means of {{experiments}} and Monte Carlo simulations, the scattering of light in random media, to determine the distance up to which photons travel along almost undeviated paths within a scattering medium, and are therefore capable of casting a shadow of an opaque inclusion embedded within the medium. Such photons are isolated by <b>polarisation</b> <b>discrimination</b> wherein the plane of linear polarisation of the input light is continuously rotated and the polarisation preserving component of the emerging light is extracted {{by means of}} a Fourier transform. This technique is a software implementation of lock-in detection. We find that images may be recovered to a depth far in excess of that predicted by the diffusion theory of photon propagation. To understand our experimental results, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to model the random walk behaviour of the multiply scattered photons. We present a. new definition of a diffusing photon in terms of the memory of its initial direction of propagation, which we then quantify in terms of an angular correlation function. This redefinition yields the penetration depth of the polarisation preserving photons. Based on these results, we have formulated a model to understand shadow formation in a turbid medium, the predictions of which are in good agreement with our experimental results...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the {{throughput}} of full-duplex cognitive communication radio which exploits unused band of primary user (PU) network. Classical cognitive radio uses half-duplex communication spectrum sensing to perform spectrum sensing and data transmission at different time intervals. It’s well-established fact that in half-duplex communication cognitive radio spectrum sensing time increases at low SNR which gives rise to lesser data transmission time for secondary user (SU) and hence results in less throughput for SU. It’s useful idea to do spectrum sensing and data transmission at the same time with two different antennas co-located on the SU transceiver. This shall not only guarantee high probability of detection of PU but also increased data transmission which means more throughput for SU. However, simultaneous sensing and data transmission has inherent problem of self-interference. One of the possible solution is to use <b>polarisation</b> <b>discrimination</b> in which sensing and data transmission antennas must use different polarisation. This is feasible if there is prior information about the polarisation of the signals emitted by the PUs. It shall be of special interest to assess throughput using analytical expressions for probability of detection PD, probability of false alarm PFA at various values of SNR for time-slotted cognitive radio which uses half-duplex spectrum sensing and non-time-slotted cognitive radio which uses full-duplex communication cognitive radio...|$|E
