40|$|Parking {{space in}} city centres is scarce. Creating it {{underground}} is an option, {{but this may}} be socially unfeasible, considering for example risks with respect to conservation of historical architecture. Besides, the presence of cars in city centres is socially becoming more undesirable. However, city centres are to be accessible as much possible. Creating parking spaces under water with a good connection to an urban environment or adjacent to an urban environment might be an option to solve this paradox. Considering the problem in general, the question is: Is it technically feasible to build a parking garage under water? Besides, {{an investigation into the}} costs of such a parking garage needs to be done. Investments in under water parking garages will only be made if costs are retrieved or, better, if there is a potential for profit. Considering this, the question is: Is it economically feasible to build a parking garage under a river? First, a description is given of the operational process in parking garages in general. Taking the main aspects of the operational process into account, an optimal configuration of parking space in the interior <b>parking</b> <b>floor</b> has been obtained. This forms the base of the interior garage design. Several construction methods have been taken into consideration for realization of parking space under water. Consequently, for one construction method the feasibility has been investigated. Construction of prefab tunnel alike elements to be immersed for the purpose of parking space seems an option. Since this is an innovative concept, this method was chosen for further investigation. Therefore, a case study has been carried out. The designs made for feasibility have been based on global dimensioning. Based on this global dimensioning, realizing a parking structure under water appears to be technically feasible in general. Based on global dimensions, realizing a parking structure under water in Beverwijk {{does not appear to be}} economically feasible for a (wished) parking tarriff of 1, 50 per hour. The designed garage appears to be feasible with a parking tarriff of at least 1, 86 (in 2008). It is to be doubted that a parking tarriff of 1, 86 is accepted in Beverwijk, so in Beverwijk the designed garage seems not to be feasible. In larger cities, a tarriff of 1, 86 would be commonly accepted in 2008, so for larger cities in the Netherlands the concept is economically feasible. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
