In India's closed market, Maruti received {{the right to}} import 40,000 fully built-up Suzukis {{in the first two}} years, and even after that the early goal was to use only 33% indigenous parts. This upset the local manufacturers considerably. There were also some concerns that the Indian market was too small to absorb the comparatively large production planned by Maruti Suzuki, with the government even considering adjusting the petrol tax and lowering the excise duty in order to boost sales.

40|$|As Prof Fujiya Morishita points out, the {{characteristics}} of the development in marketing after the second world War are represented in the following two phases: first, the integration of marketing activities such as <b>product</b> <b>planning,</b> advertising, sales promotion, sales channels, sales prices, and marketing research into a marketing management; second, the conversion of general management's over-all plans for business from production oriented to marketing oriented, in other word the appearance of managerial marketing. According to the changes in character of marketing, what functions does <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> have to accomplish in the area marketing as a whole, and further more what meaning does product plaining bear to the over-all plans for business? In this paper, I am trying to deal with these problems by revealing the modern character of <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> through the changes of its concept from {{the beginning of this century}} to the present and by investigating the differences between product differentiation and market segmentation policies, both of which form important contents of <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> for the firms seeking to establish their own markets. The development of the concept of <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> is closely related to that of marketing. B tracing it in the course of marketing development, especially in the United States, I can count the following specific characters of today's <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> 1. <b>Product</b> <b>planning</b> is involved in the comprehensive marketing management and established under the coordination with other components of marketing. This is caused by the business intention to get marketing: more speedy. And such, phase of <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> may be called under the name of "short range". 2. Because the modern, marketing is understood as managerial, and that it has become "marketing for the innovation in production", <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> also must involve the problem to coordinate with, the long run equipment and investment plan for innovation. This phase of <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> may be called "long range". I believe, in this sense, that <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> must be promoted up to the level of top-management, because such adjustment between <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> and long range business plans can be properly solved by top-management only. On the other hand, it can be stated that in the <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> strategies, market segmentation must be more emphasized than product differentiation. This mainly comes from the fact that the state of monopoly or non-price competition by means of product differentiation has been changing into monopolistic competition involving quality and price as variables by means of market segmentation B ere again the coordination between <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> which demands the heterogeneity and diversity of product and innovation of technical production which requires its effective operation and long term security of its enormous equipment, is the one of the most important problems of <b>product</b> <b>planning.</b> This calls for the solution by top-management too. Finally I quoted the marketing planning process chart of General Electric Co, to examine the practices in the United States, but, it is difficult to find the needed facts. It will need much more investigation into practical cases to make sure these inferences are working further investigation concerning this will be made under a separate article...|$|R

40|$|Indeed, {{strategies}} for product diversification have currently become {{the center of}} widespread interest among business executives {{as a means of}} market adjustment. It goss without saying that the <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> in an enterprise is to determine the characteristics of products that meet best with desires of ultimate consumers or users-the characteristics that add marketability to products-and to incorporate these characteristics into finished goods. We find, however, the word "merchandising" which has been used almost synonymously with "product planning" when we trace the history of marketing development. In this article, firstly, the writer tries to make clear the meaning of these two words by investigating literatures on marketing. The writer believes that <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> has come to the fore instead of merchandising, because the former implies a close association of marketing with managerial viewpoint of manufacturers. It has become necessary for manufacturers to <b>plan</b> new <b>products</b> in order to meet and overcome competition. Thus, <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> as a means of non-price-competition is becoming {{one of the most important}} factors in management especially in an oligopolistic market-structure. The primary purpose of <b>planning</b> on <b>product</b> is to increase profits by enlarged sales volume. And an important way to increase sales volume is to add new products of to increase the variety of designs, styles, colors, qualities, sizes and so forth in the line of production. This is referred to just as product diversification technically. In general, a new product line may be created from one of the following three sources; 1) internal development, 2) product acquisition, 3) taking over other going business When top management of a firm consider diversification strategy, they must always bear in mind "the life-cycles" of all present product lines they are managing. In short, the writer attempts to characterize the function of <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> from both viewpoints of modern managerial marketing and of market structure. The writer goes on to conclude that <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> in an integrated consumer-oriented business is the first and the most importanfc of the staff departments, and that systematic program for diversification nmust be a continuing managerial function for top management.

50|$|Further {{financial}} difficulties at Mazda during the 1990s (partly caused by losses {{related to the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis) caused Ford to increase its stake to a 33.4-percent controlling interest in May 1996. In June 1996, Henry Wallace was appointed President, and he set about restructuring Mazda and setting it on a new strategic direction. He laid out a new direction for the brand including {{the design of the}} present Mazda marque; he laid out a new <b>product</b> <b>plan</b> to achieve synergies with Ford, and he launched Mazda's digital innovation program to speed up the development of new products. At the same time, he started taking control of overseas distributors, rationalized dealerships and manufacturing facilities, and driving much needed efficiencies and cost reductions in Mazda's operations. Much of his early work put Mazda back into profitability and laid the foundations for future success. Wallace was succeeded by James Miller in November 1997, followed in December 1999 by Ford executive Mark Fields, who has been credited with expanding Mazda's new product lineup and leading the turnaround during the early 2000s. Ford's increased influence during the 1990s allowed Mazda to claim another distinction in history, having maintained the first foreign-born head of a Japanese car company, Henry Wallace.|$|E
40|$|<b>Product</b> <b>planning</b> helps {{a company}} to {{strategically}} plan its current and future product platforms and offer product variants in the marketplace. Product platforming is widely touted as a successful strategy for mass cus-tomization. However, due diligence should be exercised before implement-ing any product platform strategy. The <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> exercise should account for future uncertainties. Traditional financial tools such as the net present value (NPV) are static since they do not compensate for any exoge-nous and endogenous uncertainties {{during the course of}} the project. The crux of the problem lies in the evaluation model that is used for evaluating the <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> projects. While many view uncertainties in a <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> project as problematic, it can also be viewed as a source of new opportunities. We argue that uncertainties should be an integral part of the evaluation model. If the future possibilities (or strategic options) are not considered in the evaluation model, a corporation may face a “myopic syndrome. ” In this article, we consider two important <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> decisions— platform decisions and product variant decisions. The platform decision involves strategic selection of a concept product platform from various pos-sible alternative concept product platforms.

50|$|InPhase Technologies is a {{technology}} company developing holographic storage devices and media, based in Longmont, Colorado. InPhase was spun out from Bell Labs in 2000 after recruiting two storage industry veterans, Steve Kitrosser (Digital Equipment Corporation, Maxtor, Maxoptics, Quinta, and Seagate) joined as Chairman, and Nelson Diaz (Digital Equipment Corporation, Seagate, StorageTek), with very strong operating experience, in particular high volume magnetic disk drive and tape drive manufacturing with very high quality. Their technology promised multiple terabyte storage. InPhase concentrated on applied research from 2001 to 2004 {{to understand what}} issues had to be addressed and solved {{in order to be}} able to deliver high volume storage media and drives with high reliability and high manufacturing yield. During this time frame, Stephen Socolof joined the Board of Directors representing New Venture Partners, and in late 2004 pushed the Inphase management team to get a product (a working disk drive and storage media) within one year; a number of the InPhase staff were surprised by this, and wrote a white paper explaining that the staff had tens of decades of experience in bringing digital storage products to market, and that based on where InPhase was at in product development in early 2005, it would require three to five years of additional engineering effort, in particular in manufacturing processes for storage media and drives, before InPhase could commence to sell prototype product to customers. This warning was ignored, and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said they would try to get a product out in a year, without telling any other investors. Nelson Diaz asked Demetri Lignos for a <b>product</b> <b>plan,</b> and Demetri responded with a rack mounted drive that would allow all the optics and light transmission to lie in a single two dimensional plane, enormously simplifying the manufacturing of such a product; Nelson Diaz rejected this because he had been told that StorageTek, his former employer, had a library that held five and a quarter inch form factor drives (in fact there is no such thing as a specification for a five and a quarter inch disk drive), but Demetri Lignos and his team attempted to develop a disk drive <b>product</b> <b>plan</b> that would fit into a StorageTek library and were NOT able to make all the optics and electronics fit, even thought light was following paths in THREE dimensions to complicate manufacturing, and the total length of the drive was twenty six inches). With this as prolog, Demetri Lignos elected to retire from InPhase (after having brought many digital storage products to market from raw technology), and surprise surprise, at the end of 2005, InPhase received additional funding led by New Venture Partners to get a product out within a year, having failed to do so in 2005. At the end of 2006, InPhase received additional funding led by New Venture Partners to get a product out within a year, having failed to do sin 2006. At the end of 2007, InPhase received additional funding led by New Venture Partners to get a product out within a year, having failed to do so in 2007. In April 2008 InPhase was scheduled to have a product launch at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) trade show in Las Vegas, NV, and at the show in the middle of the launch InPhase announced it did not have a viable product to sell to customers. In 2008 Stephen Socolof elected to shop InPhase and its extensive patent portfolio, but to no avail, and in 2009-2010 went through a financial restructuring resulting in Steve Socolof leaving the Board and all of the New Venture Partners preferred stock was purchased by Signal Lake.|$|E
