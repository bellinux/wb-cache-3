Both measures use European Structural Funds, but are managed at a regional level. Measure 2. 1 b, a concessional loan aiming at stimulating the introduction of innovative <b>plants,</b> <b>machinery</b> and <b>equipments,</b> had positive effects on investments, assets and sales in the short run; but there are hints that investments could have been anticipated from already scheduled projects in the following periods. Measure 2. 6 b, a free grant aiming at stimulating research activity of firms, had positive effects on intangible investments and capital, but this new knowledge {{does not seem to be}} able to directly impact on the production process of the firm. When evaluating the effect for specific groups of firms, for both measures we do not find stronger effects for firms characterized by a high intensity of subsidy. When considering firms with a high cost of capital, we find that Measure 2. 1 b significantly reduced the interest rate asked by the lenders also after the end of the project, while Measure 2. 6 b had not been effective at all. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{pursuit of}} its {{transition}} from a command to a market economy, post-Soviet Russia has witnessed enormous regional differences in economic growth rates. Moreover, the economic reforms implemented under this transition, while initiated at the federal level, have also differed markedly across regions, as regional governments have had considerable discretion over the implementation of reform policies in their jurisdictions. We exploit these differences in analyzing whether regional differences in reform policies can account for regional differences in growth rates, and conclude that to a considerable degree, they can. Most notably, we find that local-government privatization initiatives and regional-government initiatives to gain control over their capital stock (e. g. <b>plants,</b> <b>equipment,</b> <b>machinery</b> and social infrastructure) exhibit close correspondence {{with the formation of}} new legal enterprises, which in turn exhibits close correspondence with economic growth. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of different sources of financing (foreign capital, migrants’ remittances, and domestic banks intermediation) on economic development in Italy between 1861 and WWI.

Using IRF from a Cholesky identification structure of a VAR model and relying on an original dataset that combines the most recent series of several financial and economic aggregates, this paper shows that both international capital and domestic saving {{had a significant impact on}} investment, while remittances did not. Foreign capital was invested directly, but also via domestic banks, in particular the “German-style” universal banks. Finally, foreign and d omestic capital had different attitudes towards the types of investment (construction vs. <b>plant,</b> <b>machinery</b> and transport <b>equipment)</b> and industries they financed. Combined together, these results shed a new light on the process of economic development of Italy and, more generally, of peripheral economies in the age of the international gold standard...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the crucial}} factors to be {{considered}} {{during the process of}} valuation of <b>plant,</b> <b>machinery</b> and <b>equipment</b> (PME) is the depreciation factor. This {{is due to the fact}} that most PME have pre-determined economic life and majority of them are already in use. Most PME are subjected to at least three different types of depreciation which will affect the value of each PME. Hence, there is a dire need for the Valuer to be able to identify and quantify depreciation factors which should be done during the inspection of PME. Depreciation of PME could be in the form of physical obsolescence, economic obsolescence or functional (technological) obsolescence. Physical obsolescence (PO) is one of the categories of depreciation that affect PME most, due to wear and tear and exposure to the elements and specifically with regard to the climate of a particular country where PME is located. At present, it seems there is no standard procedure or a methodological approach to identify and quantify PO during the inspection. This paper concerns the identification and quantification of the PO. The preliminary study done among a group of valuers with different background found that, much guess work take place during the inspection itself. Further study needs to be done to eliminate this problem and perhaps to come up with a methodological approach to enable valuers to identify and quantify PO while carrying out the inspection of PME. The methodological approach will not only strengthen the basis on the depreciation given on PME but also a standardized format that can be used as part of the valuation process of PME where PO is part of the depreciation that needs to be considered. The approach once developed, will remove the guess work of identifying and quantifying of PO and hence giving the valuation reports added credibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{outcome of}} this Report {{suggests}} there is strong viability {{for the establishment of}} a 60, 000 tonne p. a. (raw material input) biodiesel plant. A plant of this size would provide an annual output (at full production levels) of 59. 7 m litres of biodiesel, 6. 12 m kilograms of crude glycerine, and 1, 320 tonnes of fertiliser (potassium sulphate). This would result in a gross annual sales turnover of 47. 443 m, with the majority of this income derived from biodiesel fuel (43. 027 m), and to a lesser extent, glycerine (4. 284 m). The total capital requirement for the plant is 21. 307 m, of which 20. 0 m is the estimated cost of the building, <b>plant,</b> <b>machinery</b> and <b>equipment</b> and associated ancillaries. The land is assumed to be available to the Project at zero cost. The balance of 1. 307 m is required for working capital. The above capital requirement would be offset by a Federal Government Subsidy of 9. 552 m which is based on a grant of 0. 16 per litre biodiesel output. This is in line with a recent announcement by the Federal Government. Whilst this subsidy is not "make-or-brea" for the Project, it does nevertheless considerably mitigate financial risk and improves overall return ensuring the Project is very likely to succeed. However, with a rebate production quantity limitation applicable to the subsidy, it will be the initial renewable fuel producers whom are able to quickly establish themselves that will be able to take full advantage of this offer. The net amount of capital to be sourced by the Project’s proponents is therefore 11. 755 m. Without the government subsidy, the IRR reduces to 37. 66...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{surge in}} the stock market has called {{attention}} to movements in the underlying rate of profit. Over the last decade and a half, profitability in the total private sector has trended upward, and by 1997, according to some definitions, it was coming close to its postwar peak of the mid- 1960 s. Even in the corporate business sector, the average rate of return earned on the value of its <b>plant,</b> <b>machinery,</b> and <b>equipment,</b> valued at current cost, declined from a postwar high of 17 percent in 1950 to under 5 percent in 1986 but has since risen to 9. 6 percent in 1997. The crude evidence does suggest that stock prices are linked to corporate profitability. While corporate profitability remained high, from the late 1940 s through the late 1960 s, the S&P 500 index, deflated to 1995 dollars, increased rather steadily over time. As corporate profits slipped during the 1970 s until the early 1980 s, so did the S&P 500 index in real terms (both reached a low point in 1982). After 1982, both corporate profits and the S&P 500 index recovered quite strongly. Figure 1, for example, shows the annual change in the corporate profit rate together with the annual change in the S&P 500 index, deflated to 1995 dollars. The simple correlation between the two series from 1950 to 1997 is 0. 42. Movements in the rate of profit have long occupied Marxian economists. Marx himself argued that the rate of profit would tend to decline over the long run. His "law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall " states that over time the organic composition of capital (the ratio of capital valued in nominal terms to the wage bill) would rise, thereby causing the general rate of profit to fall (Capital, Vol. 3, Ch. 13). This law has been subject to criticism on theoretical ground...|$|R
