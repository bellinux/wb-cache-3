60|$|He {{began to}} gather the papers together, an action which {{suddenly}} recalled Louis to the recollection of Tom's cautions as to prudence and alertness, and {{he forced himself to}} a <b>prompt</b> <b>tone</b> of business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir," [...] was {{answered}} in that <b>prompt</b> <b>tone</b> of voice which indicates thorough discipline and unquestioning obedience, {{while the men}} scrambled up the fore-hatch, and sprang up the ratlines hand over hand. A moment before, the vessel had lain quietly on the bosom of the unruffled deep, {{as if she were}} asleep, now she was all uproar and apparent confusion; sails slewed round, ropes rattled, and blocks creaked, while the sonorous voice of the first mate sounded commands like a trumpet from the quarter-deck.|$|E

6000|$|In {{another part}} of the county we rise again gloriously in worldly consideration. We pass a cottage; a woman looks out after us, over the low garden wall, and rather hesitatingly calls us back. I {{approach}} her first, and am thus saluted: [...] "If you please, sir, what have you got to sell?" [...] Again, an old man meets us on the road, stops, cheerfully taps our knapsacks with his stick, and says: [...] "Aha! you're tradesmen, eh? things to sell? I say, have you got any tea" [...] (pronounced tay); [...] "I'll buy some tay!" [...] Further on, we approach a group of miners breaking ore. As we pass by, we hear one asking amazedly, [...] "What have they got to sell in those things on their backs?" [...] and another answering, in the <b>prompt</b> <b>tones</b> of a guesser who is convinced that he guesses right, [...] "Guinea-pigs!" ...|$|R
50|$|Bedhead's {{music was}} {{generally}} subdued, with a polyphonic sound {{based on the}} interlocking of single-line melodies played by three electric guitars and one electric bass guitar (often played with a capo), nearly always using clean (undistorted) <b>tones,</b> <b>prompting</b> comparisons to the Velvet Underground.|$|R
6000|$|Biddy {{got up at}} this, as if the accusatory <b>tone</b> <b>prompted</b> her {{to place}} herself generously at his side. [...] "Mightn't you go and order lunch--in that place, you know?" [...] she asked of her mother. [...] "Then we'd come back when it was ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what,' said Ethelberta in the <b>prompt</b> and broadly-awake <b>tone</b> {{of one who}} had been {{concentrated}} on the expectation of that sound for a length of time, 'it was a mistake in me to do this! Joey will be sure to make a muddle of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the truth}} and easily proved," [...] Tallente retorted. [...] "When peace came, however, Miller's party altered their tactics and the hatchet {{was to have been}} buried. My article was {{directed}} against the trades unions as they were at that time, not as they are to-day, and I still claim that if public opinion had not driven them into an arrangement with the Government, my article would have been published and would have done good. To publish it now could answer no useful purpose. Its application is gone and the conditions which <b>prompted</b> its <b>tone</b> disappeared." ...|$|R
60|$|Full of this idea, he took {{a careful}} {{observation}} of the compass, the sun, and surrounding nature; laid his course for the baker's shop, which {{was on the right}} side of the village, and walked straight into the butcher's, which lay on its left extremity. He was so much put out on lifting his eyes to those of the butcher, that he ordered a leg of mutton and six pounds of beefsteaks on the spot. The moment after, he recollected that two legs of mutton and a round of beef had been forwarded to the White House by coach the day before, and that there was a poached brace of moor-fowl in the larder at that moment; but, having given the order in a <b>prompt,</b> business <b>tone</b> of voice, he felt that he lacked moral courage to rescind it.|$|R
5000|$|As Betty {{talks to}} Hilda {{about what has}} {{happened}} at work when she starts to believe that Wilhelmina is giving her a hard time, Hilda watches Bobby spill spaghetti on the floor and is starting to get moody around him. This would <b>prompt</b> Bobby to <b>tone</b> down Hilda by pampering her now that she is expecting, so later on at her beauty shop he tells Hilda that he will put her on a what he calls a [...] "Hilda Week", in which they get a chance to spend sometime together. Hilda accepts, as witnessed and encouraged by a customer.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2006, McArthur and Expedition 13 flight officer Jeffrey Williams {{tested a}} new method of {{preparing}} for spacewalks by [...] "camping out" [...] or spending {{the night in the}} Quest airlock, the decompression capsule through which astronauts enter and exit space. In the chamber the pressure was reduced from the normal 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) to 10.2 psi. The more commonly used method {{of preparing for}} spacewalks involves breathing pure oxygen for several hours to purge the body of nitrogen and avoid the bends. The [...] "campout" [...] method was intended to shorten that lengthy preparation time. Four hours into their sleep an error <b>tone</b> <b>prompted</b> mission controllers to cut short the activity, though it was still deemed a success.|$|R
5000|$|Igbo {{slaves were}} known to have {{committed}} mass suicides, not only for rebellion, but in the belief their spirits will return to their motherland. In a publication of a 1791 issue of Massachusetts Magazine, an anti-slavery poem was published called Monimba, which depicted a fictional pregnant Igbo slave who committed suicide on a slave ship bound for Jamaica. The poem {{is an example of}} the stereotype of Igbo slaves in the Americas. Igbo slaves were also distinguished physically by a prevalence of [...] "yellowish" [...] skin <b>tones</b> <b>prompting</b> the colloquialisms [...] "red eboe" [...] used to describe people with light skin tones and African features. Igbo people were hardly reported to have been maroons, although Igbo women were paired with Coromantee (Akan) men so as to subdue the latter due to the idea that Igbo women were bound to their first-born sons' birthplace.|$|R
40|$|Our {{motor and}} perceptual {{representations}} of actions {{seem to be}} intimately linked and the human mirror neuron system (MNS) has been proposed as the mediator. In two experiments, we presented biological or non-biological movement stimuli that were either congruent or incongruent to a required response <b>prompted</b> by a <b>tone.</b> When the tone occurred {{with the onset of}} the last movement in a series, i. e., it was perceived during the movement presentation, congruent biological stimuli resulted in faster reaction times than congruent non-biological stimuli. The opposite was observed for incongruent stimuli. When the tone was presented after visual movement stimulation, however, no such interaction was present. This implies that biological movement stimuli only affect motor behaviour during visual processing but not thereafter. These data suggest that the MNS is an “online” system; longstanding repetitive visual stimulation (Experiment 1) has no benefit in comparison to only one or two repetitions (Experiment 2) ...|$|R
5000|$|Quest {{provides}} {{an environment where}} astronauts can [...] "camp out" [...] before a spacewalk in a reduced-nitrogen atmosphere to purge nitrogen from their bloodstream and avoid decompression sickness in the low-pressure (...) pure-oxygen atmosphere of the spacesuit. [...] The previous method of preparing for spacewalks involved breathing pure oxygen for several hours prior to an EVA to purge the body of nitrogen. In April 2006, Expedition 12 Commander Bill McArthur and Expedition 13 flight engineer Jeffrey Williams tested a new method of preparing for spacewalks by [...] "camping out", or spending the night, in the Quest Airlock. In the chamber, the pressure was reduced from the normal [...] Four hours into the Expedition 13 crew's sleep period, an error <b>tone</b> <b>prompted</b> mission controllers to cut short the activity, but the test was still deemed a success. American spacewalk activities thereafter have employed the [...] "camp-out" [...] pre-breathing technique.|$|R
5|$|With Piper's departure, Paul McDermott, who {{performed}} {{at one of}} DAAS's regular clubs, was invited to join. He accepted, {{although he did not}} like their material, which he considered too sweet. Fidler says McDermott changed the group's dynamic; he wrote the majority of their songs and <b>prompted</b> a darker <b>tone.</b> After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, where they based themselves with a regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe. Initially DAAS found that Melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive, with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on Fidler's naturally happy but stupid character. They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987, to sold out crowds.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{diagnoses of}} Morgan, House ridicules Kutner about his superstitious nature, and tests him with {{classics}} {{such as the}} umbrella indoors and walking under a ladder. House goes {{as far as to}} fake an illness. Towards the end of the episode, House sits down at his desk to build a toy car track similar to the one he was working on in the opening sequence, only to spring up upon realizing his chair is soaked with urine. House orders Kutner to pay for the dry cleaning and storms out, leading Thirteen to question why Kutner is still alive after a prank like that, and to marvel at the fact that he got the cat to urinate on the chair. As he walks out, Kutner replies, [...] "Yeah. A cat." [...] His ironic <b>tone</b> <b>prompts</b> Thirteen to realize that it was Kutner's own urine on House's chair much to Thirteen's own disgust.|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of serially-ordered auditory-verbal short-term memory (AVSTM) {{is sensitive to}} {{the timing of the}} material to be stored, and both temporal processing and AVSTM capacity are implicated in the development of language. We developed a novel “rehearsal-probe” task to investigate the relationship between temporal precision and the capacity to remember serial order. Participants listened to a sub-span sequence of spoken digits and silently rehearsed the items and their timing during an unfilled retention interval. After an unpredictable delay, a <b>tone</b> <b>prompted</b> report of the item being rehearsed at that moment. An initial experiment showed cyclic distributions of item responses over time, with peaks preserving serial order and broad, overlapping tails. The spread of the response distributions increased with additional memory load and correlated negatively with participants’ auditory digit spans. A second study replicated the negative correlation and demonstrated its specificity to AVSTM by controlling for differences in visuo-spatial STM and nonverbal IQ. The results are consistent with the idea that a common resource underpins both the temporal precision and {{capacity of}} AVSTM. The rehearsal-probe task may provide a valuable tool for investigating links between temporal processing and AVSTM capacity in the context of speech and language abilities...|$|R
30|$|Subjects {{reached with}} their right (dominant) hand to their unseen left target-hand (Figure  2 c). Each session {{began with the}} left target-hand at the bottom-center target-hand {{location}} (Figure  2 b). Subjects first reached with their right hand/index finger to the felt location of the left target-hand in this initial location. A tone indicated to subjects’ that they made contact with the touch screen. Subjects then returned their right reaching-hand {{to the right of}} their body and actively pushed the robotic manipulandum using their left target-hand (guided along the robot-constrained pathway, illustrated as a yellow rectangle in Figure  2 c) from this starting location to one of the five remaining target sites. Once the left target-hand arrived at its final location, a <b>tone</b> <b>prompted</b> subjects to once again reach to the left target-hand at this new target site, making contact with the touch screen with the index finger of their right hand (Figure  2 c). Subjects then returned their right reaching-hand to the right of their body, and the left target-hand was actively guided to the next final target-hand location. Therefore, the final position of the left-target hand for each reach trial served as the starting position of the left target-hand for the subsequent trial. To limit proprioceptive drift, the left target-hand began in the bottom-center start location twice as many times as in any other starting position. On 50 % of these trials, the left target-hand was illuminated using three white light emitting diodes (LEDs), and was therefore visible, for 1  s (Wann and Ibrahim 1992; Desmurget et al. 2000; Brown et al. 2003). The illumination of the target-hand in this bottom-center location occurred prior to reach onset of the right hand. The left target-hand was not illuminated in any other location in this task. Trials in which the left target-hand was visible in the bottom-center location {{were not included in the}} analysis.|$|R
