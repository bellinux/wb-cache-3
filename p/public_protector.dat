Five days before the election, the Electoral Court postponed the inquiry into her conduct until 2 June 2014, as it {{would not be able to}} rule on the matter before the 7 May election date. On 18 June, the Electoral Court recommended Tlakula's removal from office due to financial misconduct. Tlakula resigned as IEC chairperson on 1 September after an unsuccessful application to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal the Electoral Court ruling.|$|E

25|$|Zuma {{has faced}} {{significant}} legal challenges. He {{was charged with}} rape in 2005, but was acquitted. He fought a long legal battle over allegations of racketeering and corruption, resulting from his financial advisor Schabir Shaik's conviction for corruption and fraud. On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority dropped the charges, citing political interference, although the decision was successfully challenged by opposition parties, and the charges are now before the NPA for reconsideration. After extensive state-funded upgrades to his rural homestead at Nkandla, the <b>Public</b> <b>Protector</b> found that Zuma had benefited improperly from the expenditure, and the Constitutional Court unanimously held in 2016's Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly that Zuma had failed to uphold the country's constitution, resulting in calls for his resignation and a failed impeachment attempt in the National Assembly.|$|E

Vote DA on 7 May to beat corruption. Together for change." [...] The ANC submitted an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court to stop distribution of the text message {{on the grounds that}} it violated the Electoral Act. On 4 April, the court ruled that the wording of the message was fair comment and dismissed the ANC's application with costs. The ANC was granted leave to appeal the decision. On 6 May, the Electoral Court ruled that the DA must retract the text message, finding that it wrongly targeted Zuma personally instead of the systematic failures highlighted in Madonsela's report. The court case was ultimately won by the DA when the Constitutional Court set aside the Electoral Court ruling on 19 January 2015.|$|E

2500|$|The ANC has {{a growing}} list of {{constitutional}} failures. One of the most prominent relates to president of the ANC and of the Republic, Jacob Zuma, and his Nkandla homestead's security upgrades, valued at around R250 million. His swimming pool, for example, was termed a 'fire pool' and his amphitheatre an 'emergency meeting point', thus leaving the taxpayer to carry the costs. After the <b>Public</b> <b>Protector</b> released her report (Secure in Comfort) which found that Zuma must pay back the money spent on the non-security features, he refused to do so. In 2016 the Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma, as well as the National Assembly, had [...] "breached the Constitution" [...] and failed to uphold it. Zuma apologised to the nation as follows: “The matter has caused a lot of frustration and confusion for which I apologise on my behalf and on behalf of government.” However he claimed not to have asked nor known about the non-security upgrades, despite the media reporting on them almost daily.|$|E

Legal commentators condemned these claims as serious misrepresentations of the judgment. They pointed out that it could not possibly have been the case, as Zuma claimed, that he was merely adopting the High Court's approach to the powers of the <b>Public</b> <b>Protector</b> in its DA v SABC judgment, because that was handed down six weeks after Zuma signaled his intention not to comply with her report.

The President suggested to <b>Public</b> <b>protector</b> that she had failed to comply with the 30 day period and to report that the investigation was ongoing and whether the process was justifiable. The President and his lawyers tried to negate the validity of the investigation by requiring the <b>Public</b> <b>protector</b> to indicate whether President had the power to condone any non-compliance.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} between South African President Jacob Zuma and his family, and the Guptas, possibly the richest family of Indian origin at present in South Africa, has made persistent national and increasingly international {{headlines in the}} media {{over the past few}} years. The Gupta family, who arrived in South Africa from India just prior to the country’s first non-racial democratic elections in 1994, are accused of colluding with Zuma in the removal and appointment of government ministers, as well as the directors of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in order to secure lucrative state contracts. This article examines the allegedly corrupt {{relationship between}} the Zumas and the Guptas to probe key issues in post-apartheid South African society: corruption, state capture, inequality, class formation, Black Economic Empowerment, and White Monopoly Capital. It argues that corruption has negative consequences such as creating despondency amongst the populace leading to capital flight and creating the possibilities for state capture as well as further deepening inequality.

Under the current format of the Bill, the MO is likely to become the Minister’s mouthpiece. It would deepen and marginalise military complainants’ hope of finding a remedy in an independent structure capable of challenging some of the questionable military acts or omissions that have no substance while not achieving the exercise, enjoyment and fulfilment of military complainants’ human rights in accordance with the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. </p...|$|R

On 10 September 2014, five opposition parties, including the Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters, stated that they planned to submit a {{motion of no confidence}} in Mbete, and claimed that she could not simultaneously serve as chairwoman of the ANC and as Speaker of the National Assembly. A debate held in Parliament on 16 September resulted in the motion being rejected by 234 votes to none. This was a result of opposition parties collectively walking out of the house after the ANC tried to change the vote into one of confidence in Mbete instead. Mbete has faced accusations, {{over the course of several}} years, that she is biased in favour of the ANC and a puppet of President Zuma.
