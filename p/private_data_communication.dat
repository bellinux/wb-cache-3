Through this project we have configured five branches of a company with their respective headquarters. In the North region we have configured two branches i. e. Delhi and Chandigarh with their headquarters named, the North Headquarter. In the South region we have configured three branches i. e. Bangalore, Chennai and Pune with their headquarters named, the South Headquarter. Sub Netting has been done across all the branches which relieve us if purchasing new IP addresses for all the branches. This will help in the reduction of cost. All the branches are divided into three departments that are: Marketing, Sales and Finance. Virtual Private Network (VPN) connectivity is applied in order to conduct <b>private</b> <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> which uses the public network like the Internet rather than rely on private leased lines. We have also configured the Virtual LAN as a security measure. VLAN (Virtual LAN) will allow only the same departments of different branches {{to communicate with each}} other. It makes sure that no person from one department accesses the other department, thus providing security. We have also configured the Access Control List (ACL) which denies the services mentioned in the list...|$|E

In addition to text messages, Facebook and Google+ offer video chats as another type of <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> <b>data.</b> Facebook also has the poking feature mentioned in Section 4. The only way of privately contacting another user on Instagram is to use Instagram Direct, a feature that was introduced in December 2013, and disclose a photo or video item only for that particular person.

In order to illustrate their limitations in detail, in Figure 5, we show their inability to map some of Facebook’s data types (i.e., no suitable data type exists in their taxonomies). Data types that cannot be mapped into the taxonomy introduced by Schneier [23] are marked with 1), while those that cannot be mapped into the taxonomies introduced by Årnes et al.[29] and Beye et al. [28] are marked with 2) and 3), respectively. For instance, Schneier’s taxonomy [23] can be criticized {{for not being able}} to cover login data, connection data, extended profile data, ratings/interests, network data, contextual data, disseminated <b>data,</b> and <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> <b>data.</b> The work presented by Årnes et al. [29] improves on this but still does not feature any equivalents for login data, disseminated <b>data,</b> and <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> <b>data.</b> The taxonomy of Beye et al. [28] has shortcomings related to its insufficient definitions of login credentials as well as behavioral information and, additionally, is missing an equivalent for application data. Although it is possible to map the data types related to 1 : n communication and private communication into the categories proposed by Beye et al. [28], a lot of privacy-relevant information is lost when treating all of them simply under the general term Messages.|$|R
40|$|Recently, mobile {{devices such}} as {{smartphones}} and tablets have {{emerged as one of}} the most popular forms of communication. This trend raises the question about the security of the <b>private</b> <b>data</b> and <b>communication</b> of the people using those devices. With increased computational resources and versatility the number of security threats on such devices is growing rapidly.

30|$|Taking a bird’s-eye view on our taxonomy, {{it becomes}} clear that the data types {{classified}} differ in the privacy risks they are accompanied with. <b>Private</b> <b>communication</b> <b>data,</b> for instance, is obviously not privacy critical as long as the communication partner is known and trusted. Disclosed data, in contrast, can be critical since one may easily lose track of who is able to read the content. Furthermore, permissions or social graph structures could change over time. As a result, a user could suddenly see messages that were originally not visible to him. In order to make the privacy relevance quantitatively measurable, a privacy relevance metric (PRM) is needed.|$|R

Examples include private messages with or without attachments, private video chats as well as smaller interactions such as poking other users. <b>Private</b> <b>communication</b> <b>data</b> is not accompanied with privacy risks as long as the communication partner can be trusted, the OSN security mechanisms prevent third parties from gaining access, and the OSN service provider does not inspect the messages to an extent greater than roughly scanning them for illegal content.|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>private</b> <b>data</b> is ubiquitous. On one hand, people {{submit their}} <b>private</b> <b>data</b> to obtain services. On the other hand, {{organizations}} need <b>private</b> <b>data</b> {{to carry out}} their business. Characterized by convenience, efficiency and cost-saving, information systems are useful for <b>private</b> <b>data</b> management. As a result, vast amounts of <b>private</b> <b>data</b> are collected and processed electronically. However, inadequate protection may end up with the abuse of <b>private</b> <b>data.</b> Privacy concerns affect people’s attitude towards providing their <b>private</b> <b>data,</b> which restricts the success of organizations’ business. The importance of privacy control is well recognized today. Privacy control should be regarded as an imperative design criterion for information systems [40]. The common ground between privacy and security allows us to develop privacy protection techniques based on existing security protection techniques. In the past decade, a few studies have been conducted in this area. Nevertheless, they give individuals limited control over their <b>private</b> <b>data.</b> In particular, after an individual submits his/her <b>private</b> <b>data</b> to an organization, he/she almost loses control over it. This thesis considers this lack of control as a potential problem in information systems. Based on existing security protection techniques, three privacy protection approaches are proposed: an access control based approach, a hierarchical encryption based approach and a digital ticket based approach. These approaches are highlighted for their consideration for information donors’ privacy preferences...|$|R
