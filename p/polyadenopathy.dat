40|$|Aim : {{to study}} {{clinical}} {{features of the}} clinical course of an acute respiratory viral infection in conjunction with pathology of pharyngeal tonsil in children of preschool age. Methods : generally clinical; Laboratory and instrumental; Statistical. Separation of viral infection was done using the methods of lumicroscopy and polymerase chain reaction from nasopharynx lavage. Statistical processing of received results was carried out {{with the help of}} standard statistical computer system «MicrosoftExcel» (2007) adapted for medical and biological studies. Result : In the clinical presentation of respiratory viral infection prevailed rhinorrhea, short cough, subfibrilitet with usual duration near 3 days. On the contrary in children with acute respiratory viral infections with pathology of the pharyngeal tonsil prevailed stuffiness in nose, productive cough, snore and decrease of hearing, ear ache, <b>polyadenopathy.</b> Fever had fibril and hectic character with duration more than 3 days.. Dyspeptic syndrome was demonstrated more intensively in children with acute respiratory viral infections with pathology of the pharyngeal tonsil and characterized with thickening on tongue, periodic ache in stomach, meteorism, constipation, stool instability. Conclusions : The main syndromes in the clinical presentation of an acute respiratory viral infection were: intoxicational, catarrhal and dyspeptic. In children with pathology of the pharyngeal tonsil the clinical course of ARVI was more evident with long course and increase of the frequency of complications of ARVI </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative {{disorder}} {{first described}} in 1872 by Moritz Kaposi. Four main clinical presentations of KS have been described: classic, endemic, iatrogenic and epidemic. KS {{involvement of the}} lymph nodes is extremely uncommon in the classical variant form, especially if it precedes the skin manifestations. We describe {{the case of an}} elderly HIV-negative patient presenting with lymphadenopathy who was found to have KS. Case Report: A 67 -year-old patient was admitted for exploration of <b>polyadenopathies</b> {{in the context of a}} general decline in health. Physical examination revealed an erythematosus left lower limb rash associated with angiomatous nodules and multiple lymphadenopathies. The diagnosis of erysipelas in the left leg was retained and the patient was treated with good evolution of the rash but persistence of the angiomatous nodules and the <b>polyadenopathies.</b> Skin and lymph node biopsies led to a diagnosis of KS. The patient is proposed for polychemotherapy. Conclusion: KS must be suspected in lymphadenopathies despite the absence of typical cutaneous signs of the disease and in immunocompetent patients...|$|R
40|$|Acute disseminated {{histoplasmosis}} {{is a frequent}} condition in HIV carriers. Thirty-five cases of endocarditis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum {{have been reported in}} international literature, and all these descriptions correspond to a context of subacute {{disseminated histoplasmosis}}. This paper presents the case of a HIV-positive patient with fever, dyspnea, weight loss, vomiting and <b>polyadenopathies</b> to whom histoplasmosis was diagnosed following blood-cultures and isolation of the agent responsible for cutaneous lesions, and in whom aortic-valve vegetations were found during an echocardiogram. The patient was treated with amphotericin B and had a good outcome; subsequent echocardiograms showed no vegetations. Literature on the subject is reviewed, with special emphasis on diagnosis and treatment of previously described cases...|$|R
40|$|Penicillium marneffei {{infection}} {{is a rare}} fungal disease that cause significant disease in immunosuppressed patients. The geographical distribution of this dimorphic fungus is restricted to Asia, Southeast and Far East, where the disease is considered {{as an indicator of}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Case report. A 42 -year old Congolese woman living in Lubumbashi was admitted at the university hospital of Liège for exploration of a general status impairment. She experienced for three months spiking fever, weight loss, productive cough with bloody expectorations and progressive dyspnoea. She reported also to have non-bloody mild diarrhoea with abdominal pain. The HIV antibody status was positive with a low CD 4 T lymphocytes count (28 /µl). Pulmonary infiltrates were visualized on chest radiography and the computed tomography revealed the presence of a severe pneumopathy characterised by bilateral micronodular lesions. Mediastinal <b>polyadenopathies</b> associated with hepato- and splenomegaly were also highlighted. Bronchoscopy was performed and bronchial aspirations revealed the presence o...|$|R
40|$|Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} lymphadenopathy, most often cervical. It has been mainly {{described}} in Asia. There are few data available on this disease in Europe. We conducted this retrospective, observational, multicenter study to describe KFD in France and to determine the characteristics of severe forms {{of the disease and}} forms associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We included 91 cases of KFD, diagnosed between January 1989 and January 2011 in 13 French hospital centers (median age, 30  ±  10. 4 yr; 77 % female). The ethnic origins of the patients were European (33 %), Afro-Caribbean (32 %), North African (15. 4 %), and Asian (13 %). Eighteen patients had a history of systemic disease, including 11 with SLE. Lymph node involvement was cervical (90 %), often in the context of <b>polyadenopathy</b> (52 %), and it was associated with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in 14. 8 % of cases. Deeper sites of involvement were noted in 18 % of cases. Constitutional signs consisted mainly of fever (67 %), asthenia (74. 4 %), and weight loss (51. 2 %). Other manifestations included skin rash (32. 9 %), arthromyalgia (34. 1 %), 2 cases of aseptic meningitis, and 3 cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Biological signs included lymphocytopenia (63. 8 %) and increase of acute phase reactants (56. 4 %). Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and anti-DNA antibodies were present in 45. 2 % and 18 % of the patients sampled, respectively. Concomitant viral infection was detected in 8 patients (8. 8 %). Systemic corticosteroids were prescribed in 32 % of cases, hydroxychloroquine in 17. 6 %, and intravenous immunoglobulin in 3 patients. The disease course was always favorable. Recurrence was observed in 21 % of cases. In the 33 patients with ANA at diagnosis, SLE was known in 11 patients, diagnosed concomitantly in 10 cases and in the year following diagnosis in 2 cases; 6 patients did not have SLE, and 4 patients were lost to follow-up (median follow-up, 19 mo; range, 3 - 39 mo). The presence of weight loss, arthralgia, skin lesions, and ANA was associated with the development of SLE (p <  0. 05). Male sex and lymphopenia were associated with severe forms of KFD (p <  0. 05). KFD can occur in all populations, irrespective of ethnic origin. Deep forms are common. An association with SLE should be investigated. A prospective study is required to determine the risk factors for the development of SLE...|$|E
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography findings in systemic {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 FDG) is known to accumulate in a large spectrum of malignant and non-malignant pathologies and PET is routinely used to image those processes [1]. We present here a case of child Still’s disease with both hypermetabolic <b>polyadenopathies</b> and hepatosplenomegaly on PET/CT, mimicking a lymphoma. A 16 -year-old African girl, with a history of diffuse articular pain, weight loss and night sweating, and show-ing a back papulomatous rash, hepatosplenomegaly, diffuse lymph nodes enlargement and symmetrical poly-arthritis on physical examination, was evaluated on PET/ CT. This exam showed intense accumulation of FDG in almost all enlarged supra- and infra-diaphragmatic lymph nodes (maximum standardized uptake value: 4. 5 – 10. 7), and in the enlarged liver and spleen, as well (Fig. 1). A right axillary node biopsy was then performed and the pathology was consistent with reactive follicular hyperplasia, with no evidence of lymphoproliferative disease. On the basis of clinical features, inflammatory syndrome and hyperferritinaemia, patient was given the diagnosis of systemic JIA, or Still’s disease. An oral corticoid treatment was established, to which she responded well. Disclosure statement: The authors have declared no conflicts of interest...|$|R

Mediastinal <b>polyadenopathies</b> associated with hepato- and splenomegaly were also highlighted. Bronchoscopy was performed and bronchial aspirations revealed the presence of numerous leucocytes with the presence of intracellular Gram positive organisms suggestive of yeasts. Ziehl, Giemsa and Gomori-Grocott staining were also performed. Ziehl staining was negative. The morphological aspect given by Giemsa staining excluded infection and the PCR specific for T. gondii B 1 gene was negative. However, Gomori-Grocott staining revealed the presence of intracellular oval, elongated, sausage-shaped cells with a single transverse septum (3 to 5 µm). Penicillium marneffei was isolated from blood culture and respiratory samples. Intraveinous amphotericin B treatment was administrated during 15 days followed by itraconazole oral administration (200 mg/j). The antimycotic treatment improved the patient condition and despite other clinical troubles she was prematurely discharged because of financial problems. Conclusion. Opportunistic agents involved in HIV-infected patients differ in Africa and Asia and {{it is important to be}} able to make a rapid diagnosis with the aid of an experienced laboratory.
