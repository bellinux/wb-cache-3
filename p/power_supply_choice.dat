25|$|Much of {{the early}} {{development}} of electric locomotion was driven by {{the increasing use of}} tunnels, particularly in urban areas. Smoke from steam locomotives was noxious and municipalities were increasingly inclined to prohibit their use within their limits. The first electrically-worked underground line was the City and South London Railway, prompted by a clause in its enabling act prohibiting use of steam power. It opened in 1890, using electric locomotives built by Mather and Platt. Electricity quickly became the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> of <b>choice</b> for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of multiple-unit train control in 1897. Surface and elevated rapid transit systems generally used steam until forced to convert by ordinance.|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} for removing pollutants from waste gasses, released by industry and power plants, provide {{the means for}} removing COx, Nox, sulfur and fine dust particles. These technologies impose very stringent requirements on the <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> The <b>choice</b> of the high-voltage supply {{can play an important}} role in the optimization of electrostatic precipitators. Widely discussed, the environmental pollution problems are the outcome of the world wide increase in energy consumption and industrial growth. The overall amount of waste gasses has increased, including the emission of fine, 1 – 50 µm particles, particularly harmful and being a well known health risk. Therefore, both large industrial sites and the power plants require dust cleaning equipment and on-line pollution control. Automated control is required for the equipment to operate on its own, without the need for a continuous operator intervention. Control goals include the need to meet the environmental regulations, keeping at the same time the power losses and the overall energy consumption under control, in order to reach the energy efficiency goals. In this article, an overview of electric filter performance problems is discussed, and the summary of available technologies and solutions is outlined.

40|$|High {{power pulse}} {{magnetron}} sputtering processes enable protective hard layer deposition {{at a high}} rate. Their capacity and strength rely {{to a large extent}} on pulse <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> with high flexibility for adaptation to different discharge conditions to achieve specific film structures. In the present work, this is demonstrated for the deposition of Zr-Nb-N hard protective coatings by reactive co-sputtering of zirconium and niobium using a new versatile pulse <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> The <b>choice</b> of pulse mode, namely single bipolar or pulse package mode, and pulse times in adjustment to gas flow rates allows tailoring the composition of the coatings. In a wide range of elemental compositions (i. e. for a Zr:Nb ratio between 0. 6 and 1. 1, and for a nitrogen to metal ratio between 0. 6 and 1. 1) the coatings exhibit a two-phase microstructure, containing a cubic (Zr,Nb) N phase and a hexagonal beta-Nb 2 N phase, as evidenced by x-ray diffraction. The appearance of a two-phase microstructure even for a nominal coating composition Zr 0. 5 Nb 0. 5 N is attributed to the sequential passing of the rotating substrates through the niobium and zirconium target sputtering zones. Substrate movement also leads to a nanolayer structure of the coatings that has been detected by x-ray reflectometry. The coatings deposited on floating substrates exhibit hardness values in the range of 20 GPa to 30 GPa, which can be extended to 40 GPa by application of a substrate bias voltage of – 60 V. In scratch testing, the hardest coatings of 5 µm thickness exhibit cohesive failure at Lc= 20 N, but no adhesive failure is observed up to a critical load of 30 N...|$|R
40|$|Manned Mars {{missions}} (and some unmanned precursor missions) {{are expected}} to be long duration expeditions that rely on the utilization of in-situ resources to the maximum extent possible. Traditionally, nuclear energy has been suggested as the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> of <b>choice</b> for such missions. However, in the event that nuclear power is unavailable, solar energy is the only alternative power source that has received significant study to date. Unfortunately, the periodic and long duration dust storms on Mars drive the need for extensive solar arrays to provide energy needs. This work considers the possibility that wind energy may provide a secondary power source in an all-solar mission. Previous studies have shown that a viable Martian wind energy system must be ultra-lightweight, deployable, and robust. In this study, the possibility of meeting these criteria with buoyant wind energy conversion structures is studied. Conceptual designs have been assessed in terms of mass, volume, and power production. Based on current estimates of solar energy production efficiency during dust storm conditions, the design constraints on a complimentary wind energy system are determined. Using system mass per kW-hour as a figure of merit, the feasible wind speeds for three Martian buoyant wind energy conversion systems (a Savonius, a Darrieus, and a spherical) were determined and compared to previous rigid designs. The large sizes required for buoyant systems resulted in large turbines producing 10 to 30 kW in 25 m/s winds. The efficient inclusion of the buoyant chambers into the structure was found to be critical, as the mass of the balloon is significant. As a result the spherical system was seen to provide the best design. Although it is aerodynamically inefficient and untested, it was found to be feasible in a 29 m/s wind based on an estimated mass of 429 kg and 19 kW estimated power...|$|R

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a digitally controlled on-chip monotonic Reference Current Generator (RCG) with 8 -bit resolution and a LSB (Least Significant Bit) current {{as low as}} 100 nA.

The proposed architecture of the on-chip RCG is based on an 8 -bit segmented current-steering Digital-to-Analog Converter (IDAC) and a bandgap voltage reference. The (3 + 5) segmented architecture of the 8 -bit IDAC is an optimum combination of a 3 -bit MSBs (Most Significant Bits) unit-element sub-DAC and a 5 -bit LSBs binary-weighted sub-DAC offering good DNL (Differential Nonlinearity) performance. The bandgap voltage reference deviates only 0. 6 % of the nominal value over temperature and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> variations. A cascade current mirror with a super beta helper circuit is used to guarantee monotony and high accuracy. The linearity errors caused by systematic influences and random variations are reduced by the proposed 2 -D double centroid symmetrical architecture. Experiments confirm a DNL of +/- 0. 5 LSB for the proposed RCG. The tested performance of optical level monitoring and APC (Automatic Power Control) algorithm is compliant to ITU-T GPON standards.
