Product {{configuration}} {{systems are}} an important instrument to implement mass customization, a production paradigm that supports the manufacturing of highly-variant products under <b>pricing</b> <b>conditions</b> similar to mass production.

40|$|Survey {{information}} on Swiss exporters {{is used to}} test the hypothesis that firm-specific factors, in particular firm size, are important determinants of pricing [...] to-market (PTM). The survey asked exporters whether they set different prices across markets and, if so, whether price segmentation occurred because of <b>pricing</b> <b>conditions</b> in the local market or other factors. The empirical analysis is based on a probit model that regresses a binary-choice variable of PTM on firm size and other control variables. The main empirical finding is that firm size and PTM are positively and significantly correlated. A further result is that while firms whose main export market is in the Euro area are less likely to engage in PTM, firm size plays a bigger role for them. These results are robust across different PTM classifications, regression specifications, export destinations, and industrial sectors. firm size; local currency pricing; Pricing to markets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Product {{configuration}} {{systems are}} an important instrument to implement mass customization, which is a production paradigm that supports the manufacturing of highlyvariant products under <b>pricing</b> <b>conditions</b> similar to mass production. Previous research indicates that supporting users of product configuration systems with personalized feature recommendations (defaults) {{can lead to a}} higher satisfaction with the configuration process. Based on these findings, we investigate the influence of different representation styles of such defaults on users ’ perception of the configuration system. Additionally, we explore if different representation styles of defaults have an influence on users ’ selection behavior. For our user study we used RecoMobile, an environment which supports the configuration of mobile phones and corresponding subscription features. We found a strong relationship between the number of accepted default proposals and the perceived user interface quality. Our results further reveal that the different representation styles have a strong impact on users’ perceived overall quality of the system...|$|E
40|$|In {{vertical}} relationships, manufacturers commonly rely on {{retailers to}} sell their goods. In this note, we analyze a manufacturer-retailer relationship in which a manufacturer delegates the sale of his product to a retailer who gets sequentially private information about the retail value of the product. At the time of contracting the retailer knows only the product's expected retail value, but subsequently learns the actual valuation. As a result, the retailer is tempted to understate the product's (expected) value {{in order to receive}} more favorable <b>pricing</b> <b>conditions</b> from the manufacturer. In this note, we characterize the optimal sequential screening contract using ex-post and ex-ante incentive constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanism's properties. Moreover, we show how the optimal mechanism can be induced with two-part tariffs and with contracts based on returns. This allows us to discuss briefly which combination of the different instruments - returns, price floors, ex-ante and ex-post pricing - optimally elicits the retailer's private information.

Both modes contribute to congestion. Each demand level for bus trips requires a minimal supply of bus-kilometres. Optimal bus supply exceeds this minimum only when waiting time reductions due to increased service frequency, outweigh congestion costs and bus supply costs (measured at the marginal cost of public funds). An empirical analysis for Brussels and London shows that taking account of economies of density modestly increases the welfare gain from optimising transport prices. Optimal public transport prices are lower when economies of density are taken into account, while optimal car prices are not strongly affected. In case car prices are fixed at the reference level, very low or zero public transport prices produce small welfare gains in some cases. transport; congestion; public transport...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePreference {{reversal}} is {{a systematic}} {{change in the}} preference order between options when different response methods are used (e. g., choice vs. judgment). The present study focuses on procedures used to elicit preferences according to an evaluability hypothesis. Two experiments compared joint vs. separate evaluations and explicit vs. non-explicit joint evaluations. Subjects had to express preferences between high-variance gambles (HVGs) and low-variance gambles (LVGs) either by choosing one gamble {{to play in a}} lottery or by assigning gambles minimum selling prices. We show that HVGs are preferred in both choice and <b>pricing</b> <b>conditions</b> when gambles are evaluated separately, and LVGs are preferred in both choice and selling conditions when gambles are evaluated in pairs: i. e., when the evaluation mode is held constant, classic preference reversal disappears. These results support the evaluability hypothesis, and suggest that preferences depend on whether subjects are allowed to compare the options they are asked to choose from or judge, independently {{of the nature of the}} scale (i. e., attractiveness vs. minimum selling price) they are required to adopt.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{stressed}} {{the important role}} of cues such as price and other attributes in biasing consumers' product judgments. For example, Rao and Monroe (1989) reviewed evidence showing that consumers often use price to judge quality, even in categories where the actual price-quality correlations are low. Carpenter, Glazer, and Nakamoto (1994), among others, showed that consumers use irrelevant attributes, which are uncorrelated with quality, to judge product quality. The current research replicates those findings, but more importantly, shows that potentially biasing cues [...] price, irrelevant attributes, and even attributes that are merely imperfectly correlated with product quality [...] can actually improve consumers' judgments of product quality during later purchases. We argue that price and irrelevant attributes do not just function as heuristic cues that bias quality judgments but also as memory cues that help consumers to correctly retrieve quality information from previous experiences. When consumers have no direct quality information, they will use price or attribute information as a heuristic cue to judge quality. However, after receiving quality information, e. g., by experiencing the product, consumers will not only update the general heuristic relationship between the cue and quality, but also store exemplar information about the experienced product that includes a specific level of the cue (e. g., price or attribute), quality level, and other information such as brand name. Over time, this specific memory of a particular price or attribute can help consumers retrieve the specific quality level that accompanied the specific price or attribute, leading to more accurate quality judgment than if no price or attribute information was ever given. Thus, contrary to what is suggested by previous research, extrinsic and potentially biasing cues can actually make consumers more accurate and thereby increase consumer welfare. In Experiment 1, participants received information about three brands of orange juice (learning phase). For each juice, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> were first shown a brand name and a price, then asked to judge the quality level of the juice on a five-star scale, and then given feedback about the actual quality level of the juice. The actual price-quality correlation was zero. After a 20 -minute delay, participants were then presented with the brand names and prices again and asked to recall the actual quality levels of all three juices (test phase). In the no-price <b>condition,</b> no <b>price</b> information was ever given. As expected, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> used <b>price</b> as a heuristic cue in the learning phase, as evidenced by high correlations between price and quality judgments. However, at test, quality judgments were more accurate in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> than in the no <b>price</b> <b>condition,</b> as evidenced by higher correlations between quality judgments and actual quality in the <b>price</b> <b>condition.</b> Thus, whereas initial, pre-experience quality judgments were biased by price information (that was actually uncorrelated with real quality), post-experience quality judgments were made more accurate by the same price information. In Experiment 2, price was replaced by an attribute, the location (US state) where the juice was bottled. The location attribute was irrelevant {{in the sense that it}} was not highly correlated with product quality. (Unlike many other experiments involving irrelevant attributes, participants were not explicitly told that the location attribute was irrelevant.) Again, we found that this attribute biased initial quality judgments, but made postexperience judgments more accurate. Experiment 3 shows that the accuracyenhancing effect of adding an extrinsic cue is not limited to situations in which there is no overall relationship between the extrinsic cue and product quality. In the learning phase, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> received the same types of information for each brand as they did in Experiment 1 (brand, price, quality level). This time, higher-priced products had higher quality levels, with one exception. The last product had a high price but low quality. Participants in the no <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> received the same information, except that no price information was given. During a test phase, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> were provided with brand names and prices and were asked to recall the quality level of each of the products. Participants in the no <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> did the same but were not given any price information. As expected, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> judged the quality level of the "exceptional" 37 product more accurately than participants in the no <b>price</b> <b>condition.</b> In Experiment 4, we tested the hypothesis that potentially-biasing extrinsic cues (i. e., cues that participants expect to be related to an outcome such as quality) can lead to an even stronger accuracyenhancing effect than cues that participants do not expect to be related to the outcome. This might occur because a product experience that disconfirms an expectation may draw attention to that experience and exemplar information will be stored better than if participants had no expectation about the outcome. The high-expectation condition was identical to the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> in Experiment 3. The low-expectation <b>condition</b> replaced <b>price</b> by package size. As expected, participants in the <b>price</b> <b>condition</b> judged the quality level of the "exceptional" product more accurately than participants in the low-expectation condition. Thus, the cue with the strongest potential to bias (price) ended up having the strongest unbiasing effect over time. These findings have clear implications for marketers and consumers. They indicate, for example, that adding attribute information that violates participants expected attribute-quality relationships (e. g., putting a high price on a low quality product or introducing irrelevant attribute information) can make low quality products more attractive initially, but over time may actually help consumers recognize those products' mediocrity by reducing confusion in memory, leaving that product worse off than if the attribute information had never been added. Thus, instead of hurting consumer welfare, potentially biasing and irrelevant attributes can improve consumer welfare. From a theoretical perspective, our results suggest that consumers use cues such as price and irrelevant attributes not just as heuristic cues that have general relationships with benefits such as quality (e. g., "higher price usually means higher quality") but that individual levels of price or other attributes are also stored as part of exemplars that can be used as memory cues to retrieve specific experiences. It is argued that these two functions rely on different memory and learning systems. Further experiments will asses moderators that determine when cues are used as general heuristic cues versus specific memory cues. Future research may also explore indirect effects of adding misleading attribute information on the quality implications of other product features such as brand names. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Integration of {{physical}} transactions and financial contracts {{is central to}} successful electricity market design. Virtually every energy transaction has some impact on prices. The mere fact that a physical transaction can affect prices to some degree, and thereby influence the prices of related financial contracts, cannot be a per se definition of price manipulation. A principled policy for characterizing price manipulation in organized electricity markets includes a stand-alone profitability test. Multiple market-clearing prices arise from degenerate <b>pricing</b> <b>conditions</b> that can occur in electricity markets under economic dispatch. In some instances, small changes in bilateral schedules can produce large changes in prices. These prices affect the value of associated financial transmission rights. A stand-alone profitability test distinguishes transactions {{that are consistent with}} workably competitive markets from transactions that serve no economic purpose other than to manipulate prices and profit from other financial contracts.

Access to previously unpublished 1911 testimony before the Interstate Commerce Committee of the U. S.

What he advocates here is government promotion of actual competition, largely through the dissolution of the “perilous ” trusts and the development of a common pricing policy where all producers face the same price regimes in both the output and input markets. What is desired as an outcome is the promotion of what Clark terms “tolerant competition. ” Tolerant competition is not the perfect competition of the neoclassical model, nor the rough-and-ready competition of the pre- 1870 era. Rather, it is a live-and-let-live form of competition where big firms and small firms face the same <b>pricing</b> <b>conditions</b> and only efficiency determines the profit outcome...|$|E

Before the mid 1970 s, marginal price and marginal cost schedules are nearly identical, in line with efficient pricing. In later years, marginal supply costs exceed marginal prices for smaller manufacturing customers by 10 % or more. In contrast to a clear role for cost factors, our evidence provides no support for a standard Ramsey-pricing interpretation of quantity discounts.
