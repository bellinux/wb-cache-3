5|$|There are two {{widespread}} {{standards for}} <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> of diving gas. In the USA {{and perhaps a}} few other places the pressure is measured in {{pounds per square inch}} (psi), {{and the rest of the}} world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not actually used underwater.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening pressure, {{as well as to}} obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E
5|$|Unusual in many aspects, the 1846Havana {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} intense of its time. Though atmospheric pressure readings in Cuba reached as low as 916mbar (27.06inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938mbar (27.70inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> until 1924, 78years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. As {{a result of the}} tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. Sand Key, which completely submerged {{during the course of the}} hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit not in its original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} Pressure Oscillation (PO) experiments {{for which}} we find the minimum experiment time that guarantees user-imposed parameter variance upper bounds and honours actuator limits. The parameters permeability and porosity are estimated with a classical least-squares estimation method for which {{an expression of the}} covariance matrix of the estimates is calculated. This expression is used to tackle the optimization problem. We study the Dynamic Darcy Cell experiment set-up (Heller et al., 2002) and focus on data generation using square wave actuator signals, which, as we shall prove, deliver shorter experiment times than sinusoidal ones. Parameter identification is achieved using either inlet pressure/outlet <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> (Heller et al., 2002) or actuator position/outlet <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements,</b> where the latter is a novel approach. The solution to the optimization problem reveals that for both measurement methods an optimal excitation frequency, an optimal inlet volume, and an optimal outlet volume exist. We find that under the same parameter variance bounds and actuator constraints, actuator position/outlet <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> result in required experiment times that are a factor fourteen smaller compared to inlet pressure/outlet <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements.</b> This result is analysed in detail and we find that the dominant effect driving this difference originates from an identifiability problem when using inlet–outlet <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> for joint estimation of permeability and porosity. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations, and show excellent agreement with theoretical expectations...|$|R
25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a {{differential pressure gauge}} with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static <b>pressure</b> <b>measurement</b> is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies that}} {{compared}} foot pressures in {{boys and girls}} found that girls had greater peak pressures under the hallux than did boys. Only one of these studies considered plantar <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> in children. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the effect of gender on foot <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> in children. Methods: This is a comparative study using the F-Scan pressure platform (F-Mat; Texscan® Boston, MA) on a sample of children attending a podiatric clinic. <b>Pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> and temporal parameters were measured in 61 children between the ages of 5 and 16 years. Associations between joint hypermobility and hallux valgus angle also were investigated. Results: Girls were found to have significantly greater peak pressure under the hallux, faster timing of heel contact to first metatarsal head loading, and a more medially placed center of pressure trajectory. No associations were found between these significant variables and hypermobility scores or hallux valgus angle. Conclusion: The results indicate that there are differences in <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> between boys and girls, but the reasons for these remain unclear. Differences in <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> in the feet of boys and girls may be useful in establishing the cause of foot pathologies for which a prevalence has been shown in boys or girls, such as hallux valgus deformity, which is known to be more frequent in females of all ages...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo measure fabric {{permeability}} {{over the}} body at air velocities encountered in running, a series of air <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> were conducted on a mannequin torso in a wind tunnel. <b>Pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> were made at wind speeds of 3. 3 m/sec, 5. 3 m/sec and 10. 0 m/sec from 15 pressure taps that ringed the circumference of the mannequin torso. The <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> were then repeated at the two higher velocities when the pressure taps were covered in one of five fabrics commonly used for sports apparel. Each of the fabrics are considered highly permeable, based on an air permeability rating provided by the fabric manufacturer. The goals of the <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> were: (1) to quantify the ability for air to be transmitted through a garment to an athlete's skin when the athlete is running; and (2) to compare the <b>pressure</b> tap <b>measurements</b> with the manufacturers’ air permeability ratings. The <b>pressure</b> <b>measurements</b> indicated that the only areas of the torso that encounter measurable airflow at wind velocities up to 10 m/sec are the flanks, a phenomenon also observed during dye-injection flow visualization studies conducted on a torso model in a water flume. Covering portions of the torso that receive very little airflow with any fabric further subdued the incoming airflow and the reduction in airflow was not consistently correlated with the fabric air permeability rating. The {{results of this study}} suggest that fabric air permeability ratings are of limited utility in the selection of permeable materials for running apparel because of the low air pressures encountered by the torso at running velocities...|$|R

[...] Nitrogen narcosis does not normally apply to freediving as free-divers start and finish the dive with only a single lungful of air and it has long been assumed that free divers are not exposed to the necessary pressure for long enough to absorb sufficient nitrogen. [...] Where these terms are used in this manner there is usually little or no discussion of the phenomenon of blackouts not involving depressurisation and the cause may be variously attributed to either depressurisation or hypocapnia or both.
