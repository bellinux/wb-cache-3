It is shown that iron–air showers could develop more slowly than expected and produce the observed change in the slope of Xmax at the highest energies. It is expected that the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will reach regions where the energy density will be higher than the critical value of a few GeV/fm 3 predicted by lattice QCD calculations. This critical energy density corresponds to the new phase(s) of deconfinement of the quark gluon plasma or (and) of restoration of chiral symmetry.

The possibility of the generation of a magnetic field around a cosmic string on the Grand Unification energy scale (GUT scale) in the early Universe immediately after the termination of the deconfinement-confinement phase transition has been analyzed. It is found that a circular current and a magnetic field directed along the string are induced around the string in the vacuum of a pseudoscalar matter consisting of charged pions. We also have studied the interaction between the magnetic flux tube surrounding the string (the string magnetosphere) and the cosmic plasma in the early Universe.

40|$|Field correlators and {{the string}} {{representation}} {{are used as}} two complementary approaches for the description of confinement in the SU(N) -inspired dual Abelian-Higgs-type model. In the London limit of the simplest, SU(2) -inspired, model, bilocal electric field-strength correlators have been derived with accounting for the contributions to these averages produced by closed dual strings. The Debye screening in the <b>plasma</b> of such <b>strings</b> yields a novel long-range interaction between points lying on the contour of the Wilson loop. This interaction generates a Luescher-type term, even when one restrics oneself to the minimal surface, as it is usually done in the bilocal approximation to the stochastic vacuum model. Beyond the London limit, {{it has been shown}} that a modified interaction appears, which becomes reduced to the standard Yukawa one in the London limit. Finally, a string representation of the SU(N) -inspired model with the theta-term, in the London limit, can be constructed.

40|$|In {{models for}} hadron {{collisions}} based on string hadronization, the strings are usually treated as independent, allowing no {{interaction between the}} confined colour fields. In studies of nucleus collisions {{it has been suggested}} that strings close in space can fuse to form "colour ropes". Such ropes are expected to give more strange particles and baryons, which also has been suggested as a signal for <b>plasma</b> formation. Overlapping <b>strings</b> can also be expected in pp collisions, where usually no phase transition is expected. In particular at the high LHC energies the expected density of strings is quite high. To investigate possible effects of rope formation, we present a model in which strings are allowed to combine into higher multiplets, giving rise to increased production of baryons and strangeness, or recombine into singlet structures and vanish. Also a crude model for strings recombining into junction structures is considered, again giving rise to increased baryon production. The models are implemented in the DIPSY MC event generator, using PYTHIA 8 for hadronization, and comparison to pp minimum bias data, reveals improvement in the description of identified particle spectra.

[...] FLARE initiators can ignite propellants through the release of plasma, or even through the use of ultraviolet heat radiation. [...] The absorption length of a solid propellant is sufficient to be ignited by radiation from a plasma source. However, FLARE has most likely not reached optimal design requirements and further understanding of FLARE and how it works is completely necessary to ensure the evolution of the technology. If FLARE provided the XM-291 gun project with the sufficient radiative heat to ignite the propellant to achieve a muzzle energy of 17 MJ one could only imagine the possibilities with a fully developed FLARE plasma igniter. Current areas of study include how plasma will affect the propellant through radiation, the deliverance of mechanical energy and heat directly and by driving gas flow. Despite these daunting tasks FLARE has been seen as the most plausible igniter for future application on ETC guns.|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} p_T {{distribution}} {{data from the}} LHC on the invariant differential yield of the charged primary particles in pp collisions at √(s) = 0. 9 TeV, 2. 76 TeV, 7 TeV and in Pb-Pb collisions at √(s_NN) = 2. 76 TeV with 6 centrality bins contains several p_T regions with special properties. These distributions were analysed by fitting the data with exponential functions. We conclude that the regions reflect features of fragmentation and hadronization of partons through the string dynamics. The nuclear transparency results in negligible influence of the medium in the III region (p_T > 17 - 20 GeV/c), which has highest p_T values. The effects and changes by the medium start to appear weakly in the II region (4 - 6 GeV/c < p_T< 17 - 20 GeV/c) and become stronger in the I region (p_T < 4 - 6 GeV/c). It seems that the II region has highest number of strings. The increase in string density in this region could lead to fusion of strings, appearance of a new string and collective behaviour of the partons in the most central collisions. These phenomena can explain anomalous behaviour of the Nuclear Modification Factor in the II region. We propose the II region as a possible area of Quark Gluon <b>Plasma</b> formation through <b>string</b> fusion. The first p_T regions are {{the ones with the}} maximum number of hadrons and minimum number of strings due to direct hadronization of the low energy strings into two quark systems - mesons.

40|$|Semiconductor device {{profiles}} {{are determined}} by the characteristics of both etching and deposition processes. In particular, a highly anisotropic etch is required to achieve vertical sidewalls. However, etching is comprised of both anisotropic and isotropic components, due to ion and neutral fluxes, respectively. In Ar/Cl 2 plasmas, for example, neutral chlorine reacts with the Si surfaces to form silicon chlorides. These compounds are then removed by the impinging ion fluxes. Hence the directionality of the ions (and thus the ion angular distribution function, or IAD), as well as the relative fluxes of neutrals and ions determines the amount of undercutting. One method of modeling device profile evolution is to simulate the moving solid-gas interface between the semiconductor and the <b>plasma</b> as a <b>string</b> of nodes. The velocity of each node is calculated and then the nodes are advanced accordingly. Although this technique appears to be relatively straightforward, extensive looping schemes are required at the profile corners. An alternate method is to use level set theory, which involves embedding the location of the interface in a field variable. The normal speed is calculated at each mesh point, and the field variable is updated. The profile comers are more accurately modeled as the need for looping algorithms is eliminated. The model we have developed is a 2 -D Level Set Profile Evolution Simulation (LSPES). The LSPES calculates etch rates of a substrate in low pressure plasmas due to the incident ion and neutral fluxes. For a Si substrate in an Ar/C 12 gas mixture, for example, the predictions of the LSPES are identical to those from a string evolution model for high neutral fluxes and two different ion angular distributions. (2) In the figure shown, the relative neutral to ion flux in the bulk plasma is 100 to 1. For a moderately isotropic ion angular distribution function as shown in the cases in the left hand column, both the LSPES (top row) and rude's string method (bottom row) predict tapered profiles. The LSPES uses an AD with a FWHM = 13. 5 degrees, and rude's model uses a ratio of sheath voltage to ion temperature of 50. The more anisotropic IADs produce profiles with more vertical sidewalls and a wider bottom surface, as shown in the right hand column. Here, the LSPES has an AD with a FWHM = 2 degrees, and rude's model uses a ratio of 500 of sheath voltage to ion temperature. The agreement between the LSPES and rude's model is excellent in both cases. We will present etching profiles generated by the LSPES, including calculations of the re-emitted fluxes of both neutrals and ions off of the profile walls. In addition, we will show the effect of geometric structures (overhangs, etc.) on the etching profiles. Other physical aspects, such as surface diffusion, will also be included in the model...|$|R
40|$|Emergent, complex {{structures}} which {{detract from}} a pure linear description are ubiquitous in science. A necessary prerequisite for understanding those structures and for modelling the underlying (physical) processes is a quantitative characterization of them, where one naturally {{has to put}} an emphasis on extracting {{the information contained in}} the nonlinearities. First, methods and strategies to quantitatively assess nonlinearities or higher order correlations in data sets are presented. The methods being discussed comprise the assessment of (local) scaling properties of point sets, morphological measures, prediction errors in artificial embedding spaces and statistics of Fourier phases. The method of surrogate data represents one of the key strategies to detect (weak) nonlinearities in data sets. Pitfalls as well as extensions and new fields of applications of this approach are outlined. Next, applications of the methodologies introduced above to a number of interdisciplinary research topics are reported: It is demonstrated how the inner bone structures and their disease-induced changes can effectively be characterized in in vitro studies as well as in clinical in vivo studies. One thus obtains refined insights on the changes of bone structures in the context of osteoporosis like e. g. universal mass-structure scaling relations, which may lead - among others - to a better diagnostic performance in discriminating osteoporotic and healthy patients. A number of self-organization processes and phase transitions in complex plasmas are investigated on the microcanonical level. The kinetics of fluid demixing in a binary complex plasma is systematically studied using the evolving domain size and it is shown that the demixing dynamics depends crucially on the interaction range of the potential. The dynamics of lane formation in driven binary complex plasmas as well as the transition from normal fluids to string fluids in electrorheological (ER) plasmas are quantitatively described by newly developed order parameters. The observed time-resolved lane-formation process is in good agreement with computer simulations of a binary Yukawa model with Langevin dynamics. Microgravity experiments with ER plasmas as well as molecular dynamics simulations show a second order phase transition from an isotropic to an anisotropic (<b>string)</b> <b>plasma</b> state as the electric field is increased. Signatures of nonlinearities are identified in the x-ray light curve of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic black holes (GBH). These findings lead to the exclusion of linear models like e. g. the traditional shot noise model or the global disk oscillation model for explaining the variability of AGNs and GBHs. In-depth analyses of maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as obtained with the WMAP and Planck satellite consistently yield significant signatures for large scale Fourier phase correlations and for anisotropies in the maps of the CMB. These detected anomalies question the Copernican principle, i. e. the isotropy and homogeneity of the universe, which is a basic assumption of standard cosmological models. Finally, it is demonstrated how to generate data sets with tailored nonlinearities by imposing a few constraints on the distribution of Fourier phases. It is found that the power law character of leptokurtic probability distributions being typical for intermittent signals found in turbulence and financial data can thus be explained in terms of linear phase correlations. These findings point towards new research directions on deciphering the meaning of Fourier phases, which is of eminent importance for better understanding complex structures...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have studied how high {{energetic}} excitations propagate through a non- abelian strongly coupled plasma. This new {{state of matter}} is produced at heavy ion collisions in our accelerators and allows us to study a stage {{of the evolution of}} our Universe that occurred during the first microseconds after the Big Bang. In this extreme conditions of temperature and density the ordinary matter that we are made of behaves as a an almost perfect fluid, the most perfect known by mankind up to now in fact. The theory of strong interactions is tested at an energy scale that even though it is high enough to melt hadrons, it does not {{get to the point where}} the coupling constant is low enough to allow a perturbative description. In the plasma, the partonic field content, the quarks and gluons, cease to be the relevant degrees of freedom and a microscopic description in terms of quasi-particles is not possible. A very useful tool to put to test the actual behaviour of this strongly coupled fluid is the analysis of jet modifications as a result of their interactions with the plasma. In a first introductory part we have given the concepts needed to picture how heavy ion collisions develop as we are able to understand it today. At weak coupling, the main mechanism responsible for energy loss is induced gluon emission and interesting interference phenomena occur that lead to a dependence on path length of as the squared distance. These are known as coherence effects and their study becomes richer by considering multi-gluon emission, as it is done done in Part III. The strongly coupled picture uses holography to map a dressed excitation moving through a strongly coupled <b>plasma</b> into a <b>string</b> propagating in a higher dimensional space containing a black hole. Since the non-abelian theory in which the calculation is done is not QCD, but N = 4 SYM, we take these results as an insight to describe energetic parton propagation in a model of jet quenching in heavy ion collisions. Even though we assume that the exchanges with the medium are soft enough to include non-perturbative effects, as described by gauge/gravity duality, the energetic partons that are produced in the collision generally have a high virtuality which they relax by successive splittings. The latter occur at length scales that are not resolvable by the medium, and they should proceed as in vacuum. This observation motivates us to adopt a hybrid description for the interplay between the multi scale jet and the QGP, using each description at the scale it is supposed to be valid. This phenomenological description has proven to be very successful in describing dijet and photon-jet data at different centralities, and predictions have been made for a wide range of observables for the coming data from run 2 of LHC, including a new observable, the ratio of the fragmentation functions of the leading and subleading jet in a dijet pair, which is highly sensitive to the specific energy loss mechanism. In the next part of the work we extend our hybrid model by the inclusion of two effects, broadening and medium response, which should help us better describe intra-jet observables. The first effect, broadening, is due to the Brownian motion that probes experience in a thermal bath, and it will tend to broaden the distribution of particles within the jet. As it turns out, the observable quantifying such modifications, the jet shapes, are rather insensitive to the inclusion of this effect. However, by restricting the range of the tracks entering this analysis,we have been able to produce a new observable which shows a remarkable dependence on the precise strength of the broadening mechanism. The second effect involves overall energy-momentum conservation. The rapidly thermalized energy deposited by the energetic partons modifies the plasma, inducing temperature and velocity fluctuations in the surrounding fluid cells. This perturbation propagates long distances in the form of a wake and eventually decays into soft hadrons, whose orientations keep a correlation with the jet direction and therefore produce a net effect even after background subtraction. The observable consequences are best noticed in intra-jet measurements such as jet shapes and fragmentation functions, where it is clearly seen that the inclusion of such physics is in good agreement with the observed experimental trend, and it becomes simply unavoidable when comparisons against global measurements are performed. Finally, we compute the inclusive two gluon stimulated emission within the context of perturbative QCD. By studying the full answer in different kinematical limits we arrive to the conclusion that jet propagation is perceived from the point of view of the plasma as a set of effective emitters depending on the resolution power, which for a thin plasma it is of the order of the Debye screening mass. This physics is a missing piece of the Monte Carlo jet quenching model presented in this thesis and its inclusion is expected to have important consequences for the more differential observables, a task that will be undertaken in future work. These are very exciting times for the physics of strong nuclear interactions. We have seen how the very fundamental questions about the nature of the high temperature, strongly coupled phase of ordinary matter can be addressed by the study of jet quenching and its observable consequences. This thesis represents an effort in the confrontation of the seductive ideas of holography with experiments. Having the means to quantitatively confront new ideas, as we have done throughout the presented work, new observables, and new data is critical if we are eventually to understand the properties of the strongly coupled liquid quark-gluon plasma that Nature has served us.
