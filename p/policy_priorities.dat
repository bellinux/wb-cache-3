40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} policies for stochastic project scheduling with resource constraints, the linear preselective policies. They combine the benefits of two known classes of scheduling policies for stochastic and deterministic scheduling, viz. <b>priority</b> <b>policies</b> and preselective <b>policies.</b> <b>Priority</b> <b>policies</b> solve resource conflicts by means of a priority list (list scheduling). They have several computational benefits but suffer from the well-known Graham anomalies. On the other hand, preselective policies possess favorable properties such as continuity and monotonicity and thus avoid these anomalies, but computing optimal such policies requires excessive computation time. The new class of linear preselective policies is a subclass of the class of preselective <b>policies.</b> Like <b>priority</b> <b>policies,</b> linear preselective <b>policies</b> use <b>priority</b> lists for their definition. They thus inherit all favorable properties of preselective policies but are far better computationally tractable. We st [...] ...|$|R

Though for a time he was associated with the Northern Whig Club, he entered the Irish House of Commons as an Independent. He ran on a platform supporting Whig principles of electoral reform and opposing the Irish policies of the British Government.

25|$|President Bush {{advocated}} the partial privatization of Social Security in 2005-2006, but was unsuccessful in achieving any reforms {{to the program}} against strong congressional resistance. His proposal would have diverted some of the payroll tax revenues that fund the program into private accounts. Critics argued that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding challenge facing the program. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on Budget and <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} Reagan's 1981 tax cuts (reduced revenue {{relative}} to a baseline without the cuts) were at least partially offset by phased in Social Security payroll tax increases that had been enacted by President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress in 1977, and further increases by Reagan in 1983 An accounting indicated nominal tax receipts increased from $599 billion in 1981 to $1.032 trillion in 1990, an increase of 72% in current dollars. In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20% above inflation. From 1991 to 2000, receipts increased by 90% in current dollars, or 60% in 2005 dollars. An analysis from the Center on Budget and <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> calculated that the average annual growth rate of real income-tax receipts per working-age person eventually rose over the two decades from 0.2% (1981–90) to 3.1% (1990–2001).|$|E
25|$|The Conservative Party {{believes}} {{that in the}} 21st century defence and security are interlinked. It has pledged to break away from holding a traditional Strategic Defence Review and have committed to carrying out a more comprehensive Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) immediately upon coming into office. This review will include both defence and homeland security related matters. The Labour Government last conducted a review in 1998. To prevent a long gap in the future it also pledged to hold regular defence reviews every 4–5years, and if necessary will put this requirement into legislation. Party officials claim that the SDSR will be a major improvement, and will ensure that Britain maintains generic and flexible capability to adapt to any changing threats. It will be a cross-departmental review that will begin with foreign <b>policy</b> <b>priorities</b> and will bring together all the levers of domestic national security policy with overseas interests and defence priorities.|$|E
40|$|The purpose {{with this}} study is to analyze how the Serbian {{government}} has acted to reach its first foreign <b>policy</b> <b>priority</b> (protection of the country´s sovereignty and territorial integrity) from a rational choice perspective between 2006 until the end of 2009. To analyze my purpose I have formulated the following questions: Which relevant state institutions have participated {{in the creation of the}} first foreign <b>policy</b> <b>priority</b> and can this be seen as rational? How has the Serbian government acted to maximize its interests and reach the first foreign <b>policy</b> <b>priority</b> during the negotiation talks of Kosovo´s future status? How has the Serbian government acted to maximize its interests and reach the first foreign <b>policy</b> <b>priority</b> after the Kosovo declaration of independence? This study aims to explain these questions by using the rational actor model and a case study framework. With reference to the first question I have reached a conclusion. The Serbian parliament was the institutions that established the goals, and it is a rational act. On the second question I reached the following conclusion: the Serbian government has maximized its interests because during they managed to maintain the continuity of the negotiations. On the third question the Serbian government managed to prevent several countries to recognize Kosovo because of their actions. The support of other countries around the world led the Serbian government to ask the International court in the Hague that will deliver an advisory opinion if the independence declaration of Kosovo is compatible with international law.   Keywords: rationalism, foreign policy, Serbian government, Kosov...|$|R

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1992, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{committed}} Canada to United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM I). Canada was being pressured to make this decision because in the past it had aggressively engaged in Yugoslavia in 1992 and had reached out to Balkan refugees later that year. The heightened media coverage on Somalia had also put more pressure on the Canadian government to mobilize a peacekeeping effort. Thanks to the Mulroney government’s desire to improve conflict resolution mechanisms and for its natural interest in multilateralism and peacekeeping, Canada found the Somali Civil War to fit its foreign <b>policy</b> <b>priorities.</b> Mulroney was himself a ‘Pearsonian’ and a multilateralist who would {{have a great deal}} of confidence in the United Nations. Canadian diplomat Geoffrey Pearson argued that “effective multilateral arrangements provide a means to exert influence on major allies and powerful neighbours as well as help maintain peace”. Mulroney’s notion of new internationalism coupled with this notion of multilateralism would see intervention as a moral imperative in cases of intrastate disorder and large-scale human rights abuse. He commented that it would be ideal for the United Nations to become still more effective and more of an actor in international affairs.|$|E

500|$|An {{analysis}} by the CBO showed that the Ryan plan would not balance the budget for at least 28 years, partly because the changes in Medicare would not affect anyone older than 55. Former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker and Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, praised the budget for making tough choices. Walker believed it needed to go even further, tackling Social Security and defense spending. In contrast, David Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, has declared that Ryan's budget [...] "is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices" [...] and would [...] "do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse". Ezra Klein also criticized the budget for making [...] "unrealistic assumptions". The Center on Budget and <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> was highly critical of Ryan's budget proposal, stating that it would shift income to the wealthy while increasing poverty and inequality.|$|E
