As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging.

For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including {{the extent to which}} vermin infested the prison. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of this criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.|$|E

40|$|We examine {{spending}} on consumption items which have signaling value in social interactions across groups with distinctive social identities in India, where social identities {{are defined by}} caste and religious affiliations. The classification of such items was done by eliciting responses to a survey in India. We match {{the results of our}} survey with nationally representative micro data on household consumption expenditures. We find that disadvantaged caste groups such as Other Backward Castes spend nine percent more on visible consumption than Brahmin and High Caste groups while social groups such as Muslims spend eleven percent less, after controlling for differences in permanent income and demographic composition of households. These differences are significant and robust.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} seed bank density and composition alonga semi-arid gypsum gradient in Central Spain. Seed bank density was relatively high (16, 214 seed/m 2) with a very clumped spatial distribution. Landform and microslope were the best predictors for seed density, indicatingthat density can be at least <b>partly</b> interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the physical processes regulating secondary dispersal. A high number of species appeared in the seed bank (68) beingmost of them annual gypsophytes. A relevant feature is that three widely distributed perennial gypsophytes occurred among the 10 more abundant species (Helianthemum squamatum, Lepidium subulatum and Sedum gypsicola). Presence of perennial amongthe most frequent species of the seed bank is not a shared characteristic with other arid and semiarid systems. CCA model suggested that vegetation bands, microslope and vegetation perennial cover were factors shapingthe composition of the seed bank...|$|R

5|$|The first {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{around the time}} of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as they were used to send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.|$|E

While a large number of regulations may be the outcome of the government priorities at the national and local level – not all of these laws represent national priorities. As the discussion in this chapter shows, other external factors certainly have an impact on the national environmental law making processes, affecting sustainable resource management. Noting that states are the primary actors in any investment contracts dealing with resource sectors (e. g. water, energy, biodiversity), the focus of this chapter is to identify and discuss these external factors rather than the internal factors such as political manifestos, economic agenda or emergency prevention. It assesses the level of influence external bodies have on the environmental policy making at the national and local level. While the chapter acknowledges that states play a central role in managing their resources, it attempts to highlight the influence of international law and non-state actors in managing resources at the national level...|$|R

Sorabji had sent several of his scores, including that of his First Piano Sonata, to Ernest Newman, who paid them no attention. Sorabji then played the piece to Ferruccio Busoni, who expressed some reservations about the work, but gave him a letter of recommendation, which helped Sorabji get it published.|$|E

Even after Athens fell to the advancing Persian army, the Allied fleet still remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the navies finally engaged in the cramped Straits of Salamis. There, the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised.

30|$|It is {{understood}} that this {{data can be}} <b>partly</b> seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of {{limitations of the study}} sample. The convenience criterion was used to recruit the participants, so the sample was composed of parents of children with different health problems, levels of dependence, and need for care. The study also included parents of children with acute diseases of transitory course: 33.2 % of children did not receive special care and 59.1 % did not require intensive medical care in the year prior to the study. Through the responses of the parents of children with less severe conditions, this sample bias may have influenced the scores on items such as Chip 42 and Chip 44. On this issue, it is thought that, although there have been violations of the assumptions of the analysis, these items should be kept in the scale until additional analyses are carried out. Further random and more uniform sample studies may help to decide whether to exclude or include additional items that map onto a wider range of coping patterns.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE—Imaging {{methods are}} {{currently}} being optimized {{in an attempt to}} assess and monitor angiogenesis in vivo. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether areas of apparently increased tumor vascularity, as identified on 8 -T gradient-echo (GE) imaging of a known glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), corresponds to foci of increased microvascularity on histopathologic analysis. METHODS—We performed postmortem in situ, high-resolution GE 8 -T MR imaging of the brain in a 53 -year-old woman with GBM. Ten histopathologic specimens in the region of the tumor bed were studied by using hematoxylin-eosin and reticulin stains. MR and histopathologic results were assessed and compared for microvascular size and density. RESULTS— 8 -T GE images showed small, penetrating vessels in the gray matter and white matter. The images, however, were <b>partly</b> inhomogeneous <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of local magnetic field inhomogeneities adjacent to the skull base and aerated paranasal sinus structures. 8 -T MR images demonstrated serpiginous areas of signal intensity loss, which were thought to represent areas of increased microvascularity.

Using nationally representative micro data on household consumption expenditures, we find that disadvantaged caste groups such as Other Backward Castes spend 8 percent more on visible consumption than Brahmin and High Caste groups while social groups such as Muslims spend 14 percent less, after controlling for differences in permanent income, household assets and household demographic composition. The differences across social groups are significant and robust and these differences persist within different sub populations. We find that the higher spending of OBC households on visible consumption is diverted from education spending, while Muslim households divert spending from visible consumption and education towards greater food spending.
