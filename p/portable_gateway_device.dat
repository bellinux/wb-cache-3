40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of Internet of Things (IoT) keeps many sensors {{connected}} to the internet every day. Of the many sensors to be connected, each of which has unique characteristics, such as different work environments, connection protocols are supported, and programming techniques are manifold. A single network approach is no longer suitable for sending all raw data from each sensor directly to the cloud and will certainly use an expensive network bandwidth. Some sensor data also needs to be analyzed and responded in real-time. In this research, the authors utilized a Single Board Computer (SBC) Raspberry Pi and MQTT protocol as a communication channel to develop a <b>gateway</b> <b>device</b> for IoT sensors as a link between sensors to the cloud network. Through this developed <b>gateway</b> <b>device,</b> the sensor is no longer connected to a single cloud network so that limited connections based on characteristics and infrastructure can be reduced. The results show the <b>gateway</b> <b>device</b> can serve as a liaison between sensors with cloud networks well. Sensors can transmit data and receive commands from the <b>gateway</b> <b>device.</b> The data transmitted as well as commands received by the <b>gateway</b> <b>device</b> are then forwarded to the cloud network...|$|R

50|$|One {{solution}} for NAT traversal, called the Internet <b>Gateway</b> <b>Device</b> Protocol (IGD Protocol), is implemented via UPnP. Many routers and firewalls expose themselves as Internet <b>Gateway</b> <b>Devices,</b> allowing any local UPnP control point {{to perform a}} variety of actions, including retrieving the external IP address of the device, enumerate existing port mappings, and add or remove port mappings. By adding a port mapping, a UPnP controller behind the IGD can enable traversal of the IGD from an external address to an internal client.|$|R

A single <b>gateway</b> <b>device</b> can control up to 500 street lights. Using the <b>gateway</b> <b>device,</b> one can turn individual lights ON, OFF or dim them, as well as find out which individual light is faulty and in need of maintenance.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} first study of network access link {{performance}} measured directly from home <b>gateway</b> <b>devices.</b> Policymakers, ISPs, and users are increasingly interested in studying the performance of Internet access links. Because of many confounding factors in a home network or on end hosts, however, thoroughly understanding access network performance requires deploying measurement infrastructure in users' homes as <b>gateway</b> <b>devices.</b> In conjunction with the Federal Communication Commission's study of broadband Internet access in the United States, we study the throughput and latency of network access links using longitudinal measurements from nearly 4, 000 <b>gateway</b> <b>devices</b> across 8 ISPs from a deployment of over 4, 200 devices. We study the performance users achieve and how various factors ranging from the user's choice of modem to the ISP's traffic shaping policies can affect performance. Our study yields many important findings about the characteristics of existing access networks. Our findings also provide insights into the ways that access network performance should be measured and presented to users, which can help inform ongoing broader efforts to benchmark the performance of access networks...|$|R

50|$|A VoIP gateway is a <b>gateway</b> <b>device</b> {{that uses}} Internet Protocols to {{transmit}} and receive voice communications (VoIP).

50|$|However, when routers, firewalls, proxies, {{and other}} <b>gateway</b> <b>devices</b> perform network address {{translation}} (NAT), or more specifically, port address translation (PAT), they may rewrite source ports in order to track connection state.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a routing protocol that utilizes {{the characteristics of}} Short range technology for Short range-based mobile ad hoc networks. The routing tables are maintained in the <b>gateway</b> <b>devices,</b> and the routing zone radius for each table is adjusted dynamically via a fuzzy inference system. Given that some useless routing packets exist which increase the network loads in the existing ad hoc routing protocols, this work selectively employs multiple unicasts or a single broadcast when the destination device moves beyond the routing zone radius coverage of the routing table. The simulation results demonstrate that the dynamic adjustment of the routing table size in each <b>gateway</b> <b>device</b> results in considerably faster routing request reply time, as well as fewer request packets and useless packets compared with two representative protocols, Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) and Dynamic Source Routing...|$|R
