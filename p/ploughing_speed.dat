These and other factors all {{contribute to the development of}} stress on the agricultural machine elements which may either lead to breakdowns or failures of some parts. As part of an effort to investigate into the frequent failures of the Steyr tractor lift system, the effects of <b>ploughing</b> <b>speed</b> on the development of stress on the Steyr tractor lift system (stabilizers and brackets) on a clay loam soil of Bauchi-Nigeria in the Northern Guinea Savannah were investigated using quarter-bridge strain gauge circuit with temperature compensation. It was found that stress on these parts of the three-point linkage system increased with increase in speed of ploughing. The average stress values obtained were relatively higher when compared with the yield point stress (0. 23 kN/mm 2) of bracket material. The use of a spring loaded ‘U ’ bolt was found to reduce the stress...|$|E
40|$|Summary: In {{this thesis}} work, {{mathematical}} models required to simulate an offshore ploughing operation has been derived. This includes a surface vessel model, {{a model of}} the plough and its friction force due to seabed sediment and a towline model. A Dynamic Positioning control system has been derived in order to regulate the vessel to a desired location based on the plough’s desired position. A supervisor module has been derived in order to generate the vessel’s reference position in a smooth manner. And finally the total system has been implemented and simulated in the Simulink_TM environment. The surface vessel model derived in this assignment is based on an offshore supply vessel from the ”MatLab Marine GNC Toolbox” in Simulink_TM. The vertical motion of the vessel has been kept constant during simulations, {{based on the assumption that}} the buoyancy force of the vessel is large compared to the vertical towline force. The plough’s friction force due to penetration of the seabed sediment has been modeled, based on the content in reference [5], to get a realistic picture of the sediment forces involved in ploughing operations. It was found that the plough’s friction force profile changed with different operational boundaries. The boundaries are the ocean depth and the <b>ploughing</b> <b>speed.</b> For the boundaries in this assignment the resulting ploughing force equation were found to be nonlinear and shaped as a sigmoid function. In this assignment the lumped mass model has been derived for the towline’s motion and proven to give reasonably good numerical results when implemented in the Simulink TM environment. To get a realistic towline motion in seawater, a hydrodynamic quadratic damping force has been added to the equations. This hydrodynamic damping had effect on the towline’s tangential and normal motion components. The DP controller derived in this assignment consists of a PD-controller with feed forward signal from the horizontal towline tension. Feed forward signals are often influenced by noise and must be filtered to obtain low-frequency signals. In this assignment a ordinary 1 st-order low-pass filter has been used in order to damp out oscillations from the towline. This filter has been proven to give a good damping effect when the towline was exposed to underwater currents. The DP controller provides good position tracking quality. The supervisor module designed in this assignment consists of a reference generator an a reference model. The supervisor module is responsible for converting input signals for the plough’s desired path into a smooth tracking signal for the vessel’s control system. The reference generator produces smaller intermediate reference signals, as input to the reference model, from a final desired vessel position. A circle of acceptance has been introduced in order to change reference values at a convenient vessel location. This has been proven to give a nice effect on the vessel’s and the plough’s behavior. The reference model has been designed with a speed saturation element, in order to bound the speed of the ploughing operation. During the case simulations it was found that by defining the operation over a longer distance, a more efficient operation is gained. When crossing longer distances the plough will reach the vessel’s speed and underwater current disturbances are small compared to the ploughing force that has gotten time to be built up. Underwater currents has great influence on the towline when the towline’s pulling force is small. In appendix A a CD can be found. On this CD this report can be found, the original work schedule, pictures and the Simulink program for the ploughing operation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Farm Tractors {{acquired}} in Oyo State-Nigeria are primarily utilized for ploughing operations {{which represents the}} most costly single item in the budget of an arable farmer. Tractor fuel consumption constitutes a significant parameter that affects ploughing operations performances. Ploughing operations, using ASABE standard D 497. 5 were carried out using Massey Ferguson(MF 435, 100 hp), Fiat(F 130 D, 100 hp) and Steyr (CVT 170, 100 hp) tractors that were purchased in 2009. Field experiments were conducted at 5. 5, 6. 5 and 7. 5 km/h <b>ploughing</b> <b>speeds</b> for <b>ploughing</b> depths of 20, 25 and 30 cm. Mean fuel consumption for Fiat, MF and Steyr models were 23. 35, 23. 58 and 24. 55 l/ha while average of 16. 78, 22. 02 and 32. 67 l/ha of diesel were used to plough 20, 25 and 30 cm depths, respectively. Fuel consumption increased by 31 % when ploughing depth increased from 20 to 25 cm and 48 % when increased from 25 to 30 cm. Mean fuel consumption at 5. 5, 6. 5 and 7. 5 km/h <b>ploughing</b> <b>speeds</b> were 20. 0, 24. 25 and 27. 23 l/ha, respectively.

40|$|As {{the use of}} {{offshore}} renewable energy sources such as wind and wave energy systems expands, they represent an increasing portion of the energy mix. Subsea cables connecting these resources are subject to many hazards, making cable burial using cable ploughing an important tool in preventing unplanned outages and downtime.

40|$|In this {{research}} study, dimensional {{analysis was used}} to model the relationship between depth of cut, weight of disc plough and draught on a sandy loam soil. Field experiment was carried out on a site with three different moisture content levels at five different <b>plough</b> <b>speeds</b> (0. 83, 1. 39, 1. 94, 2. 4 and 2. 78 m/s). It was observed that the depth of penetration of plough disc increased with an increased draught and soil moisture content. The depth of cut was minimum at 4. 9 % and maximum at 9. 4 % moisture content. The result obtained from the validation shows that the model can be used effectively to determine the depth of cut in sandy loam soil at different soil moisture levels. Also the draught-speed relationship obtained from this study can be used to predict the power requirement of the disc plough in other soil types. The draught increase linearly with the depth of cut as predicted from the model. The result of the soil properties after tillage operation showed increased shear strength, bulk density and depth of cut...|$|R
40|$|Double {{cropping}} of paddy fields {{has become}} possible under rainfed condition {{with the introduction}} of improved varieties of rice with shorter term of growth and higher yields (HYVs) that were introduced in the 1960 s, and has progressively grown since then in Sri Lanka. The double cropping coupled with the labour intensive paddy production technology affected not only on the previous system of low-land utilization but also buffalo keeping and upland farming which were closely integrated with low-land farming during the single cropping. The dissemination of double cropping has compeled farmers to concentrate more on the improvement and maintenance of soil fertility, that might be exhausted through continuous cropping. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine and ascertain the development trend towards the double cropping of paddy fields with the changes of production technology and management strategies, from the aspect of improving soil fertility. For this purpose, a traditional village, Moragalla, was selected. Findings are summarized as follows: 1. The double cropping has been spread without any improvement of the field tracts. In addition to storing water for paddy fields, the higher and larger levees provided multipurposive benefits, such as grass cutting for buffaloes, growing some subsidiary crops on the top of levees, drying and temporarily storing reaped paddy produce. The usage of the levees in this way has coincided with single cropping of paddy fields, but has disintegrated mainly due to the changes of forming practices and the labour scarcity under the double cropping system since the 1960 s. The labour required for the maintenance of levees even has sometimes been cut. As a result, levee-breakes have tended to increase and accelerate soil erosion of the field. The reduction of the grass cut on the levees has also made it inconvenient for peasants to keep buffaloes. 2. The sharp reduction of buffalo numbers in the 1970 s was due to insufficient pasturing. The reasons for this were: (1) the lack of fallowed paddy fields which were fallowed in the yala season but were now raised to rice under the double cropping system in the paddy fields, (2) coconut lands on which the buffaloes previously pastured became scarce due to the introduction of intertilled crops such as banana, and (3) the decrease of waste lands, much of which had been reclaimed to coconut. The decrease in the number of buffaloes has resulted in poor manuring of paddy fields. 3. The lack of land improvement adversely affected not only on achieving higher yields of HYVs, but also the raising of other subsidiary crops on the paddy fields to improve the soil conditions through crop rotation. 4. Because of the yield sharing tenancy system and the traditional customs involved therein the adoption of advanced production technology is somewhat retarded. It goes without saying that there is less incentive for improving soil conditions under this system. 5. The iron (mold-board) plough replaced the indigenous wooden plough in the later part of the 1960 s. They were well suited for cultivating HYVs in the sense of <b>ploughing</b> <b>speed</b> and ploughing weeds under furrow slices. However, negatively, there have been some demerits. The ploughing with iron plough requires a larger quantity of water to cover the larger furrow slices and larger size of buffalo teams for trampling operations. The partial introduction of tractor ploughing since the 1960 s is also not more than a substitute for buffalo driven ploughing. 6. The development of farming practices has been centered on broadcast sowing on muddy soil with the application of chemical fertilizer both for basal and top dressings and chemical weedicides. This has tended to degenerate and ignore the traditional dry farming. It is the time to reevaluate the traditional dry farming, which has many merits, ie. : minimizing water requirements and labour input, and lowering farmers’ expenditure on chemical fertilizers and weedicides. 以上,スリランカのKurunegala県Moragalla村の家族経営による水稲作を中心とした経営様式の変遷を,農業生産力上昇のメカニズム,とりわけ地力再生産の在り方に注目し,近代的農法の発展過程を指標にして分析してきた. 時代の推移に伴い水稲の年 1 作(単作) から年 2 作(連作) になり,それが水田の土地利用率の向上をもたらし,農家の増収意欲を高め,農家への商品経済を浸透させてきた. この水稲作技術体系の変化は台地におけるココヤシ栽培や自給的野菜作部門と水牛飼育とも深い関係を持っている. Moragalla村における農業の変遷に見られる特徴を農法的視角から要約すれば以下の通りである. 1. 1950 年代までは水田畦畔の利用方法が水稲作の年 1 作と水牛飼育及び他の穀作や野菜作とうまく結びついていた. しかし水田の基盤整備が行なわれないままに,マハ期･ヤラ期を通ずる水稲の 2 期作が普及していったため,稲作の集約化は種々の困難に直面した. 水稲の 2 期作によって,貯水機能を兼ねた高い水田畦畔の補修労働が倍加したのみならず,畦畔の利用も規制され,水牛飼料(畦畔草) の採取が困難となり,また自給に供せられた穀物や野菜の作付けも困難となった. さらに水田休閑の解消は水牛の飼育を困難にし,頭数の減少をひきおこした. 水牛頭数の減少は,在来の木製犂に代えてより能率的な鉄製犂の導入を促していった. ここに見られる限り農法の近代化が進展している如くである. しかしその近代化は,水牛飼養を中心にした旧来の地力再生産機構の解体過程であった. 2. 従来からの田越灌漑のシステムはそのままであるため,改良品種の導入に伴って実施すべき用水管理は妨げられている. また農具の不備は,整地や除草作業の土で種々の困難をもたらしている. 水田畦畔は貯水機能を兼ねているため水牛の通行すら容易でない. 水稲の 2 期作化によってヤラ期における畦畔補修が必要となり,こうして畦畔補修作業は年 2 回遂行されるようになったが,時にその補修はおろそかになりがちである. 近年における畦畔決壊の増加傾向はそれを示すものであろう. 3. Moragalla村における小作には二種の形態が見られる. いずれの形態においても旧い社会的な慣習と結びついており,耕作者(小作人) の権利が抑制されている. そのため土地改良はおろか,稲の増収をはかるための改良技術の採用すらおさえられている. 4. 稲作の 2 期作化に伴って水牛の飼料基盤は縮小していったが,Moragalla村では,未墾地(台地) の開墾=ココヤシ園化によって一層飼料基盤は縮小された. 他方,乏しくなった堆肥や家庭残渣はココヤシ園に振向けられ,今ではMoragalla村の稲作は完全に化学肥料に依存することとなった. 5. 木製犂から鉄製犂への転換は,必ずしも深耕あるいは地力増進を契機とするものではなく,作業のスピード化と雑草抑制のためである. 大型トラクターの導入もまた同様の目的によっている. こうして地力による水稲の増収ではなく,化学肥料の増投による増収が追究されつつある. いまや省力化追求が稲作技術改善の中心的課題となり,除草も除草剤による傾向が顕著である. かつての地力維持の機構は解体されてしまったといっても過言ではない. 果たしてこのような変化が農法の進歩であろうか. 現在定着している湛水直播方式のみではなく,忘れられつつある乾田直播方式を軸にした農法を再検討すべきではないか. 用排水分離を前提にした耕地基盤の整備を考えるとき,代かき用水を必要としない乾田直播方式は極めて重要な意義をもつと思われる...|$|E
50|$|Organic {{gardening}} {{is designed}} {{to work with the}} ecological systems and minimally disturb the Earth’s natural balance. Because of this organic farmers have been interested in reduced-tillage methods. Conventional agriculture uses mechanical tillage, which is plowing or sowing, which is harmful to the environment. The impact of tilling in organic farming is much less of an issue. <b>Ploughing</b> <b>speeds</b> up erosion because the soil remains uncovered {{for a long period of}} time and if it has a low content of organic matter the structural stability of the soil decreases. Organic farmers use techniques such as mulching, planting cover crops, and intercropping, to maintain a soil cover throughout most of the year. The use of compost, manure mulch and other organic fertilizers yields a higher organic content of soils on organic farms and helps limit soil degradation and erosion.Other methods can also be used to supplement an existing garden. Methods such as composting, or vermicomposting. These practices are ways of recycling organic matter into some of the best organic fertilizers and soil conditioner. Vermicompost is especially easy. The byproduct is also an excellent source of nutrients for an organic garden.|$|R

The creation of commodious machinery especially power tiller for land preparation proved that it can improve ploughing quality and increased grain yield, but not only that, it is also reduces elapsed time {{and the costs of}} land preparation. The study was conducted to test the relationship between soil moisture versus <b>ploughing</b> depth, <b>speed</b> versus <b>ploughing</b> depth, and effective field capacity (EFC) versus fuel consumption using power tiller that is Two-Wheel Tractor (2 WT) (Model S 120). The data are collected such as percentage of soil moisture in the morning, afternoon and evening, time taken by machine during ploughing operation, total time including turning time, fuel consumption, ploughing depth. Replication was made 6 times in different plot and different soil moisture. Replication was made 2 times in the morning, 2 times in the afternoon and 2 times in the evening. The results show that the soil moisture 11. 38 % in the morning, 8. 33 % in the afternoon and 6. 53 % in the evening. Higher the soil moisture will increase the average of ploughing depth. This study shows that the average speed of power tiller during ploughing operation are 1. 0122, 1. 0519, 1. 088, 1. 11 02, 1. 1285 and 1. 1329 km/hr respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Ploughing {{is one of}} {{the most}} power {{consuming}} and expensive processes in agricultural production. It is known that the draft resistance of ploughs, the energy requirement for ploughing, the quality of ploughing and expenses depend on the plough body design, which is determined by the share-mouldboard parameters and the parameters of its supporting surfaces, as well as on such soil properties as its hardness, density, friction and adhesion, values of which are depending on soil mechanical composition, structure and humidity. Studies are carried out to determine the impact of the soil humidity on the ploughing resistance of the main soil types: sandy soil, loam and clay soils. It was cleared up that humidity most of all impacts the soil hardness and cutting resistance which considerably dominates in the summary resistance of the plough body. Increase in the soil humidity leads to decrease in the ploughing resistance that is more remarkable on clay soils. The working <b>speed</b> of the <b>plough</b> influences also the ploughing resistance. The optimum humidity of sticky clay soils when <b>ploughing</b> at the <b>speed</b> 2 … 2. 5 m s- 1 is 18 … 22 %.
