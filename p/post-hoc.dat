25|$|Included in the Indexes, at one point, {{were many}} of the great works of Spanish literature. Also, a number of {{religious}} writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published {{in the first place}} if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The answer lies in the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of <b>post-hoc</b> censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these results, an uncontrolled clinical trial was carried out at the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in St. Petersburg {{over a period of}} 17 years, and a controlled trial was carried out at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in California over period of 10 years, respectively. The Russian trial reported complete tumor regression in about 1% of cases, a partial response in about 3% of cases and some subjective improvement of symptoms in about half of the patients. The National Cancer Institute analysis of this trial notes that interpretation of these data is difficult, due to the absence of controls, the lack of information on prior treatment and the study's reliance on subjective assessments of symptoms (i.e. asking patients if the drug had made them feel any better). Overall, the trials in California saw no statistically significant effect on survival from hydrazine sulfate treatment, but noted increased calorie intake in treated patients versus controls. The authors also performed a <b>post-hoc</b> analysis on one or more subgroups of these patients, which they reported as suggesting a beneficial effect from treatment. The design and interpretation of this trial, and in particular the validity of this subgroup analysis, was criticized in detail in an editorial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.|$|E

500|$|Jason Cowley, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The Guardian, felt that Outliers was an argument between Gladwell and himself, referring to the many times that he uses the word [...] "we" [...] when defining his position, {{such as in the}} example: [...] "There is something profoundly wrong with the way we look at success. [...] We cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that {{the world in which we}} grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all." [...] He also believed that there was a [...] "certain one-dimensional Americanness at work", observing that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States, particularly in New York City. In an article about the book for The New York Times, Steven Pinker wrote, [...] "The reasoning in 'Outliers,' which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, <b>post-hoc</b> sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle."

2500|$|Gladwell's {{critics have}} {{described}} him as prone to oversimplification. The New Republic called the final chapter of Outliers, [...] "impervious to all forms of critical thinking" [...] and said Gladwell believes [...] "a perfect anecdote proves a fatuous rule". Gladwell has also been criticized for his emphasis on anecdotal evidence over research to support his conclusions. Maureen Tkacik and Steven Pinker have challenged the integrity of Gladwell's approach. Even while praising Gladwell's writing style and content, Pinker summed up Gladwell as [...] "a minor genius who unwittingly demonstrates the hazards of statistical reasoning", while accusing him of [...] "cherry-picked anecdotes, <b>post-hoc</b> sophistry and false dichotomies" [...] in his book Outliers. Referencing a Gladwell reporting mistake in which Gladwell refers to [...] "eigenvalue" [...] as [...] "Igon Value", Pinker criticizes his lack of expertise: [...] "I will call this the Igon Value Problem: when a writer's education on a topic consists in interviewing an expert, he is apt to offer generalizations that are banal, obtuse or flat wrong." [...] A writer in The Independent accused Gladwell of posing [...] "obvious" [...] insights. The Register has accused Gladwell of making arguments by weak analogy and commented Gladwell has an [...] "aversion for fact", adding: [...] "Gladwell {{has made a career}} out of handing simple, vacuous truths to people and dressing them up with flowery language and an impressionistic take on the scientific method." [...] In that regard, The New Republic has called him [...] "America's Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer". His approach was satirized by the online site [...] "The Malcolm Gladwell Book Generator".|$|E

5000|$|Power {{analysis}} {{can either be}} done before (a priori or prospective power analysis) or after (post hoc or retrospective power analysis) data are collected. A priori power analysis is conducted prior to the research study, and is typically used in estimating sufficient sample sizes to achieve adequate power. <b>Post-hoc</b> analysis of [...] "observed power" [...] is conducted after a study has been completed, and uses the obtained sample size and effect size to determine what the power was in the study, assuming the effect size in the sample {{is equal to the}} effect size in the population. Whereas the utility of prospective power analysis in experimental design is universally accepted, post hoc power analysis is fundamentally flawed. Falling for the temptation to use the statistical analysis of the collected data to estimate the power will result in uninformative and misleading values. In particular, {{it has been shown that}} <b>post-hoc</b> [...] "observed power" [...] is a one-to-one function of the p-value attained. This has been extended to show that all <b>post-hoc</b> power analyses suffer from what is called the [...] "power approach paradox" [...] (PAP), in which a study with a null result is thought to show more evidence that the null hypothesis is actually true when the p-value is smaller, since the apparent power to detect an actual effect would be higher. In fact, a smaller p-value is properly understood to make the null hypothesis relatively less likely to be true.|$|E
