40|$|The design {{analysis}} of a <b>conveyor</b> <b>mechanism</b> for an automatic car park is discussed. The conveyor assembly {{is made up of}} three units; the rack-pinion unit, the cable drive unit and the cantilever. The rack-pinion unit converts the rotational motion of a stepper motor to a linear forward and backward motion of the conveyor. The cable drive converts the rotational motion of another stepper motor to upward and downward motion of the cantilever to lift and lower the car at will. The cantilever is responsible for positioning the vehicle in the stack unit. The parameter for the cantilever is estimated to avoid excess deflection that could result from impact loading of a vehicle on the lift mechanism. The pinion-rack design for strength and rigidity is considered for the load required to be translated by the conveyor. The prototype was interfaced with a computer for operation using parallel port. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Millmerran Power Company generates 850 MW (mega watt) and {{produces}} electricity to about 1. 1 million {{houses in the}} south-east Queensland. The Power Station consists of two generating units. The Coal plant at Millmerran Power Station has been experiencing difficulties with the transfer of wet coal in the plant. These problems {{have led to a}} reduction in the availability of coal plant and blockages in the silos. This blockage caused by wet coal has led to a considerable amount of unit trips. The identification and reduction of problems with wet coal is vastly advantageous as it would result in a {{reduction in the number of}} unit trips. Therefore Millmerran Power Station which operates as a private investor would benefit significantly from this improvement. A detailed review of the coal handling <b>plant,</b> <b>conveyors</b> and chutes was carried out. The solution was to connect the Reclaim conveyor to the Stacker conveyor system through a Reblending conveyor system. By using this method the coal can be stacked in the emergency area until it is dry enough for handling...|$|R
40|$|A heating-transferring {{equipment}} {{of carbon}} fiber {{reinforced thermoplastic sheet}} (CFRTP sheet) for press forming was developed.

The height of the heater is 50 mm {{so that it can be}} inserted between the upper and the lower die when the die is open in order to minimize the distance between the heater and the die. The placing function of the heated CFRTP sheet was realized using the belt <b>conveyor</b> <b>mechanism</b> of combination of heating panel and belt.

40|$|Ferromanganese concretions {{from the}} Svalbard {{shelf in the}} Barents Sea show {{slightly}} convex shale-normalized REE patterns with no Eu anomalies. Concretions from the Gulf of Bothnia, {{northern part of the}} Baltic Sea, exhibit an enrichment of light REE and negative Eu anomalies. This difference is interpreted as a consequence of different <b>conveyor</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of the REE to the sediment. It is suggested that dissolving biogenic debris contributes to the convex pattern obtained in the Barents Sea, whereas an inorganic suspended fraction with scavenged REE is the main carrier in the Gulf of Bothnia. During oxic diagenesis in the sediment, the scavenged REE are set free into the porewater and contribute to the distribution pattern in concretions found in the Gulf of Bothnia. Small Mn-rich spheroidal concretions are enriched two to five times in REE compared to average shale, whereas Mn-poor flat concretions are low in REE. Specific surface area of the concretion and the depth of burial in the oxidized surface sediment are two factors that strongly affect the enrichment of the REE. Weak Ce anomalies are present in the analysed concretions and a redox level dependence is seen...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of an early}} pelagic juvenile of the discinid brachiopod Discinisca cf. tenuis elucidates the so far enigmatic origin of nanometric silicon chips covering the brachiopod's juvenile shell. The siliceous tablets are products of an intracellular process within specialized cells of the animal's inner mantle epithelium. These specialized cells are arranged in a circumferential row and contain vesicles, which provide 'reaction chambers' osmotically separated from the cytoplasm. Up to 15 tablets per vesicle are released into the cell by vesicle burst, followed by a coordinated extrusion onto the periostracum. In conjunction with the <b>conveyor</b> belt <b>mechanism</b> of periostracum formation, the regime of tablet release accounts for the highly ordered arrangement of siliceous tablets {{in parts of the}} shell's surface.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{different forms}} of industrial heritage with regard to representations of the past. Drawing on case studies in three different cities which have to varying degrees been affected the deindustrialization in the West during the last forty years, the study illustrates the variety and complexity of industrial heritage and the many challenges facing preservationists when industrial production ceases and large areas are left abandoned. Industrial heritage may {{be understood as a}} response to the challenge posed by production sites and industrial landscapes that are neither profitable nor aesthetically pleasing. In this sense one might say that the preservation of industrial heritage constitutes a pragmatic method for dealing with decrepit objects made redundant by deindustrialization. Blast furnaces, mines, coke <b>plants,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts and workshops are registered, evaluated, historicized and valued in ways which establish boundaries between waste and value, between what is worthy of preservation and what might be allowed to pass into oblivion. In this way industrial heritage is always already a form of sanctioned forgetting where some buildings are preserved while others perish. But what principles guide preservation work and what kind of understanding of the past is favored in the ways these former production plants are presented to the general public as cultural heritage? In a suburb outside Dortmund we find the inactive coke plant Kokerei Hansa which closed in 1992. Today the site has been reopened as a public monument and witness of a bygone era which seems both remote and exotic. Trees and plants have settled in the former coke plant making it resemble classical Greek or Roman ruins. In Odda the conflict concerning the preservation of an abandoned smelter has subsided and several buildings have been demolished in order to strike a balance between development and preservation. The situation here is, in clear contrast to Kokerei Hansa, not characterized by a remote and distanced perspective on the industrial heritage. In Blaenavon in South Wales the abandoned coal mine Big Pit has been turned into a museum where the central question concerns the appropriate form of industrial heritage: Who can legitimately claim to speak on behalf of the industrial past in the Welsh coalfield...|$|R
