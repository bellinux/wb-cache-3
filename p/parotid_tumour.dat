40|$|Background: The {{spectrum}} of parotid disease in southern Africa has not previously been reported. Methods: A review of all parotidectomies {{performed by a}} single surgeon {{over a period of}} 10 years (1994 - 2004) in Cape Town, South Africa, is presented. Data were collected from a retrospective chart review. Results: One hundred and ninety-nine parotidectomies were performed and 196 pathology reports were reviewed. Pleomorphic adenoma was the most common benign tumour and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the most common malignancy. Warthin's tumour had an equal gender distribution. Forty-five per cent of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours</b> in males were malignant. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in diagnosing malignancy were 73 %, 98 % and 94 % respectively. Conclusions: In South African males almost half of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours</b> are malignant. Warthin's tumours are less common in Africa than in the West, and did not show a male preponderance.

40|$|A {{salivary gland}} tumour most often {{presents}} as an asymptomatic swelling, peri-auricularly for a <b>parotid</b> <b>tumour,</b> below the mandible for the submandibular gland, and intraorally -causing ill-fitting dental prostheses- for tumours {{of the minor}} salivary glands. The work-up for parotid tumours aims at determining the risk to the facial nerve by estimating location, extent and chance of malignancy, the latter being less than 25 % in any <b>parotid</b> <b>tumour,</b> and higher in the other sites (submandibular 40 %, minor 50 %, sublingual 80 %). Suspect clinical findings are lymphadenopathy, fixation to skin or deeper structures, rapid tumour enlargement and facial palsy. Ultrasound is important as guidance for fine needle aspiration cytology to rule out non-neoplastic lesions and to identify malignancy in neoplastic lesions.

40|$|SUMMARY A 23 {{year old}} woman {{presented}} with facial pain, a right <b>parotid</b> <b>tumour</b> and iron deficiency anaemia. She had several cutaneous venous swellings and tumours {{with a similar}} appearance {{were found in the}} large bowel. Histological examination of the <b>parotid</b> <b>tumour</b> and angiography of the skin and gut lesions confirmed that they were venous in origin. The aetiology, classification, and complications of disorders of the venous system and the importance of using a tourniquet to examine the peripheral veins is discussed. There is an ill defined group of conditions character-ised by the coexistence of lesions in both the skin and the internal organs. For example, in blue rubber bleb naevus disease haemangiomas in the skin are associ-ated with vascular polyps in the bowel. The latter may give rise to occult or frank gastrointestinal tract bleeding resulting in anaemia. We have recently investigated a woman who presented with anaemia and a unilateral parotid swelling. She also had unusual skin lesions which seemed to arise from veins, and we found vascular tumours with similar appearances in the large bowel. This combination of abnormalities led to the diagno-sis of blue rubber bleb naevus disease. Angiography confirmed that the skin and the bowel lesions were part of the venous system. This case illustrates firstly that careful examination of the skin of patients with anaemia may reveal the cause, and secondly how detailed investigation of vascular lesions helps in classification.

30|$|According to Belghiti et al., {{fewer than}} 19 cases of {{malignant}} <b>parotid</b> gland <b>tumours</b> in {{children have been}} published, with mucoepidermoid carcinoma accounting for approximately one third of these [34].|$|R
40|$|Salivary gland tumours are uncommon, {{representing}} {{less than}} 6 % of {{head and neck}} neoplasm. Pleomorphic adenoma {{is the most common}} benign epithelial salivary gland neoplasm, comprising 50 %- 74 % of all <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours.</b> It is followed by Warthin's tumour (4 - 14 %). The authors retrospectively reviewed 282 eligible patients surgically treated for <b>parotid</b> gland <b>tumours</b> in the last 10 years, focusing on 231 benign epithelial neoplasms. Clinical and diagnostic findings, surgical treatment and surgical outcome were discussed. The diagnosis of a parotid gland neoplasm must be considered in any patient presenting with a lump near the mandible. Smoking habit is important in Warthin's tumour pathogenesis. Fine needle aspiration citology (FNAC) can't lead alone to histological diagnosis. Only surgery can give histological certainty of benignity, thus preventing malignant degeneration, lump infection or risk of size-dependent surgical complications. Conservative formal parotidectomy appears to be the treatment of choice. Tumour pseudopodia and capsule ruptures are recognised factors involved in pleomorphic adenoma recurrences but also tumour multicentricity might play an important role...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fine needle {{aspiration}} cytology is {{a widely}} practiced technique in the diagnosis of parotid lump. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a simple, quick, inexpensive and minimally invasive technique used to diagnose different types of masses. In otolaryngology, FNAC’s greatest utility is in the diagnosis of neck masses. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of FNAC in the diagnosis of parotid mass. Parotid gland lesions form about 2 - 6. 5 % of all head and neck neoplasms in adults. They are easily accessible by FNAC, also cytology can provide a distinction between parotid and non-parotid lesion, benign and malignant lesions, and specific and non specific inflammation. Methods: 50 patients were studied prospectively over 2 years. FNAC was done using 10 cc syringes and 20 - 22 G. needle and stained with papanicular stain. Histopathology was assessed on routine H & E (haematoxylin and eosin) stained paraffin sections. Results: Sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing malignant and benign tumours were 75 %, 95. 2 %, and 92. 5 %, 80 %, respectively, and 90 % of benign tumours were accurately typed on fine-needle aspiration cytology compared with 92 % in the malignant group. Conclusion: Fine-needle aspiration cytology is useful in the preoperative assessment of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours</b> as it is more reliable than clinical examination to diagnose malignant <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours.</b> FNA cytology is useful in avoiding surgery (inflammatory lesions) or limiting surgical procedures (benign <b>tumours).</b> Key words: <b>Parotid</b> gland tumour; Fine needle cytology DOI: [URL] BSMMU J 2011; 4 (2) : 65 - 69 </p...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{treated for}} {{head and neck}} tumours with local {{radiotherapy}} (RT) on the neck harbour {{an increased risk of}} stroke.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to clarify and explain the epidemiological features of parotid tumors in a Senegalese context, to highlight the importance of clinical examination when access to complementary investigations is limited, to discuss respective indications and finally to describe certain aspects of treatment in our context. Materials and methodsThis retrospective study of 114 cases of parotidectomy spans 16 years, from 1992 to 2007. It was performed in the ENT department of University Hospital of Fann, Senegal. All patients operated on for chronic mass of the parotid region for whom histological results were available when initially included. Benign swellings were subsequently excluded. The study parameters were epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical and surgical. ResultsThe 114 parotidectomies showed a predominance of benign tumours: 63 procedures (55. 26 %) essentially concerned pleomorphic adenoma; 30 cases (26. 31 %) concerned malignant <b>tumours,</b> mainly <b>parotid</b> adenocarcinoma. There were 21 cases of benign swelling (18. 4 %). The study focused on the series of 93 cases of benign and malignant <b>tumours</b> of the <b>parotid</b> gland. Both sexes were affected similarly. All age groups were concerned, from 5 to 89 years. A total of 97 % of patients underwent surgery: conservative total parotidectomy in 75. 51 % of cases. ConclusionAlthough there are features specific to the local context, the epidemiological profile of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours</b> is well-known. Indications for complementary investigations are discussed, as availability in Senegal is restricted, highlighting the important role of clinical examination in the management of <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours</b> is parotidec-tomy (partial or total) with sparing {{of the facial}} nerve when-ever possible. The spectrum of parotid neoplasms requiring parotidectomy has been reported extensively in the European and American literature. 1, 2 There have been a few reports of pathology seen in some parts of Africa, 3 - 6 but the spectrum of parotid disease in southern Africa has not been reported. Parotidectomy is most commonly performed for benign tumours, of which pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin’s tumour are the most common. The disease spectrum dif-fers in the African population compared to that of the West, with an increased ratio of malignant to benign tumours in Africa, and Warthin’s tumours occurring less commonly. 3 - 6 Metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) {{has been shown to be}} a common cause of parotidectomy in the Australian population. 7, 8 South Africa also has a high inci-dence of skin cancer, and would presumably reflect this in its spectrum of parotid disease. The extent of preoperative investigation for <b>parotid</b> <b>tumours</b> is a controversial issue, as fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be unhelpful, and radiological investigation, especially for benign tumours, often does little to add to the diagnosis and management. Facial palsy is the most important and disfiguring conse-quence or complication following parotidectomy. Studies have shown that immediate facial nerve dysfunction follow-ing parotid surgery is common (46 %), but that permanent dysfunction is uncommon (4 %). 9 The reported incidence of long-term dysfunction is higher in revision cases and with extended (subtotal or total) parotidectomy. 10 This study details the experience of the second author (J.

40|$|Distinguishing keratoacanthoma from well-differentiated squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{is often}} difficult {{on account of the}} clinical and histopathological similarities between them. Since the outcome of treatment depends on identifying the correct diagnosis and having the correct treatment on time, it is essential to differentiate keratoacanthoma and squamous-cell carcinoma as soon and accurately as possible. A paradigmatic case is herein reported. An 85 year-old female underwent total parotidectomy and ipsilateral neck dissection due to the squamous-cell carcinoma of the parotid gland. The investigations, in order to determine whether the tumour was a metastatic or a primary one, led to a misdiagnosis. A prior skin lesion, which was excised over her left cheek one year ago in another clinic, was diagnosed as keratoacanthoma. However, the histopathological revision of the specimen revealed that the lesion was in fact a squamous-cell carcinoma.

40|$|Background: The {{parotid gland}} is the mostly {{affected}} site among major salivary gland tumors {{in up to}} 85 % of cases. Preoperative knowledge of the tumour nature is crucial since it influences the surgical procedure and patient’s morbidity, especially the risk of facial nerve palsy. Ultrasonography is commonly used as the first line imaging modality for the salivary gland lesions. A pitfall is that the histologic pleomorphism often reflects an imaging pleomorphism. Case Report: Herein we aimed to present the role of elastosonography in three parotid lesions: a case of benign pleomorphic adenoma, a Wharthin’s tumour and a malignant <b>parotid</b> <b>tumour.</b> Conclusions: Our findings show that malignant parotid lesion was the stiffest lesion according to elastosonography. Wharthin’s tumour demonstrated soft elastosonographic features. The pleomorphic adenoma was also interpreted as stiff by elastosonography suggesting that the elastosonographic features of pleomorphic adenoma may resemble those of malignant lesions limiting {{the utility of the}} technique...|$|E
