25|$|Amundsen set {{out from}} Kristiania (Oslo) in June 1903 and was west of the Boothia Peninsula by late September. The Gjøa was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>harbour</b> on the south shore of King William Island; by October 3 she was iced in. There the {{expedition}} remained for nearly two years, with the expedition members learning from the local Inuit people and undertaking measurements to determine {{the location of the}} North Magnetic Pole. The harbour, now known as Gjoa Haven, later developed as the only permanent settlement on the island.|$|R
50|$|Gjøa {{left the}} Oslofjord on June 16, 1903, {{and made for}} the Labrador Sea west of Greenland. From there she crossed Baffin Bay and navigated the narrow, icy straits of the Arctic Archipelago. By late September Gjøa was west of the Boothia Peninsula and began to {{encounter}} worsening weather and sea ice. Amundsen <b>put</b> her <b>into</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>harbour</b> on the south shore of King William Island; by October 3 she was iced in.|$|R
5000|$|In 1903, the Norwegian {{explorer}} Roald Amundsen {{had entered}} the area on his ship Gjøa in an expedition intending to travel through the Northwest Passage. By October the straits through which he was travelling began to ice up. Amundsen <b>put</b> Gjøa <b>into</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>harbour</b> on the southeast coast of King William Island. He stayed there, in what Amundsen called [...] "the finest little harbor in the world", for nearly two years. He and his crew spent much of that time with the local Netsilik Inuit, learning from them the skills to live off the land and travel efficiently in the Arctic environment. This knowledge proved to be vital for Amundsen's later successful exploration to the South Pole. He explored the Boothia Peninsula, searching for {{the exact location of}} the North Magnetic Pole.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Richard looked relieved. 'Then it {{may still}} be magic. It was magic to us. And so we voyaged. When the wind served we hoisted sail, and lay all up along the {{windward}} rail, our shields on our backs to break the spray. When it failed, they rowed with long oars; the Yellow Man sat by the Wise Iron, and Witta steered. At first I feared the great white-flowering waves, but as I saw how wisely Witta led his ship among them I grew bolder. Hugh liked it well from the first. My skill is not upon the water; and rocks and whirlpools such as we saw by the West Isles of France, where an oar caught on a rock and broke, are much against my stomach. We sailed South across a stormy sea, where by moonlight, between clouds, we saw a Flanders ship roll clean over and sink. Again, though Hugh laboured with Witta all night, I lay under the deck with the Talking Bird, and cared not whether I lived or died. There is a sickness of the sea which for three days is pure death! When we next saw land Witta said it was Spain, and we stood out to sea. That coast was full of ships busy in the Duke's war against the Moors, and we feared to be hanged by the Duke's men or sold into slavery by the Moors. So we <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> small <b>harbour</b> which Witta knew. At night men came down with loaded mules, and Witta exchanged amber out of the North against little wedges of iron and packets of beads in earthen pots. The pots he put under the decks, and the wedges of iron he laid {{on the bottom of}} the ship after he had cast out the stones and shingle which till then had been our ballast. Wine, too, he bought for lumps of sweet-smelling grey amber--a little morsel no bigger than a thumbnail purchased a cask of wine. But I speak like a merchant.' ...|$|R

50|$|All {{of these}} linearized objects are <b>put</b> <b>into</b> {{envelopes}} that enable {{the client and}} server agents to coordinate their processing. In DDM architecture, these envelopes are called Data Stream Structures (DSS). Commands are <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Request DSS (RQSDSS), replies are <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Reply DSS (RPYDSS), and other objects are <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> Object DSS (OBJDSS). There can be only one command in a RQSDSS and only one reply in RPYDSS, but many objects, such as records, can be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> OBJDSS. Further many OBJDSSes can be chained to a RQSDSS or a PRYDSS to accommodate as many objects as necessary A DSS consists of the total length of the DSS, a flag byte identifying the type of DSS, a request identifier, and the linearized objects in the DSS. The request identifier ties an RQSDSS with subsequent OBJDSSes from the client, such as the records to be loaded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> file by the Load File command. The request identifier also ties the RQSDSS from the client with a RPYDSS or the OBJDSSes from the server to the client.|$|R
