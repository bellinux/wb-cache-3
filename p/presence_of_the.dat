5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin {{with some of the}} dibromoalkane also produced.

5|$|An uncompetitive {{inhibitor}} cannot bind to {{the free}} enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most effective at high substrate concentration.

On February 15, 1971, after the unconsulted election of the Dean of the Division of Social Science and Economics, some students took the rectory. This marked the first incursion of the police force to the university campus. For these events, some professors and students were expelled of the university. Nevertheless, the support for the rector dropped, who had to resign. Since mid February to April, the university was closed until the new rector was appointed.|$|E
