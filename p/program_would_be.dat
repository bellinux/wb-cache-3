5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this {{has been attributed to}} poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes for earthquake-safe buildings. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding <b>program</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E

25|$|It was {{announced}} in June 2000 that the athletics <b>program</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> phased out {{as part of the}} change from a junior college to a four-year college, due mainly to the costs associated with running a college athletic department, and the desire to develop a more comprehensive participatory student activities program.|$|E

25|$|Nagel's replacement, Mike Giddings {{posted a}} record of 9–12 (.429) during the 1966 and 1967 seasons before resigning. Giddings had {{previously}} been an assistant coach at USC under legendary head coach John McKay and brought with him hopes that the Utes football <b>program</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> turned around, but an inability to get recruiting going led to on-field issues that essentially prevented any chance of viable football success.|$|E

50|$|AOHell was {{the first}} program of its kind, but it spawned {{a very large number}} of copycats, some of which rivaled AOHell itself in quality.

New <b>programs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> developed and released regularly by the community of coders that sites like this fostered.

25|$|In 1999, Sacramento State {{was given}} {{authority}} to award its first ever Doctoral degree, a unique find {{at the time}} in the California State University.

However, White House Spokesman Jay Carney said negotiations with Iran over its nuclear <b>program</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on the agenda, among other topics.|$|E
25|$|Red {{was founded}} on March 7, 2007, in a merger of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party.

However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E
25|$|While {{not itself}} {{a part of}} the New Deal, the Roosevelt {{administration}} kept a close eye on the challenge to the 1934 Railroad Retirement Act, Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co.. Its similarity with the Social Security Act meant the test of the railroad pension regime would serve as an indicator of whether Roosevelt's ambitious retirement <b>program</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> found constitutional. The railroad pension was designed to encourage older rail workers to retire, thereby creating jobs for younger railroaders desperately in need of work, although ostensibly Congress passed the act {{on the grounds that it}} would increase safety on the country's railways.|$|E
