25|$|Though Ford's novels {{varied in}} setting and style, several {{were of the}} Bildungsroman (coming-of-age) type: in Web of Angels, The Final Reflection, Princes of the Air, Growing Up Weightless, and The Last Hot Time, Ford wrote {{variations}} {{on the theme of}} growing up, learning about one's world and one's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> and taking responsibility for it – which involves taking on the power and wisdom to influence events, to help {{make the world a better}} place.|$|E
25|$|It {{remains a}} paradox of the mystics that the {{passivity}} {{at which they}} appear to aim is really {{a state of the}} most intense activity: more, that where it is wholly absent no great creative action can take <b>place.</b> <b>In</b> <b>it,</b> the superficial self compels itself to be still, in order that it may liberate another more deep-seated power which is, in the ecstasy of the contemplative genius, raised to the highest pitch of efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In pre-Islamic Arabia, it was {{customary}} {{to identify}} a year after a major event which took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Thus, according to Islamic tradition, Abraha, governor of Yemen, then a province of the Christian Kingdom of Aksum (Ethiopia), attempted to destroy the Kaaba with an army which included several elephants. The raid was unsuccessful, but that year {{became known as the}} Year of the Elephant, during which Muhammad was born (sura al-Fil). Most equate this to the year AD 570, but a minority use AD 571.|$|E

25|$|This {{introductory}} section {{has focused}} on the spacetime of special relativity, since it is the easiest to describe. Minkowski spacetime is flat, takes no account of gravity, is uniform throughout, and serves as nothing more than a static background for the events that take <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> The presence of gravity greatly complicates the description of spacetime. In general relativity, spacetime is no longer a static background, but actively interacts with the physical systems that it contains. Spacetime curves in the presence of matter, can propagate waves, bends light, and exhibits a host of other phenomena. A few of these phenomena are described in the later sections of this article.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} {{powerful}} factor which works against {{the chance of}} any kind of peaceful reconstruction and which is equally negative for all levels of society: this is the extreme isolation in which the regime has placed both society and itself. This isolation has not only separated the regime from society, and all sectors of society from each other, but also put the country in extreme isolation {{from the rest of the}} world. This isolation has created for all—from the bureaucratic elite to the lowest social levels—an almost surrealistic picture of the world and of their <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Yet the longer this state of affairs helps to perpetuate the status quo, the more rapid and decisive will be its collapse when confrontation with reality becomes inevitable.|$|E
25|$|Martin and Sugarman {{describe}} {{memory and}} imagination as two ontic (real) characteristics {{of human nature}} which are vital to humans' capacity for dialogue. According to Martin and Sugarman, it is through both that {{people are able to}} remember the conversations that “we furnished with the symbolic and relational tools we require to consider past experiences and previous learning, and to entertain future possibilities” because memory allows humans to reconstruct their past while imagination allows them “to project selves into the future”. In other words, when humans converse with others, they recall memories and imagine future possibilities to help themselves mentally construct potential ways for understanding themselves (self-interpretation) and their world, and their <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> so they know how to relate to others.|$|E

25|$|The union {{continued}} {{to expand its}} membership after World War II, reaching its apex at 500,000 members in 1965, one year after Dubinsky's retirement. Dubinsky's focus on maintaining {{the stability of the}} industry and the union's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> dampened the union's desire to gain significant wage increases for its members. The union gradually lost its ability to keep sweatshop conditions from returning, even in the former center of its strength in New York. While the union still had one-half million members in the years immediately after Dubinsky's retirement, the forces that brought about the decline and eventual disappearance of the ILGWU thirty years later, when it merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union to form the union known as UNITE, were already at work. In his last years, Dubinsky was often accessible to the union's members.|$|E
25|$|Our {{ideas about}} God are {{important}} indicators {{of how we}} view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our {{vision of the world}} – and our <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{prominent}} cartouch on the 1955 addition {{became a}} symbol of the Titche-Goettinger company and can be found {{in other areas of the}} building. It is made of solid Indiana limestone and stands 28 feet high by 26 feet across, covering part of the building's fifth, sixth and seventh floors. The design was created by the architectural firm of Thomas Jameson and Merrill. The center portion is topped by a star signifying the Lone Star State and Titche's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> On each side of the star are live oak leaves mixed in with cactus blossoms. Below the star on the left is a scale indicating full measure and value. On the right, a ship indicating the world of commerce. Nine cotton bolls are indicative of Texas farm life and the textile industry, and on the right are the initials of the store. The six national flags of Texas are shown, representing the United States, Confederacy, France, (on the left) Texas, Mexico and Spain (on the right).|$|E

500|$|SimTower: The Vertical Empire (known as [...] in Japan) is a {{construction}} and management simulation video game developed by OpenBook Co., Ltd. {{and published by}} Maxis for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh System 7 operating systems in November 1994. In Japan, it was published by OpenBook that same year and was later released for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in 1996. The game allows players to build and manage a tower and decide what facilities to <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> in order to ultimately build a five-star tower. Random events take place during play, such as terrorist acts that the player must respond to immediately.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there is}} an {{alternative}} reading possible, which may be closer to the facts of Traherne's experience as he expresses them in the quote above. [...] This is that he did not suffer a loss of faith, but rather identified his maturation away from a natural, innocent child's view of the world and his <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> from an innate understanding of the wonder of God's creation, to a burdened grappling with the rules and expectation of church and society as an apostasy itself, which he had to overcome then by careful and disciplined study ("the highest reason"). [...] This childlike, accepting, and joyous view of faith and religious ecstasy {{is at the core of}} the writing from which the excerpt above is drawn, and is part of the reason for Traherne's appeal.|$|E
500|$|Dostoyevsky's Petersburg is {{the city}} of unrelieved poverty; [...] "magnificence has no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold". Dostoyevsky connects the city's {{problems}} to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions. The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoyevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that [...] "the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind {{in the way that}} its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched." [...] The inner turmoil suffered by Raskolnikov can also be perceived as a Shakespearean pathetic fallacy. For example, the great storm in Shakespeare's King Lear reflects the state of the titular character's mind, much like the chaos, disorder and noise of St. Petersburg reflects the state of Raskolnikov's mind.|$|E

500|$|Since the 1950s, {{academic}} {{assessment of}} the Earl of Leicester has undergone considerable changes. Leicester's importance in literary patronage was established by Eleanor Rosenberg in 1955. Elizabethan Puritanism has been thoroughly reassessed since the 1960s, and Patrick Collinson has outlined the Earl's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Dudley's religion could thus be better understood, rather than simply to brand him as a hypocrite. His importance as a privy councillor and statesman has often been overlooked, one reason being {{that many of his}} letters are scattered among private collections and not easily accessible in print, as are those of his colleagues Walsingham and Cecil. Alan Haynes describes him as [...] "one of the most strangely underrated of Elizabeth's circle of close advisers", while Simon Adams, who since the early 1970s has researched many aspects of Leicester's life and career, concludes: [...] "Leicester was as central a figure to the 'first reign' [...] as Burghley." ...|$|E
500|$|Even in {{the late}} 19th century, the islanders could {{communicate}} {{with the rest of}} the world only by lighting a bonfire on the summit of Conachair which would, weather permitting, be visible to those on the isles of Harris and the Uists, or by using the [...] "St Kilda mailboat". This was the invention of John Sands, who visited in 1877. During his stay, a shipwreck left nine Austrian sailors marooned there, and by February supplies were running low. Sands attached a message to a lifebuoy salvaged from the Peti Dubrovacki and threw it into the sea. Nine days later it was picked up in Birsay, Orkney, and a rescue was arranged. The St Kildans, building on this idea, would fashion a piece of wood into the shape of a boat, attach it to a bladder made of sheepskin, and <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> a small bottle or tin containing a message. Launched when the wind came from the north-west, two-thirds of the messages were later found on the west coast of Scotland or, less conveniently, in Norway.|$|E
500|$|The autumn {{work was}} {{somewhat}} {{in reaction to}} the recent compositions of Christ in the Garden of Olives by his friends Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard. [...] Frustrated by their work which he qualified with the words [...] "nothing was observed", Van Gogh painted [...] "in the groves, morning and evening during these clear, cold days, but in beautiful, bright sunshine" [...] resulting in five canvases above the three he completed earlier in the year. He wrote to his brother, Theo, [...] "What I have done is a rather hard and coarse reality beside their abstractions, but it will have a rustic quality and will smell of the earth." [...] Rather than attempting to recreate what the scene might have been like, he explained [...] "one can express anguish without making reference to the actual Gethsemane, and... {{there is no need to}} portray figures from the Sermon on the Mount in order to express a gentle and comforting feeling." [...] He also commented: [...] "I shall not paint a Christ in the Garden of Olives, but shall paint the olive harvest as one might see it today, and by giving the human figure its proper <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> one might perhaps be reminded of it." ...|$|E
