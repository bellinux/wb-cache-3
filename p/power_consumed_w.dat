30|$|Energy {{calculations}} for microwave based process need {{to consider}} the actual microwave power applied into the process. Leadbeater conducted batch and continuous flow microwave experiments using 4.6  L batch vessel and flow rates 2  L/min, 7.2  L/min. Energy consumption rates reported from this study are comparable to energy consumption by conventional method. Process energy requirements were calculated based on both actual <b>power</b> <b>consumed</b> and actual microwave power delivered (65 % of the power setting) by the system. Overall conversion (oil to FAMEs) rates of 97.9 and 98.9 % were reported for these tests. For instance, considering preliminary analysis for 2  L continuous flow conditions, the initial assumption was that the microwave unit would operate at an average of 66 % of maximum power (1100 <b>W</b> microwave input; <b>power</b> <b>consumed</b> 2600 <b>W)</b> as observed when the reaction was performed. On the basis of this, energy consumption would be 60.3  kJ/L of biodiesel prepared. If the microwave was operating at full power (1600 W; <b>power</b> <b>consumed</b> 2600 <b>W),</b> energy consumption would be 92.3  kJ/L of biodiesel prepared. For a batch process, calculations were based on the process to heat a 4.6  L reaction mixture to the target temperature of 50 °C which takes 3.5  min using a microwave power of 1300 W. With a hold time of 1  min at 50 °C, a total reaction time of 4.5  min is given. Assuming that the microwave power remains constant at 1300 W throughout the process, the energy consumption would be 90.1  kJ/L of biodiesel prepared. In reality, the power drops once the target temperature is reached. Thus, this is an overestimation of energy consumption [110].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A resolution-rate {{scalable}} ADC for micro-sensor net-works is described. Based on {{the successive}} approximation register (SAR) architecture, this ADC has two resolution modes: 12 bit and 8 bit, and its sampling rate is scalable, at a constant figure-of-merit, from 0 – 100 kS/s and 0 – 200 kS/s, respectively. At the highest per-formance point (i. e., 12 bit, 100 kS/s), the entire ADC (including digital, analog, and reference <b>power)</b> <b>consumes</b> 25 <b>W</b> from a 1 -V supply. The ADC’s CMRR is enhanced by common-mode inde-pendent sampling and passive auto-zero reference generation.
