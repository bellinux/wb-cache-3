40|$|The STS- 55 initial launch attempt of Columbia (OV 102) was {{terminated}} on KSC launch pad A March 22, 1993 at 9 : 51 AM E. S. T. due to violation of an ME- 3 (Engine 2011) Launch Commit Criteria (LCC) limit exceedance. The event description and timeline are summarized. Propellant loading was initiated on 22 March, 1993 at 1 : 15 AM EST. All SSME chill parameters and launch commit criteria (LCC) were nominal. At engine start plus 1. 44 seconds, a Failure Identification (FID) was posted against Engine 2011 for exceeding the 50 psia Oxidizer Preburner (OPB) <b>purge</b> <b>pressure</b> redline. The engine {{was shut down}} at 1. 50 seconds followed by Engines 2034 and 2030. All shut down sequences were nominal and the mission was safely aborted. The OPB <b>purge</b> <b>pressure</b> redline violation and the abort profile/overlay for all three engines are depicted. SSME Avionics hardware and software performed nominally during the incident. A review of vehicle data table (VDT) data and controller software logic revealed no failure indications other than the single FID 013 - 414, OPB <b>purge</b> <b>pressure</b> redline exceeded. Software logic was executed according to requirements {{and there was no}} anomalous controller software operation. Immediately following the abort, a Rocketdyne/NASA failure investigation team was assembled. The team successfully isolated the failure cause to the oxidizer preburner augmented spark igniter purge check valve not being fully closed due to contamination. The source of the contaminant was traced to a cut segment from a rubber O-ring which was used in a fine clean tool during valve production prior to 1992. The valve was apparently contaminated during its fabrication in 1985. The valve had performed acceptably on four previous flights of the engine, and SSME flight history shows 780 combined check valve flights without failure. The failure of an Engine 3 (SSME No. 2011) check valve to close was sensed by onboard engine instruments even though all other engine operations were normal. This resulted in an engine shutdown and safe sequential shutdown of all three engines prior to ignition of the solid boosters...|$|E

In order to achieve these conditions, the tests were {{carried out in the}} National Transonic Facility operating under cryogenic conditions in a nitrogen environment.

40|$|Contaminants from an instrument's self-generated sources or {{from sources}} {{external}} to the instrument may degrade its critical surfaces and/or create an environment which limits the instrument's intended performance. Analyses {{have been carried out}} on a method to investigate the required purging flow of clean, dry gas to prevent the ingestion of external contaminants into the instrument container volume. The pressure to be maintained and the required flow are examined in terms of their effectiveness in preventing gaseous and particulate contaminant ingestion and abatement of self-generated contaminants in the volume. The required venting area or the existing volume venting area is correlated to the volume to be <b>purged,</b> the allowable <b>pressure</b> differential across the volume, the external contaminant partial pressure, and the sizes of the ambient particulates. The diffusion of external water vapor into the volume while it was being purged was experimentally obtained in terms of an infiltration time constant. That data and the acceptable fraction of the outside pressure into the volume indicate the required flow of purge gas expressed in terms of volume change per unit time. The exclusion of particulates is based on the incoming velocity of the particles and the exit flow speed and density of the purge gas. The <b>purging</b> flow <b>pressures</b> needed to maintain the required flows through the vent passages are indicated. The purge gas must prevent or limit the entrance of the external contaminants to the critical locations of the instrument. It should also prevent self- contamination from surfaces, reduce material outgassing, and sweep out the outgassed products. Systems and facilities that can benefit from purging may be optical equipment, clinical facilities, manufacturing facilities, clean rooms, and other systems requiring clean environments...|$|R

40|$|The breeder thermal {{performances}} under a {{purge line}} break have been analyzed for two blanket design options: a blanket design using a packed breeder {{bed and a}} blanket design using a sintered breeder product. Under a purge line break open to a vacuum environment, the packed bed breeder temperature exceeds its operating temperature limit {{at a faster rate}} than that of the sintered breeder blanket design for the same breeder temperature gradient. Depending on the breeder material and nominal operating conditions, the breeder eaches its maximum operating temperature in time ranging from 32 seconds to 125 seconds for a break area of 10 cm 2 in packed bed designs. However for the sintered product design, the consequence of this transient might not result in the breeder exceeding its maximum operating temperature if a reasonable contact pressure could be established at the interface.

40|$|The eighth {{bench scale}} test of POC program, Run PB- 08, was {{successfully}} completed from August 8 to August 26, 1997. A total of five operating conditions were tested aiming at evaluating the reactivity of different pyrolysis oils in liquefaction of a Wyoming sub-bituminous coal (Black Thunder coal). For the first time, water soluble promoters {{were incorporated into}} the iron-based GelCat to improve the dispersion of the promoter metals in the feed blend. The concentration of the active metals, Mo and Fe, was 100 and 1000 ppm of moisture-free coal, respectively. Black Thunder coal used in this run was the same batch as tested in HTI�s Run POC- 02. Similar to Runs PB- 01 through 7, this run employed two back mixed slurry reactors, an interstage gas/slurry separator and a direct-coupled hydrotreater. In addition to the hot vapor from the second stage separator, the first stage separator overhead liquid was also fed to the hydrotreater, which was packed with Criterion C- 411 hydrotreating catalyst. Pyrolysis oil was produced off-line from a pyrolysis unit acquired from University of Wyoming. Solids rejection was achieved by <b>purging</b> out <b>pressure</b> filter solid. The recycle solvents consisted of O- 6 separator bottoms and pressure filter liquid (PFL). The Run PB- 08 proceeded very smoothly without any interruptions. Coal conversion consistently above 90 W% was achieved. High resid conversion and distillate yield have been obtained from co-processing of coal and 343 °C+ (650 °F+) pyrolysis oil. Light gas (C 1 -C 3) yield was minimized and hydrogen consumption was reduced due {{to the introduction of}} pyrolysis oil, compared with conventional coal-derived solvent. Catalytic activity was improved by incorporating a promoter metal into the iron-based GelCat. It seemed that lowering the first stage temperature to 435 °C might increase the hydrogenation function of the promoter metal.

To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results for the Orbiter Main Propulsion System (MPS) hardware are documented. The Orbiter MPS consists of two subsystems: the Propellant Management Subsystem (PMS) and the Helium Subsystem.

Testing performed on highly volatile liquids such as cleaning solvents has proven problematic due to inconsistent test results (non-ignitions). Non-ignition results can be misinterpreted as favorable oxygen compatibility, although {{they are more likely}} associated with inadequate fuel-to-oxidizer ratios. Forced evaporation during purging and inadequate sample size were identified as two potential causes for inadequate available sample material during testing. In an effort to maintain adequate fuel-to-oxidizer ratios within the reaction vessel during test, several parameters were considered, including sample size, pretest sample chilling, pretest <b>purging,</b> and test <b>pressure.</b> Tests on a variety of solvents exhibiting a range of volatilities are presented in this paper. A proposed improvement to the standard test protocol {{as a result of this}} evaluation is also presented.

NASA and the industry are identifying and developing engine and sealing technologies that will result in dramatic improvements and address the goals for engines entering service in the 2005 - 2007 time frame. This paper provides an overview of advanced seal technology requirements and highlights the results of a preliminary design effort to implement advanced seals into a regional aircraft turbine engine.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented here is to quantify the effects of <b>purge</b> gas temperature, <b>pressure,</b> and mass flow rate on Hydrazine (Hz) decontamination rates of the Ares I Roll Control System and Reaction Control System. A survey of experts in this field revealed {{the absence of any}} decontamination rate prediction models. Three basic decontamination methods were identified for analysis and modeling. These include low pressure eduction, high flow rate purge, and pulse purge. For each method, an approach to predict the Hz mass transfer rate, as a function of system <b>pressure,</b> temperature, and <b>purge</b> gas mass flow rate, is developed based on the applicable physics. The models show that low pressure eduction is two orders of magnitude more effective than the high velocity purge, which in turn is two orders of magnitude more effective than the pure diffusion component of pulse purging of deadheads. Eduction subjects the system to low pressure conditions that promote the extraction of Hz vapors. At 120 F, Hz is saturated at approximately 1 psia. At lower pressures and 120 F, Hz will boil, which is an extremely efficient means to remove liquid Hz. The Hz boiling rate is predicted by equating the rate at which energy is added to the saturated liquid Hz through heaters at the tube outer wall with the energy removed from the liquid through evaporation. Boil-off fluxes were predicted by iterating through the range of local pressures with limits set by the minimum allowed pressure of 0. 2 psia and maximum allowed wall temperature of 120 F established by the heaters, which gives a saturation pressure of approximately 1. 0 psia. Figure 1 shows the resulting boil-off fluxes as a function of local eduction pressure. As depicted in figure 1, the flux is a strong inverse function of eduction pressure, and that minimizing the eduction pressure maximizes the boil-off flux. Also, higher outer wall temperatures lead to higher boil-off fluxes and allow for boil-off over a greater range of eduction pressures...|$|R
40|$|Conformal {{coatings}} {{are becoming}} increasingly important as technology heads towards the nanoscale. The exceptional thickness control (atomic scale) and conformality (uniformity over nanoscale 3 D features) of atomic layer deposition (ALD) has made it the process of choice for numerous applications found in microelectronics and nanotechnology {{with a wide variety}} of ALD processes and resulting materials. While its benefits derive from self-limited saturating surface reactions of alternating gas precursors, process optimization for ALD conformality is often difficult as process parameters, such as dosage, <b>purge,</b> temperature and <b>pressure</b> are often interdependent with one another, especially within the confines of an ultra-high aspect ratio nanopore. Therefore, processes must be optimized to achieve self-limiting saturated surfaces and avoid parasitic CVD-like reactions in order to maintain thickness control and achieve uniformity and conformality at the atomic level while preserving the desired materials' properties (electrical, optical, compositional, etc.). 	This work investigates novel approaches to optimize ALD conformality when transitioning from a 2 D planar system to a 3 D ultra-high aspect ratio nanopore in the context of a cross-flow wafer-scale reactor used to highlight deviations from ideal ALD behavior. Porous anodic alumina (PAA) is used as a versatile platform to analyze TiO 2 ALD profiles via ex-situ SEM, EDS and TEM. Results of TiO 2 ALD illustrate enhanced growth rates that can occur when the precursors titanium tetraisopropoxide and ozone were used at minimal saturation doses for ALD and for considerably higher doses. The results also demonstrate that ALD process recipes that achieve excellent across-wafer uniformity across full 100 mm wafers do not produce conformal films in ultra-high aspect ratio nanopores. The results further demonstrate that conformality is determined by precursor dose, surface residence time, and purge time, creating large depletion gradients down the length of the nanopore. Also, deposition of ALD films over sharp surface features are very uniform, and verified by profile evolution modeling. This behavior, in contrast to that in high aspect ratio structures, suggests strongly that detailed dynamics, local flow conditions (e. g. viscous vs molecular), surface residence time, and ALD surface reaction kinetics play a complex role in determining ALD profiles for high aspect ratio features...|$|R
40|$|New pressure-swing {{adsorption}} (PSA) {{processes and}} PSA hybrids are developed for several commercially relevant gas separations. The Combination Cycles and Cycling-Zone Pressure-Swing Adsorption (CZPSA), respectively, use feed purge to supplement and replace product purge and are high recovery {{alternatives to the}} Skarstrom Cycle when lower product purities are acceptable. For air separation, the Skarstrom Cycle produces ∼ 88 % O 2 with pressurized O 2 recovery of ∼ 44 % while CZPSA produces ∼ 72 % O 2 with pressurized O 2 recovery of 75 % at the same productivity. To achieve high purity O 2 and N 2, CZPSA is coupled with cryogenic distillation to form a hybrid air separation process. By removing excess N 2, the CZPSA unit decreases the size of downstream equipment, thereby decreasing costs. When capital costs dominate, placing the CZPSA unit after the main air compressor (MAC) in a hybrid air separation plant reduces capital cost by up to ∼ 27 %, but power increases by ∼ 16 %. When both capital and operating costs dominate, placing the CZPSA unit before the MAC reduces operating cost by up to ∼ 7 % and capital costs by up to ∼ 9 %. An existing 1000 mtpd air separation plant can be retrofitted with a pre-MAC CZPSA unit to increase the plant capacity by ∼ 12 % with a 6 % increase in incremental capital costs and a 55 % increase in incremental operating costs. For dilute binary gas separation, hybrid SMB/PSA processes are developed by combining stripping-type PSA with a gas-phase SMB. As conceived, SMB/PSA has two advantages: low <b>pressure</b> <b>purge</b> and internal desorbent generation. For the two-zone, two-train SMB/PSA process, binary separation of enflurane into its 99 % pure R- and S-enantiomers is achieved at D/F ∼ 15. 0; the gas-phase SMB achieves this with D/F ∼ 54. 0. Stripping- and rectifying-type PSA typically {{are not used to}} achieve complete binary separation because of low productivities. The gas-phase SMB is combined with these processes to achieve binary separation of a concentrated feed of H 2 and CH 4 with zeolite 5 A. An eight-bed combination of stripping- and rectifying- type SMB/PSA processes produces 99. 99 % H 2 with 99. 6 % H 2 recovery and 99 % CH 4 with 99. 9 % CH 4 recovery with productivity of 9. 37 E- 5 mol/kg-s and an energy requirement of 260. 9 kJ/mol. ...|$|R

Literally, thousands (2, 850) of simulations were carried out to the periodic state to study the effects of the light product purge to feed ratio ({gamma}), cycle step time (t{sub s}) or cycle time (t{sub c}), high to low pressure ratio ({pi}{sub T}), and heavy product recycle ratio (R{sub R}) on the process performance, while changing the cycle configuration from 4 - to 5 -step (bed) designs utilizing combinations of light and heavy reflux steps, two different depressurization modes, and two sets of CO{sub 2 }-HTlc mass transfer coefficients. The process performance was judged in terms of the CO{sub 2 } purity and recovery, and the feed throughput. The best process performance was obtained from a 5 -step (bed) stripping PSA cycle with a light reflux step and a heavy reflux step (with the heavy reflux gas obtained from the low <b>pressure</b> <b>purge</b> step), with a CO{sub 2 } purity of 78. 9 %, a CO{sub 2 } recovery of 57. 4 %, and a throughput of 11. 5 L STP/hr/kg. This performance improved substantially when the CO{sub 2 }-HTlc adsorption and desorption mass transfer coefficients (uncertain quantities at this time) were increased by factors of five, with a CO{sub 2 } purity of 90. 3 %, a CO{sub 2 } recovery of 73. 6 %, and a throughput of 34. 6 L STP/hr/kg. Overall, this preliminary study disclosed the importance of cycle configuration through the heavy and dual reflux concepts, and the importance of knowing well defined mass transfer coefficients to the performance of a high temperature PSA process for CO{sub 2 } capture and concentration from flue and stack gases using an HTlc adsorbent.
