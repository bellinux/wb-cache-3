The tradition OPV cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode, electron blocking layer, tunnel junction, holes blocking layer, electrode, with the sun hitting the transparent electrode. OPV replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly. OPV are flexible, low weight, and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production. OPV uses [...] "only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low <b>processing</b> <b>temperatures</b> using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times". Current efficiencies range from 1–6.5%, however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10% efficiency.|$|E

Only the poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), acrylic and chlorinated polyethylene extrudates filled with 10 phr oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) {{were able to}} be extruded successfully as the extrusion <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> profiles increased. The extrudates containing 20 phr OPEFB were severely distorted even though the <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> was increased to the maximum level.

The test pieces were moulded at the following real injection temperatures: 220 °C, 240 °C, 260 °C, 280 °C and 300 °C. It was determined that the in-mould (cavity) pressure decreased with increasing of the <b>processing</b> <b>temperature.</b> Also PP was thermally analyzed through: Thermogravimetry (TG), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamic-Mechanical Analysis (DMA). It was established that <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> has a minor influence on the thermal stability, the glass transition temperature and melting point of polymer, but the storage modulus (E’) is significantly influenced by the <b>processing</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{potato protein}} {{concentrate}} (PPC) was investigated {{as a source}} of thermoformed bio-based plastic film. Pressing temperatures of 100 to 190 degrees C with 15 to 25 % glycerol were used to form PPC films. The shape of the tensile stress-strain curve in thermoformed PPC was controlled by glycerol level and was independent of <b>processing</b> <b>temperature.</b> Tensile testing revealed that elongation at break increased with <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> while Young's modulus was unaffected by <b>processing</b> <b>temperature,</b> both in contrast to previous results in protein based systems. Also in contrast to previous studies, Young's modulus was found to be only sensitive to glycerol level. Maximum tensile stress increased with increasing <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> for PPC films. Maximum stress and strain at break correlated with the extractable high molecular weight protein content of the processed films measured with size exclusion chromatography. Infrared absorption indicated that the content of beta-sheet structure increased from the commercial protein concentrate to that pressed at 100 degrees C, but did not further develop with increasing press temperature. Changes in structural arrangements were observed by small angle X-ray scattering indicating the development of different correlation distances with <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> but with no clear long range order at the supramolecular level. The novel Young's modulus behaviour appears to be due to constant secondary structure or the effect of aggregated protein structure formed during protein production. Unique strain at break behaviour with <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> was demonstrated, likely due to new connections formed between those aggregates...|$|R

40|$|The 7075 -T 6 Al alloy was {{processed}} by accumulative roll bonding (ARB) {{up to five}} passes by a 3 : 1 thickness reduction per pass at 300, 350 and 400 C. Microscopical examinations revealed that the particle distribution varies with the processing parameters. As a consequence, the particle pinning effect decreases with increasing <b>processing</b> <b>temperature</b> {{and the number of}} ARB passes. For this reason, the evolution of grain structure with the number of passes is different for each <b>processing</b> <b>temperature,</b> and the superplastic properties are determined not only by the microstructural features before deformation, but also by the alloy thermal stability. The best superplastic properties are attained by the sample processed up to three passes at 300 C, obtaining elongations to failure in excess of 200 %. Finally, ARB <b>processing</b> at high <b>temperature</b> leads to a decrease of hardness with respect to the peak-aged as-received alloy, especially with increasing number of passes and with decreasing <b>processing</b> <b>temperature,</b> due to the variation of the interparticle mean spacing and the amount of solute atoms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.
