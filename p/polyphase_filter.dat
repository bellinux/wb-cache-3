The dot product {{is the sum of}} the dot products of each subsequence with the corresponding samples of the x• sequence. Furthermore, because of downsampling by M, the stream of x• samples involved in any one of the M dot products is never involved in the other dot products. Thus M low-order FIR filters are each filtering one of M multiplexed phases of the input stream, and the M outputs are being summed. This viewpoint offers a different implementation that might be advantageous in a multi-processor architecture. In other words, the input stream is demultiplexed and sent through a bank of M filters whose outputs are summed. When implemented that way, it is called a <b>polyphase</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

The analysis filter-bank consists of allpass <b>polyphase</b> <b>filters</b> to achieve a high frequency selectivity with a low algorith-mic complexity and low signal delay. The condition for perfect reconstruction (PR) leads to either unstable or anti-causal synthesis filters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods for}} the efficient realization of prototype filters for modulated filter banks.

40|$|Changing {{resolution}} of images {{is a common}} operation. It is also common to use simple, i. e., small interpolation kernels satisfying some ”smoothness ” qualities that are determined in the spatial domain. Typical applications use linear interpolation or piecewise cubic interpolation. These are popular since the interpolation kernels are small {{and the results are}} acceptable. However, since the interpolation kernel, i. e., the impulse response, has a finite, and small length, the frequency domain characteristics are not good. Therefore, when we enlarge the image by a rational factor of ¢¡¤£¦¥¨ §, aliasing effects usually appear and cause a noticeable degradation in quality of the image. One such effect is jagged edges. Another effect is low frequency modulation of high frequency components such as sampling noise. Enlarging an image by a factor of  ¢¡©£�¥¨ §, is represented by first interpolating the image on a grid ¡ times finer than the original sampling grid, and then resampling it every ¥ grid points. While the usual treatment of the alias-ing created by the resampling operation is aimed towards improving the interpolation filter in the frequency domain, this paper suggests reducing the aliasing effects using a polyphase representation of the interpolation process, and treating the <b>polyphase</b> <b>filters</b> separately. We discuss separable interpolation and so the analysis is conducted for the one-dimensional case. Finally, we compare a 6 coefficient <b>polyphase</b> <b>filters</b> found using the suggested procedure with a 6 coefficient <b>polyphase</b> <b>filters</b> capable of reconstructing a 3 rd order polynomial...|$|R
