40|$|The real {{effective}} {{exchange rate}} of the dollar is close to its minimum level for the past 4 decades (as of September 2008). At the same time, however, the U. S. trade and currentaccount deficits remain large and, absent a significant correction in coming years, wouldcontribute to a further accumulation of U. S. external liabilities. The paper discusses thetension between these two aspects of the dollar assessment, and what factors can helpreconcile them. It focuses in particular on the terms of trade, adjustment lags, andmeasurement issues related to both the {{real effective exchange rate}} and the current accountbalance.

40|$|A {{reduction}} in the U. S. current account deficit vis-Ã -vis emerging Asia involves a shift in demand from U. S. to emerging Asia tradable goods and a change in international relative prices. This paper quantifies the required adjustment {{in the terms of}} trade and real exchange rates in a three-country open economy model of the U. S., China, and other emerging Asia. We compare scenarios where both Chinese and other emerging Asian export prices change by the same proportion to the case where export prices remain constant in one country and increase in the other. Our results are robust to different assumptions about elasticities of substitution and to introducing a high degree of vertical fragmentation in production in the model.

40|$|Since 2004 Egypt''s {{growth has}} been {{accelerating}} {{in step with the}} launching of a series of ambitious reforms, reversing a trend during the preceding half-decade when Egypt''s growth rate fell below that of most regional peers and well below that of the average developing country. This paper seeks to identify factors that held back Egypt''s growth in the recent past, and explores whether recent reforms have removed the most binding constraints to allow at least a temporary growth spurt. Overall, the Egyptian reforms launched in 2004 appear to have focused well on the most critical constraints-reducing red tape and tax rates, and improving access to foreign exchange-thereby getting a strong growth response out of a limited set of reforms. However, inefficient bureaucracy remains an important obstacle to higher growth and reforms in this area should continue to have high payoffs. Ongoing reforms are also addressing constraints that are likely to become binding soon (or have become so already), such as inefficient financial intermediation and high public debt. Improvements in education may rapidly become a critical factor for sustaining higher growth.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} short-run {{effects of the}} 2007 - 09 global {{financial}} crisis on growth in (mainly non-fuel exporting) low-income countries (LICs). Four conclusions stand out. First, for many individual LICs, 2009 was not extraordinarily calamitous; however, aggregate LIC output declined sharply because LICs were unusually synchronized. Second, the growth declines are on average well explained by the decline in export demand. Third, if the external environment facing LICs improves as forecast, their growth should rebound sharply. Finally, and contrary to received wisdom, there are few robust relationships between the cross-country growth variation and the policy and structural environment; the main exceptions are reserve coverage and labor-market flexibility.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{sustainability}} of China''s export-oriented growth over the medium to longer term. It shows that maintaining the current export-oriented growth would require significant gains in market share through lower prices {{in a range of}} industries. This, in turn, could be achieved through a combination of increases in productivity, lower profits, and higher implicit or explicit subsidies to industry. However, the evidence suggest that it will prove difficult to accommodate such price reductions within existing profit margins or through productivity gains. Moving up the value-added chain, shifting the composition of exports, diversifying the export base, and increasing domestic value added of exports could give room to further export expansion. However, experiences from Asian economies that had similar export-oriented growth suggest there are limits to the global market share a country can occupy. Rebalancing growth toward private consumption would provide a large impetus to output growth and reduce the need for gaining further market share.

40|$|Recent studies {{conclude}} that the ongoing global financial integration may have {{had little or no}} value in advancing economic growth, especially in poor countries. Capital is often found to flow "uphill" from poor to rich countries. And, when it does flow into the less developed economies, it is negatively correlated with growth, calling into question the desirability of foreign capital. In this paper we report that Europe-including the new member states of the European Union-provides a counterexample to these global anomalies. With increasing financial integration, capital in Europe has traveled "downhill" from rich to poor countries, and has done so with gathering strength.

The paper argues these large external deficits pose risks to the economy and therefore matter, even in a currency union, and discusses some policy options to reduce them. <b>Current</b> <b>account</b> deficits;European Union;Global Financial Crisis 2008 - 2009;Private savings;current <b>account,</b> <b>current</b> <b>accounts,</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit, capital account openness, domestic saving, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> imbalances, capital <b>account,</b> investment income, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> dynamics, balance of payment, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> surpluses, foreign loans, public debt, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> adjustment, government deficits, central banks, debt sustainability, private credit, domestic currency, external debt, external liabilities...|$|R

40|$|The paper aims at {{characterizing the}} main {{determinants}} of the medium-term <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance for oil-exporting countries using dynamic panel estimation techniques. Previous studies included {{a very limited}} number of oil-exporting countries in their samples, raising concerns about {{the applicability of the}} estimated coefficients for oil countries. Furthermore, current approaches are not specifically tailored to oil-producing countries because they fail to capture the effects of oil wealth and the degree of maturity in oil production. This paper explores the underlying determinants of the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance for a large sample of oilexporting countries, and extends the specifications commonly used in the literature to include an oil wealth variable, as well as a proxy for the degree of maturity in oil production. The paper therefore contributes to the existing literature both in terms of the sample studied as well as the variables considered. The results reveal that factors that matter in determining the equilibrium <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance of oil-exporting counties are the fiscal balance, the oil balance, oil wealth, age dependency, and the degree of maturity in oil production. <b>Current</b> <b>account</b> balances;Oil exporting countries;Oil production;Oil revenues;Economic growth;Economic models;current <b>account,</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit, <b>current</b> <b>accounts,</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> position, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> surpluses, budget balance, domestic currency, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> positions...|$|R

Based on the recent econometric techniques we investigate the potential determinants of <b>current</b> <b>account</b> positions in FYROM for both, the short run and long run dynamics covering the period 1998 q 1 - 2013 q 4. By applying the ARDL approach, we estimate the regression equation and present the model with variables that best explain <b>current</b> <b>account</b> developments. Empirical results indicate that there is strong support for co integration relationship between <b>current</b> <b>account,</b> fiscal balance, financial development, terms of trade and trade openness. The financial development, fiscal balance and terms of trade are positively correlated with the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance, while openness to international trade is negatively correlated with the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance. Moreover, the inclusion of lagged <b>current</b> <b>account</b> as endogenous variable in the model indicates the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits persistence...|$|R

Our analysis shows excessive reliance on oil revenues, misperception of temporary increases in oil prices as permanent ones and structural weaknesses of the economy resulting in unsustainable <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits and external crisis, necessitating {{the adoption of the}} Structural Adjustment Program in 1986.

Empirical evidence suggests that, lagged investment, government’s primary surplus, terms of trade, international interest rates, and the real exchange rate, have {{significant impact on the}} evolution of the <b>current</b> <b>account.</b> Changes in the terms of trade have a moderate effect on the <b>current</b> <b>account.</b> Terms of trade affect the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> by two channels, the quantum and the value of the exports and imports. The estimated net effect suggests that a decline on the terms of trade produces a worsening in the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit. Government income and expenses have influence on the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> {{in such a way that}} increases in the government’s surplus net of interest payments will reduce the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit. In addition, international interest rates and real exchange rate variations have a significantly positive effect on the <b>current</b> <b>account.</b> Finally, no significant effect of US growth on <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit can be identified. ...|$|R

This paper examines a panel of 128 countries over the period 1976 - 2005, and finds that the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances of common currency participants are more highly correlated with fundamental factors (such as net foreign assets, incomes, growth rates, fiscal policy, demographics, resource endowments) than the <b>current</b> <b>accounts</b> of non-participants.
