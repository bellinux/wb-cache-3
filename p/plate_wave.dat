The design and fabrication process of a MEMS flexural <b>plate</b> <b>wave</b> device based on the LTO/ZnO/LTO/Si 3 N 4 multilayered composite membrane are presented. The flexural <b>plate</b> <b>wave</b> was respectively launched and received by both Al interdigital transducers. In order to reduce the stress of the thin membrane induced mainly by the in-plane compressive stress of ZnO film, two fabrication process of DC and RF magnetron sputtering were used to deposit the ZnO films, respectively. The FPW device based on LTO(0. 2 µm) /ZnO(1 µm) / LTO(2 µm) /Si 3 N 4 (0. 5 µm) thin membrane was fabricated. The center frequency of the MEMS flexural <b>plate</b> <b>wave</b> device is measured at 3. 69 MHz, which agrees with the theoretical predictions...|$|E

40|$|The {{utilization}} of leaky plate waves in a scanning arrangement has exhibited improved reliability and increased sensitivity to important defects in unidirectional material [1, 2, 3]. The application of frequency modulation {{to the usual}} tone burst signal used to generate plate waves {{has also been shown}} to enhance defect discrimination [2, 3]. In the current work, leaky <b>plate</b> <b>wave</b> techniques have been applied to the inspection of biaxially laminated graphite-epoxy composites. Test samples having 8, 16, and 24 plies, respectively, are studied. Test specimens contain several types of defects — simulated delaminations, porosity, and ply cuts. In addition, a series of impact-damaged samples are examined to study the method’s sensitivity to this type of delamination. All simulated defects were detected, and comparisons with conventional normal-incidence C-scan measurements have shown that the <b>plate</b> <b>wave</b> technique is more sensitive to both porosity and ply cuts, consistent with our observations on uniaxial composites [3]. Novel gating methods have been applied to the <b>plate</b> <b>wave</b> spectra to improve defect detection in biaxial composites...|$|E

40|$|Guided waves behave much {{differently}} in inhomogeneous anisotropic plates than in homogeneous anisotropic plates. It {{has been reported}} before that guided waves in inhomogeneous plates tend to follow preferred directions based on the location of ply-groups {{as well as the}} orientation of the fibers [1]. The pattern obtained by imaging the leaked energy into the surrounding fluid (earlier called as <b>Plate</b> <b>Wave</b> Flow Patterns) has been shown to indicate fiber orientations [2]. In this paper, a model based on the Thomson-Haskell transfer matrix is employed to obtain the internal distributions of the energy vector within the inhomogeneous plate.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{physical}} reasons {{of why the}} particle is more accelerated in the cold spray nozzle when helium gas {{is used as a}} process gas compared to nitrogen gas， by using one-dimensional calculation. In addition， the deceleration mechanism of the particle between a <b>plate</b> shock <b>wave</b> and a substrate is also investigated. The selected particle in the calculation is spherical Cu with the diameters of 5 and 15 μm. The calculated results reveal that 1) the particle injected into the helium gas flow has a larger velocity just upstream of the <b>plate</b> shock <b>wave</b> because a larger drag force keeps acting on the particle from the injection port to the <b>plate</b> shock <b>wave.</b> The larger drag force is due to a larger drag coefficient just downstream of the injection port, followed by a larger squared relative velocity of the particle in the downstream region， 2) the particle accelerated by the helium gas is less decelerated between the <b>plate</b> shock <b>wave</b> and the substrate because the squared relative velocity of the particle is decreased to less than 1 / 10 by passing through the <b>plate</b> shock <b>wave</b> for the helium gas case...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a novel method based on a <b>plate</b> <b>wave</b> sensor for the in situ {{monitoring}} of the thickness of quartz membranes during wet etching. Similarly to oscillators and resonators, some acoustic devices require the thickness of quartz membranes to be determined precisely. Precise control of the thickness of quartz membranes during wet etching is important, because the thickness strongly influences post processing and frequency control. Furthermore, the proposed <b>plate</b> <b>wave</b> sensor, allows the thickness of quartz membranes from a few mu m to hundreds of pm to be monitored in situ, which depends on the periodicity of an interdigital transducer (IDT).

This configuration {{is often used}} in micromechanical chemical sensors. The model {{is based on a}} closed-form solution of a resonating beam; however, the results are applicable to plates supported on four edges. The model gives a voltage or charge output from the sense combs as a function of voltage applied to the drive combs. The analysis predicts the response of the multiple plate modes to axial tensions and to comb finger dimensions and position relative to the diaphragm eigenfunctions. These models are much more detailed than those described in the literature on acoustic chemical sensors [1]–[8] and are difficult to obtain by finite-element solutions. Frequency responses of FPW devices constructed from silicon with deposited aluminum nitride as the piezoelectric compared well with analytic results. The effects of boundary conditions on the plate’s lateral edges are discussed in both the analysis and testing.

The possibility of total internal reflection in structures of complex geometry is often linked to the presence of internal areas on the surfaces characterised by lower values of the geometry-dependent local phase velocities of Rayleigh or <b>plate</b> <b>waves</b> in comparison with their values in the surrounding areas. The above-mentioned condition of wave localisation is illustrated by theoretical calculations of frequency-dependent phase velocities for three different cases of localised elastic wave propagation.
