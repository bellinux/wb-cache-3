The book is roughly 780 pages and includes the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Bill of Rights, outcomes of various elections throughout American history, and famous court cases. It {{is accompanied by a}} companion website that features <b>practice</b> <b>test</b> questions and detailed explanations on each chapter.|$|E
25|$|The {{restructuring}} {{has been}} credited with improvements. To better allocate resources, Fenty and Rhee significantly reduced the school system's central administrative staff and closed 23 schools with low enrollments. After 2007, student achievement tests {{at the secondary level}} reportedly rose 14points in reading and 17points in math. Student SAT scores rose 27points in 2010. Graduation rates rose each year since 2007, and 72 percent of District students took the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT), which functions as a <b>practice</b> <b>test</b> for college bound students. Fenty's administration had also taken on a major, five-year maintenance and construction effort to improve school buildings by 2014. Fenty and Rhee successfully negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Washington Teachers Union that establishes a system of performance-based teacher compensation.|$|E
2500|$|The science {{reasoning}} test is a 35-minute, 40-question test. [...] There {{are seven}} passages each followed by {{five to seven}} questions. [...] The passages have three different formats: Data Representation, Research Summary, and Conflicting Viewpoints. While the format used to be very predictable (i.e. there were always three Data Representation passages with 5 questions following each, 3 Research Summary passages with six questions each, and one Conflicting Viewpoints passage with 7 questions), {{when the number of}} passages was reduced from 7 to 6, more variability in the number of each passage type started to appear. But so far, there is still always only one Conflicting Viewpoints passage. These changes are very recent and so the only reference to them so far is in the recently released <b>practice</b> <b>test</b> on the ACT website.|$|E
40|$|Students {{prepared}} for classroom examinations by completing <b>practice</b> <b>tests,</b> with selected items from these <b>practice</b> <b>tests</b> repeated, {{in either the}} original or in a modified wording, on classroom examinations and a final examination. The availability of immediate self-corrective feedback on Study 1 <b>practice</b> <b>tests</b> (0, 3, or 6 <b>practice</b> <b>tests)</b> was varied, while in Study 2, the timing of feedback provided during <b>practice</b> <b>tests</b> (immediate, end of test, 24 -hour delay, control) was varied. Performance on examinations was elevated by the provision of immediate feedback on <b>practice</b> <b>tests</b> in both studies, especially when test items were presented in their original wording, with some generalization observed on items presented in a modified wording. Predictions made {{in accordance with the}} interference-perseveration hypothesis and the delayretention effect were not supported. These results demonstrate considerable potential for immediate self-corrective feedback, delivered during test preparation through the Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique, to enhance performance on classroom examinations and to promote the retention of factual information during the academic semester...|$|R

2500|$|Whether {{taking the}} PERT {{in high school}} or for college placement, {{students}} are only permitted two opportunities to take the test.

At the college level, achieving the cut score will allow the student to proceed directly into courses that earn credits towards their degree.

50|$|The {{situational}} judgement {{test has}} been around for over fifty years. The first two that were documented were the How supervise and the Cardall Practical Judgement Test. In 1958 the Supervisory <b>Practice</b> <b>Test</b> came about by Bruce and Learner. The Supervisory <b>Practice</b> <b>Test</b> was to point out whether or not supervisors could handle certain situations on the job. This test is said to effectively identify who could and could not be a supervisor. The situational judgement test did not really take off and become a great use in the employment field until the early 1990s.|$|E

30|$|Running regular low-stake (for example, weekly) online {{tests is}} a popular {{approach}} (Bennett et al., 2017) designed to prevent students from falling behind. The provision of <b>practice</b> online <b>tests,</b> which are not graded, is common as a method to familiarise students with the functionality and requirements of summative tests. It is generally found {{that the number of}} students attempting the <b>practice</b> <b>tests</b> reduces as the unit progresses (Lowe, 2015) but those that do complete the <b>practice</b> <b>tests</b> tend to perform better in the summative tests.|$|R

5000|$|The {{second class}} of problem cases involve {{coordination}} problems, where it seems intuitively obligatory {{for us to}} do the same thing that everyone around us is actually doing, but where a universal <b>practice</b> <b>test</b> does not require this coordination. E.g., consider the behavior [...] "drive on the left side the road--no matter what!" [...] If everyone does this, your doing so again produces more good than harm; but if not everyone does this (some driving on the right), then your doing so is likely to cause a great deal more harm than good. Like the rule of absolute pacifism, this passes some versions of a universal <b>practice</b> <b>test,</b> but fails a universal applicability test, because while everyone's practicing the behavior is not harmful, its practice by some persons while some other people are not doing so does produce significant harm. In no case will a behavior condemned by a universal <b>practice</b> <b>test</b> be acceptable for a universal approval test using the same criteria, so the latter is always at least as strong as the former.|$|E
