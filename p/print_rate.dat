5000|$|In 1962 Saunders Lewis a {{prominent}} Welsh nationalist and {{a founder of}} Plaid Cymru, gave a radio speech entitled Tynged yr iaith (The Fate of the Language) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless action was taken. This speech {{led to the creation}} of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (the Welsh Language Society). During this speech he directly praised the actions of Trefor and Eileen Beasley for their campaign for Welsh language tax bills. May I call your attention to the story of Mr. and Mrs. Trefor Beasley? Mr. Beasley is a coal-miner. In April 1952 he and his wife bought a cottage in Llangennech near Llanelli, a district where nine out of every ten of the population are Welsh-speaking. All the councillors on the rural council which controls Llangennech are Welsh-speaking: so too are the council officials. Therefore when a note demanding the local rates arrived from ‘The Rural District Council of Llanelly' Mrs. Beasley wrote to ask for it in Welsh. It was refused. She refused to pay the rates until she got it. She and Mr. Beasley were summoned more than a dozen times to appear before the magistrates' court. Mr. and Mrs. Beasley insisted that the court proceedings should be in Welsh. Three times did the bailiffs carry off furniture from their home, the furniture being worth much more than the rates which were demanded. This went on for eight years. In 1960 Mr. and Mrs. Beasley received a bilingual note demanding the local rates from (Cyngor Dosbarth Gwledig Llanelli, the Welsh on the bill being just as good as its English. It is not my right to say what was the financial cost of all this to Mr. and Mrs. Beasley. Friends, including solicitors and barristers, were very loyal. Their trouble became the subject of the country's attention, and the newspapers and radio and television plagued them continually. The court cases were interesting and important. For example, the rating officer's reply to Mr. Wynne Samuel: 'The Council is not under any obligation to <b>print</b> <b>rate</b> demand notes in any language except English.' Saunders Lewis, [...] "Tynged yr iaith" [...] Lewis took the Beasley case as a model for future action, but significantly added [...] "this cannot be done reasonably except in those districts where Welsh-speakers are a substantial proportion of the population". He proposed to make it impossible for the business of local and central government to continue without using Welsh". [...] "It is a policy for a movement", he said, [...] "in the areas where Welsh is a spoken language in daily use" [...] it would be [...] "nothing less than a revolution".|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe communication industry is clearly {{in a state}} of transition and communication managers faced with decisions about commitments to today's products need to know about possible future changes in the industry. To fulfill this need, this study develops technological forecasts for hard copy and video display communications terminals. Changes in input/output parameters of the terminals, when the changes will occur, and how rapid the changes will be are estimated. These forecasts are determined by first measuring a limited number of performance parameters such as <b>print</b> <b>rate</b> and transmission speed. Then mathematical models are fitted to the performance parameter data and the trend extrapolated into the future to make predictions. The results of the study indicate that print rates will increase significantly in the next ten years to a level of approximately 2000 characters per second and transmission speeds to' a level of approximately 500, 000 bits per second for hard copy terminals. Video display terminals show a steeper increase with transmission speed levels of 1. 5 Mbps predicted in the next five years. Also, the <b>print</b> <b>rate</b> per dollar and transmission speed per dollar for these terminals will show rapid increases in the next ten years. This study indicates that hard copy terminals and video display terminals {{are on the verge of}} significant changes that communications managers should take into consideration in their procurement and design decisions.

However, printed feature broadening is frequently observed due to the coalescence of un-dried ink, reducing achievable resolution. Increasing substrate temperature and reducing <b>print</b> <b>rates</b> are two common mitigation techniques, each with drawbacks. Here a novel interlacing method is introduced as an alternative strategy to manage droplet coalescence. The desired geometry is sampled into multiple sub-patterns and then printed sequentially, to yield the complete pattern. The interlacing sub-sampling matrix is selected according to the desired resolution and printing parameters to isolate each un-dried ink droplet during deposition. Printed geometries are found to retain single droplet resolution using this method. A comparison is made between samples with direct (single-pass) printing and interlaced printing. High-resolution silver planar resistors are constructed and characterized for their application as printed temperature sensors. © 2014 IEEE. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{defining}} {{characteristics of the}} newspaper industry is that the products are virtually worthless {{at the end of}} the day; nobody wants to pay for yesterday s news. In addition, strict delivery deadlines and no inventory lead to very short time frames for production and distribution. Consequently production and outbound distribution are intimately linked and should be coordinated in order to achieve the objective of on-time delivery performance at minimum total cost. The increase in online publishing the last decade has led to a general drop in circulation numbers and reduction of advertising revenues. Another consequence of online publishing is that the pressure to include last minute news in the printed editions has been somewhat reduced. There are several unresolved logistical problems in the media industry, for instance the question of where to produce which products in order to optimize the distribution. In Norway it is common for media corporations to collaborate on distribution, but there is little cooperation with respect to where products should be printed. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a model that can be used to identify cost saving potentials in the newspaper industry. We formulate a deterministic cost minimization arc- flow model that integrates facility location, production allocation, production scheduling and vehicle routing for the first echelon of the distribution. The model includes multiple facilities and products, production in time slots, changeover times between production of different products, split deliveries, a heterogeneous vehicle fleet and delivery time windows. The arc-flow model is reformulated to a path-flow formulation using Dantzig-Wolfe decom- position (DWD). Two different decomposition strategies are developed. The first strategy decomposes into two subproblems (D 2 SP), one for the production and scheduling which is solved for each facility, and one for the vehicle routing which is solved for each vehicle and route. The second decomposition strategy (D 1 SP) includes the production allocation and scheduling in the master problem while the vehicle routing is in the subproblem. Feasible routes are generated a priori and column generation is used to solve the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the integer programming (IP) problem. Different column generation procedures for the vehicle routing subproblem have been tested for each of the decomposed models. Procedures that add fewer columns per iteration reduce the solution time for the root node by over 50 % for both of the decomposed path-flow models. The way in which vehicles and routes are ordered for solving the vehicle routing subproblems also influences the solution time. DWD and general Branch and Bound does not guarantee optimality, or even feasible integer solutions, for IP problems. With the aim of improving the IP solution, two fixing strategies that allow for additional column generation after the root node is solved are implemented in both of the path-flow models. The fixing strategies successively fix vehicles to facilities or routes and re-apply column generation. For D 2 SP, fixing vehicles to routes improves the communication between the two subproblems which improves the integer solution consider- ably. D 1 SP performs better than D 2 SP due to a more integrated formulation and so the fixing strategies do not improve the integer solution found through Branch and Bound. A comparison of the three models reveals that the arc-flow model is better at finding feasible solutions on small instances, while D 1 SP is the better choice for larger instances. Both of theiidecomposed models provide better LP bounds than the arc-flow model, with D 2 SP providing by far the best bound. D 1 SP is able to find good solutions within a reasonable time frame, and is used to conduct an economic analysis on a case from the newspaper industry in South-Eastern Norway. Two of the largest printing facilities in Norway are considered: Amedia s printing facility at Stokke and Schibsted s printing facility in Nydalen, and seven of Amedia and Schibsted s largest newspaper titles. An analysis of the effect of cooperation between Amedia and Schibsted with respect to printing demonstrates that there lies a significant value in cooperating. Full cooperation with traditional offset printing results in a more centralized production and a 9 % decrease in distribution costs due to a 24 % reduction in the distance driven. The effect of digitalizing the printing process has also been studied. The biggest obstacle for changing to digital printers today is the <b>print</b> <b>rate.</b> However, technology for digital print is improving rapidly and with increased production rates digital print can lead to more efficient routing and considerable reductions in distribution costs. This is due to an increased flexibility in production allocation and scheduling which leads to production closer to customers. Mov- ing the newsroom deadline forward amplifies the effects of cooperation and digitalization, decreasing the distribution costs further. The numeric findings are case-specific and our model only considers costs, excluding other factors that are important in decision making, such as e. g. the media corporations marketing strategies, environmental and social aspects. It is worth mentioning that our model is not only applicable for the newspaper industry but can with certain modifications be used for problems in other industries with time-sensitive products. The model is especially useful if integration of production allocation, scheduling and distribution is important in order to minimize facility or production costs and optimize distribution...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{thin film}} {{transfer}} mechanism {{has been studied}} and developed to transfer chemically reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) thin film using a roll-to-roll printing system. We discover that shear stress generated on the silicon rubber stamp surface facilitates delamination of the deposited r-GO thin film efficiently. A roll-to-roll apparatus is assembled to demonstrate the shear-induced transfer printing {{in a large scale}} printing system. Shear stress is applied on the stamp surface by rotating the stamp side roller faster than the substrate side roller. The hydrophobic surface is changed to hydrophilic by polydopamine modification for 15 minutes at 60 ˚C in order for r-GO thin film to be directly deposited on the rubber stamp. Roll-to-roll printing parameters such as evaporation time during deposition of r-GO, vertical deformation of stamp, RPM, and RPM ratio between two rollers are investigated and adjusted for successful transfer of r-GO. With the adjusted roll-to-roll printing parameters, r-GO thin film has been transferred successfully to glass and PET substrates at a <b>printing</b> <b>rate</b> of 5 mm/min. The shear stress required to transfer r-GO thin film in our experiment condition with glass substrate is estimated to be 325. 43 kPa by experimental data and computation with ANSYS.
