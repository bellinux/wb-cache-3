40|$|Abstract: Behavioral {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} {{over the last several years}} to assess downstream <b>passage</b> of juvenile salmonids, upstream <b>passage</b> of shad and reservoir movement of white sturgeon at hydroelectric facilities in the United States. Acoustic transmitters were surgically implanted into run-of-river fish and detection arrays were configured to track acoustically tagged fish. GIS analysis of fish approach and <b>passage</b> has provided valuable information to hydropower engineers who were seeking alternatives to operational configurations that would increase <b>passage</b> rates. For juvenile salmonid studies, GIS spatial analyses have included the evaluation of <b>passage</b> route efficiency, relative percent <b>passage</b> densities, normalized bin densities, approach elevations and top-spill nonselection. <b>Passage</b> route efficiency was measured by the proportion of smolts that selected a particular route of <b>passage</b> (powerhouse, top-spill or spillway). Relative percent <b>passage</b> densities and normalized bin densities highlighted zones of use in the forebay. Both <b>passage</b> route efficiency and relative percent <b>passage</b> were correlated to operational configurations. Approach elevations were analyzed for smolt positions within 300 feet of the dam. Top-spill nonselection presented three-dimensional positions of smolts that had approached within 300 feet of the top-spill bypass structure but did not pass. All GIS analyses were examined for trends between years and species and have led to operational configuration modifications to provide increased successful smolt <b>passage.</b> The GIS analyses used during these behavioral studies will be presented...|$|R

Various fish <b>passage</b> solutions have been implemented to improve connectivity with varying success. A well-functioning <b>passage</b> solution must ensure safe and timely <b>passage</b> routes that are used by {{a substantial portion of}} the migrating fish. In this thesis, I report the results from telemetry studies where the behavior and survival of migrating Atlantic salmon spawners, post-spawners and smolts have been evaluated in relation to hydropower dam <b>passage.</b> I evaluate downstream <b>passage</b> performance at dams with no <b>passage</b> solutions in the River Klarälven, and with simple <b>passage</b> solutions in in the Winooski River. In the River Ätran, I study both upstream- and downstream <b>passage</b> performance at a dam with sophisticated <b>passage</b> solutions based on the best available technology. In addition, I have studied the survival and behavior of post-spawners and hatchery-released smolts. A substantial portion of the spawners survived spawning and initiated downstream migration. Most males migrated downstream in autumn following spawning, whereas females tended to stay in the river until spring. For hatchery-reared smolts, early release was associated with faster initiation of migration and higher survival compared to late release. Multiple dam <b>passage</b> resulted in high mortality for both smolts and kelts. For smolts, dam <b>passage,</b> even with simple <b>passage</b> solutions, was associated with substantial delay and mortality. High spill levels were linked to high survival and short delay for downstream migrating salmon. The best available <b>passage</b> solution, which consisted of a nature-like fishway and a low sloping intake rack to guide fish to a bypass, resulted in rapid <b>passage</b> of a large portion of the adult migrants...|$|R
