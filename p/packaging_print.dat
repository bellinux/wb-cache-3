Tobacco companies also sponsor holiday tours like Mild Seven Seafarers Club, Peter Stuyvesant Travel and Tours, Kent Holidays and Salem Holidays as well as concerts and entertainment events. All of these are indirect advertising strategies employed by tobacco companies. Tobacco advertising continued without the display of cigarette packaging until January 2003, when the Malaysian federal government banned even such indirect advertising of tobacco brands, except in certain establishments licensed to sell tobacco products. Formula One Grand Prix and other sporting events are still allowed to use tobacco sponsorship. In 2009, Malaysian government halted the branding of cigarettes as [...] "light" [...] or [...] "mild" [...] on all smoking packages and has decided to place graphic images on the cigarette packs to show the adverse long-term effects of excessive smoking.|$|E

40|$|Packaging is {{currently}} the centre of intensive research that is being carried out regarding new technologies that integrate digital data on a package. This has been fuelled by developments in electronics technology, materials and processes that {{have the potential to}} create packages that can carry digital- machine readable data. These developments concern in particular, new materials (such as printed polymers) and tagging applications (such as RFID and EAS systems) which are described as “intelligent”, “smart ” or “active ” packaging. One matter of particular interest is how these types of digital information can be integrated and implemented into the existing production workflow of packaging, which is normally consisted by the processes of <b>packaging</b> design, prepress, <b>printing</b> and finishing. Therefore, the objective of the study is to examine the various factors and parameters that might affect the production management and workflow of the traditional/existing packaging design and production. The paper is based mainly on a literature study on smart packaging applications and their developments as well as on findings from leading research institutes, manufacturers and academia, as it regards new technology applications for <b>packaging</b> <b>printing</b> production. A final outcome from the present survey is that <b>packaging</b> <b>printing</b> production management is expected to be subjected in changes (investments, production workflow, integration of new/additional processes, quality controls etc).

40|$|The {{paper has}} {{investigated}} influence of various technologies on recycling of vegetal raw material {{with the purpose}} to obtain the desired product used for <b>package</b> <b>printing.</b> Influence of various technological regimes and introduction of fresh polyethylene additives for recycled raw material on qualitative indices of the desired product has been studied in the paper. Investigations of preliminary aquatic hydrolysis of vegetal raw material have shown {{that in order to}} obtain high quality cellulose from vegetal raw material it is necessary that this cellulose has not less than 2 - 3 % of hemicellulose otherwise its qualitative indices are significantly deteriorated that is important for <b>packaging</b> <b>printing.</b> Usage of carbon dioxide aqueous solution for preliminary vegetal raw material hydrolysis contributes to reduction in destruction of cellulose carbo-hydrate. This improves qualitative indices of the obtained desired product that is cellulose which is used for <b>package</b> <b>printing.</b> Recommendations for sulphate pulping of vegetal raw material with preliminary hydrolysis have been prepared with the purpose to improve physical and mechanical characteristics of the obtained desired product - cellulose {{on the basis of the}} obtained data on content of hemicellulose in cellulose. While investigating recycled polymers the obtained results have demonstrated that increase of low- molecular product content in them looks rather typical. This suggests that packaging will have lower qualitative indices while using polymers being kept in waste deposits. In order to avoid this phenomena it is necessary to add 20 - 30 % of fresh polymers during their recycling. </p...|$|R
