40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to test the feasibility of using existing video-detection techniques for counting turning volumes with a <b>portable</b> <b>installation.</b> This was accomplished by integrating a forty-five foot mechanical tower mounted on a van with two video detection systems, Autoscope and VideoTrak. The research project has produced results in three categories: prototype methods of counting turning volumes, evaluation results, and general specifications of a portable video-based system for counting vehicles at intersections. The method based on spot detection uses redundancy of data (more spots than movements) to improve the results quality. The method for VideoTrak one-dimensional tracking classifies maneuvers based on the location where vehicles enter and exit a tracking strip. Both the evaluated methods in their current versions {{do not meet the}} accuracy expectations expressed by the INDOT representatives. The general system specifications were developed to help build a prototype unit. The biggest challenge is the structure of the system that has to be portable, stable during data collection, and protected against tempering with. The authors advise postponing building a prototype system by the time needed to develop satisfactory image processing and interpretation software for identifying vehicles’ maneuvers at intersections...|$|E

40|$|From {{the stand}} point of {{sustainable}} development as well as energy security, {{there is a need}} to generate power in an environmentally friendly manner using renewable energy sources. However, practical problems occur when considering <b>portable</b> <b>installations</b> in urban as well as rural settings. A specific example may be where due to logistical reasons, only very lightweight photovoltaic modules can be installed. Apart from weight, architectural constraints may also require the module layout to be contoured. The performance of Flexible PV (FPV) modules with moderate Watt-peak/kg values (8 - 16) and exposed to sustained insolation conditions (maximum of 910 Watt/m(2)) has been investigated in the present work. A polynomial model for predicting the FPV module performance parameters has been developed. Specifically, the effect of solar irradiance (G) and module temperature (7) on Fill Factor (FF), Open Circuit Voltage (V(OC)) and Short Circuit Current (I(SC)) is determined. Three different FPV technologies have been considered, namely mono-crystalline silicon, poly-crystalline silicon, and amorphous silicon. A consistent improvement in performance prediction as compared to previous PV models has been reported. Contoured FPV (C-FPV) modules for special applications have also been studies. The analysis of C-FPV modules and the modeling of power output under different environmental conditions (insolation, temperature) and contour angle will help in extracting maximum power output...|$|R
50|$|Several ways to {{deal with}} gaiji have been devised. Solutions that treat them as {{characters}} usually assign arbitrary Unicode values to them in the Private Use Areas (PUA). Such characters cannot be used outside the environment in which the association of the private Unicode to the glyph shape is known. Documents based on them are not <b>portable.</b> Other <b>installations</b> treat gaiji as graphics. This can be cumbersome because text layout and composition cannot apply to graphics. They cannot be searched for. Often their rendering looks different from surrounding characters because the machinery for rendering graphics usually is different from the machinery for rendering glyphs from fonts.|$|R

The operator of the system reported shutting down and abandoning the system within {{the first year after}} <b>installation.</b> <b>Portable</b> mechanical dehumidifiers were used for roughly six years until a retrofit project brought this to management's attention. Investigations revealed that the dehumidification system design and installation were causing water to condense in the regeneration air ducts which then drained through the desiccant dehumidifiers and regeneration air ducts. Recommended corrections are discussed but have not been implemented and tested...|$|R
50|$|Radio Direction Finding {{technology}} - later termed Radar {{to follow}} the American terminology - {{was developed by the}} British during the lead up to the second world war and was quickly shared with its major allies, including Australia. The enemy did not possess the technology; hence its development and application gave the allies an edge at a crucial time during the war. The equipment installed at the Australian radar stations was mostly an Australian version of the original British technology. The British Aircraft to Surface Vessel Mk I was modified by Australia's Radiophysics Laboratory (RPL) to a Shore Defence or Coastal Artillery radar then rapidly modified again by RPL to become Air Warning Mk I. These Australian electronics were the first in the world to have a timebase which was virtually unaffected by voltage variations in the power supply. The Australian version was designed for the tropics and was lightweight and <b>portable</b> for <b>installation</b> in remote locations.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent beam instabilities due to the {{coupling}} impedance of vacuum tanks containing septum magnets, electrostatic inflectors, etc., in a proton synchrotron the author makes routine measurements with <b>portable</b> instruments before <b>installation.</b> A center conductor of 1 cm diameter placed in the standard vacuum pipe forms a 125 Omega coaxial line. If a nonstandard vacuum tank is inserted one observes reflection and transmission coefficients. To save the laborious impedance transformations in the frequency domain the reflected and transmitted waveforms are photographed in the time domain. Their interpretation in terms of frequency dependent impedances is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Grounding (earthing) of {{distribution}} circuits is a notable difference in practice between wiring {{systems of the}} United States {{and those of other}} regions. Since the early 1960s, wiring in new construction has required a separate grounding conductor used to bond (electrically connect) all normally non-current carrying parts of an electrical <b>installation.</b> <b>Portable</b> appliances with metal cases also have a bonding conductor in the flexible cable and plug connecting them to the distribution system. The circuit return conductor (neutral) is also connected to ground at the service entrance panel only; no other connections from neutral to ground are allowed, unlike regulations {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|R
40|$|While {{work has}} been done on connectivity, {{mobility}} and general rendezvous systems for ubiquitous computing environments, research has been hampered by the lack of higher level application abstractions. To identify what these might be, we constructed a prototype ubiquitous computing environment which we call an Interactive Workspace, and observed how application writers attempted to use its facilities. We also identify system support issues for ubiquitous computing that differ from their counterparts in "traditional" single-node computing, and use them to guide the design of a set of abstractions to support ubiquitous computing applications deployed in spaces such as ours. Our implemented prototype meta-operatingsystem, iROS, and several applications in daily use on top of it, suggest that we have made progress toward the goal of providing support for application-level ubiquitous computing abstractions {{in a way that is}} robust to transient failures, extensible, <b>portable</b> across <b>installations,</b> and easy to program. Finally, as we consider future work, we argue that the abstractions we identified [...] -moving data around, moving interfaces around, and coordinating the behavior of existing monolithic applications [...] -are fundamental to this style of ubiquitous computing generally...|$|R

40|$|This {{book draws}} on the {{complementary}} fields of visual cultural studies and interpretative archaeology to examine how successive generations transformed their visual culture to construct themselves, exploring this process through an extended case-study of art and social life in prehistoric south-east Italy, between the Upper Palaeolithic and the Bronze Age. A central argument is that {{a wide range of}} visually communicative artworks were consumed and produced in the cultural process. Such objects range from <b>portable</b> artefacts, to <b>installations</b> within sites, to monumental structures in the landscape – all of which were interwoven with people’s bodies in the experiences of daily life and special performances. More specifically, it is argued that these powerful aesthetic objects were actively used by people across space and time to perceive the world around them and to reproduce their social lives. They helped people to establish personal and collective boundaries, identities and relationships, to acquire and exercise power, to promote ideologies, and to contest them, especially at times of social tension...|$|R
50|$|In 1991 SMART Technologies {{introduced}} an Interactive Whiteboard. It {{was a large}} touch-sensitive (resistive technology) board mounted on the wall, on which the image from a projector was displayed, that through a USB connection to a computer indicated where the presenter was touching it, allowing the presenter to virtually interact with the computer desktop (as is projected on the board), or to dispense virtual ink to annotate the displayed image. It was not <b>portable,</b> required professional <b>installation</b> and calibration, it worked only when the presenter/teacher is at the board. Other products (Mimio, eBeam) came out after that. Those were “after-market” products that were aimed at working with existing projectors. However, they still required professional installation, calibration, had limited portability once they were installed on the wall, and still restricted the presenter to the board. Some of those products were incorporated into projectors, thus introducing the interactive projector. Interactive projectors once again require professional installation, are less affordable, and would not work with existing projectors.|$|R
40|$|Motivation: The {{recent efforts}} of various {{sequence}} projects to sequence deeply into various phylogenies provide great resources for comparative sequence analysis. A generic and portable tool {{is essential for}} scientists to visualize and analyze sequence comparisons. Results: We have developed SynBrowse, a synteny browser for visualizing and analyzing genome alignments both within and between species. It is intended to help scientists study macrosynteny, microsynteny and homologous genes between sequences. It can also aid with the identification of uncharacterized genes, putative regulatory elements and novel structural features of a species. SynBrowse is a GBrowse (the Generic Genome Browser) family software tool that runs {{on top of the}} open source BioPerl modules. It consists of two components: a web-based front end and a set of relational database back ends. Each database stores pre-computed alignments from a focus sequence to reference sequences in addition to the genome annotations of the focus sequence. The user interface lets end users select a key comparative alignment type and search for syntenic blocks between two sequences and zoom in to view the relationships among the corresponding genome annotations in detail. SynBrowse is <b>portable</b> with simple <b>installation,</b> flexible configuration, convenient data input and easy integration with other components of a model organism system...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{embedded}} generation and <b>portable</b> electrical <b>installations</b> {{has led to}} an increased demand for low cost, flexible and reliable generator systems for military and commercial applications. An interior permanent magnet (IPM) machine has high power density due to its reluctance torque and magnetic torque components so it can produce a large constant power-speed range. However, an IPM machine needs demagnetizing current at high-speed during the flux-weakening region and thus develops an inverter shutdown problem in an uncontrolled generator mode operation. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the IPM machine, the permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance generator (PMa-SynRG) can be a good solution for low cost, high efficiency reliable generator systems. A PMa-SynRG can produce a high efficiency drive by utilizing the proper amount of magnet and reluctance torque. This work proposes a PMa-SynRG with two flux barriers and permanent magnets embedded in the second layer of the rotor. A neodymium magnet (NdFeB) was used as permanent magnets in the rotor to prevent demagnetization. Finding the minimum amount of magnet is {{one of the goals of}} the optimization process. The objectives of this work are to build an optimal design for the 3 kW generator and an advanced power electronics converter for the PMa-SynRG drive system. In order to find the optimized 3 kW machine, a Lumped Parameter Model (LPM) was used to achieve fast computation, and Differential Evolution Strategy (DES) was used to embed the LPM in an efficient numerical optimization routine to identify optimum designs. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used for test performance of optimum designs. On the basis of differences between LPM and FEA, model predictions were used to fine tune the LPM model. For new optimum design converges, numerical optimizations and iterations were performed to produce LPM and FEA predictions. For the drive system, the thyristor based, current-fed drive is much simpler and has lower power losses compared to the pulse width modulation (PWM) drive. Eliminating the requirement for self-controlled switches is a distinct advantage for lower cost. Another feature of the developed current-fed drive is its inherent capability to provide generating action by making the PMa-SynRG operates as a generator, rectifying the phase voltages by means of the three-phase rectifier and feeding the power into the load. These features make the current-fed drive a good candidate for driving any type of synchronous generators including the proposed PMa-SynRG...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge about {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} soil moisture distribution {{is one of the}} key elements in land and water management and supports the prediction of climate relevant events. Although information of soil moisture conditions is of utmost importance, it is still difficult to obtain reliable information over the field-scale. A possibility of filling that information gap is the indirect mapping of soil moisture by easily recordable physical variables, e. g. from the electric conductivity measured by electromagnetic induction (EMI) due to the (dependent) relationship between moisture and electric soil conditions. EMI has been an established tool for subsurface characterization for several decades and has the capacity to non-invasively map over larger spatial areas with low operation costs. However, the recorded electrical conductivity (EC) is an integrated value and includes the effects of clay and mineral properties, porosity and water content; hence, making an allocation to one of these qualities, in this case oil moisture, can be difficult. The Wireless Sensor Network SoilNet at Wüstebach catchment (approx. 27 ha) provides a reliable near-real-time monitoring of soil moisture at three different exploration depths (Bogena et al. 2010). However the SoilNet network is spatial limited, not <b>portable</b> and <b>installation,</b> monitoring and service are time and effort costly. A combination of the advantages of EMI measurement with these reliable moisture data could improve the allocation of the ECa signal to soil moisture values. This offers the deriving of moisture information from EMI maps recorded at areas outside of the network time and cost efficient. In this study we analysed EMI data from Wüstebach of two different exploration depths obtained during different weather condition / seasons. To separate the dynamic moisture signal from the geological background signal, we subtracted the temporal ECa values from the mean values and delineated so the relative changes at each depth as proxy for moisture changes. We also used the standard deviations estimated from the temporal ECa changes and identified therewith areas of higher and lower dynamic soil moisture changes. A comparison with the corresponding SoilNet data confirms similar areas of higher and lower soil moisture fluctuation and general trends, both {{spatial and temporal}}. The study demonstrates the ability of non-invasively hydrogeophysical measurement to reveal soil moisture pattern with relatively low effort. Thus the applied approach provides an adequate alternative to time and cost consuming invasive methods. The study also shows that the practice of EMI monitoring is not limited by areas with heterogeneous topography and / or complex accessibility appropriated for application within conifer forests...|$|R
