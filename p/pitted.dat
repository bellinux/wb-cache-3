5|$|By lap10, Massa {{had opened}} his lead over Räikkönen to 4.4seconds, ahead of Kubica, Heidfeld, Kovalainen and Trulli. Kubica {{was the first}} of the frontrunners to pit, on lap17.

Following the first round of pit stops, the gap between the Ferraris was 5.4seconds, however by lap31 Räikkönen had closed to within four seconds of his teammate. Massa held a 3.6second lead over Räikkönen when the two Ferraris <b>pitted</b> for the final time on laps 39and 38, respectively, and Massa retained his lead into the final stint. Kubica <b>pitted</b> on lap41, Heidfeld on lap45, and Kovalainen on lap47.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pitted</b> terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the <b>pitted</b> terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the <b>pitted</b> terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by <b>pitted</b> terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E

Bordered <b>pits</b> {{of the opposite}} cells form bordered <b>pit</b> pair. The cavity in the thick secondary wall is called <b>pit</b> chamber.

In certain cases, the <b>pit</b> apertures are lenticular or linear or mai. ‘the <b>pi.t</b> membrane of bordered <b>pit</b> develops an oval thickening in the middle. It is called torus. <b>Pit</b> membrane is flexible. The liquid in cell put pressure on torus membrane. <b>Pit</b> membrane pushes the torus.

5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had <b>pitted</b> just before the incident. Thus the pit lane was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced to pit {{in order to avoid}} running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When the pit lane was re-opened {{and the rest of the}} field <b>pitted,</b> Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left the pit lane while the red light was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|E

From slight <b>pitting</b> to moderate <b>pitting</b> and from moderate <b>pitting</b> to severe <b>pitting,</b> a large change of feature values can be observed from the top six features.

5|$|Piquet, on a {{one-stop}} strategy {{after his}} poor qualifying performance, had fortuitously <b>pitted</b> {{immediately prior to}} the safety car's deployment and was also fuelled {{to the end of}} the race. Promoted to third place from 14th beforehand following the pit stops, he was set to take the lead once Hamilton and Heidfeld (who also had not <b>pitted</b> under the safety car conditions) <b>pitted</b> for their final stops. Further back, Vettel squeezed past Alonso at the pit exit, pushing him over the white line separating the pit lane exit from the track. Alonso complained over his radio but no action was taken against either driver. Meanwhile, Räikkönen dropped several places to 11th, having had to queue behind Massa at the second pit stops.|$|E
5|$|Robert Kubica {{was quickly}} losing {{ground on the}} two Ferraris and Hamilton. Alonso passed Rosberg for seventh, and quickly closed in on Heidfeld, but stayed behind him until he <b>pitted</b> on Lap 16.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that species-specific <b>pit</b> properties such as <b>pit</b> membrane thickness, <b>pit</b> membrane porosity, torus-to-aperture diameter ratio and <b>pit</b> chamber depth influence xylem vulnerability to cavitation. Despite the indisputable importance of using mean <b>pit</b> characteristics, considerable variability in <b>pit</b> structure within a single species or even within a single <b>pit</b> field should be acknowledged. According to the rare <b>pit</b> hypothesis, a single <b>pit</b> that is more air-permeable than many neighboring <b>pits</b> is sufficient to allow air-seeding. Therefore, any irregularities or morphological abnormalities in <b>pit</b> structure allowing air-seeding should be associated with increased vulnerability to cavitation. Considering the currently proposed models of air-seeding, <b>pit</b> features such as rare, large pores in the <b>pit</b> membrane, torus extensions, and plasmodesmatal pores in a torus can represent potential glitches. These aberrations in <b>pit</b> structure could either result from inherent developmental flaws, or from damage caused to the <b>pit</b> membrane by chemical and physical agents. This suggests the existence of interesting feedbacks between abiotic and biotic stresses in xylem physiology...|$|R

5|$|Vettel <b>pitted</b> {{from first}} {{position}} on lap18. Kovalainen, Webber and Massa <b>pitted</b> fourlaps later. Light rain {{began to fall}} on lap26, though only lasted five minutes. Glock, Trulli, Räikkönen and Hamilton completed their first pit stops over the following laps. Coulthard was the first driver to try intermediate wet-weather tyres when he <b>pitted</b> on lap28.

By lap36 {{the majority of the}} field were running on intermediate tyres. Webber was passed at turneight by Massa on lap35. The Australian spun after the corner, though managed to retain seventhposition. A lap later, however, Hamilton outbraked Webber at turnthree and demoted the Red Bull driver to eighth.|$|E
