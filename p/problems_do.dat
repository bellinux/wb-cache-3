Burbank's City Manager, Mike Flad, estimated the city's 2009–10 fiscal budget will suffer a 5% shortfall. For the city's 2010–11 fiscal year, the city projected a deficit of $5.8 million and projected the deficit will remain a problem at least until 2014–15, when it is projected to be $6.9 million.

25|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) is a {{group of}} {{permanent}} movement disorders that appear in early childhood. Signs and symptoms vary among people. Often, symptoms include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors. There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, swallowing, and speaking. Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl, or walk as early as other children of their age. Other symptoms include seizures and problems with thinking or reasoning, each of which occurs in about one third of people with CP. While the symptoms may get more noticeable over {{the first few years of}} life, the underlying <b>problems</b> <b>do</b> not worsen over time.|$|E

2500|$|In {{complexity}} theory, the unsolved P versus NP problem asks if {{all problems}} in NP have polynomial-time algorithms. All the best-known algorithms for NP-complete problems like 3SAT etc. take exponential time. Indeed, it is conjectured for many natural NP-complete {{problems that they}} do not have sub-exponential time algorithms. Here [...] "sub-exponential time" [...] is taken to mean the second definition presented below. (On the other hand, many graph problems represented in the natural way by adjacency matrices are solvable in subexponential time simply because the size of the input is square of the number of vertices.) This conjecture (for the k-SAT problem) is known as the exponential time hypothesis. Since it is conjectured that NP-complete <b>problems</b> <b>do</b> not have quasi-polynomial time algorithms, some inapproximability results in the field of approximation algorithms make the assumption that NP-complete <b>problems</b> <b>do</b> not have quasi-polynomial time algorithms. For example, see the known inapproximability results for the set cover problem.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Problems</b> <b>do</b> {{sometimes}} {{occur in}} the area of self classification by the person concerned. During the phase of the [...] "coming-out", self-questioning related to one's own [...] "normality" [...] is quite common. According to Moser, the discovery of BDSM preferences can result in fear of the current non-BDSM relationship's destruction. This, combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life, leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome. At the same time, the denial of BDSM preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one's own [...] "vanilla"-lifestyle, feeding the apprehension of finding no partner. Moser states that BDSM practitioners having problems finding BDSM partners would probably have problems in finding a non-BDSM partner as well. The wish to remove BDSM preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases. Finally, the scientist states that BDSM practitioners seldom commit violent crimes. From his point of view, crimes of BDSM practitioners usually have no connection with the BDSM components existing in their life. Moser's study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence, which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates, adoption possibilities, custody or other social rights or privileges. The Swiss psychoanalyst Fritz Morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book, Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion (1988). He states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior, but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards their own preferences. In 1940 psychoanalyst Theodor Reik reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft.|$|E
60|$|Amongst these nice, and {{therefore}} dangerous points of casuistry, may be reckoned the question so much agitated {{in the present}} hour,--Whether, after the people have discharged themselves of their original power by an habitual delegation, no occasion can possibly occur which may justify the resumption of it? This question, in this latitude, {{is very hard to}} affirm or deny: but I am satisfied that no occasion can justify such a resumption, which would not equally authorize a dispensation with any other moral duty, perhaps with all of them together. However, if in general it be not easy to determine concerning the lawfulness of such devious proceedings, which must be ever on the edge of crimes, it is far from difficult to foresee the perilous consequences of the resuscitation of such a power in the people. The practical consequences of any political tenet go a great way in deciding upon its value. Political <b>problems</b> <b>do</b> not primarily concern truth or falsehood. They relate to good or evil.
