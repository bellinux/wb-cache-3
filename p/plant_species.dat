5|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of wasps play no role in pollination, a few species can effectively transport pollen and pollinate several <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for pollen storage (Pollen basket) as some bees do, pollen does not stick to them well. However {{it has been shown that}} even without hairs, several wasp species are able to effectively transport pollen, therefore contributing for potential pollination of several <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

Direct observations were conducted to observe feeding activity of the starling after release. Results of this study showed that 105 <b>plants</b> <b>species</b> have been identified in Ped village. About 30 species (in varied habitus of trees, shrubs, and herbs) acted as food resources for the starling. Part of <b>plants</b> <b>species</b> which had been used as food resources were fruits and seeds. Besides plants as food sources, insects were also available on the studi site (such as grasshopper, ants, caterpillars, butterflies).

40|$|The {{utilization}} of plants {{as a source}} of life that is done in order to fulfill the daily needs with the ability to adapt, will try to satisfy their needs according to availability around them. The ethnobotany of traditional use of plants by the community is essential to keep the knowledge of their wisdom in the use of plants. This study aims to determine the types and parts of plants used by rural communities Pesaguan Kanan. The benefits of the research are expected to maintain the existing knowledge in the community to develop forest resources. This research is using snowball sampling method tointerview by the number of respondents as many as 60 people. Data from interviews conducted directly are analyzed in order to obtain results {{in the form of a}} systematic and accurate description. From the results of research there are 200 <b>species</b> of <b>plants</b> which are grouped into 76 families consisting of food <b>plants</b> 91 <b>species,</b> medicinal <b>plants</b> 73 <b>species,</b> coloring material <b>plants</b> 7 <b>species,</b> <b>plant</b> pesticide <b>plant</b> 3 <b>species,</b> ornamental <b>plants</b> 56 <b>species,</b> fodder <b>plants</b> 9 <b>species,</b> wood-producing <b>plants</b> 10 <b>species,</b> <b>plant</b> materials 12 <b>species,</b> <b>plant</b> producing rope, webbing and crafts 14 species.
