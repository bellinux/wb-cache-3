5000|$|Identification of Malassezia on skin {{has been}} {{aided by the}} {{application}} of molecular or DNA-based techniques. These investigations show that the Malassezia species causing most skin disease in humans, including {{the most common cause}} of dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis, is M. globosa (though M. restricta is also involved). [...] The skin rash of tinea versicolor (<b>pityriasis</b> <b>versicolor)</b> is also due to infection by this fungus.|$|E
50|$|In 1846, Karl Ferdinand Eichstedt was {{the first}} to {{identify}} the association of fungi with <b>pityriasis</b> <b>versicolor,</b> a common infection associated with the genus Malassezia. The name applied to the fungal agent responsible shifted multiple times over the next 150 years until the genus Pityrosporum was settled upon for the teleomorph, and Malassezia for the anamorph. Through the use of genetic sequencing, a number of new species have since been identified.|$|E
50|$|Sulfacetamide {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for use in the}} treatment of <b>pityriasis</b> <b>versicolor</b> and rosacea. It also has anti-inflammatory properties when used to treat blepharitis or conjunctivitis (in eye-drop solution). It is believed to work by limiting the presence of folic acid which bacteria need to survive. It has been suggested that sulfacetamide may also serve as a treatment for mild forms of hidradenitis suppurativa. Sulfacetamide has antibacterial activity and is used to control acne. Products containing sulfacetamide and sulfur (a keratolytic) are commonly promoted for the treatment of acne rosacea (rosacea with papules, pustules, or both). There are several prescription topical products containing sulfacetamide, such as foams, shampoos, cream and washes.|$|E
50|$|Tinea versicolor (also {{known as}} dermatomycosis furfuracea, <b>pityriasis</b> <b>versicolor,</b> and tinea flava) is a {{condition}} characterized by a skin eruption on the trunk and proximal extremities, hypopigmentation macule in area of sun induced pigmentation. During the winter the pigment becomes reddish brown. Recent {{research has shown that}} the majority of tinea versicolor is caused by the Malassezia globosa fungus, although Malassezia furfur is responsible for a small number of cases. These yeasts are normally found on the human skin and only become troublesome under certain circumstances, such as a warm and humid environment, although the exact conditions that cause initiation of the disease process are poorly understood. Treatment include griseofulivin, topical selenium shampoo and topical ketoconazole.|$|E
5000|$|... ====Pityriasis versicolor==== <b>Pityriasis</b> <b>versicolor</b> is a skin {{disorder}} {{that leads to}} the formation of patches on the skin that are either hypo- or hyperpigemented. It may be found on oilier areas of the body including the neck and trunk. Besides M. sympodialis, several species of Malassezia have been identified on individuals with the disorder including, M. globosa, M. slooffiae and several others. Some believe that M. globosa is responsible for the disease as it has been found in higher numbers, but this has not yet been confirmed. Confirmation of the agent of disease involves microscopic examination of skin scrapings from the infected individuals for the presence of thick-walled yeast cells intermixed with broad hyphae. Ointments containing fungicidal ingredients such as selenium {{can be applied to the}} affected area. Oral medications are also used in some cases.|$|E
50|$|It {{was very}} {{effective}} in treating <b>Pityriasis</b> <b>versicolor,</b> Tinea pedia and Candida intetrigo, with 100% cure. Oyelami et al. (2003) concluded that Acalypha wilkesiana ointment {{can be used to}} treat superficial mycoses. Akinyemi et al. (2005) evaluated crude extracts from six important medicinal plants, namely Phylantus discoideus, Ageratum conyzoides, Terminalia avicennioides, Bridella ferruginea, Acalypha wilkesiana and Ocimum gratissimum, to find activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA. Water and ethanolic extracts of these plants were obtained locally. MRSA strains isolated from patients were used. Both ethanolic and water extracts showed effects on MRSA. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of these plants ranged from 30.4-37.0 Âµg/ml and 18.2-24.0 Âµg/ml respectively. A high MBS value was found in two plants and the other four contained traceable amounts of anthraquinones. This study provided scientific support for the use of Acalypha wilkesiana, T. avicennioides, O. gratissimum and P. discoidens against MRSA based diseases. A. conyzoides and B. ferruginea were unresponsive against the MRSA strains.|$|E
