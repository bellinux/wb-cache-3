50|$|Haw flakes {{have been}} seized on several {{occasions}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration for containing <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R</b> (E124, Acid Red 18), an unapproved artificial coloring. <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R</b> is used in Europe, Asia and Australia but is not approved by the US FDA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R</b> is a {{strawberry}} red azo dye {{which can be}} used in a variety of food products, and is usually synthesized from aromatic hydrocarbons; it is stable to light, heat, and acid but fades in the presence of ascorbic acid.|$|E
50|$|Sugar, Acidity Regulators: Malic Acid, Tartaric Acid; sodium bicarbonate, stearic acid, Modified starch, E470b, Anti-Caking Agent: Magnesium Carbonate; Flavourings, Colours: E100 (turmeric or curcumin), E104 (Quinoline Yellow WS), E110 (Sunset Yellow FCF), E122 (Azorubine), E124 (<b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R),</b> E129 (Allura Red AC), E132 (Indigo carmine), Elderberry Extract.|$|E
50|$|While the {{ingredients}} vary somewhat from one drink to another, {{the ingredients}} of the Lucozade Original Energy, were listed as follows in 2013: carbonated water, glucose syrup (25%), citric acid (E330), lactic acid (E270), flavouring (unspecified), preservatives (potassium sorbate, sodium bisulphite (E-222)), caffeine, antioxidant (ascorbic acid), colour (sunset yellow (E110), <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R).</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, the Food Standards Agency of the UK {{called for}} food {{manufacturers}} to voluntarily stop using six food additive colours, Tartrazine, Allura Red, <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R,</b> Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine (dubbed the [...] "Southampton 6") by 2009, {{and provided a}} document to assist in replacing the colors with other colors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R</b> (known by {{more than}} 100 synonyms, {{including}} as C.I. 16255, Cochineal Red A, C.I. Acid Red 18, Brilliant Scarlet 3R, Brilliant Scarlet 4R, New Coccine, is a synthetic colourant {{that may be used}} as a food colouring. It is denoted by E Number E124. Its chemical name is 1-(4-sulpho-1-napthylazo)- 2-napthol- 6,8-disulphonic acid, trisodium salt. Ponceau (French for [...] "poppy-coloured") is the generic name for a family of azo dyes.|$|E
50|$|Irn-Bru and Diet Irn-Bru {{have been}} {{formulated}} since 2002 by A.G. Barr plc {{to meet the}} regulations for food colouring of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R,</b> used in the UK formulation, is prohibited by the FDA. Barr uses alternative food and drink colourants manufactured by a U.S. company approved by the FDA. The product labelling also meets U.S. labelling standards on nutritional information and bar code. Compliant Irn-Bru is solely imported by Great Scot International in Charlotte, North Carolina, who supplies distributors and retailers throughout the U.S. It is only supplied in 500 ml.|$|E
50|$|Annatto {{condiments}} and colorants {{are safe}} for most people when used in food amounts, but they may cause allergic reactions in those who are sensitive. In one 1978 study of 61 patients suffering from chronic hives or angioedema, 56 patients were orally provoked by annatto extract during an elimination diet. A challenge was performed with a dose equivalent to the amount used in 25 g of butter. Twenty-six {{percent of the patients}} reacted to this color four hours after intake, worse than amaranth (9%) or synthetic dyes such as tartrazine (11%), Sunset Yellow FCF (17%), Food Red 17 (16%), <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R</b> (15%), erythrosine (12%) and Brilliant Blue FCF (14%).|$|E
50|$|Irn-Bru {{is known}} for its bright orange colour. As of 1999 it {{contained}} 0.002% of ammonium ferric citrate, sugar, 32 flavouring agents including caffeine and quinine (but not in Australia), and two controversial colourings (Sunset Yellow FCF and <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R).</b> On 27 January 2010, A.G. Barr agreed to a Food Standards Agency voluntary ban on these two colourings although no date was set for their replacement. However, after lobbying by First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond, a proposed restriction of Sunset Yellow to 10 mg was eased to 20 mg in 2011 â€” the same amount present in Irn Bru. As of May 2017, Irn-Bru still contains these colourings.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to {{concerns about the}} safety of certain food additives, the UK FSA commissioned a study by researchers at Southampton University of the effect of a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R,</b> Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine (dubbed the [...] "Southampton 6")) and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007. [...] The study found [...] "a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity" [...] in the children; the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 1970s and the well-publicised {{advocacy}} of Benjamin Feingold, {{there has been}} public concern that food colorings may cause ADHD-like behavior in children. [...] These concerns have led the FDA and other food safety authorities to regularly review the scientific literature, and led the UK FSA to commission a study by researchers at Southampton University {{of the effect of}} a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R,</b> Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine (dubbed the [...] "Southampton 6")) and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007.

5000|$|After {{concerns}} were expressed that food colorings may cause ADHD-like behavior in children, the collective evidence {{do not support}} this assertion. The US FDA and other food safety authorities to regularly review the scientific literature, and led the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) to commission a study by researchers at Southampton University {{of the effect of}} a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, <b>Ponceau</b> <b>4R,</b> Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine (dubbed the [...] "Southampton 6")) on children in the general population. These colorants are found in beverages. The study found [...] "a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity" [...] in the children; the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended". The U.S. FDA did not make changes following the publication of the Southampton study, but following a citizen petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest in 2008, requesting the FDA ban several food additives, the FDA reviewed the available evidence, and still made no changes.|$|E
