40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} reinforcing material and architecture on the voids content, mechanical properties and tribological behavior of fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminates manufactured by VARTM under different processing conditions. Two different textile architectures, namely unidirectional non-crimp fabrics (UD) and 0 / 90 <b>plain</b> <b>wave</b> (PW), were considered, reinforcing an EPIKOTE RIMR 135 epoxy matrix with glass (GF) as well as carbon (CF) continuous fibers. Optical observations revealed an unexpected trend relatively to the intra- and inter-bundle voids concentration with respect to the impregnation velocity, especially using UD-CF and UD-GF reinforcements and low impregnation rate. Tensile and three points bending tests highlighted the dominant role of fiber material and architecture on mechanical properties, whereas the presence of voids played a minor role with respect to the analyzed features. Tribological outcomes evidenced a reduction of the friction coefficient (m) when the resin is reinforced by carbon or glass fibers. The lowest values were detected when the sliding direction of the counterbody is oriented parallel to the fiber direction for UD samples. Further reduction of m, for both UD and PW specimens, was obtained by interposing a lubricant at the interface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In {{the design}} of Reflector antenna systems, the control of sidelobes caused from {{spillover}} of the primary pattern presents a major design challenge. The design of the illumination pattern of the reflector system is key to designing a reflector system that optimizes gain while minimizing {{the level of the}} sidelobes. The reduction of spillover sidelobes requires the use of large aperture feeds that provide a highly tapered illumination pattern. One of the traditional methods for accomplishing this design is the use of large aperture conical or corrugated horns for the feed. These designs are extremely effective for single band feeds but present problems when needed to operate over an extended frequency band. The approach presented in this paper attempts to illustrate a broadband solution to the feed pattern shaping design. The use of a doubly shaped lens placed at the aperture of a multi-band feed is investigated. The investigation is performed on a parabolic antenna system. The first surface of the lens transforms the radiation pattern into a <b>plain</b> <b>wave</b> exiting the feed aperture. The second surface then refocuses the radiation to {{the focal point of the}} reflector’s parabolic surface. This approach allows greater control of the primary pattern and allows the illumination pattern to be optimized for the antenna system design...|$|E
