5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} <b>precision</b> <b>machining</b> is required, {{especially}} for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for <b>precision</b> <b>machining</b> properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E

25|$|The natural {{progression}} was {{to streamline}} the assembly process and the company introduced a method known as Progressive Construction. In this process the mass-produced parts were combined into “unit assemblies”, each {{of which was a}} major sub-component of the finished carriage such as side panels, carriage ends or the roof. The workshops were organised on the “flow-line” principle, similar to a modern assembly line, and the unit assemblies were taken to workstations, where the <b>precision</b> <b>machining</b> of the mass-produced parts ensured they all fitted accurately into position, building into a complete carriage as the unit moved along the flow line. The technique was already in use in Derby prior to grouping, and was adopted in Wolverton during 1925, with Newton Heath following two years later. By using this method, the time taken to construct a typical carriage fell from six weeks to six days and by 1931 Derby and Wolverton were able to handle the entire LMS carriage building workload, and production at Newton Heath ceased.|$|E
25|$|The {{telescope}}s amateur telescope makers build {{range from}} backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful {{contributions to the}} field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, astrometry, photometry, comet and asteroid discovery to name just a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing deep sky objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and astrophotography of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the design, size, and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers {{do not have access to}} high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford focuser, and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring <b>precision</b> <b>machining.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a sophisticated trajectory tracking algorithm {{based on the}} utilization of the compound control and fuzzy contour control for the ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machine</b> tools. The main idea {{is to use the}} compound control to broaden the bandwidth of the servo system and, therefore, improve the tracking accuracy of the single axis. Then, FUZZY cross coupled contour control is introduced to compensate for the contour error caused by imperfect dynamics of the tracking axis and the mismatch of the control parameters of the servo systems. Experiments carried out on the HCM- 1 ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machine</b> tool with a T-type layout show that the integration of the compound control with the fuzzy cross coupled contour control can effectively improve the contour tracking accuracy of the ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machine</b> tool...|$|R
