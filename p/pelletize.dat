40|$|As of March 2011, {{there were}} about 3. 3 million cattle, 7 million pigs, and 140 million poultry in Republic of Korea, {{producing}} about 46. 5 million tons of animal manure.

This study presents novel methods for this purpose, including analyses of influence of the raw material properties on the energy requirements in the sequence of subprocesses (compression, flow, and friction components) that constitute the <b>pelletizing</b> process, {{and the strength of}} the pellets. The methods were used to analyze the importance of <b>pelletizing</b> temperature and MC and the differences between sawdust of European beech (Fagus sylvática L) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L).

The Mather A Mine opened in the early 1940s and the Mather B shaft in the 1950s. As the Cold War continued, reserves of mineable hematite dwindled in northern Minnesota and Cleveland-Cliffs returned some of its focus to its traditional areas of interest around Marquette, Michigan, where new deposits of magnetite were opened. The first pellet plant was built at Eagle Mills in 1954, followed by the first grate/kiln plant at the Humboldt Mine in 1960. The Republic Mine was converted from a shaft mine to an open pit and concentrator in 1956 and a two-kiln pellet plant was added in 1962. The Empire Mine opened in 1963 and was expanded in the mid- and late-1970s; the Pioneer Pellet Plant was opened in 1965 to <b>pelletize</b> the underground ore from the Mather B Mine in Negaunee.

40|$|There {{is growing}} global {{interest}} on bio-methane as a vehicular fuel and Europe Union (EU) {{has stated that}} this as a best well-to-wheel fuel. Commercialization of bio-methane under atmospheric conditions is limited due to its requirement of higher storage capacity.

Thus, adsorbed bio-methane is suggested as a better alternative to store methane under low pressure conditions & activated carbon (AC) has shown promise as a methane adsorbent. This study is based on identifying the potential absorptivity of bio-methane into commercially available AC in Sri Lanka. The paper presents the pathway envisage in this task. Two types of commercial AC samples as granular & <b>pelletize</b> forms have been used from supplier HAYCARB for the analysis. In this paper, characterization data from the principals is used to investigate the methane uptake potential into commercial AC.

40|$|ABSTRACT A feed {{production}} trial {{was conducted to}} study the effect of synthetic emulsifier and natural biosurfactant the process and quality of pelletized broiler feed. A corn-soy based broiler diet was formulated with fixed ratio 2 : 1 of oil-to-water with two types of emulsifiers, namely glyceryl polyethylene glycol ricinoleate synthetic emulsifier and lysophosphatidylcholine natural biosurfactant. T 1 : Basal diet with no water and no emulsifier; T 2 : Basal diet with water and no emulsifier; T 3 : Basal diet with water and synthetic emulsifier glyceryl polyethylene glycol ricinoleate; T 4 : Basal diet with water and a natural biosurfactant lysophosphatidylcholine as comparative treatment. The treatment diets were manufactured by a commercial feed mill. The electricity cost and meal temperature were measured {{during the process of}} milling. Composite samples were collected from different processed points, tested for physical properties, chemical stability and biostability of pelletized feed. Pellet quality of emulsifier supplemented diets was significantly (p< 0. 05) improved in crumble and pellet intact form. Correlation between emulsifier and <b>pelletize</b> processed cost was not observed in this present study. No deteriorate effect was observed in hydrolytic rancidity (AV), oxidation rancidity (PV), mold count, moisture content and water activity. However, percentage of starch gelatinization on pelletized feed was significantly (p< 0. 0001) improved in both types of emulsifier treated diets. These results demonstrated that the addition of emulsifier to broiler diet improved pellet quality to some extent although significant difference between synthetic emulsifier and natural biosurfactant was not observed.

40|$|This graphic {{illustrates}} {{the life cycle}} of horticultural film, with a focus on recycling. Horticultural films include several quite different products: mulch and fumigation films, low and high tunnels, greenhouse and hoophouse covers, irrigation tubes, bags for inputs and storage, and more. At this point in time, virtually all are recyclable, though each with some challenges. These challenges fall into one of three categories: (i) characteristics inherent to these plastics, (ii) characteristics of the products after use on farms and in nurseries, and (iii) cost and logistics of collection and transport from fields (or nurseries) to recycling markets. Recycling is a multi-stepped process that involves collecting used material, reclaiming it, and then manufacturing new products with the recycled content. Materials that enter the recycling stream are not fully recycled until they are made into something new. Thus simply hauling recyclables away from the farm (or other place where they were used) does not constitute recycling. The recycling life cycle involves users who separate recyclables from garbage, haulers who collect the recyclables, and reclaimers (also called processors) who do some of the following: clean, shred, compact, densify, <b>pelletize,</b> etc. Reclaimers will buy plastic recyclate from haulers only if they can sell their processed plastic to manufacturers who will incorporate it into new products. (To increase efficiency, improve the profit margin, and guarantee that they will have an adequate supply, many recycling companies carry out more than one of these recycling functions. They will, for example, both collect and process plastic, or process and also manufacture new products.) Very importantly, for recycling to be successful and sustainable over time, consumers—industrial and commercial buyers, government procurement offices, and individuals—must choose to buy products that are made with recycled content. Purchasing power is the fuel that keeps the gears of recycling turning...|$|E
40|$|The project {{goal was}} to develop an {{effective}} silica removal technology and couple that with existing electro-dialysis reversal (EDR) technology to achieve a cost effective treatment for impaired waters to allow for their use in the cooling towers of coal fired power plants. A quantitative target {{of the program was}} a 50 % reduction in the fresh water withdrawal at a levelized cost of water of $ 3. 90 /Kgal. Over the course of the program, a new molybdenum-modified alumina was developed that significantly outperforms existing alumina materials in silica removal both kinetically and thermodynamically. The Langmuir capacity is 0. 11 g silica/g adsorbent. Moreover, a low cost recycle/regeneration process was discovered to allow for multiple recycles with minimal loss in activity. On the lab scale, five runs were carried out with no drop in performance between the second and fifth run in ability to absorb the silica from water. The Mo-modified alumina was successfully prepared on a multiple kilogram scale and a bench scale model column was used to remove 100 ppm of silica from 400 liters of simulated impaired water. Significant water savings would result from such a process and the regeneration process could be further optimized to reduce water requirements. Current barriers to implementation are the base cost of the adsorbent material and the fine powder form that would lead to back pressure on a large column. If mesoporous materials become more commonly used in other areas and the price drops from volume and process improvements, then our material would also lower in price because the amount of molybdenum needed is low and no additional processing is required. There may well be engineering solutions to the fine powder issue; in a simple concept experiment, we were able to <b>pelletize</b> our material with Boehmite, but lost performance due to a dramatic decrease in surface area...|$|E
30|$|Besides {{the search}} for new precursors, the {{strategy}} also claims for {{the need to improve}} production processes in order to make them more energetically favourable, and also lower carbon dioxide emissions. Recently, hydrocarbonization (HTC) {{has proven to be a}} promising step in the production of cost effective carbon materials. By HTC, biomass was subjected to mild temperature conditions (150 – 350  °C) in a closed aqueous system. Under these conditions, the material starts undergoing hydrolysis reactions (the kinetics is strongly dependent on the heating conditions) which occur in parallel or in series with many other processes (decarboxylation, dehydration, polymerization…) [3]. Moreover, as hydrolysis occurs, more hydronium ions are produced which further enhances decomposition reactions. As a result, a wide variety of chemical compounds migrate to the liquid phase, and some gases are also formed, which causes an increase in the system pressure. After a period of time, a solid product called hydrochar (HC) is obtained. Several advantages associated to this process make it appealing. Firstly, it is a very simple, cost-effective process, as compared to other traditional thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis or gasification. In opposition to these processes, HTC temperatures are moderate and no gas feeding is needed. Thermodynamically, it is a very favourable process, since most of the occurring reactions are exothermic and the hydronium ions generated as a consequence of primary decomposition, act as catalysts of the process. Autogenous pressure is also a reaction promotor factor; it is produced as a result of gasification reactions in the bulk of the liquid phase, with no gases leaving the reactor, which is tightly closed; this also results in a null emission of harmful gaseous species. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that previous pieces of research have reported other benefits related to the thermal processing of the solid phase (HC) such as ease to <b>pelletize</b> [4], decrease of boiling ash temperature, or improvement of emissions during gasification [5], as compared to the initial precursor.|$|E

40|$|Protecting {{livestock}} feed from insect infestation {{is a common}} challenge that feed facility managers and farmers have to deal with. It becomes an issue of importance because insect infestation degrades feed quality and quantity. Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS) is added to {{livestock feed}} because of its high protein content. As DDGS usage in animal feed increases, understanding the susceptibility of DDGS, when mixed with livestock feed, to insect infestation is necessary for safe feed storage. This research addressed four questions. The first looked at the susceptibility of DDGS, when stored as a raw ingredient, to Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) infestation. DDGS susceptibility to T. castaneum was lower when stored as a raw ingredient compared with normal T. castaneum laboratory diet at 30 % r. h [...] However, increasing r. h. to 50 % and grinding DDGS samples, increased DDGS susceptibility to T. castaneum infestation. The second question concerned the susceptibility of livestock feed that contains DDGS to T. castaneum infestation. Results showed that adding any amount of DDGS to animal feed will not change diet susceptibility to T. castaneum infestation and feed pelletization negatively affected insect development. For the third question, experiments were conducted to determine the chemical and physical characteristics of DDGS which may influence its susceptibility to T. castaneum infestation. Particle size was the main factor affecting DDGS vulnerability to T. castaneum infestation. The fourth question focused on the alternative uses of DDGS as bait for monitoring T. castaneum. Efficacy of traps significantly increased when a combination of DDGS and food oil kairomone lures were used compared with food oil or empty traps. Therefore, DDGS {{may be a good}} additive to food oil lures to increase trap efficacy. In conclusion, T. castaneum development significantly increased when fed DDGS. Diet particle size and environmental humidity had significant effects on T. castaneum development. As a result, it is recommended that facility managers store DDGS as a raw ingredient, <b>pelletize</b> DDGS if it is cost-effective, and keep the storage humidity at 30 % or lower. ...|$|E

Also promote the sale of the bulk pellet because it would avoid the expensive and not environmentally friendly step of bagging. The financial risk was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). For a factory selling half of its production on the domestic market and the other half in foreign markets, the NAV has 42. 2 % chance of being negative and the IRR has 36 % chance of being below the minimum rate of attractiveness that was considered of 14. 15 % pa. The elasticity in relation to the NPV and the IRR of the variables forming the cost of production were estimated. This paper {{deals with the}} wood pellets production in Brazil: the strategy of the producers, the production costs and the investment risk. Nine plants were interviewed located in the southern region of the country: 43 % of production is exported, representing 23, 000 tons per year. Brazilian producers companies are generally small to medium sized (1200 to 25, 000 tons per year) and are focused on the transformation of pine wood shavings which is a residue from the timber industry with affordable and easy pelletização. Two main factors further the recent growth of Brazilian production: in the internal market, the competitiveness compared to other energy sources, and in the export market, the advantageous exchange. The cost of production was estimated at 340 R$. t- 1 without taxation. The cost of the raw material shavings represents 50 % of this cost and energy 15 %. The way to lower this cost would be <b>pelletize</b> wet sawdust which is a raw material abundant and cheaper.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of <b>pelletized</b> or extruded diets, with different levels of carbohydrate and lipid, on the gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) and its modulation in pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus). One hundred and eighty pacu juveniles were fed with eight isonitrogenous diets containing two carbohydrate levels (40 and 50 %) and two lipid levels (4 and 8 %). Four diets were <b>pelletized</b> and four were extruded. Carbohydrate and lipid experimental levels caused no changes to the bolus transit time. However, the bolus permanence time was related to diet processing. Fish fed <b>pelletized</b> diets exhibited the highest gastrointestinal transit time. Regression analysis of bolus behavior for <b>pelletized</b> and extruded diets with 4 % lipid depicted different fits. GITT regression analysis of fish fed 8 % lipid was fitted to a cubic equation and displayed adjustments of food permanence, with enhanced utilization of the diets, either with extruded or <b>pelletized</b> diets. GITT of fish fed extruded diets with 4 % lipid was adjusted to a linear equation. The GITT of pacu depends on the diet processing and is affected by dietary levels of lipid and carbohydrate...|$|R
