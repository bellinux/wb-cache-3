40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how the Swedish <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> {{neutrality}} has changed between the years 1990 - 2008. The research method used for this essay has been comparative case study, which strives to answer four research questions. Two of these questions are: Which specific occurrences have been fundamental in changing the Swedish <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> neutrality? How have the Swedish <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> neutrality and the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> non-alignment changed between the years 1990 - 2008 ? The theoretical frame work of this study consists of Europeanization as a comprehensive theoretical perspective. In order to explain the Swedish act regarding the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> neutrality, Logic of Consequences and Logic of appropriateness are used. The conclusion of the study points out that Sweden has become much more flexible in terms <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> neutrality and <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> security. The years between 1990 - 2008 are distinguished due to the fact that the international cooperation has become much more important in the Swedish act of security. Sweden still has the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> non-alignment, but cooperation between the states is more and more prioritized to secure peace around the world...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the data}} from Investigation Report of Land Use Change in China, The Land Resources Communique of China and Chronicle of Statistical Data for Five Decades of New China issued from Ministry of Land Resources, we select two indices: change of {{farmland}} quantity and <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection. According to econometric theory, by using Eviewes 5. 1 software, co-integration analysis, Granger causality test, impulse response and other analysis methods, we analyze the relationship between change of farmland quantity and <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection in China since the reform and opening-up. The results {{show that there is}} long-term balanced relationship between change of farmland quantity and <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection, and there is a certain mechanism restricting motion of variables between the two so as to make the two deviate from each other little and step towards balance in the long run; there is unilateral causality relationship between farmland change and <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection, namely that the farmland change is the Granger cause <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection, while <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection is not the Granger cause of farmland change; impulse response and variance decomposition indicate that farmland change plays the role <b>of</b> promoting <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection continuously, and the role is strengthened along with prolonged lag period; the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection has strong inertia, because it is impacted by the former level of itself, and the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> farmland protection plays insignificant role in promoting farmland quantity.
