40|$|The {{impact of}} the apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa), on net CO 2 exchange, {{transpiration}} rate, and leaf color of field-grown Jonagold and Golden Delicious apples was investigated. Apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> feeding causes leaf browning. Changes in leaf color were measured to assess the cumulative leaf damage. Significant negative relationships were found between cumulative leaf damage and single-leaf net CO 2 exchange as well as transpiration rate. The same trends were observed on both varieties, but the effect of apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> feeding was more severe on Jonagold than on Golden Delicious. Leaf tissue injury was analyzed by cryoscanning electron microscopy and light microscopy.

40|$|Although odour-mediated {{interactions}} among plants, spider mites and predatory mites have been extensively studied above-ground, belowground studies {{are in their}} infancy. In this paper, we investigate whether feeding by <b>rust</b> <b>mites</b> (Aceria tulipae) cause tulip bulbs to produce odours that attract predatory mites (Neoseiulus cucumeris). Since {{our aim was to}} demonstrate such odours and not their relevance under soil conditions, the experiments were carried out using a classic Y-tube olfactometer in which the predators moved on a Y-shaped wire in open air. We found that food-deprived female predators can discriminate between odours from infested bulbs and odours from uninfested bulbs or artificially wounded bulbs. No significant difference in attractiveness to predators was found between clean bulbs and bulbs either wounded 30 ?min or 3 ?h before the experiment. These results indicate that it may not be simply the wounding of the bulbs, but rather the feeding by <b>rust</b> <b>mites,</b> which causes the bulb to release odours that attract N. cucumeris. Since bulbs are belowground plant structures, the olfactometer results demonstrate the potential for odour-mediated interactions in the soil.

They have been studied for a long time and have economic importance among the plant diseases caused by agents of different species of fungi.

The most significant fruit tree rust pathogen is the genus Gymnosporangium. The literature review shows quite limited scientific information about this genus and its species.

40|$|Optimal {{foraging}} theory {{predicts that}} predators prefer those prey {{species that are}} most rewarding in terms of reproductive success, which is dependent on prey quality and prey availability. To investigate which selection pressures may have moulded prey preference in an acarine system consisting of two prey species and three predator species, we tested whether prey preference of the predators is matched by the associated reproductive success. The predators involved areAmblyseius finlandicus (Oudemans),Am. potentillae (Garman) andTyphlodromus pyri Scheuten. The prey species are the apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> (Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa)) and the {{fruit-tree red spider mite}} (Panonychus ulmi (Koch)). Reproductive success was assessed in terms of intrinsic rate of increase and for one predator also in terms of diapause induction. All three predator species reached highest reproductive success on the same prey species: apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite.</b> This was most pronounced for the predatorAm. finlandicus, because its larval stage suffered severe mortality when feeding onP. ulmi. An independent study on prey preference of the three predator species (Dicke et al., 1988) revealed thatAm. finlandicus prefersAc. schlechtendali toP. ulmi, whereas the other two predator species have the reverse preference. Thus, on the basis of current data, prey preference ofAm. finlandicus can be understood in terms of reproductive success. However, this is not so for prey preference ofT. pyri andAm. potentillae. Investigations needed for a better understanding of prey preference of the last-named two predator species are discussed...|$|R

In one year of the study (2006), five out of six orchards experienced elevated mite densities relative to the standard. In four orchards, novaluron caused a 3. 0 - 16. 9 × in-crease in mite populations; acetamiprid caused a 2. 6 - 3. 4 × increase, and thiacloprid caused a 1. 7 - 13. 8 × increase. In the fifth orchard, the organophosphate standard had an extremely high mite population, {{in addition to all}} three experimental treatments. In 2005 and 2007, only one or two orchards had elevated mite levels in the novaluron, acetami-prid, and thiacloprid treatments.
