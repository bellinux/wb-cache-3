40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} a reformulation of ELT curricula {{by means}} of a critique of established theoretical models and a case study of the ELT curriculum at De La Salle University (DLSU), Manila. The thesis proceeds in accordance with the precise that a sound theoretical and philosophical perspective is crucial to any task of curriculum development and criticism and thus derives a theoretical/ philosophical perspective from a consideration of ELT {{in the context of the}} philosophy of education and linguistic, applied linguistic, sociolinguistic, learning and curriculum theories. The argument is presented that any model of language as communication derived from linguistics and applied linguistics is not amenable to translation into descriptive rules of 'use' and hence a <b>pedagogic</b> <b>grammar.</b> Such theoretical perspectives, in only deriving partial models of 'use', are largely inadequate in the context of a concern with language teaching. Input from cognitive learning theory however suggests that teaching language as communication requires a curriculum approach focusing on 'open' communicative procedures rather than systematic techniques premised on language description and exemplified by a syllabus-based structure. It is thus argued that communicative language teaching requires 'open', methodology-based procedures that provide a markedly subordinated role for syllabus. The advocated form of communicative language curriculum is thus described as employing an 'open' rather than a 'closed-system') approach. It is also maintained that the ELT debate on communicative curricula has largely ignored crucial issues in curriculum theory and the philosophy of education - especially the distinction between 'education' and 'training'. This theoretical debate enables the derivation of a revised taxonomy of language curricula to replace the orthodox dichotomy into General English and ESP. The argument is presented that there are essentially two approaches to the curriculum - closed-system and open approaches - and that within each approach there are two curriculum types. Through revised definitions, the intents of 6 E and ESP curricula are distinguished and a new taxonomy of four possible curriculum types, including that of a Focused English Learning (FED curriculum, presented. The principles derived from the theoretical discussion and reformulated taxonomy enable an 'illuminative' case study investigation of an example curriculum: the ostensibly English for Specific Purposes (ESP) curriculum for Engineers employed at DLSU. This case study, by examining curriculum justification and intent and illuminating the nature of the problem at the university, illustrates, by example, aspects of the reformulated taxonomy. The case study findings detail crucial aspects of the interface between theory and local practice and expose the curriculum at DLSU as inherently contradictory, based on an inaccurate notion of ESP, and principally concerned with the pursuit of broadly educational aims through a mainly training-based, closed-system and non-communicative curriculum. The thesis concludes by proposing that the orthodox dichotomy between GE and ESP curricula is inappropriate and fails to reflect the various and possible forms of curricular intent. This has been a consequence of a theoretical emphasis on linguistics and sociolinguistics and an inadequate consideration of the philosophy of education and learning and curriculum theories. The inadequacy of the established dichotomy has led to confusion in application (as demonstrated through the case study) that could be avoided through the adoption of the reformulated taxonomy...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the methodological toolbox of “pedagogy-driven corpus-based research” (Gabrielatos, 2006), that is, research which is situated at the intersection of language description, pedagogical lexicogrammar, and pedagogical materials evaluation (e. g. Harwood, 2005; Hunston & Francis, 1998; Kennedy, 1992; Owen, 1993; Römer, 2004, 2005). The contribution of the present paper mainly lies in proposing a method of triangulating the corpus-based evaluation of lexicogrammatical information in EFL coursebooks, by way of examining a relevant corpus sample of learner written output. More precisely, Gabrielatos (2006) compared the information and examples on if-conditionals in eleven coursebooks for advanced EFL learners with a random sample of 781 if-conditionals from the written BNC (Aston & Burnard, 1998) – using BNCweb (see Hoffmann et al., 2008). The analysis revealed that the common-ground typology – i. e. the information presented in all the coursebooks examined – accounted for just over one-quarter (27. 8 %) of the if-conditionals in the BNC sample. More importantly, even if the information given in all the sample coursebooks were collated to produce an inclusive typology, it would account for less than three-quarters (72. 5 %) of the if-conditionals in the BNC sample. Even lower proportions were revealed when the sample of coursebooks included both intermediate and advance coursebooks (Gabrielatos, 2003). The observed under-representation of the variety of if-conditionals in the coursebooks mainly hinged on the following: •The coursebook typologies predominantly focused on conditionals with apodoses expressing degress of likelihood, ignoring or backgrounding conditionals with apodoses expressing deontic or volitional senses. Similalry, coursebooks ignored the type of conditionals termed “indirect” (Quirk et al., 1985), “speech act” (Sweetser, 1990), or “pragmatic” (Athanasiadou & Dirven, 1997) – e. g. Out {{of the corner of his}} eye he saw Hammond start forward. “But you promised [...] . ” Spatz interrupted Hammond, his face hard. “I promised nothing, if you recall. ” [GUG 121]. •Patterns presented as ‘exceptions’ or ‘special cases’ in the coursebooks proved to be too frequent to be accurately described as such. For example, the coursebooks present Past tense marking with past time reference in protases as a special case – stressing its epistemic interpretation. However, in the BNC sample, one-third of Past tense marking in protases expressed past time. •Modal marking in ‘rules’ and examples was predominantly by way of central and (less so) peripheral modals; lexical modal markers were ignored in both rules and examples. On the basis of the above results, it was hypothesised in the present study that learner written production – when compared to similar texts in the written BNC – would be characterised by the following: a) Under-representation of indirect conditionals. b) Among direct conditionals, an over-representation of conditionals with apodoses expressing degrees of likelihood, and a corresponding under-representation of other types. c) Lower proportion of Past tense marking with past time reference in protases. d) Smaller extent of modal marking in protases. e) Over-representation of central modals. The study aimed to compare the if-conditionals in the random sample from the written BNC with those in a random sample from ICLE (Granger et al., 2002). However, ICLE only contains argumentative essays, whereas the written BNC is richer in text types. For reasons of comparability, only the instances from academic texts, essays and editorials in the BNC sample were considered – resulting in a sample of 195 if-conditionals. Therefore, a random sample of 200 instances was drawn from ICLE – using CQPweb (Hardie, forthcoming). Each if-conditional was annotated for its type, using the typology developed in Gabrielatos (2010), as well as the modal marker and the type of modality in the protases and apodoses. Only hypotheses ‘b’, ‘c’ and, to some extent, ‘d’ were supported by the results – in the other two respects learner production in ICLE was comparable to that of the native speakers in the BNC. However, it would be premature to conclude that the explicit information in coursebooks has limited influence on learner production. ICLE contains the written production of learners having a variety of L 1 s, and coming from a variety of educational contexts, which can be expected to employ different pedagogical materials and/or instructional approaches. Therefore, the possibility cannot be discounted that the picture emerging from the present analysis may hide country-specific and/or L 1 -specific variation. References Athanasiadou, A. & R.

40|$|Whereas {{traditional}} {{foreign language}} teaching mainly concentrated on language as an object, that is, on {{the transmission of}} grammatical rules and lists of foreign vocabulary items, today’s modern language teaching rather concentrates on the language as a communication tool and aims for genuine and fluent communication in semi-authentic situations. Real-life situations are rooted in and follow from culture’s experiences in past and present life. This is the dimension in FLT that cognitive linguistics is relevant for. By its usage-based orientation and its being rooted in gestalt psychology and phenomenology, it offers a possibility of perceiving and describing the layer of sociocultural experience in a scientifically motivated way. On this cognitive view, extralinguistic reality is not an unstructured mass, but it is experientially structured {{as the result of}} coherent conceptualizations in diverse categories, each firmly based in larger domains of experience. Reality, that is the experience of reality, is organized by speakers of different languages in different categories: “We communicate the world as our language structures the phenomena of the world and categorises them as entities, processes, actions, space, time, etc. Consequently our general cognitive ability, as far as categorisation functions are concerned, interacts with our linguistic ability. ” (Dirven, 1989, p. 57) If we postulate a relationship between language and the categorization, which is a result of our conceptualization, then we can conclude that differences between languages reflect differences in the conceptualization (also see Taylor, 1993, p. 213). Categorization is not only or solely universal, but also and to a very large extent culturally specific, which means that more often than not it differs from one language to the other. This is particularly clear when we compare historically strongly related conceptualizations in the Romance languages with those in the Germanic languages. We will try to show this for three different domains, one in the verbal sphere, one in the nominal sphere, and one in case morphology: 1) Motion and the manner of motion as conceptualized in verb-oriented vs. satellite-oriented languages: As Talmy (1985), Slobin (1996) and many other researchers have shown, Romance languages are verb-oriented languages which tend to use more general verbs of motion and do not tend to specify the manner of motion nor the path of motion, whereas Germanic languages incorporate manner specifications much more into the verb and specify the path of motion in adverbial satellites. Thus, whereas French uses the verb aller in a more schematic or abstract way for any kind of movement or change of location, German obligatorily uses several linguistic signs and must differentiate between the way the movement is taking place: gehen (only on foot), fahren (by car, train or boat), fliegen (by air). But the path of motion requires satellites in German: Er rannte aus der Kueche durch das Wohnzimmer zur Strasse/Il sortit de la cuisine et traversa la salle de séjour pour aller à la rue. For the French learner of German this not only means that s/he has to acquire many more specific verbs, but also and especially that s/he has to learn to experience and see events in different ways, much more focusing on both the manner as the core of the motion to be conceptualized obligatorily in each utterance and on the various possible satellites not left as an optional choice, but forming part of the experiential habitus. 2) Complex categories conceptualized: Compounding as routinely fixed compounds vs. loose paraphrases: German also differs from French in the nominal domains, amongst other conceptualizations by the systematic use of lots of compounds (see Vandermeeren (1998), (1999)) for realities which are not laid down as fixed expressions in French or other Romance languages: Zukunftsfähigkeit denotes the capability of or the chance of being used {{for a long time in}} the future; gesundbeten denotes praying for and until recovery, and hitzefrei compresses the complex notion of having time off from school or work on account of excessively hot weather. These German compounds can only be translated into French by means of very approximative paraphrases. The learner of the foreign language will have the greatest learning problems with the linguistic signs which reflect these foreign-language categories, perhaps unknown to him or her, or not routinely fixed in his or her memory as a linguistic concept. A sociocultural awareness can only be engendered by conscious metalinguistic activity by the foreigner. Based on some very typical examples, the paper will concentrate on possible metalinguistic learning strategies for French-speaking students of the German language. German signs (especially compounds) for linguistic concepts which are not present in French can first be best understood and interpreted by building paraphrases first without and then within a “rich context”, and in a next phase out of context. As a final step these contexts are used to produce the new routines of thought laid down in compounds such as: Tagesmutter, hitzefrei, Finanzkarussell, Fremdbestimmung, gesundbeten,etc. Thus the paraphrases are the intermediary between language and thought, and they relate the foreign-language semantics to our encyclopedic knowledge and conceptual categorization. 3) Spatial conceptualization as static vs dynamic location enforced by morphosyntax: Teachers of German know all too well that spatial relations as conceptualized in German and syntactically realized in the system of verbs, prepositions and case marking in sentences constitute a major problem for French speakers: These verbs must be used either with a dative for static location or with an accusative for dynamic location object. This differentiated use has been described in great detail in CL research, e. g. by Di Meola (1998), Meex (2002), Smith (1993), Serra Borneto (1997), and others. This static/dynamic differentiation relates to the difference Germans experience and see between verbs which express an already existing location (stehen, sitzen, liegen) (+ wo-complement) and verbs which express physical motion towards a landmark: something or someone stellen, setzen, legen (+ wohin complement). To facilitate the experiential learning and gradual acquisition of this difference one can describe German spatial verbs in visualised schemas with their different syntactic realizations. The crux is that this spatial distinction within spatial relations is also transposed to more abstract domains of thought as linguistically laid down in German. Some abstract German verbal expressions such as auf ein Problem eingehen, sich an die Hoffnung klammern, in eine andere Sprache übersetzen make the French speaker face a similar dilemma: is this an instance of a static or a dynamic abstract location? Here the concept of metaphor or metaphorical transfer can help us explain the different syntactic realizations. FLT vaguely advised the foreign-language learner “to learn to think in the foreign language”. This can only happen with a cognitively and experientially rooted approach to language understanding and description, we now are in a position to begin to appreciate what this slogan involves.

More importantly there is {{a link between the}} use of such modality and the approach to personality chosen in the grammars: hedging is more common when the more friendly YOU is used to address users than when WE is used; this suggests an interpersonal (as well as epistemic) motivation for the hedging.

The dialogues contained in the Student’s Book are used for listening/comprehension activities, while those contained in the Teacher’s Book are used in grammar sections, to exemplify the use of specific structures. 5 Concordance 3. 0 for Microsoft Windows is software designed for concordancing and text analysis produced by R J C Watt, 19 January 2002.
