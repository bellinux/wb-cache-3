40|$|In {{the next}} fifty years, {{according}} to the United Nations Population Prospect (2004), an ageing population is expected in Vietnam. The operation of a pay-as-you-go defined benefit pension scheme will inevitably elevate <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities.</b> These liabilities, in turn, threaten the financial sustainability of the scheme, and affect generational relations. This paper estimates the size of <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the current pension scheme in Vietnam, and analyzes generational relations under various economic scenarios. <b>Pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> are considered by a closed-group approach. The estimated results show that <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> account for {{a small part of}} 2002 GDP, and this is partially explained by two primary factors: (i) the method of estimation currently employed by the scheme, and (ii) the fact that currently the scheme covers {{only a small portion of}} the total population and labour force. It is, however, obvious that the government will have to pay existing <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities,</b> which will affect generational relations in the longer term, particularly from an economic point of view. Whether the impacts on generational relations will be serious or not depends upon payment settings and reforms of the scheme.

40|$|Financial {{economists have}} long favoured {{the use of}} a wind—up measure of the firm's <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Yet the <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the firm also {{represent}} the pension wealth of its workers. It is reasonable to presume that workers and shareholders have a common view of the pension contract. If the wind—up measure depicts the true <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the firm, then the wage concession granted by its workers must reflect the fact that the firm may choose to terminate the plan at any time. Data on the wage—service characteristics of the membership of a sample of final earnings plans in Canada suggest, contrary to the implications of the wind—up measure, that workers' wages do not internalize accruing pension benefits on a year—to—year basis. Instead, the data suggest that pension plans may be a vehicle through which {{a significant portion of the}} total compensation of individual employees is deferred until their later work years, and that the wind—up measure may well understate the <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> of an on—going firm...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} debate on the European Union (EU) fiscal rules there is a {{widespread}} consensus on the need to place more focus on government debt and long-term fiscal sustainability in the surveillance of budgetary positions. More specifically, pension developments should be taken into account in assessing fiscal sustainability. The way to make this operational has not yet been defined. The paper examines the pension expenditure projections available in EU countries and their use in the assessment of fiscal sustainability. While acknowledging the progress in the availability and quality of projections, the paper notes that their comparability is still unsatisfactory. Any mechanical use of existing pension expenditure projections should therefore be avoided. The paper also examines the different definitions of <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> and their potential role in the EU fiscal framework. It argues that <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> may bring a clearer understanding of the impact of fiscal policies, may provide a measure of the cost of terminating pay-as-you-go pension schemes and may be useful for the measurement of deficits computed on accrual basis. However, the level of <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> does not provide indications concerning the sustainability of pension schemes and their effects on public budgets. <b>Pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> should not be added to conventional debt. The paper argues that both pension expenditure projections and estimates of <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> can complement the deficit and debt indicators currently used in the EU fiscal rules. The paper concludes by pointing to the need of improving some technical and organisational aspects concerning age-related expenditure projections, such as the independence of forecasters, the transparency of projections and the homogeneity of methods. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, various {{option pricing}} models {{are used to}} provide {{analytical}} solutions to valuing defined <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities</b> (or securitised parts of <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities)</b> in incomplete markets. Unlike when markets are complete, {{there is not a}} single arbitrage-free price for liabilities but instead a range of prices consistent with the absence of arbitrage. We analyse and compare the application of incomplete market variants of the following models to pension liabilities: i) the standard Black-Scholes (1973) option model ii) the Margrabe (1978) exchange options model; iii) the Stulz (1982) rainbow option model to price <b>pension</b> schemes <b>liabilities.</b> No matter which approach is used, we find the range of liability prices to be broad, implying it is difficult to put a precise market value on <b>pension</b> <b>liabilities.</b> However, we also find that the implication for strategic asset allocation is relatively minimal; strategic asset allocations, at least in the models we looked at, appear to be relatively robust to incomplete markets. This conclusion is more about risk exposure than the financial instruments used to achieve a given level of risk exposure, as the desired financial instruments may depend considerably on the degree of market completeness. ...|$|R
