40|$|Urticaria, a perplexing {{disease of}} ever-changing explanations, is being renovated almost {{everyday}} by newer facts and findings accumulated from {{different parts of}} the globe. Cost of the urticaria treatment gradually grows higher and higher whereas the ailment disturbs the quality of life very adversely. Disorder of coagulation cascade has recently thrown some new light into its mechanism. Non-allergic angioedema induced by bradykinin caused by genetic defects and ACE-inhibitors has also been noted. Role of H. pylori in the pathogenesis of urticaria has also been re-reviewed. Urticaria could sometimes mimic erythema multiforme and is termed urticaria multiforme. Skin biopsy showed features of vasculitis in good number of urticaria irrespective of clinical features.

40|$|The {{connection}} between contact geometry and fatigue in {{tapered roller bearings}} utilized in the railroad environment is still of interest. Roller bearings for railroad applications are typically precision ground with crowned contact geometries to prevent edge loading of components. This normally results in completely elastic Hertzian contact stresses under standard railcar loads. However, under extreme load conditions, detrimental edge loading {{has been known to}} occur. It is proposed to develop a tool, using finite element analysis, that can be utilized to optimize complex raceway crown geometries for severe applications. A successful implementation of this tool is presented and validated using <b>proven</b> Hertzian <b>contact</b> theory. Correlation within 5 % of the ultimate surface and subsurface stress magnitudes, using finite element modeling, in contrast with <b>proven</b> <b>contact</b> theory is achieved. In addition, analyses of other load conditions and contact geometries in order to illustrate the practical application of the tool are exhibited...|$|R

People of this culture burned their dead and buried the ashes in urns, which were typically placed in urnfields but also in tumuli. The Pomeranian variant of the Lusatian culture can further be divided into an eastern and the Göritz group.

40|$|A 50 year old, healthy man {{developed}} a severe bullous allergic reaction after producing coatings. This was probably {{caused by a}} <b>proven</b> <b>contact</b> allergy for two compounds he frequently worked with; 1, 6 -hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). Contact allergies to both compounds are not uncommon, but a severe bullous eruption as in this case has, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, not been described before. Multiple positive patch test reactions can be explained by the impurity of industrially used acrylates, through which cosensitization can occur.

50|$|As {{with other}} Pacific Northwest nations, the Kwakwaka'wakw highly valued copper in their economy {{and used it}} for {{ornament}} and precious goods. Scholars have proposed that prior to trade with Europeans, the people acquired copper from natural copper veins along riverbeds, but {{this has not been}} <b>proven.</b> <b>Contact</b> with European settlers, particularly through the Hudson's Bay Company, brought an influx of copper to their territories. The Kwakwaka'wakw nations also were aware of silver and gold, and crafted intricate bracelets and jewellery from hammered coins traded from European settlers. Copper was given a special value amongst the Kwakwaka'wakw, most likely for its ceremonial purposes. This copper was beaten into sheets or plates, and then painted with mythological figures. The sheets were used for decorating wooden carvings or kept for the sake of prestige.|$|R
40|$|Pruritus ani is {{a common}} {{distressing}} problem with numerous possible causes. When locally applied agents trigger irritation or allergic response, skin changes of dermatitis usually accompany the itch. Focal pruritus {{in the absence of}} dermatitis is not generally considered to be a manifestation of contact allergy. Furthermore, focal pruritus is not listed among the possible diverse presentations of the systemic delivery of a <b>proven</b> <b>contact</b> allergen. We report a case of a gentleman with a 1. 5 -year history of treatment-resistant pruritus ani. When patch testing revealed a positive reaction to nickel sulfate, he admitted to daily peanut butter consumption. His symptoms resolved with dietary nickel restriction. Patch testing may be useful in patients with pruritus of the anogenital region, not only to elucidate potential contact exposures contributing to the symptom but also to suggest possible dietary precipitants...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY – Delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} reaction or type IV allergic reaction can cause different oral manifestations. They can be localized or diffusely visible on oral mucosa and usually appear 24 - 72 hours after antigen input. The antigens that cause {{this type of}} reaction are mostly external, such as contact allergens (particularly metals) and drugs. It {{has been shown that}} the most common oral manifestations are cheilitis, gingivitis, stomatitis, perioral dermatitis, burning mouth syndrome, lichenoid reaction and orofacial granulomatosis. The most important part of diagnosis is the use of patch testing that indicates contact allergic reaction to an allergen. The results of patch testing have shown that the most common proven allergens are gold, nickel, mercury, palladium, cobalt, acrylate, etc. Although connection between specific clinical manifestations and positive pat-ch test results was not always found, patch testing is necessary to <b>prove</b> <b>contact</b> hypersensitivity. Therefore, in patients with oral symptoms, allergic hypersensitivity to dental components has to be considered...|$|R

25|$|Buns is {{strongly}} influenced by Italian composers from his time, for instance Bassani and Degli Antonii. It could be Buns had some contacts with musicians of the Italian Carmelites. Unfortunately it is unknown who was Buns' music-teacher in Geldern. In the Carmelite monastery of Geldern were at that time two organs placed in the monastery-church. The Carmelites at that time had a high skill {{of the art of}} music. Perhaps a chapel-master out of Cologne? Because there exists <b>proven</b> <b>contacts</b> between the family/Count van den Bergh ‘s-Heerenbergh and chapel-masters of Cologne like Carl Rosier (1640-1725) and even the Flemish Carolus Hacquart (ca. 1640-1671). It is likely they worked in ‘s-Heerbergh. Buns’ music is based on the principles and style of the Venetian School {{at the beginning of the}} 17th century and Buns’ oeuvre has some similarity to Monteverdi and even comparison to Marc-Antoine Charpentier and Corelli can be adduced. Although Buns wrote almost exclusively religious music he has considered as the most important Dutch composer in the second half of the 17th century.|$|R
40|$|As the {{system-on-chip}} (SoC) design {{becomes more}} complex, the test costs are increasing. One {{of the main}} obstacles of a test cost reduction is {{the limited number of}} test channels of the ATE while the number of pins in the design increases. To overcome this problem, a new test architecture using a channel sharing compliant with IEEE Standard 1149. 1 and 1500 is proposed. It can significantly reduce the pin count for testing a SoC design. The test input data is transmitted using a test access mechanism composed of only input pins. A single test data output pin is used to measure the sink values. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture not only increases the number of sites to be tested simultaneously, but also reduces the test time. In addition, the yield loss owing to the <b>proven</b> <b>contact</b> problems can be reduced. Using the new architecture, it is possible to achieve a large test time and cost reduction for complex SoC designs with negligible design and test overheads...|$|R
60|$|Here a {{difficulty}} occurs. Mythologists, as a rule, are averse to {{the method of}} folklore. They think it scientific to compare only the myths of races which speak languages of the same family, and of races which have, in historic times, been actually in <b>proved</b> <b>contact</b> with each other. Thus, most mythologists hold it correct to compare Greek, Slavonic, Celtic, and Indian stories, because Greeks, Slavs, Celts, and Hindoos all speak languages of the same family. Again, they hold it correct to compare Chaldaean and Greek myths, because the Greeks and the Chaldaeans were brought into contact through the Phoenicians, and by other intermediaries, such as the Hittites. But the same mythologists will vow that it is unscientific to compare a Maori or a Hottentot or an Eskimo myth with an Aryan story, because Maoris and Eskimo and Hottentots do not speak languages akin to that of Greece, nor can we show that the ancestors of Greeks, Maoris, Hottentots, and Eskimo were ever in {{contact with each other}} in historical times.|$|R

Specifically we prove if R ≥ 1 there is no ψ∈Cont(R^ 2 n× S^ 1), the group of compactly supported contactomorphisms of R^ 2 n× S^ 1 which squeezes B̂(R) = B(R) × S^ 1 into itself, i. e. maps the closure of B̂(R) into B̂(R). A sheaf theoretic proof of non-existence of corresponding ψ∈Cont_ 0 (R^ 2 n× S^ 1), the identity component of Cont(R^ 2 n× S^ 1), is due to Chiu (2014); {{it is not known}} if this is strictly weaker. Our construction has the advantage of retaining the contact homological viewpoint of Eliashberg-Kim-Polterovich and its potential for application in prequantizations of other Liouville manifolds. It makes use of the Z_k-action generated by a vertical 1 /k-shift but can also be related, for prequantized balls, to the Z_k-equivariant contact homology developed by Milin (2008) in her proof of orderability of lens spaces.

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is a {{globally}} prevalent, zoonotic parasite {{of major}} importance to public health. Various indirect and direct methods {{can be used}} for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Whereas serological tests are useful to <b>prove</b> <b>contact</b> with the parasite has occurred, the actual presence of the parasite in the tissues of a seropositive animal is not demonstrated. For this, a bioassay is still the reference method. As an alternative, various PCR methods have been developed, but due to the limited amount of sample that can be tested, combined with a low tissue cyst density, those have proved to be insufficiently sensitive. A major improvement of the sensitivity was achieved with magnetic capture-based DNA extraction. By combining the hybridization of specific, biotinylated probes with the capture of those probes with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads, T. gondii DNA can selectively be "fished out" from a large volume of meat lysate. Still, several studies showed an insufficient sensitivity compared with the mouse bioassay. Here we present a method that is more sensitive (99 % limit of detection: 65. 4 tachyzoites per 100 g of meat), economical and reliable (ISO 17025 validated) by adding a non-competitive PCR inhibition control (co-capture of cellular r 18 S) and making the release of the target DNA from the streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads UV-dependent.
