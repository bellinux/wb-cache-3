5|$|In {{order to}} be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly, to acclimatise them during the <b>process,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> allow more {{realistic}} training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain, Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942. Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment. The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E

Depending on the architecture, these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses.

The nearby sister factory, ROF Drigg which produced TNT (trinitrotoluene) had been constructed in 1940, 5km to the south-east and {{adjacent to the}} village of Drigg. ROF Drigg and ROF Sellafield were built in these isolated and remote coastal sites because of the hazardous nature of the <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> minimise the risk of enemy air attack.

Deputies are often seen supporting local police in traffic control and at large events like county fairs and sports events.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{proposal}} for political democracy {{calls for a}} high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of {{the party in power}} to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.|$|E
