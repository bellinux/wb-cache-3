To determine the level of influence that the handling processes and air transportation have on blood sample quality, a {{research has been conducted}} through transportation of whole blood samples on two European scheduled routes. Two shipping models were defined: the standard one without defined transportation temperature regime and the controlled one, where transportation is conducted under appropriate temperature regime. The blood samples were packed and transported respecting all relevant national and international regulations. The analysis was conducted and the results compared to control sample kept in the laboratory. Significant changes were identified on all components analyzed after crosschecking with the control sample.

Moreover, a component analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of modeling and feedback on staff member's ability to utilize this teaching strategy. Four skills trainers were divided into two groups: a) group one received instructions and modeling and if they did not meet criteria, feedback was added, b) group two received instructions and feedback, and if they did not meet criteria, modeling was added. Results indicate that the skills trainers in both groups improved with either instructions plus feedback or instructions plus modeling; however, they did not meet competency until they received all three components of the training <b>package</b> (<b>instruction,</b> modeling, & feedback). Furthermore, it appears that feedback is more efficacious than modeling as a training component. Implications for staff training are discussed...|$|R

TITLE: USING PYRAMIDAL STAFF TRAINING TO DECREASE SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE SEXUAL BEHAVIORS AMONGST INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Mark Dixon 	This current study expands {{the research of}} pyramidal training to the subject area of sex education. It utilizes the Behavioral Skills Training (BST) teaching <b>package</b> (<b>instruction,</b> model, role play and feedback) while applying the pyramidal training approach to teach appropriate boundaries to individuals with DD. Although {{this is not a}} complete sex education package, it will begin the research in this this subject area. With state hospitals closing their doors and more individuals with an ID entering the community, appropriate boundaries is an essential skill for both, individuals with an ID and the others in the community. Pyramidal training of the sexual education curriculum was introduced to the three participants in a consecutive manner. This study suggests that pyramidal training is an effective way to decrease spikes in target behaviors for individuals with intellectual disabilities at a day training facility. Future research should be conducted to look at more detailed sex education packages and teaching the curriculum in different environments...|$|R

These devices, which have gained {{popularity}} over the past 10 years, {{are designed to be}} used multiple times for a single person, using a new needle for each injection. Unfortu-nately, reports of themisuse of insulin pens also have been growing. Backflow of blood and other biologic material into the insulin cartridge or reservoir can occur after injection (1). For this reason, insulin pens, like other injection devices, must never be used by more than one person. Reports of insulin pen sharing have come from a variety of U. S. health care settings. Since 2011, there have been at least six separate incidents in which patients were contacted and given advice to test for bloodborne patho-gens because individual insulin pen devices were reused for multiple patients (Table 1). In all of these events, reuse of pens may have occurred {{over a period of years}} before it was identified and corrected. Because these unsafe practices had gone unnoticed for so long, thousands of patients were placed at risk for infection.
