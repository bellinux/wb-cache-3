5|$|Chappuis {{was drafted}} by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reports in February 1948 {{indicated}} that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year. However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers' offer, opting instead {{to play for the}} new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In June 1948, Chappuis signed with Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC after coach Carl Voyles outbid the Steelers for his services at $17,000. Chappuis had been drafted by the Cleveland Browns, and the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis. Rickey had felt that modern football was based on speed and that he could win with a good center, passing quarterback and two tall sprinting ends. Thus, he placed a <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> signing Chappuis, the passing quarterback. The college All-star game caused Chappuis to miss three weeks of practice and he played little in the early season games because he had not learned his plays.|$|E

Mud Hens owner Charles Stroebel stated that he had signed Joss and other Mud Hens players for the 1902 season on August 12 and that the Western League was {{under the protection of}} the National League through September 1901. Before 1901 ended, the Cleveland Bronchos offered $500 ($) to Toledo in exchange for Joss and manager Bob Gilks, who would be a scout for Cleveland. Toledo and Joss agreed and Joss was now a member of the American League, which was paying a <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> baseball talent to rival the National League.

5|$|The Civil War economy catalyzed a {{shortage}} of United States coinage—gold and silver coins were hoarded given their intrinsic bullion value relative to irredeemable paper currency at the time. In late 1861, to help finance the Civil War, the U.S. government borrowed gold coin from New York City banks in exchange for Seven-thirties treasury notes and the New York banks sold them {{to the public for}} gold to repay the loan. In December 1861, the Trent Affair shook public confidence with the threat of war on a second front. The United States Department of the Treasury suspended specie payments and banks in New York City stopped redeeming paper money for gold and silver. In the absence of gold and silver coin, the premium for specie began to devalue paper currency. After the New York banks suspended specie payments (quickly followed by Boston and Philadelphia) the <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> gold rose from 1–3% over paper in early January 1862 to 9% over paper in June 1862, by which time one paper dollar was worth 91.69 cents in gold. This fueled currency speculation (e.g., redeeming banknotes for silver coin which was then sold at a premium as bullion), and created significant disruption across businesses and trade. Alternate methods of providing small change included the reintroduction of Spanish quarter dollars in Philadelphia, cutting dollar bills in quarters or halves, refusing to provide change (without charging a premium for providing silver coins), or the issuance of locally issued shinplasters (i.e., those issued by businesses or local municipalities) was forbidden by law in many states.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} Kentucky’s SCHIP program to address two issues {{relating}} {{to the impact of}} public <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> health insurance coverage for children. First, public insurance claims data is used to examine whether or not the impact of public health insurance premiums vary by child health type. Second, results from a survey of families whose children lost SCHIP coverage due to premium non-payment is used to examine {{the extent to which these}} children are able to find another source of health coverage. The results suggest that, in general, children with chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, or a mental health condition, are less likely to leave public coverage than children without one of these health conditions. We find very weak evidence of a differential impact of <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> enrollment status for children with diabetes, but no evidence of a differential impact of <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> enrollment for children with other chronic conditions. Our survey results suggest that roughly half of responding families found some type of alternative health coverage after losing SCHIP coverage, with less healthy children being more likely to be covered than healthy children.

40|$|Prices {{received}} by Australian wheat farmers have increasingly depended on grain quality, especially protein concentration.

In this paper {{a model of}} weed management {{in the presence of}} grain quality premiums is presented. Two types of quality premium are examined: a continuout linear payment schedule and a discontinuous "stepped" schedule with substantial premiums for quality levels above a critical level. The model is applied to an analysis of the impact of protein <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> optimal management strategies for a particular weed in Western Australia. It is found that the impact of protein <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> optimal weed management is likely to be very small indeed, even if premiums were substantially increased above current levels.

25|$|The Nintendo 64's central {{processing}} unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300. Popular Electronics said it had power similar to the Pentium processors found in desktop computers. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retained the computational abilities of the more powerful 64-bit MIPS R4300i, though software rarely took advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. Nintendo 64 games generally used faster (and more compact) 32-bit data-operations, as these were sufficient to generate 3D-scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit.

25|$|Retrospectively rated {{insurance}} {{is a method}} of establishing a <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> large commercial accounts.

The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium × tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.|$|E
