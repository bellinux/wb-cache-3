We present estimates of the long-term impact of various sources of knowledge (R&D performed by the business sector, the public sector (higher education and government) and abroad) on the multifactor productivity growth of 17 major OECD countries from 1988 to 2006. The results confirm that business R&D and the R&D performed by the higher education sector significantly contribute to growth. In addition, {{the extent to which}} countries rely on triadic patents, as well as their degree of <b>patent</b> friendliness (<b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanism</b> and number of restrictions) affect significantly the extent to which R&D contributes to growth...|$|R
40|$|The competition-related {{provisions}} in the TRIPS Agreement were very much influenced by {{the context in which}} the Agreement was concluded. The inclusion of competition provisions served a specific purpose. Competition law was basically seen as a tool to facilitate the transfer of technology. Twenty years after the entry into force of TRIPS, the legal landscape within which IPRs are exercised has experienced tremendous changes on the IP front, as well as on the competition law front. IP protection tends to be raised beyond the minimum standards of TRIPS, questionable protection has been granted specially in the field of <b>patents,</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and remedies have been strengthened and IP portfolios are strategically used in the markets. From an international perspective, higher IP standards have been exported through bilateral and regional trade agreements. Competition law is developing at a very fast speed, especially in emerging and developing economies. Moreover, competition law and IP laws are increasingly understood as being complementary to each other. A strict and “conflict oriented” reading of TRIPS’ competition provisions does not help to cope with the new strategies of innovation and the new forms of use of IPRs. We argue in this paper that a flexible reading of the competition-related {{provisions in}} TRIPS provides enough room for applying competition law as an innovation instrument. Hence, the application of competition law to combat IP-related restraints of competition that inhibit innovation would be covered by the rationale of the TRIPS Agreement just as much as an application of competition law aimed at enhancing access to and dissemination of IP-protected products...|$|R

40|$|The Australian Government {{has been}} {{concerned}} “to {{find ways of}} making <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> less of an issue” {{and to make it}} “cheaper, simpler and quicker to get fair and appropriate resolution for any dispute”. Major problems relating to <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> in Australia have been identified as: the cost of legal proceedings; the lack of patent owners’ financial capacity to fund enforcement proceedings; delay; and uncertainty as to the outcome and lack of knowledge about the processes of enforcement. This paper considers some of the problems associated with <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> in Australia and proposes an approach to patent litigation which is directed at alleviating some of the difficulties which have been identified.

40|$|Purpose This paper aims {{to study}} the effects of the {{strength}} of <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> on economic growth following the signing of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the role of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in mediating and enhancing this relationship. Design/methodology/approach Following a generalized method of moments methodology, use is made of a new longitudinal index measuring the strength of enforcement-related aspects of patent systems. Findings Stronger levels of <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> have a significant positive effect on the economic growth of both developed and developing countries. Importantly, inward FDI flows have a mediating role in positively boosting this effect for all countries and particularly for developed countries. Originality/value This is the first empirical study {{of the role of the}} strength of <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> (“law in action”) in stimulating economic growth, as previous empirical studies have focused on the effect of the strength of patent law protection (“law on the books”). The failure in the past to allow for “law in action” was mainly due to the lack of available data that could proxy for the strength of <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> levels in a country. This study utilizes a newly published, longitudinal index that captures the strength of the enforcement-related aspects of patent systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} runtime {{enforcement}} of untimed and timed properties with uncontrollable events. Runtime enforcement consists in modi-fying the executions of a running system {{to ensure their}} correctness {{with respect to a}} desired property. We introduce a framework that takes as input any regu-lar (timed) property over an alphabet of events, with some of these events being uncontrollable. An uncontrollable event cannot be delayed nor intercepted by an <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanism.</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> satisfy important properties, namely soundness and compliance- meaning that <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> out-put correct executions that are close to the input execution. We discuss the condi-tions for a property to be enforceable with uncontrollable events, and we define <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that modify executions to obtain a correct output, as soon as possible. Moreover, we synthesize sound and compliant descriptions of runtime <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> at two levels of abstraction to facilitate their design and implementation. ...|$|R

We compare {{the performance of}} three damage regimes. The 'reasonable royalty' regime, which yields symmetric equilibrium pricing, maximizes static welfare and yields the highest innovation incentives when <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> is nearly certain. The 'lost profits' regime, which may deter infringement, yields the highest innovation incentives when <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> is less-than-certain and products are sufficiently valuable. The 'unjust enrichment' regime yields low static efficiency and low innovation incentives.

40|$|Using {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} framework, this paper shows that imperfect and heterogeneous patent protection across industries affects the relative innovation incentives of firms and the skill premium. It is found that tighter <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> in some industries allows a <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> externality effect to emerge, whereby varieties with relatively softer patent protection have relatively stronger innovation incentives. The theoretical mechanisms {{hold for a}} wide range of the elasticity of substitution between varieties and also hold in a North-South framework when IPR harmonization is considered. A numerical simulation shows that merging both endogenous technological change and institutional aspects in the form of imperfect and heterogeneous IPR protection can contribute to explaining the different innovation and wage inequality performances of the U.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> {{insurance}} when used by an incumbent patent holder in order to increase its incentives to oppose alleged infringers (entrants). By covering some of the legal costs ex-ante, the incumbent can increase its commitment to litigate and, as a result, deter some potential entrants and, in case of entry, induce a more profitable settlement deal. We find that it is always optimal for the incumbent to undertake <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> insurance, typically with a deductible that either prevents litigation from occurring in equilibrium or trades off its ex post costs in some situations with the ex ante gains in terms of deterring infringement and enhance the settlement deal in some others.

40|$|Scholarship on the {{enforcement}} of international legal obligations often makes a fundamental division between "horizontal" (inter-state retaliation) and "vertical" (national court) <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This paper argues that such a division of treaty <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> fails to capture how "horizontal" and "vertical" enforcement relationships can be combined in one important scenario, where a state's acceptance of an obligation on their domestic courts to automatically enforce trade-based treaty obligations is matched by an abandonment by the state's trading partners of more common forms of retaliation-based <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanism.</b> On the one hand, therefore, states allow their trade treaty obligations to be automatically enforced by domestic courts, while on the other, the beneficiaries of such a commitment in other states forego any rights to threaten trade sanctions to enforce treaty obligations.

40|$|Patent law {{is usually}} {{thought to be}} the domain of the federal government, not state governments. Yet over half the states have {{recently}} passed statutes outlawing unfair or deceptive assertions of patent infringement. The statutes are aimed at fighting so-called patent trolls, particularly those who send letters to users of allegedly infringing technology — as opposed to the manufacturers of that technology — demanding that each user purchase a license for a few thousand dollars or else face an infringement suit. The Federal Circuit, however, has held that state law claims challenging acts of <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> are preempted by the federal Patent Act unless the patent holder made infringement allegations with knowledge that the allegations were objectively baseless. No court has yet applied this rule to the new state statutes, but it will likely provide patent holders with nearly absolute immunity from liability under the new laws. Although the Federal Circuit has called this immunity a matter of “preemption,” a close examination of the court’s decisions reveals that the rule is not grounded in the Supremacy Clause but in the First Amendment right to petition the government. Unlike the Supremacy Clause, the First Amendment limits the power of the federal government, not just state governments, so patent holders will also be able to invoke this immunity to thwart impending federal initiatives to fight abusive <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement,</b> such as unfair competition proceedings brought by the Federal Trade Commission and proposals in Congress to outlaw false or misleading statements made in patent demand letters. This article argues that the broad immunity the Federal Circuit has conferred on patent holders is wrong as a matter of doctrine, misguided as a matter of policy, and inconsistent with a long history of courts enjoining unfair and deceptive acts of <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement.</b> Accordingly, the article suggests a reimagined immunity standard that would not shield extortionate schemes of <b>patent</b> <b>enforcement</b> but would still respect a patent holder’s right to make legitimate allegations of infringement...|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes the MAP-REDUCE framework, a {{programmable}} framework, {{that can}} be used to construct <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of different security policies. The framework is based on the idea of secure multi-execution in which multiple copies of the controlled program are executed. In order to construct an <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a policy, users have to write a MAP program and a REDUCE program to control inputs and outputs of executions of these copies. This thesis illustrates the framework by presenting <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of non-interference (from Devriese and Piessens), non-deducibility (from Sutherland) and deletion of inputs (a policy proposed by Mantel). It demonstrates formally soundness and precision of these <b>enforcement</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This thesis also presents the investigation on sufficient condition of policies {{that can be}} enforced by the framework. The investigation is on reactive programs that are input total and have to finish processing an input item before handling another one. For reactive programs that always terminate on any input, non-empty testable hypersafety policies can be enforced. For reactive programs that might diverge, non-empty downward closed w. r. t. termination policies can be enforced. ...|$|R
