5|$|Edler {{plays in}} the style of an {{offensive}} defenseman. One of his strongest offensive assets is his slapshot. At the Canucks' 2008 SuperSkills event, he beat the team's reigning hardest shooter, Sami Salo, with a 99.3 mile-per-hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010, as well. He is also known for his <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> confidence with the puck, allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards. Many within the Canucks organization, such as Assistant Coach Rick Bowness, have asserted this as a reflection of his calm off-ice demeanor.|$|E
25|$|Modern ballet {{technique}} incorporates {{all three}} transition methods. Relevé and piqué transitions are typically used for adages, where strength, <b>poise,</b> <b>and</b> controlled movements are highlighted. The more abrupt sauté method, which {{was introduced by}} Enrico Cecchetti, is typically used in allegros, where the relatively slow and smooth relevé and piqué transitions would be both impractical and visually inconsistent with the lively pace of movement. The sauté method {{is more common in}} Russian ballet.|$|E
25|$|The Pageant {{provides}} {{young women}} opportunities to gain confidence and <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> to develop friendships through competition. The pageant {{has evolved over}} the years into a two-evening, primarily student-produced event.

Miss MHB and three runners-up are named, and each one receives a scholarship for the semester following their selection.|$|E

25|$|Cleopatra, {{being the}} complex figure that she is, has faced {{a variety of}} interpretations of {{character}} throughout history. Perhaps the most famous dichotomy {{is that of the}} manipulative seductress versus the skilled leader. Examining the critical history of the character of Cleopatra reveals that intellectuals of the 19th century and the early 20th century viewed her as merely an object of sexuality that could be understood and diminished rather than an imposing force with great <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> capacity for leadership.|$|E
25|$|The Student of the Year Competition is {{a contest}} that {{encompasses}} six areas deemed critical {{to a successful}} life - scholarship, talent, community involvement, <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> appearance, career preparation, and model chapter operation. Each Province sponsors a pageant during its Council. In the year of a Grand Chapter Meeting, the Province winners compete at the Grand Chapter Meeting. The first Student of the Year Pageant was held on May 20, 1972 at Drexel University, {{under the direction of}} Mel Davis. The first Pageant at the Grand Chapter Meeting occurred at the 58th Grand Chapter Meeting.|$|E
25|$|Most {{undergraduate}} chapters elect {{a female}} {{associated with the}} chapter as the chapter sweetheart. At each Grand Chapter, the fraternity chooses a Sweetheart from one chapter to be the International Sweetheart of Sigma Chi for two years. The International Sweetheart Award is presented based on personality, character, campus involvement, Sigma Chi activities, general accomplishments, <b>poise,</b> <b>and</b> grace. Each nominee must be the sweetheart of an undergraduate chapter for the year nominated and {{a student at the}} nominating chapter's university. Judy Garland was a Sigma Chi Sweetheart from The New York State University chapter.|$|E

After being caught with his allies on the battlefield after trying to overthrow the Cholas from his exile, 'Vira Pandya was treated better than he {{had a right to}} expect. His life was spared and he was allowed some land and other wealth suited to his new station'. Possibly, Kulothunga Chola III also had a hand in the identification and enthronement of the next Pandya monarch Vikrama Pandya after his victory over Vira Pandya.|$|E
25|$|President Quezón was re-elected in November 1941, but his {{presidency}} was immediately beset with crisis when Japan invaded the Philippines {{in the following}} month. Aurora accompanied her husband to Corregidor in December, 1941, where the President was sworn in by Chief Justice José Abad Santos for his second term on December 30, 1941. For the next two months, the Quezón family remained in Corregidor where, despite the difficult living conditions, Quezón {{was said to have}} maintained her <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> kept up with a daily mass. In February 1942, they began their long journey via Australia to escape the Japanese, finally reaching the United States in June 1942.|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} Mary Victoria Leiter in Chicago, the {{daughter}} of Mary Theresa (née Carver) and Levi Leiter, the wealthy co-founder of Field and Leiter dry goods business, and later partner in the Marshall Fields retail empire. On her father's side, she was of Swiss-German descent. Her family moved to Washington, D.C. in 1881 and entered the exclusive circle of official society there. They lived for several years in the former home of James G. Blaine on Dupont Circle. She was taught dancing, singing, music, and art at home by tutors and learned the French language from her French governess. A Columbia University professor taught her history, arithmetic, and chemistry. Travel and prolonged residence abroad cultivated her powers of observation and breadth of mental vision at an early age. Her <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> finish made her charming to those with mature and brilliant intellect.|$|E

25|$|Although scandalized by Don Ciccio's stories, the Prince at last {{asks the}} {{question}} that's really on his mind—what is Angelica truly like? Ciccio speaks rapturously of her beauty, <b>poise,</b> <b>and</b> sophistication, and then speaks {{about how her}} parents' vulgarity seems to have not affected her. The Prince bristles, and informs Don Ciccio that from now on, because Angelica and Tancredi are to be married, the Serdàras must be spoken about with appropriate respect. Ciccio, who has believed that Tancredi was attempting to seduce Angelica in order to embarrass her father, is horrified. He bursts out that for Tancredi and Angelica to marry will cause {{the end of the}} good qualities of the Salina and Falconieri families. The Prince thinks to himself, however, that the marriage will not be the end, but the beginning. As the Prince and Don Ciccio return to Donnafugata, it is impossible to tell which of them is Don Quixote and which is Sancho Panza.|$|E

500|$|Confirming Naim's upgrade {{philosophy}} – {{the belief}} and objective that incremental improvements to their equipment can be gained with {{improving the quality}} of the power source, Martin Colloms of Hi-fi Critic concluded about adding an external power supply to the top-of-the-range Supernait: ... simply transformed the sound quality, immediately bringing a substantial and obvious improvement. Supernait-with-Hi-Cap has greater <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> dynamic range, is better at getting feet tapping, has less 'character', a bigger soundstage, and the bass is tauter with less 'thump'.|$|E

500|$|Bruce {{was also}} known for his unusually high goalscoring rate for a centre-back, {{resulting}} {{from a combination of}} his ability to powerfully head the ball and his effectiveness in taking penalty kicks. Although lacking <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> grace, and often criticised for his lack of pace, his bravery and willingness to take knocks from opposition players made him the [...] "heart" [...] of the defence during his time with Manchester United. He was well known for continuing to play even when injured, including returning to the United team at short notice in 1992 even though he was awaiting an operation on a hernia. His indomitable spirit and motivational abilities were deemed vital to the United team, and Alex Ferguson has commented on his [...] "determination and heart".|$|E

500|$|In March 1925, Fox gave Lombard {{a leading}} role in the drama Marriage in Transit, {{opposite}} Edmund Lowe. Her performance was well received, with a reviewer for Motion Picture News writing that she displayed [...] "good <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> considerable charm." [...] Despite this, the studio heads were unconvinced that Lombard was leading lady material, and her one-year contract was not renewed. Gehring has suggested that a facial scar she obtained in an automobile accident was a factor in this decision. Fearing that the scar—which ran across her cheek—would ruin her career, the 17-year-old had an early plastic surgery procedure to make it less visible. For the remainder of her career, Lombard learned to hide the mark with make-up and careful lighting.|$|E

Fahey stood head and shoulders above the many highly decorated full internationals in the Hertha team, showing the full range of his passing from deep and from close range, and generally showing a <b>poise</b> <b>and</b> guile on the ball that you would not expect from a League of Ireland player amongst such illustrious company." ...|$|E

[...] She also noted the fact that Alex takes control of her sexuality and decisions, saying, [...] "What was set up as an uncomfortable situation where Booth was in charge, swiveled into a scenario that gave Parish the reins."
