40|$|Statistics {{confirm that}} there is a need to study the safety of vans with a <b>permissible</b> maximum <b>laden</b> <b>mass</b> between 2000 and 3500 kg. as well as develop {{strategies}} for improvement. The number of fatalities in accidents involving vans has been constant during the last 10 years, not following the diminishing tendency shown by the general accidents. Not only efficient, but also safer road freight transport is required. This report analyses the security of the light commercial vehicles across the study of the influence from load distribution and the effectiveness of ESC (Electronic Stability Control). Through the medium of simulations made with Pc-Crash software, it has been analysed if the implementation of ESC in vans can at some extent compensate the influence of inaccurate load distributions. Furthermore, due to van’s relatively high centre of gravity and its load, vans may have less avoidance properties than a passenger car. Also (in addition) the differences of braking and dynamic properties between passenger cars and light commercial vehicles have been studied. Neither through literature review nor through own tests, the widespread opinion that van...|$|R
30|$|Similar surveys to PRFSS {{are made}} in other European countries. These surveys share a common {{methodology}} recommended by Eurostat in order to harmonize and compare EU road freight statistics [18, 19]. For instance, Great Britain, France and Germany perform the “Continuing Survey of Road Goods Transport/CSRGT” [20], “Transport Routier de Marchandises/TRM” [21] and “Kraftfahr-Bundesamt/KBA” [22] respectively. All these surveys provide annual data about road freight operations carried out by goods vehicles with a loading capacity above 3.5  tonnes or maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>laden</b> weight above 6.0  tonnes.|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises the {{historical}} development of railway freight vehicles and how vehicle designers have tackled the difficult challenges of producing running gear which can accommodate {{the very high}} tare to <b>laden</b> <b>mass</b> of typical freight wagons whilst maintaining stable running at the maximum required speed and good curving performance. The most common current freight bogies are described in detail and recent improvements in techniques used to simulate the dynamic behaviour of railway vehicles are summarised and examples of how these have been used to improve freight vehicle dynamic behaviour are included. A number of recent developments and innovative components and sub systems are outlined and finally two new developments are presented in more detail: the LEILA bogie and the SUSTRAIL bogie...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} aerosol filtration in turbofan engines. The current problem of very fine aerosol admission is the impossibility for mechanical filtration; {{another aspect of the}} problem is the high mass flow of air to be filtered. Non-attended, the aerosol admission can -and usually does- lead to clogging of turbine cooling passages and can damage the engine completely. The approach is theoretical and relies on the principles of electrostatic dust collectors known in other industries. An estimative equation is deduced in order to quantify the electrical charge required to obtain the desired filtration. Although the device still needs more theoretical and experimental work, it could one day be used as a means of increasing the safety of airplanes passing trough an aerosol <b>laden</b> <b>mass</b> of air...|$|R

One station {{was located in}} the free troposphere (FT), {{the other in the}} marine boundary layer (MBL). Transport towards these two sites was strongly decoupled: the FT was first affected by dust and sulfate <b>laden</b> air <b>masses</b> advecting form North Africa, and later by clean air masses originating over the N.

50|$|CLEVER {{features}} a two-seat tandem layout, a single front wheel, tilting cabin, and a two-wheeled rear engine module. The total vehicle mass is approximately 332 kg (excluding driver and bodywork); with a 75 kg driver the static weight distribution is 39% front and 61% rear. The rear module does not tilt and accounts for approximately 40% of the <b>laden</b> vehicle <b>mass</b> meaning only 60% can be tilted {{to balance the}} vehicle whilst cornering. CLEVER’s wheelbase is 2.4m, as long as many conventional city cars, {{but there are no}} overhangs so total length is under 3m. The track width is just 0.84m giving a total vehicle width of 1.00m.|$|R
5000|$|Theological {{books in}} the eighteenth century were heavy, expensive, and dull, and preachers {{remained}} in one parish and did not travel. John Wesley's revolutionary approach was to send his ministers on circuits to the <b>masses,</b> <b>laden</b> with books that were small, cheap and written in a popular style. [...] Wesley supported himself through his publishing empire and bade his U.S. followers to use his press as well. Itinerant Methodists such as Rogers' husband would have carried books with them to sell, supplementing their meagre stipends. [...] Since every minister was also a subscription agent, the fact that Minister George Whitfield was listed as the book’s agent was customary of Wesley’s system.|$|R

Globalization and the {{advances}} of technology and infonnation have also brought a huge influence in {{almost every aspect of}} human life, including socio-cultural dimension and socio-political. Thus, the roles of mass media as the main agent in the transaction of infonnation become significant. The mass media are expected to represent themselves as a major of public sphere, then also helped to detennine the dynamics of social, political and culture at the local and global stage. Among the plurality of Indonesian society, the treat of SARA (Suku: tribe/ethnic; Agama: religionlfaith; Ras: racelblood; Antargo/ ongan: inter-group) conflict is crucial and important to be noticed. Since conflict is the most interesting news value, the news coverage of mass media then holds an absolute power in shaping public opinion. Not only loved by the media alone, the audience was considered to be very enthusiastic readers for news of conflict as well. Conflicts using violence in all its fonns are always interesting. Especially when conflict is associated with politically <b>laden</b> of <b>mass</b> media industry that has lots of interests and problems in it. The problem of reporting the conflict has become increaSingly more bizarre and more complex when addressed the mainstream ideology of the journalist profession that emphasizes the two-dimensional concept of ·objectivity" publications that is factuality and impartiality. In a news text of conflict, the problem of completeness and accuracy, relevance of a fact are to be of great importance for the quality of news. The role of mass media in conflict situations such as this becomes very important. Of the three roles of mass media in reposting the case of conflict, only two roles are taken. First, as the issue intensifier/sharpen conflicts (Republika's case in SARA conflict in Ambon) and as the conflict diminisherlhider conflicts (Kompas and Suara Republika's case in SARA conflict in Ambon). None of the mass media has established itself as part of the conflict resolution process in reporting news of conflict...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution in situ CO_ 2 {{measurements}} were conducted aboard the NASA DC- 8 aircraft during the ARCTAS/POLARCAT field campaign, {{a component of}} the wider 2007 – 2008 International Polar Year activities. Data were recorded during large-scale surveys spanning the North American sub‐Arctic to the North Pole from 0. 04 to 12 km altitude in spring and summer of 2008. Influences on the observed CO_ 2 concentrations were investigated using coincident CO, black carbon, CH_ 3 CN, HCN, O_ 3, C_ 2 Cl_ 4, and Δ^(14) CO_ 2 data, and the FLEXPART model. In spring, the CO_ 2 spatial distribution from 55 °N to 90 °N was largely determined by the long-range transport of air <b>masses</b> <b>laden</b> with Asian anthropogenic pollution intermingled with Eurasian fire emissions evidenced by the greater variability in the mid-to-upper troposphere. At the receptor site, the enhancement ratios of CO_ 2 to CO in pollution plumes ranged from 27 to 80 ppmv ppmv^(− 1) with the highest anthropogenic content registered in plumes sampled poleward of 80 °N. In summer, the CO_ 2 signal largely reflected emissions from lightning-ignited wildfires within the boreal forests of northern Saskatchewan juxtaposed with uptake by the terrestrial biosphere. Measurements within fresh fire plumes yielded CO_ 2 to CO emission ratios of 4 to 16 ppmv ppmv^(− 1) and a mean CO_ 2 emission factor of 1698 ± 280 g kg^(− 1) dry matter. From the ^(14) C in CO_ 2 content of 48 whole air samples, mean spring (46. 6 ± 4. 4 ‰) and summer (51. 5 ± 5 ‰) Δ^(14) CO_ 2 values indicate a 5 ‰ seasonal difference.

40|$|International audienceWe analyze MOZAIC ozone {{observations}} recorded over Equatorial Africa, from April 1997 to March 2003 to {{give the}} first ozone climatology of this region. The monthly mean vertical profiles have been systematically analyzed with monthly mean ECMWF data using a Lagrangian-model (LAGRANTO). We assess the roles played by the dynamical features of Equatorial Africa and the intense biomass burning sources within the region in defining the ozone distribution. The lower troposphere exhibits layers of enhanced ozone during the biomass burning season in each hemisphere (boreal winter in the northern tropics and boreal summer in the southern tropics). The monthly mean vertical profiles of ozone are clearly influenced by the local dynamical situation. Over the Gulf of Guinea during boreal winter, the ozone profile is characterized by systematically high ozone below 650 hPa. This {{is due to the}} high stability caused by the Harmattan winds in the lower troposphere and the blocking Saharan anticyclone in the middle troposphere that prevents any efficient vertical mixing. In contrast, Central African enhancements are not only found in the lower troposphere but throughout the troposphere. The boreal summer ozone maximum in the lower troposphere of Central Africa continues up to November in the middle troposphere due to the influx of air <b>masses</b> <b>laden</b> with biomass burning products from Brazil and Southern Africa. Despite its southern latitude, Central Africa during the boreal winter is also {{under the influence of the}} northern tropical fires. This phenomenon is known as the "ozone paradox". However, the tropospheric ozone columns calculated from the MOZAIC data give evidence that the Tropical Tropospheric Ozone Column (TTOC) maximum over Africa swings from West Africa in DJF to Central Africa in JJA. This contrasts with studies based on TOMS satellite data. A rough assessment of the regional ozone budget shows that the northern tropics fires in boreal winter might contribute up to 20 % of the global photochemical ozone production. This study gives the first detailed picture of the ozone distribution over Equatorial Africa that should be used to validate both global models over this region and future satellite products...|$|R
