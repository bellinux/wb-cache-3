2500|$|The Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue Storm's younger brother, {{possesses}} {{the ability to}} control fire, allowing him to <b>project</b> <b>fire</b> from his body, as well as the power to fly. This character was loosely based on a Human Torch character published by Marvel's predecessor Timely Comics in the 1940s, an android that could ignite itself. Lee said that when he conceptualized the character, [...] "I thought it was a shame that we didn't have The Human Torch anymore, and this was a good chance to bring him back". Unlike the teen sidekicks that preceded him, the Human Torch in the early stories was [...] "a typical adolescent — brash, rebellious, and affectionately obnoxious." [...] Johnny Storm was killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "Three", before being brought back and rejoining the reformed Fantastic Four.|$|E

Wind tunnel testing occurred at the 4-foot Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel, the High-Temperature Tunnel, and the Thermal Structures Tunnel at the Langley Research Center located in Hampton, Virginia. Recoverable reentry packages were flight tested using the Atlas Intercontinental ballistic missile. <b>Project</b> <b>Fire</b> flight tests originated from Launch Complex 12 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, United States.|$|E

50|$|A {{fire camp}} is a {{campsite}} for firefighters and support personnel. It is typically {{set up for}} a large <b>project</b> <b>fire</b> which requires {{a large amount of}} manpower, organisation and logistics. According to the National Incident Management System (NIMS), a fire camp is one of five predesignated temporary facilities. Fire camps provide certain essential auxiliary forms of support, such as food, sleeping areas, and sanitation for Wildland firefighters. Fire camps may also provide minor maintenance and servicing of equipment.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of drought}} and high winds, 2,525 {{hectares}} of the Karkaraly forest were burned by forest fires in 1997-1998. After the fire, the park {{worked very hard}} on planting new trees and restoring the forest to its original state. A nursery in the Kent mountains provided the saplings for the re-vegetation <b>project.</b> <b>Fire</b> prevention standards were implemented and the following year 164 hectares were destroyed from 18 separate fires. In 2003, only 84 hectares were burned.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} and electrical engineering engineers are specialists, {{commonly referred to}} as (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) when engaged in the building design fields. Also known as [...] "building services engineering" [...] in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Mechanical engineers often design and oversee the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, and rain gutter systems. Plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple active fire protection systems, but for more complicated <b>projects,</b> <b>fire</b> protection engineers are often separately retained. Electrical engineers are responsible for the building's power distribution, telecommunication, fire alarm, signalization, lightning protection and control systems, as well as lighting systems.|$|R
