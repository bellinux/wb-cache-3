5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{gave the}} ruins to the Carey family, who {{retained}} {{it until it}} passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families. The castle {{was not involved in}} the events of the English Civil War in the 17th century, and escaped the slighting that affected many similar properties, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the outer walls had already made it indefensible and of little military value. In 1737, after the death of Edward Coke, the castle and the surrounding manor were bought by Thomas Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, for £22,500.|$|E

5|$|In Tamaulipas and {{southern}} Texas, the ranges {{of the marsh}} rice rat and the related Oryzomys couesi meet; in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in far northeastern Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places). In experimental conditions, they fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to O.couesi, the marsh rice rat shows less genetic variability within but more between populations in the contact zone, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> species is restricted to isolated populations near the coast.|$|E
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E
5|$|The church {{held the}} right to conduct the marriages of people {{throughout}} Manchester, not only from within its parish, until 1874. Despite this, there were no such services for the first 35 years of its existence, {{perhaps because of the}} continued popularity of the Collegiate Church as a venue for weddings but <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other local churches, which effectively doubled the cost of being married at St John's rather than at the Collegiate Church. Later, after the rights of the Collegiate Church were curtailed, some weeks saw more than 100 marriage services at St John's in the years just before 1874.|$|E

5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> moral {{judgments}} are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Major {{memorial}} themes, such as {{victory and}} death all had their symbols. Many Canadian and British soldiers are shown raising a hat or a rifle, {{a sign of}} victory first introduced into Boer War memorials. The Greek goddess Nike herself frequently appears on civic memorials, particularly in Britain and Canada, personifying victory, often pointing the way to soldiers: the image is far less, common, however, on more sombre memorials in battlefields and graveyards. Personifications of Death rarely feature on these memorials, however, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> emphasis is typically on the self-sacrifice of the soldiers involved, rather than their being taken or claimed by Death. Death is more typically presented through images of widows, orphans and elderly parents on memorials, all popular inter-war allegorical forms for death and grieving. Figures of women often represented peace, civilisation or wider humanity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Bellerophon was launched, {{there was no}} {{pressing}} need for new warships. The signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 brought the American War of Independence to an end while Bellerophon was still under construction. Though Greaves had been contracted to have her ready for launching by April 1784, she spent another two years on the slipway, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Navy Board ordered construction work to be delayed to allow her timber to be seasoned, a luxury available now {{that there were no}} pressing military needs. When the launch came, it was delayed several times, finally taking place during a period of heavy autumn storms in October 1786. She was launched with little ceremony on 7 October 1786, by Commissioner Charles Proby, of Chatham Dockyard. She was then towed across the River Medway and anchored off Chatham Dockyard. She was taken into the dry dock there on 7 March 1787, where her hull was fitted with copper sheathing, and she was fitted for the Ordinary. Her final costs came to £30,232.14.4d paid to Greaves for building her, and a further £8,376.15.2d spent on fitting her for service.|$|E

5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{surviving}} {{art from}} the Mesolithic period in Scotland, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> mobile peoples of the period would have made this on perishable organic items. Probably the oldest surviving portable visual art from Scotland are carved stone balls, or petrospheres, that date from the late Neolithic era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire, {{but a handful of}} examples are known from Iona, Skye, Harris, Uist, Lewis, Arran, Hawick, Wigtownshire and fifteen from Orkney, five of which were found at the Neolithic village of Skara Brae. Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions. Their production may have continued into the Iron Age. The complex carved circles and spirals on these balls can be seen mirrored in the carving on what was probably a lintel from a chambered cairn at Pierowall on Westray, Orkney, which seem {{to be part of the}} same culture that produced carvings at Newgrange in Ireland. Similarly, elaborately carved maceheads are often found in burial sites, like that found at Airdens in Sutherland, which has a pattern of interlocking diamond-shaped facets, similar to those found across Neolithic Britain and Europe.|$|E
25|$|Theodorus of Cyrene {{proved the}} irrationality of the surds of whole numbers up to 17, but stopped there <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> algebra he used couldn't {{be applied to}} the square root of 17.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of papillomaviruses {{is thought to}} be slow compared to many other virus types, but there are no experimental measurements currently available. This is <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> papillomavirus genome is composed of genetically stable double-stranded DNA that is replicated with high fidelity by the host cell's DNA replication machinery.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} several {{attempts}} to replace Gerber by formats containing more information than just the layer image, e.g. netlist or component information. None of these attempts have been widely accepted within the electronics manufacturing industry, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> formats are complex. Gerber remains the most widely used data transfer format.|$|E
25|$|Lusatian {{settlements}} in central Poland (Łódź area) were small (4–5 families) and short-lived, {{no more than}} half a century at the same location, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> soil was no longer usable after intensive exploitation through a couple of generations. The exception is a huge settlement in Kowalewice, Zgierz County, from the late Bronze Age, lasting into the Hallstatt period.|$|E

Human activities consisted of animal husbandry and incipient agriculture, and archaeological {{evidence points to}} the beginning of decrease in forest cover.|$|E
25|$|The oceans of the mid-Pacific and Micronesia {{opened up}} in the early 19th century as whalers from Europe and the Americas came in search of prey. The sudden influx of whaling vessels in the 1820s led to the {{discovery}} and initial charting {{of most of the}} Phoenix Islands between 1821–1825. This area was the last in the Pacific to be fully explored and charted, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> islands were predominantly small and isolated.|$|E
25|$|Composer Viktor Ullmann was interned in September 1942, {{and died}} at Auschwitz in October 1944.

It was planned for {{performance at the}} camp, but the Nazis withdrew permission when it was in rehearsal, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> authorities perceived its allegorical intent.
