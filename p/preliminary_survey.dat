5|$|In 2006 the Indian {{government}} acting for the Bhutanese government, {{conducted a}} feasibility study into {{the viability of}} an international airport near the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu. In the five-year plan (which covers 2008–2013) the sum of BTN 2,826 million had been allocated by the Bhutanese government for development of the new airport. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>survey</b> was conducted by India in May 2006 and the survey team from the Airports Authority of India was to return and complete the final survey in September 2006. In October 2008 the project was shelved, and the Bhutanese government decided that the airport at Gelephu {{would be used for}} domestic flights only.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>preliminary</b> <b>survey</b> {{of nearly}} 400 seven-year-olds, 45% chose even over odd when asked the parity of zero. A {{follow-up}} investigation offered more choices: neither, both, and don't know. This time {{the number of}} children in the same age range identifying zero as even dropped to 32%. Success in deciding that zero is even initially shoots up and then levels off at around 50% in Years 3 to 6. For comparison, the easiest task, identifying the parity of a single digit, levels off at about 85% success.|$|E

5|$|Across Florida, damage totaled $27.75million (1950USD), {{of which}} $15million {{was in the}} Miami {{metropolitan}} area. The hurricane damaged 20,861houses in southern Florida, 580 of them severely. Additionally, 248trailer homes were damaged, 188 of them severely. A total of 248houses or trailers were destroyed in the Miami area. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>survey</b> indicated there were about 2,000store windows that were broken during the storm. In West Hollywood, a town of 2,000people located north of Miami, strong winds destroyed or severely damaged about 150houses, leaving hundreds homeless. At the Broward County airport in Fort Lauderdale, the winds damaged 55buildings and destroyed one plane. Further north, damage was lighter in Palm Beach, consisting of downed trees and flooded streets. Along its path through the state, strong winds were observed around Lake Okeechobee, with a 93mph (150km/h) gust in Clewiston. In Orlando, the winds destroyed the roof of an airport hangar.|$|E

25|$|Analysts {{noted the}} rapid rise of Poe in {{national}} election surveys, which community organizer Harvey Keh attributed to popular sympathy for her father, fueled {{in part by}} high public trust in the Poe name. Prior {{to the start of}} the election season, Poe was ranked twenty-eighth in a <b>preliminary</b> <b>survey</b> conducted by the Social Weather Stations (SWS) in mid-2012, before the start of the filing period. Immediately after filing her candidacy, Poe initially ranked fifteenth in the first survey of the election, published by StratPOLLS. While she ranked as low as twentieth in a survey published by SWS later in the year, she entered the top 12 in January 2013, where she stayed. In the last survey issued by Pulse Asia in April 2013, she was ranked third.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} colony was founded, {{settlers}} lobbied {{for the construction}} of a road across the mudflats in the Swan River at the eastern end of the town. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>survey</b> of the site was conducted in 1834 by the Commissioner for Roads and Bridges, George Fletcher Moore, together with Surveyor General John Septimus Roe. A public meeting on 17 February 1837 passed a resolution urging the colony's government to construct the road at the site, and Roe showed the public plans for the proposed causeway. A year later, in January 1838, the Perth Gazette noted that preliminary work had been carried out towards building the causeway, which is thought to have been the upgrading of Adelaide Terrace from the [...] "bush track" [...] it was previously.|$|E
500|$|The Hungarian {{linguists}} Katalin Balogné Bérces and Zsuzsa Szamosfalvi {{found in}} a <b>preliminary</b> <b>survey</b> of Serbian usage that {{the most commonly used}} [...] "animal vocatives" [...] were, in order, 1. pig, 2. chick(en), 3. dog/puppy, 4. cow, 5. monkey, 6. hen, 7. rat, 8. turkey, 9. mouse, 10. snake, 11. cat/kitten, 12. fox, 13. lamb, 14. vixen, 15. worm. Of these, using the classification devised by Sabina Halupka-Resetar, and Biljana Radic, lamb was always used positively; cow and vixen referred to a person's appearance; pig indicated a person's eating habits; calling someone a fox or a turkey related to their intelligence, or lack of it; and names like cat, snake, worm, monkey, dog, mouse, chicken, lamb and rat were used to indicate a person's character.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, {{one of the}} {{patterns}} reported by the CCD Study Group at Pennsylvania State was that all producers in a <b>preliminary</b> <b>survey</b> noted a period of [...] "extraordinary stress" [...] affecting the colonies in question prior to their die-off, most commonly involving poor nutrition and/or drought. This was the only factor {{that all of the}} cases of CCD had in common in the report; accordingly, there appeared to be at least some significant possibility that the phenomenon was correlated to nutritional stress that may not manifest in healthy, well-nourished colonies. This was similar to the findings of another independent survey done in 2007 in which small-scale beekeeping operations (up to 500 colonies) in several states reported their belief that malnutrition and/or weak colonies was the factor responsible for their bees dying in over 50% of the cases, whether the losses were believed to be due to CCD or not.|$|E
