50|$|The largest {{feature of}} the <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> is its paved area, hence, by {{changing}} this surface to be more permeable to water the <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> will drain better. Some surface options are open joint pavers, porous asphalt, pervious concrete, or a turf grid. Drainage {{is an important part}} of a green <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> because runoff is a serious concern. In addition to using a more porous surface, a more porous subsurface may be used to maximize drainage through the <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> surface. Drains and low lying areas for water retention can also be components of a green <b>parking</b> <b>lot.</b>|$|R

5|$|Heavy rains {{that preceded}} the storm forced {{thousands}} of gamblers along the Las Vegas Strip to be evacuated and left two people missing. The remnants of the storm later moved into the region, bringing additional flooding. Many <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> in the resort town of Laughlin were flooded. Furthermore, the villages of Searchlight and Blue Diamond were isolated due to flooding. Several major streets in Paradise were closed because of flooding and sandbag barriers were erected alongside Caesars Palace to prevent further flood damage. In addition, record river levels were measured along the Amargosa River near Death Valley.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E
