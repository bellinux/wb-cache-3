Although he added that it [...] "was not one of [...] most successful," [...] since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa. On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's automatic <b>phone</b> <b>dialer,</b> intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs. In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: [...] "Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics? A lot safer most likely.

5000|$|The Nexus 5 {{received}} mostly positive reviews; critics {{felt that}} the device provided a notable balance between performance and pricing.

Hangouts as the default text messaging app was criticized for its user interface and for attempting to force the use of a Google service, while the quality of photos taken with the device was described as being [...] "great, but it didn't particularly blow me away." [...] In conclusion, the Nexus 5 was given a 4 out of 5, concluding that [...] "to even compare this $400 phone to those that cost upward of $650 unlocked (like the Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC One, and Apple iPhone 5S) speaks volumes about the Nexus 5's massive appeal and affordability", and that the device [...] "extends the allure of the Nexus brand to anyone simply looking for an excellent yet inexpensive handset." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Data Acquisition Systems (DAS) are {{the basis}} for {{building}} monitoring tools that enable the supervision of local and remote systems. A variety of communications and data transmission system has been adopted DAS to exchange information. The special-purpose DAS has a very important practical value. This paper presents the circuit and system design for a new micro type of remote data acquisition system. It consists of an integrated circuit, a <b>phone</b> <b>dialer,</b> modulation devices, central processing unit, buttons, input devices and display devices. The system and circuit design has been described in detail. It {{can be used to}} transmit data through the public switched telephone network. It is suitable for constructing a mini scale communication network at low cost for data acquisition through the PSTN...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Finger Based Technique (FBT) prototypes, a {{novel interaction}} system for blind users, which is especially designed and developed for non-visual touch screen devices and their applications. The FBT prototypes were developed with virtual keys {{to be identified}} based on finger holding positions. Two different models namely the single digit FBT and double digit FBT were propounded. FBT technique were applied using two different <b>phone</b> <b>dialer</b> applications: a single digit virtual key for the single digit FBT model and a double digit virtual key with audio feedback enabling touch as input gesture for the later one. An evaluation with 7 blind participants showed that single digit FBT was significantly faster and more accurate than double digit FBT. In addition to that, single digit FBT {{was found to be}} much faster than iPhone VoiceOver entry speeds in performing similar tasks. Furthermore, our research also suggests 11 accessible regions for quick access or navigation in flat touch screen based smart phones for blind users. These accessible regions will serve as a usability design framework and facilitate the developers to place the widget for the blind user for dynamic interaction with the touch screen devices. As far as is known to the authors, this is a novel suggestion...|$|E
