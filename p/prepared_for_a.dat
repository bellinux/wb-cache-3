5|$|Having seized Emesa, the Muslims {{were just}} a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an {{alliance}} with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his grand daughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what {{was meant to be}} a well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver—probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government—and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark.|$|E

5|$|After {{clinching}} {{a spot in}} {{the championship}} game, Tech defeated ACC opponent Duke, then <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> game against traditional rival Georgia before heading to Jacksonville for the ACC championship. In the game against Georgia, the No. 16 Yellow Jackets were upset by the unranked Bulldogs, who intercepted Tech quarterback Reggie Ball twice and held him to just 42passing yards in the game. Georgia's victory marked the sixth consecutive victory in the rivalry and sent Tech into the ACC Championship Game on a down note.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{large-scale}} {{evacuation of}} supplies from Warsaw was ordered, the Modlin Fortress was well <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lengthy siege. Its magazines contained over 25,000 cannonballs, almost 900 thousand musket and rifle rounds and enough provisions {{for several months}} of full siege. The treasury of the Polish government was still intact and contained more than 6.5 million złotys.|$|E

5|$|German {{intelligence}} {{suggested that}} the RAF was down to just 300 serviceable fighters on 17 August 1940, taking into consideration German pilots' claims and their estimates of British production capabilities. In fact, there were 855 machines serviceable, with another 289 at storage units and 84 at training units. These resources were included {{in a total of}} 1,438 fighters, twice as many as at the beginning of July 1940. Expecting weakening opposition, the Luftwaffe <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major action against RAF Sector Stations on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|In October 1884, a {{convention}} {{held by the}} Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions unanimously set May 1, 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard. As the chosen date approached, U.S. labor unions <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> general strike {{in support of the}} eight-hour day.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{spread that}} the strike was weakening. Volunteers and others not {{connected}} with the miners association took over the mine pumps, which had been abandoned by the miners, {{in order to prevent}} flooding of the tunnels. There were minor acts of violence. The Citizens' Corps <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> possible armed confrontation, drilled by those of its members who were Civil War veterans. The group used the mine company store owned by W. W. Scranton as their headquarters, after vacating two other locations because owners feared the presence of the group would attract violence.|$|E

5|$|The castles {{guarding}} the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Złotoryja, Dobrzyń and Bobrowniki, {{the capital of}} Dobrzyń Land, while German burghers invited them into Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg). Władysław {{arrived on the scene}} in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came to terms with the Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major confrontation. Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at Płock in Masovia and had a pontoon bridge constructed and transported north down the Vistula.|$|E
5|$|The kick was {{returned}} to the Cincinnati 48-yard line, and the Bearcats <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> desperation drive in hopes of narrowing the Hokies' lead. On the first play after the punt, however, Pike threw an interception to Virginia Tech defender Cody Grimm. Back in possession of the ball, Taylor kneeled on the ball four times to wind down the game clock. After the final kneeldown, Virginia Tech secured the 20–7 win.|$|E
5|$|While the Allied armies {{continued}} their slow eastward drive between September and November 1944, the Germans <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> counteroffensive. Adolf Hitler, the German leader, believed that by launching an offensive in the West he could force the United States and Great Britain {{to an early}} peace, and thereby transfer {{the entirety of the}} Wehrmacht to the Eastern Front, where he could bring the Soviet offensive to a standstill and defeat it.|$|E

5|$|Young Mallory <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{profession}} {{by reading}} {{law in the}} office of Judge William Marvin. Because of its geographical position, Key West was often sought as a port of refuge for ships caught in storms, and was for the same reason near frequent shipwrecks. Marvin was recognized as an authority on maritime law, particularly applied to laws of wreck and salvage, and Mallory argued many admiralty cases before him. He was reputed {{to be one of the}} best young trial lawyers in the state.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew {{starting}} to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|After {{less than}} a month at Burnham, the {{battalion}} began moving overseas. In early January 1942 they were sent to Fiji, where they were based at Sambeto, near the airfield at Namaka. Shortly after their arrival, the 37th Battalion became part of the 14th Brigade along with the 30th and 35th Battalions. Later this brigade became part of the New Zealand 3rd Division. The brigade was responsible for defending the Namaka airfield and during its stay on Fiji, the 37th Battalion was tasked as a mobile reserve, the other battalions occupying fixed defensive positions as the island was <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> possible Japanese invasion.|$|E

5|$|After two of Flagg's {{followers}} fail to {{kill the}} leaders of the Free Zone, the Boulder community sends a group of men to Las Vegas to stop him. The three who reach the city are taken prisoner, and Flagg orders one of them executed for his defiance. As the other two are being <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> public execution, one of Flagg's most loyal followers, the Trashcan Man, arrives with a nuclear warhead salvaged from a military base. As Trash dies of radiation poisoning the Hand of God appears, detonating the warhead and annihilating Flagg, his followers, and the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs. Because the ship, already <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion}} of the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were picked up in the morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was able to keep West Honaker in the convoy headed to Utah beach.|$|E
