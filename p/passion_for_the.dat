5|$|Whitlam was {{the most}} {{paradoxical}} of all Prime Ministers {{in the last half}} of the 20th century. A man of superb intellect, knowledge, and literacy, he yet had little ability when it came to economics.... Whitlam rivalled Menzies in his <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives and ability to use it as his stage, and yet his parliamentary skills were rhetorical and not tactical. He could devise a strategy and then often botch the tactics in trying to implement that strategy.... Above all he was a man of grand vision with serious blind spots.|$|E

5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator.

5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of his}} life, Rimsky-Korsakov {{combined}} his {{composition and}} teaching with {{a career in the}} Russian military—at first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This love of the sea might have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and Scheherazade. Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law, Maximilian Steinberg.|$|E

5|$|Level-5 {{collaborated with}} Studio Ghibli {{to produce the}} game's {{animated}} sequences, and the game features graphics and visuals replicating the traditional animation style of Studio Ghibli films. The collaboration began when musician Naoya Fujimaki, who had previously worked with both companies, introduced Level-5 president Akihiro Hino to Studio Ghibli president Toshio Suzuki. At the time, Studio Ghibli had completed work on Ponyo (2008), and the animation team had no ongoing projects, which influenced Suzuki's decision to collaborate with Level-5. Another influencing factor of the collaboration was witnessing Hino's <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> project. Studio Ghibli approached the production process {{in the same way}} that they would create an animated film. Work on the animation began in July 2008, and took much longer than the predicted three months.|$|E
