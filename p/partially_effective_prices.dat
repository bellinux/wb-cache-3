When the maximum temperature is reached during the preheating phase, the temperature will be maintained until the <b>effective</b> <b>price</b> is below the next local minimum. Thus, any drawn energy will be restored by heating, similar to maintaining minimum temperature, but with higher standby losses. If the required temperature cannot be reached within a single slot, the heating rate will continue to be higher than the demand to reach the temperature. A different behavior occurs, if the <b>effective</b> <b>price</b> of the slot before the heating phase starts is below the price of the slot after the start (peff,i− 1 <peff,i+ 1). Then, the heating rate is selected such that the resulting temperature allows to reach the required temperature within the next slot.|$|R

3000|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how price functions impact the cost-optimal heating profile, the bilevel problem (8) of finding a price to shape the heating profile of a single DEWH was analyzed in Lübkert et al. (2018 a). It was understood that the resulting optimal price function allows the solver to select many heating profiles resulting at the same costs. The {{reason is that the}} price compensates the costs for earlier heating at any time slot. For this purpose, the price can be formulated as an exponentially increasing function (12) using the temperature change rate τ of the considered DEWH as a parameter called τ ^p = (τ ^p_ 1, [...]..., τ ^p_n). Such a price determined with τ ^p_i = τ for all i using (12) leads to a constant <b>effective</b> <b>price</b> determined with (13) of peff,i=prefenΔt/τ. The <b>effective</b> <b>price</b> represents a modified price information incorporating additional costs for higher standby losses due to preheating to higher temperatures (Lübkert et al. 2017). A constant <b>effective</b> <b>price</b> allows arbitrary heating profiles fulfilling the constraints and leading to minimum temperature {{at the end of the}} last slot.|$|R
