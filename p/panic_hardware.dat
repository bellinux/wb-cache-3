50|$|The City of Sacramento, in {{conjunction}} with the Sacramento Railyards Project, {{is in the process of}} an extensive and multi-stage renovation project. The first stage, called the Sacramento Valley Station Intermodal Phase I, was completed on August 13, 2012 with the complete relocation of all heavy-rail passenger platforms (Amtrak) approximately 1000 feet further north from their previous location. Sacramento Regional Transit Gold Line light rail operations remain in their original location directly behind the station depot. Stage two, or Sacramento Valley Station Intermodal Phase II, is actively under way with extensive work being performed on the station depot building itself. This work includes long-deferred retrofitting and structural repair, window replacement, ADA accessibility work, Life Safety fire code work including the outward opening of emergency exit doors and <b>panic</b> <b>hardware</b> installation, and both appearance and comfort rehabilitation to make the station better serve the public. As a result, as of August 2014, the station interior is full of scaffolding to facilitate the work being undertaken, causing the passenger waiting space to be visibly claustrophobic. This work will also see the complete relocation of Amtrak ticket and baggage offices from the 1960s era addition on the back side of the waiting room; the new offices will be located in the former station restaurant space on the North wing of the station and will be much more passenger-friendly.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{requirements}} for the Degree of Masters of Science in Fire Protection Engineering from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, a prescriptive and performance based design analysis was conducted for the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center building (Cal Poly campus). The purpose of this analysis was to review the Bonderson Engineering Projects Centerâ€™s compliance with applicable and recognized fire and building codes with regards to its fire protection systems and features. The fire protection systems and features analyzed in this report include: 1) Egress Systems, 2) Structural Fire Protection, 3) Fire Detection and Alarm Systems, 4) Fire Suppression Systems. Prescriptive analysis of the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center was performed {{in order to determine}} if the building adhered to standards set forth within applicable standards and codes. Analysis was based primarily upon both the International Building Code 2009 Edition and NFPA 101 : Life Safety Code 2012 Edition. Where required, other NFPA codes and standards were utilized, including the 2010 Editions of NFPA 13 : Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems and NFPA 72 : National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. The egress systems in the building largely met prescriptive code requirements except for a few issues related to room 104 and its change in occupancy use (door swing direction, locks without <b>panic</b> <b>hardware,</b> etc). The structural system is a Type II-B classification and was found to meet prescriptive code requirements. Some shortcomings with the detection and alarm systems were discovered during the analysis, mainly with respect to spacing gaps. Several visible notification devices on the second floor did not meet prescriptive code due to gaps in required coverage. Additionally, it was determined that detailed measurements of the average ambient sound level should be taken in order to better analyze the audible notification systems. Lastly, the sprinkler system was found to meet prescriptive code requirements, both for water demand and bracing. Performance based design analysis was performed in order to gain understanding on the ability of the building to safely egress occupants during various fire scenarios when built to the prescriptive approaches set forth in the codes and standards. This performance based design analysis was based upon standards set forth in Chapter 5 of the Life Safety Code. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Pathfinder computer simulators were utilized to carry out the performance based design. ASET vs. RSET analysis solidified the code requirements which prohibit highly combustible materials from within atrium spaces...|$|E
