5|$|By this time, the fortifications {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} because the Swedish command did not <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to these territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed {{under the supervision of}} Captain L. Stobecks.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E
5|$|Reyes and Doggett {{arrive in}} Novi {{and talk to}} Detective Van Allen (James McDonnell), who seems apathetic about the case. At the same time, Scully {{contacts}} Dr. Bertram Mueller (George D. Wallace), a former medical examiner who autopsied several bodies in the 1960s that were skinned {{in a manner similar}} to Potts. Mueller tells Scully that the sheriff at the time did not <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to the cases, emphasizing that there was more than one victim, and that he later killed himself. Reyes and Doggett receive news of Terry's attack and arrive at the local butchery to find him strung up among the pigs. While looking around the crime scene, Doggett discovers that Terry is still alive; Terry weakly says Ed's name. Doggett and the local police arrest Ed, who claims that he is innocent. Reyes believes him and admits that she too is having similar visions. Ed is freed, but not before having a vision in which Dr. Holland is skinned. In the meantime, Scully discovers that Potts and Terry were both born on the same day that two of the 1960s murder victims died.|$|E

5|$|The first {{generation}} of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements of the composition, seen {{in the far distance}} and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains {{one of the most memorable}} landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint cirrus clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E

However, when the emigration began to increase and the provincial economy was going through a depression, leaders of the province attempted to halt the emigration. The church warned of hell being destined for those who decided to leave. Nevertheless, more than 200,000 left between 1879–1901.|$|E
25|$|The Finns did not <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Soviet POWs {{at the beginning of}} the war, as the war was expected to be of short duration. The quantity and quality of camp personnel was very low, as the more qualified men were at the front. It was not until the middle of 1942 that the quantity and quality of camp personnel was improved. There was a shortage of labour in Finland and authorities assigned POWs to forest and agricultural work, as well as the construction of fortification lines. Some Soviet officers cooperated with the Finnish authorities and were released from prison by the end of the war.|$|E

Milan's return to Serbia did not last long because he quickly got into a conflict with his son. A week after his departure, Queen Natalija was allowed to return to Serbia. Natalija invited Alexander to come to Biarritz. When he visited his mother, he met Draga - who was 12 years older than him - and immediately fell in love with her. Natalija knew about this affair but did not <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to it believing that it would only be a short-lived adventure.|$|E

By contrast, Harry M. was much more autocratic and did not <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to the advice his teammates were giving him, which eventually led to Gbemi and Lizzie (who were designing the can) deciding to return the favour and not pay attention to his ideas on the can design.

25|$|As the Baroque style {{went out}} of fashion during the 18th century, the {{majority}} of Baroque and pre-Baroque composers were virtually forgotten. Local organists in Nuremberg and Erfurt knew Pachelbel's music and occasionally performed it, but {{the public and the}} majority of composers and performers did not <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to Pachelbel and his contemporaries. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, some organ works by Pachelbel were published and several musicologists started considering him an important composer, particularly Philipp Spitta, who was one of the first researchers to trace Pachelbel's role in the development of Baroque keyboard music. Much of Pachelbel's work was published in the early 20th century in the Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich series, but it was not until the rise of interest in early Baroque music in the middle of the 20th century and the advent of historically-informed performance practice and associated research that Pachelbel's works began to be studied extensively and again performed more frequently.|$|E
25|$|Although the 1980s were {{chaotic and}} nomadic there were {{brighter}} sides {{to his life}} charted in his published diaries. In January 1978 he had met his second long-term partner Nicholas Balaban, who {{was working as a}} barman at the Sombrero Club in Kensington. With Clark's encouragement Balaban applied to the Byam Shaw School of Art and went on to start his own highly successful fashion business producing printed T-shirts for high-street boutiques and multiples. Although most published accounts choose not to <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to Clark's gay relationships his sexuality was predominantly homosexual. Unfortunately Clark's continued erratic behaviour eventually led to the relationship's collapse in 1983/84. His depression deepened even more as he obsessed over Balaban, trying unsuccessfully to rekindle the relationship. Only with Balaban's death from AIDS in 1994 and a conversion to Buddhism did Clark finally begin to rebuild a career and shake off the past. In the early 1990s he trained the designer Bella Freud to pattern-cut and an extremely promising new beginning was the use of Clark's mastery of pattern-cutting chiffon and delicate fabrics by the Ghost label. Clark found their computerised pattern cutter a revelation, able to turn initial ideas into formers almost instantaneously.|$|E

25|$|Macrinus {{refused the}} {{extensive}} {{demands of the}} Parthians and war was restarted and its peak was in a three-day battle in Nusaybin. Although there is controversy about {{the result of the}} battle in the views of the ancient world's historians, the aftermath of the battle was obviously Roman defeat. After the end of the war, peace negotiations began and resulted in a peace treaty in 218 according to which the Romans paid 50 million Dinars to the Parthians and kept Armenia and Northern Mesopotamia. It was probably in about 220 that the local Persian governors (Ardashir I) started taking far and close lands. At the time, Artabanus did not <b>pay</b> <b>much</b> <b>attention</b> to his actions and decided to fight him when it had become too late. Eventually, Ardashir ended the life of the House of Arsaces in the Battle of Hormozdgan and founded the Sasanian dynasty. However, the end of the Parthian dynasty did not mean an endpoint for all Parthian houses. Movses Khorenatsi, Armenian historian, has quoted some reports of the roles and aids of some Parthian houses, like Suren and Ispahbudhan, in Ardashir's uprising.|$|E
