40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) transgenic wheat will undoubtedly affect Canada's wheat industry, expected to arrive in western Canada in approximately 2003 - 05. This thesis examines one of the possible outcomes of introducing genetically modified wheat to the western Canadian grain industry. The {{introduction of}} transgenic wheat was modelled while assuming that conventional and transgenic wheat were co-mingled in the current grain handling network. This resulted {{in the loss of}} ten export markets for Canadian Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat. The primary objectives of the thesis are to estimate the potential revenue loss to the CWRS wheat <b>pool</b> <b>account,</b> and calculate the potential farm-gate price reduction for CWRS wheat (resulting from the introduction of transgenic wheat). The empirical model results revealed an annual average reduction in revenue to the <b>pool</b> <b>account</b> for CWRS wheat of approximately $ 185 million, roughly 8. 5 % of the total revenue in the <b>pool</b> <b>account</b> for any given year. The annual price reduction for low, medium and high quality wheat was $ 9. 24 /tonne, $ 16. 11 /tonne, and $ 20. 62 /tonne respectively. Also, the annual average CWRS wheat price reduction across all qualities of CWRS wheat was estimated at $ 13. 95 /tonne. The thesis concludes with a discussion of future policies regarding registration of new transgenic crop varieties, formulating potential wheat segregation systems, and establishing marketing guidelines for GM grains in the world export market. An opportunity exists for involved stakeholders to avoid the negative consequences resulting from the introduction of transgenic wheat as modelled in the empirical analysis. The best case situation would include the introduction of transgenic wheat and associated benefits to both the technology provider and wheat producers, the establishment of export tolerance levels that permitted the separation of transgenic and conventional wheat within the current grain handling network, and the preservation of all current export markets for CWRS wheat produced in western Canada. This discussion identifies some of the challenges the involved industry participants will face as they seek to manage the introduction of genetically modified wheat to western Canada...|$|E
40|$|The CWB has {{the stated}} {{objective}} of increasing producer returns through maximizing sales revenue and minimizing operating costs. To maximize producer returns the CWB derives value from single-desk selling, price pooling {{and the initial}} price guarantee. The initial price allows the CWB to offer a price floor to producers which is guaranteed by the Federal government. This guarantee has come under review in recent World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations with opponents stating that the Federal government is unfairly subsidizing producers. Therefore developing methods to hedge the initial payment and remove the CWB dependency on the Federal government guarantee has taken on considerable importance. Hedging the initial price has two components, the first is commodity risk, {{and the second is}} currency risk. Commodity risk basically consists of the risk that wheat prices decrease significantly from the announcement of the initial payment resulting in a wheat <b>pool</b> <b>account</b> deficit. Currency risk relates to the risk of the Canadian dollar (CAD) increasing vis-à-vis the United States dollar (USD) resulting in lower wheat prices. This {{is due to the fact}} most sales are made in USD, necessitating the conversion of USD for CAD in order to pay Canadian producers. Given recent increases in exchange rate volatility this later risk is important. The goal of this study is to evaluate the currency risk present in the initial payment and to examine alternate means of mitigating this risk. A number of call option strategies will be evaluated to determine its ability to reduce the probability of a wheat <b>pool</b> <b>account</b> deficit by offsetting the effect of a rising CAD. The policy variables analyzed in the thesis are the initial payment as a percentage of the Pool Return Outlook for wheat and the strike price of the call options purchased. Therefore the study will examine the effect of inputting varying initial payment levels and different strike prices for the call options in the model. This will allow for quantifiable insight into cost versus risk reduction comparisons. These comparisons will be useful in determining the most efficient mode of action for the CWB...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MComm.) [...] Stellenbosch University, 1995. Many {{co-operative}} societies {{make use}} {{of a system of}} pooling the produce delivered to it by its members. The delivered produce is thrown into one common stock and its identity is lost in the process. Each season's harvest would normally form a separate pool. The co-operative keeps record of all the pool transactions {{in the form of a}} <b>pool</b> <b>account.</b> In short these transactions consist of the proceeds from the sale of the pooled mass, commission charged by the co. :. operative, expenses incurred in the processing and marketing of the products, as well as advances to the members. The surplus of the <b>pool</b> <b>account</b> is divided among the members at the closing of the account, in proportion to their contributions to that specific pool. Each member's share in the surplus is reduced by advances already received. In practice, only the advances and the final share of the surplus, reduced by advances already received, are included in the taxable income of the members. Realised sales, not yet distributed to the members are therefore not included in the taxable income of the members, nor of the co-operative society. The value of unsold pool stock at year end is further not included in the taxable income of the individual members, nor of the co-operative society. In this study, the treatment of co-operative pools from an income tax perspective is investigated in order to determine whether the treatment in practice is a correct reflection of the law. The study first gives a general background of the co-operative society as a form of a business enterprise. This is necessary in order to understand the creation of co-operative pools. The study further deals specifically with co-operative pools and the income tax consequences thereof. The following aspects are discussed: (a) The legal nature and consequences of pooling are investigated. The rights and obligations between the relevant parties will determine the income tax consequences. The study concentrates on whether ownership of the produce is transferred to the co-operative society as well as the implications in law of the mixing of all the produce and the further processing thereof. The capacity in which the co-operative processes and disposes of the products are also investigated. (b) A discussion is also given on whether the participants of a particular pool form an association of persons. Certainty in this regard is necessary before the income tax consequences of pooling for the co-operative society or the individual members can be discussed. An association of persons is regarded as a person for income tax purposes and is therefore a separate taxpayer. A partnership will, however, not be a separate taxpayer. As the circumstances with pooling resembles that of a partnership, the legal requirements of partnerships are also investigated. (c) The income tax consequences of pooling for the co-operative society as well as the individual members are discussed in detail. The conclusions are reached by applying the general income tax principals, as laid down by the courts, on the circumstances that exist with pooling. The fact that the members are co-owners of the pooled mass and the co-operative society is regarded as the irrevocable agent of the members, has a significant influence on the income tax consequences. From the above, the conclusion is reached that the income tax treatment of pooling in practice, is a correct reflection of the law, not only in respect of receipts and accruals, but also in respect of the treatment of unsold pool stock...|$|E

40|$|Vegetative fronds of Spirodela polyrrhiza were induced to form dormant turions by the {{addition}} of 1 micromolar abscisic acid or by shading. The cell wall polymers of fronds contained a high proportion of the branched-chain pentose, d-apiose (about 20 % of total noncellulosic wall sugar residues), whereas turion cell walls contained only trace amounts (about 0. 2 %). When the fronds were fed d-[3 H]glucuronic acid for 30 minutes, the accumulated UDP-[3 H]apiose <b>pool</b> <b>accounted</b> for about 27 % of the total phosphorylated [3 H]pentose derivatives; in turions, the UDP-[3 H]apiose <b>pool</b> <b>accounted</b> for only about 4 % of the total phosphorylated [3 H]pentose derivatives.

However, since there was a 100 -fold decrease in the rate of polysaccharide synthesis and only a 9 -fold decrease in UDP-apiose accumulation, there is probably also control of the activity of the relevant polysaccharide synthase...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Driven by {{the twin}} {{pressures}} {{of economic reform}} and an aging population, China began to reform its pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system in the mid- 1980 s. In 1997, the Chinese government issued a document to formally establish a new, partially funded pension system for urban workers. The new system, featuring a social <b>pooling</b> <b>account</b> and individual accounts, was developed with the joint goals of equity and efficiency in mind. To date, however, the system has failed to achieve these goals. Individual accounts are currently in debt and are accumulating mounting annual deficits. The same is also true of the social <b>pooling</b> <b>account.</b> We identify four major drivers behind the system’s current problems—namely, rapid {{growth in the number}} of retirees, the economic decline of the State sector, a decline in payroll tax collection rates, and underreported wage levels. We then examine the linkages between these drivers and the costs arising from the transition from the PAYG system to the partially funded system. On the basis of our analysis, we develop and analyze several recommendations designed to ensure that the new system achieves its goals. Recommendations include government asset sales to fund transition costs, bond issuing, a reduction of the system’s replacement ratio, and an increase in the rate of return on pension assets. ...|$|R

If outpatient spending can be reimbursed from an NCMS <b>pooled</b> <b>account,</b> the incidence of CMP before a reimbursement and that after a reimbursement will be reduced. Higher nominal reimbursement rate for inpatient spending at provincial hospitals is correlated with higher incidence of CMP before a reimbursement.

40|$|How {{to improve}} cost {{allocation}} for reinforced steel bar (rebar) {{is an ongoing}} topic of debate among construction manufacturers and contractors. Traditionally, many fabrication shops have used a single overhead-cost <b>pool</b> <b>accounting</b> system.

In this case study, a single overhead-cost pool system is compared with the ABC method to demonstrate how ABC improves cost allocation and provides other benefits.
