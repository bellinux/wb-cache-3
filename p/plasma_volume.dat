5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E
25|$|The macula densa {{cause an}} {{increase}} in Na+ reabsorption, which causes water to follow in via osmosis and leads to an ultimate increase in <b>plasma</b> <b>volume.</b> Further, the macula densa releases adenosine which causes constriction of the afferent arterioles.|$|E
25|$|ADH binds to {{principal}} {{cells in}} the collecting duct that translocate aquaporins to the membrane, allowing water to leave the normally impermeable membrane and be reabsorbed into the body by the vasa recta, thus increasing the <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> of the body.|$|E
30|$|There were no {{significant}} differences in <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> or the physiological parameters analysed between any of the three groups at any time point. There was a significantly larger urine production in the single bolus dose group (200 mg/kg) compared to the sham group.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, further {{research}} {{along these lines}} demonstrated that further advances were possible by using external current-carrying coils to make the lines not just helical, but non-symmetric as well. This led {{to a series of}} experiments using C and D-shaped <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes..</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> were {{measured}} at baseline, at 3 h {{after the end}} of surgical preparation {{and at the end of}} the experiment another 3 h later. Blood samples for measurement of arterial pH, PCO 2, PO 2, lactate, haematocrit, sodium and potassium were taken at the same time points.|$|R
25|$|Finally, Liddle's Syndrome {{has been}} implicated with {{autosomal}} dominant activating mutations in the WW interaction motif in the β-(SCNNB_HUMA) and γ-(SCNNG_HUMA) subunits of the Epithelial sodium channel ENaC. These mutations abrogate the binding to the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, thereby inhibiting channel degradation and prolonging the half-life of ENaC, ultimately resulting in increased Na+ reabsorption, <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> extension and hypertension.|$|E
25|$|The second {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} {{takes place in}} human fluids. The body {{is made up of}} 60% water, much of it intra-vascular and inter-cellular. Within a few moments of entering a microgravity environment, fluid is immediately re-distributed to the upper body resulting in bulging neck veins, puffy face and sinus and nasal congestion which can last throughout the duration of the trip and is very much like the symptoms of the common cold. In space the autonomic reactions of the body to maintain blood pressure are not required and fluid is distributed more widely around the whole body. This results in a decrease in <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> of around 20%. These fluid shifts initiate a cascade of adaptive systemic effects that can be dangerous upon return to earth. Orthostatic intolerance results in astronauts returning to Earth after extended space missions being unable to stand unassisted for more than 10 minutes at a time without fainting. This {{is due in part to}} changes in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and the loss of <b>plasma</b> <b>volume.</b> Although this effect becomes worse the longer the time spent in space, as yet all individuals have returned to normal within at most a few weeks of landing.|$|E
25|$|This is characterised by a {{physical}} obstruction of the intestine, {{which can be}} due to impacted food material, stricture formation, or foreign bodies. The primary pathophysiological abnormality caused by this obstruction {{is related to the}} trapping of fluid within the intestine oral to the obstruction. This is due to the large amount of fluid produced in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and {{the fact that this is}} primarily re-absorbed in parts of the intestine downstream from the obstruction. The first problem with this degree of fluid loss from circulation is one of decreased <b>plasma</b> <b>volume,</b> leading to a reduced cardiac output, and acid-base disturbances.|$|E
30|$|Pigs were anesthetized and monitored. <b>Plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> were {{measured}} {{and the changes}} in hematocrit were, after corrected for the fluid gain and loss, used to estimate global plasma extravasation. One pre-nodal spleen lymph-vessel was cannulated. LPS was administered to induce sepsis. Lymph and plasma were studied to investigate the specific local reaction in spleen during control situation and sepsis.|$|R

25|$|Construction of the ITER Tokamak complex {{started in}} 2013 and the {{building}} costs are now over US$14 billion as of June 2015. The facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2021 and will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2025 with full deuterium–tritium fusion experiments starting in 2035. If ITER becomes operational, it will become the largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment in use with a <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> of 840 cubic meters, surpassing the Joint European Torus by almost a factor of 10. The first commercial demonstration fusion power station, named DEMO, is proposed to follow on from the ITER project.|$|E
25|$|Full acclimatization, however, {{requires}} days or even weeks. Gradually, {{the body}} compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days {{at any given}} altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as acetazolamide. Eventually, the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower lactate production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased <b>plasma</b> <b>volume,</b> increased hematocrit (polycythemia), increased RBC mass, a higher concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue, increased myoglobin, increased mitochondria, increased aerobic enzyme concentration, increase in 2,3-BPG, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery pressure increases {{in an effort to}} oxygenate more blood.|$|E
25|$|Large colon impactions {{typically}} {{occur at}} the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon, two areas where the lumen of the intestine narrows. Large colon impactions are most frequently seen in horses that have recently had a sudden decrease in exercise, such as after a musculoskeletal injury. They are also associated {{in the practice of}} twice daily feeding of grain meals, which causes a short-lived but significant secretion of fluid into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a 15% decrease in <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> (hypovolemia of the circulatory system) and the subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Aldosterone secretion activates absorption of fluid from the colon, decreasing the water content of the ingesta and increasing risk of impaction. Amitraz has also been associated with large colon impaction, due to alterations in motility and retention of intestinal contents, which causes further absorption of water and dehydration of ingesta. Other possible factors include poor dental care, course roughage, dehydration, and limited exercise.|$|E
40|$|Six {{patients}} {{are described in}} whom cerebral damage was associated with raised plasma sodium and chloride concentrations and with extremely low urinary outputs of sodium and chloride. The patients were not clinically dehydrated and direct determinations showed that the blood and <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes,</b> the endogenous creatinine clearance, and the urinary output of antidiuretic hormone were normal. For these and other reasons it is concluded that the metabolic picture results not from diminished circulatory volume, water deficiency, sodium deficiency, undetected diabetes insipidus or osmotic diuresis, but from the cerebral damage itself...|$|R

The turnover of IgG-I 131 {{has been studied}} in 10 cows, 5 of which were hyperimmunoglobulinemic, i. e. with serum immunoglobulin levels above 3. 0 gm/ 100 ml. These hyperimmunoglobulinemias were caused mainly by pyogenic infections. When these cows were compared with 5 normoimmunoglobulinemic cows the salient turnover data were, high fractional turnover rates, short plasma half lives, low Ev:Iv ratios and extended <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> (table I). The results are discussed in relation to similar findings in other animal species and man. Possible mechanisms of the observed hypercatabolism are outlined...|$|R
25|$|The {{ratio of}} {{testosterone}} to cortisol can both increase and decrease during resistance training, depending on intensity of exercise. A study comparing {{young and old}} subjects showed acute increases in GH and testosterone for both, although the latter increased less in older men. Testosterone rises in late hours of sleep after anaerobic exercise. Androgen receptor expression increases with acute exercise in correlation to free testosterone. When comparing {{men and women in}} the 30, 50 and 70 year age groups, young and middle aged men showed increased testosterone after exercise, with the latter also having increased cortisol. Elderly men showed no change. Other studies have also shown with age there is a downtrend of testosterone and attenuated growth hormone response. Young men have shown no acute change in testosterone with resistance training, with increase in cortisol and growth hormone depending on intensity. One study in young men showed testosterone acutely stable, with increase in GH and IGF-1. Similarly, a study showed testosterone did not increase in young men, women, and pubescent boys unaccustomed to weight training when corrected for <b>plasma</b> <b>volume.</b> Extreme intensity of strength training may trigger the stress response, resulting in lower testosterone levels, an effect accentuated by energy deprivation. A separate study comparing different ages, however, found no difference in acute testosterone and cortisol levels between groups, but attenuated growth hormone response in the elderly. Acutely, other studies have shown testosterone to increase. In a small group of anaerobically trained athletes, stressful training acutely even decreased serum testosterone and its ratio to cortisol and SHBG, with an increase in LH. With subsequent decompensation, testosterone was stable, but cortisol and SHBG decreased. Another case control showed with intense training followed by rest, testosterone dropped and LH increased initially.|$|E
2500|$|The {{centrifugation}} process itself has four variables {{that can be}} controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is [...] "sit time" [...] in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the RBC's at the bottom, the buffy coat of platelets and WBC's (lymphocytes/granulocytes, PMN's, basophils, eosinophils/monocytes) {{in the middle and}} the plasma on top.|$|E
2500|$|Dehydration refers both to hypohydration ({{dehydration}} induced {{prior to}} exercise) and to exercise-induced dehydration (dehydration that develops during exercise). The latter reduces aerobic endurance performance {{and results in}} increased body temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and possibly increased reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source. Although {{the negative effects of}} exercise-induced dehydration on exercise performance were clearly demonstrated in the 1940s, athletes continued to believe for years thereafter that fluid intake was not beneficial. More recently, negative effects on performance have been demonstrated with modest (<2%) dehydration, and these effects are exacerbated when the exercise is performed in a hot environment. The effects of hypohydration may vary, depending on whether it is induced through diuretics or sauna exposure, which substantially reduce <b>plasma</b> <b>volume,</b> or prior exercise, which has much less impact on <b>plasma</b> <b>volume.</b> Hypohydration reduces aerobic endurance, but its effects on muscle strength and endurance are not consistent and require further study. [...] Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by sweat-based thermoregulation. A male marathon runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower). People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine. This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35nbsp&°C) with minimal fluid intake causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper fluid intake, higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat.|$|E

During apheresis, target molecules are selectively removed while the plasma is reinfused into the patient. Hence, higher <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> can be processed than in therapeutic plasma exchange. Since no substitution fluid is required, the treatment is usually very well tolerated. TheraSorb Products may be helpful for the treatment of diseases associated with hypercholesterolemia, pathogenic immunoglobulins, and fibrinogen.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{fast and}} {{sensitive}} liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method {{was developed and}} validated for the simultaneous determination of acetaminophen (APAP) and its glucuronide and sulfate metabolites (APAP-GLU and APAP-SUL) in small <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes.</b> This method included a simple step of sample preparation and a chromatographic separation on an LC-MS-MS system equipped with an electrospray ionization source and a tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The analytes and internal standard, APAP deuterated analog, were separated on a C 18 column (3. 0 µm, 2. 1 × 100 mm), using aqueous 1 % formic acid and methanol (80 : 20, v/v) as the mobile phase. The LC-MS-MS method was validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, extraction efficiency, process efficiency and matrix effect. Calibration curves were obtained by fortifying drug-free plasma and ranges of linearity were set between 0. 25 - 20 mg/L. The mean correlation coefficients, r², were > 0. 99 for APAP and its metabolites. The inter-day and intra-day precision values were less than 11. 75 and 13. 03 %, respectively, at the lower limit of quantification concentration. The usability of the method was demonstrated by studying APAP metabolism in C 57 BL/ 6 J wild-type and obese ob/ob female mice, in which only small <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> were available. The results showed that APAP glucuronidation was enhanced in obese mice, suggesting that changes in APAP metabolism could modify its toxicity in obesity and related fatty liver disease...|$|R

2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) or indomethacin {{can be used to}} create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis.

40|$|The {{growing number}} {{and variety of}} fundamental, applied, and {{industrial}} uses for high intensity, high charge state ion beams {{continues to be the}} driving force behind efforts to develop Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion sources with superior performance characteristics. Incumbent with the advent of sub-micron electronic devices and their fabrication has been the demand for improved process control and optimization. These demands have {{led to the development of}} methods for cleaning, chemical etching, and deposition of thin films based on the use of plasma devices including ECR sources. Despite the steady advance in the technology, ECR plasma heating has not yet reached its full potential in terms of charge state and intensity within a particular charge state, in part, because of the narrow band width, single-frequency microwave radiation commonly used to heat the plasma electrons. This heating technique, coupled with conventional minimum-B configuration magnetic fields used for confining the electrons, resulting in the formation of the thin, ECR surfaces within the <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> of these sources. This report identifies fundamentally important methods for enhancing the performances of ECR plasma generators by transforming the ECR zones from surfaces to volumes. Two methods are readily available for increasing the sizes of these zones. These techniques include: (1) a tailored magnetic field configuration in combination with single-frequency microwave radiation to create a large uniformly distributed ECR volume and; (2) the use of broadband-frequency domain techniques derived from standard TWT technology, to transform the resonant plasma surfaces of traditional ECR ion sources into resonant <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective : The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor sitagliptin with respect to mode of inhibition and its in vivo duration of inhibition and efficacy in type 2 diabetes animal model. Materials and Methods : DPP-IV enzyme assay was carried out in human plasma (10 &# 956;L) or human recombinant enzyme (10 ng) using H-Gly-Pro-AMC as a substrate. The competitive nature was estimated by plotting IC 50 values measured at different substrate concentrations on the Y axis and substrate concentration on the X axis. The tight binding nature was estimated by plotting IC 50 values measured at different <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> on the Y axis and <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> on the X axis. Fast binding kinetics was assessed by progressive curves at different inhibitor concentrations in the DPP-IV assay. The reversibility of the inhibitor was assessed by a dissociation study of the DPP-IV-sitagliptin complex. Durations of DPP-IV inhibition and efficacy were shown in ob/ob mice dosed at 10 mg/kg, p. o. Results : Sitagliptin is a competitive, reversible, fast and tight binding DPP-IV inhibitor. In ob/ob mice, 10 mg/kg, (p. o.) showed a long duration of inhibition of > 70 &#x 0025; at 8 h. The duration was translated into long duration of efficacy (~ 35 &#x 0025; glucose excursion at 8 h) in the same model and the effect was comparable to vildagliptin. Conclusion : The DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin behaves as a competitive, tight, and fast binding inhibitor. Sitagliptin differs mechanistically from vildagliptin and exhibits comparable efficacy to that of latter. The finding may give an understanding to develop-second generation DPP-IV inhibitors with desired kinetic profiles...|$|R

One of the reasons for this is the lack of a specific and sensitive assay suitable for small <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes.</b> Therefore the authors aimed to improve an existing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay by changing the solid-phase extraction material and by using a more sensitive and controlled electrochemical detector. An on-line solid-phase extraction was used with a preconcentration column of 10. 3 min ID containing octadecyl silane (ODS) reversed-phase material and an analytical microsphere C 18 column. The mobile phase was unchanged and consisted of 35 % phosphate buffer 0. 02 mol (pH 7. 00 +/- 0. 10), 50 % methanol, and 15 % acetonitrile. Detection was performed with a new electrochemical detector. This detector comprised a highly stable Faraday-shielded oven compartment that accommodated a column and flowcell. The flowcell had a spacer thickness of 0. 25 mum set at 830 mV. It also had an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, which resulted in very sensitive electrochemical analysis. These improvements resulted in a lower required sample volume of only 0. 3 mL instead of 1. 2 mL plasma with a very low Emit of quantitation of 0. 483 mug/L according to good laboratory practice (GLP) rules. The intraday coefficients of variation were 6. 2 % (0. 483 mug/L) and 4. 2 % (18. 4 mug/L). The interday coefficients of variation were 10. 3 % (0. 483 mug/L) and 8. 5 % (18. 4 mug/L) ...|$|R
40|$|Cryofiltration is a {{technique}} in which plasma is separated from blood and chilled, leading {{to the formation of}} “cryogel”, a composite of heparin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, immunoglobulins, and other proteins. This is retained by further filtration and plasma is returned to the patient. There may be a role for cryofiltration in the treatment of cryoglobulinemia or where the application of other forms of plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption is limited. Five patients received six courses of cryofiltration. Two patients had cryoglobulinemia and three were treated before HLA antibody-incompatible renal transplantation. The treatment was associated with few adverse effects, and it was possible to treat up to 120 mL/kg plasma per session. There was a good clinical response in four patients. One patient was switched back to double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) because cryofiltration seemed to remove HLA antibodies less effectively, but the other two transplants have excellent function. In the cryoglobulinemia patients there was excellent clearance of cryoglobulins during each treatment (mean decrease of 78. 2 (SD 14. 1) % per treatment). Compared with DFPP, fewer immunoglobulins were removed and the mean percentage reductions in immunoglobulin G per treatment were 36. 0 (4. 0) % for cryoglobulinemia and 59. 2 (2. 5) % for DFPP (P < 0. 01), with respective mean <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> of 64. 2 (10. 3) and 71. 1 (6. 8) mL/kg treated.

The GH standards ranging from 20 pg/well/ 100 L to 5000 pg/well/ 100 L were prepared in charcoal-stripped hormone free yak plasma. The sensitivity of EIA procedure was 20 pg/well GH, which corresponds to 0. 2 ng/ml plasma. 50 % relative binding sensitivity was seen at 320 pg/well/ 100 L. <b>Plasma</b> <b>volumes</b> for the EIA viz. 25 L, 50 L and 100 L did not influence the shape of standard curve even though a slight drop in the OD 450 was seen with higher <b>plasma</b> <b>volumes.</b> GH estimated from serial dilutions of yak plasma exhibited good parallelism with bovine GH standard curve, which indicated that the GH from the two species was homologous.
