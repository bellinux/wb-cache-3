We walked up the middle of the <b>principal</b> <b>street,</b> and these vermin {{surrounded}} us on all sides, and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street.|$|E

O'Connell admired Latin American liberator Simón Bolívar, {{and one of his}} sons, Morgan O'Connell, was a volunteer officer in Bolívar's army in 1820, aged 15. The <b>principal</b> <b>street</b> in the centre of Dublin, previously called Sackville Street, was renamed O'Connell Street in his honour in the early 20th century after the Irish Free State came into being.

2500|$|The High Street was the {{familiar}} {{name of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>street</b> in nearly every English town at the time Philadelphia was founded. But if Philadelphia was indebted to England {{for the name of}} High Street, nearly every American town is, in turn, indebted to Philadelphia for its Market Street. Long before the city was laid out or settled, Philadelphia's founder, William Penn, had planned that markets would be held regularly on the [...] wide High Street. The city's first market stalls were situated {{in the center of the}} thoroughfare starting at Front Street and proceeding west eventually to 8th Street. The stalls soon became covered and were not taken down as planned. Later, additional covered sheds appeared west of Center Square as the city expanded westward. The street began to be called Market Street around 1800. The road's new name was made official by an ordinance of 1858, coincidentally, just a year before the market sheds were ordered removed.|$|E
2500|$|Hardly {{less than}} ten {{thousand}} persons were on Main street, between 8th and 14th, at one time.

Bonfires were lighted at nearly every corner of every <b>principal</b> <b>street</b> in the city, and the light of beacon fires could be seen burning on Union and Church Hills. The effect of the illumination was grand and imposing. The triumph of truth and justice over wrong and attempted insult was never more heartily appreciated by a spontaneous uprising of the people. Soon the Southern wind will sweep away with the resistless force of a tornado, all vestige of sympathy or desire of co-operation with a tyrant who, under false pretences, {{in the name of a}} once glorious, but now broken and destroyed Union, attempts to rivet on us the chains of a despicable and ignoble vassalage.

2500|$|The New Town was an 18th-century {{solution}} to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a [...] "New Town" [...] was won by James Craig, a 27-year-old architect. The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with Enlightenment ideas of rationality. The <b>principal</b> <b>street</b> is George Street, running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the [...] "Old Town". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh's main shopping street and now has few of its original Georgian buildings. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by St Andrew Square and Charlotte Square respectively. The latter, designed by Robert Adam, influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century. Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland, is on the north side of Charlotte Square.|$|E
2500|$|Willow Bunch {{held its}} festivities to {{celebrate}} Saskatchewan Day on August 2 and 3, 1980 by inviting former and current citizens {{to attend a}} weekend of celebration of the historic town and its people. The first day of celebrations started with a pancake breakfast {{and then there was}} the parade of locally designed and commercial floats around the town. The parade procession began at the Community Rink on St. Louis Avenue to Willow Bunch Street, Broad Avenue, <b>Principal</b> <b>Street</b> and then finally down St. Catherine Street which meets St. Louis Avenue. The first prize for float went to the Willow Bunch Kinsmen and Kettle and second prize was a tie between the Willow Bunch Manoir Hotel and the Kirby Family entry from Coronach. An art display featuring Rosetown Painting and Photography was presented at the Willow Bunch School. Day one of the activities also included pony rides for children, ball games for adults and youngsters, an afternoon tea at the Senior Center, a barbecue dinner at the skating rink and then to end the day there was a dance with music by The Big Muddy Ramblers. On the second day, celebrations included church services, a golf tournament and games for kids at Jean Louis Légaré Park, ice-cream and lemonade at the park, tours of the Willow Bunch Museum, an award presentation for family heritage and a horse shoe tournament.

2500|$|On 4 August 1892, the {{proposal}} was put that a new church be constructed, {{in front of the}} existing one, at a proposed cost of £5,100, with the erection of an adjoining suite of offices to fund the building of the church. This was accepted and Trinity Church was dedicated in December 1893 and opened in 1894. The plans and specifications were prepared by Henry Trigg and the contractors were Bunning Brothers at a contract price of £6,100 pounds. The design for the new church provided accommodation for 750 people on the ground floor and for 100 in the galleries. Additional funds of £500 were budgeted for furnishings, and £500 for an organ. The new building was designed for the minister's voice to be heard from every part of it. The church was to have been furnished with chairs, but owing to the slope in the floor, locally crafted pews were substituted. The foundation stone for Trinity Church was laid by Governor William Robson on 22 March 1893. Dr Bevan from the Collins Street Congregational Church, Melbourne came to Perth to conduct the opening services. The ceremony was attended by Sir John and Lady Forrest, Sir James Lee Steere, Alexander Forrest (Mayor of Perth) and a crowd of the leading citizens of Perth and Fremantle. John Forrest proclaimed that such [...] "..a magnificent building would be an ornament to the <b>principal</b> <b>street</b> of the city. Such an undertaking showed that the people were progressing materially and morally and that progress was the order of the day." ...|$|E
