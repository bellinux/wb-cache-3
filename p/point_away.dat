The principal eyes are also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing them to move the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary eyes are immobile.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012–13 Iraqi Premier League, {{under the}} {{management}} of Nazar Ashraf, Al-Talaba returned to their poor performance of the 2010–11 season, finishing in the 14th place with 35 points, only one <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from relegation, with only nine wins, eight draws, and 17 losses. They saved the club from being relegated in the 33rd round against Al-Naft where they won 2–1 and also because of Al-Kahraba's loss to Zakho in the last round. Al-Talaba passed the round of 32 of the 2012–13 Iraq FA Cup where they were up against Al-Zawra'a, drawing 0–0 in the first leg and winning 3–1 in the second leg before the tournament was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Bergkamp {{made his}} debut against Reggiana on 29 August 1993 at the San Siro in a 2–1 victory. He scored his first {{goal for the}} club against Cremonese in September 1993 but had a {{difficult}} time against the highly organised and resolute Italian defences, scoring a further seven goals in the league. This was partly due to manager Osvaldo Bagnoli's inability to find a stable forward partnership, preferring Bergkamp in a three with Rubén Sosa and Salvatore Schillaci. Inter's poor league form culminated in the sacking of Bagnoli in February 1994 and his replacement by Gianpiero Marini, a member of Italy's 1982 FIFA World Cup-winning squad. The club finished 13th in Serie A, one <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from relegation, but enjoyed success in the UEFA Cup, beating Austria Salzburg in the final over two legs. Bergkamp was the competition's joint top goalscorer with eight goals and scored a hat-trick against Rapid București in the first round.|$|E

5|$|With Yahya Alwan {{as their}} manager, Al-Talaba {{had one of}} the worst seasons in their history in the 2010–11 Iraqi Premier League, {{finishing}} the season in eighth place of the Southern group with 38 points, only one <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from relegation, with nine wins, eleven draws, and six losses. In the 2011 AFC Cup, Al-Talaba finished in third place in their group with five points, having won one match, drew two, and lost three, therefore they were knocked out at the group stage. In the 2011–12 Iraqi Premier League, Al-Talaba with Jamal Ali, Khalaf Hassan, and Karim Salman as their consecutive managers, finished the season in fourth place with 68 points, winning in 19 matches, drawing in 11, and losing in eight.|$|E
5|$|A trip to The Dell on 3 October {{was taken}} with caution given United's return from Munich in the Champions League and winless record at the ground. The team lost to Southampton {{in each of}} their last three visits, {{including}} a 6–3 mauling in 1996. Despite dominating possession and clear-cut chances in the previous season’s fixture, United lost by a single goal leaving Ferguson to question when, not if he would eventually break the jinx. Andy Cole was paired with Yorke {{for only the second}} time this season, a tactic that paid off as both got on the score sheet. Substitute Jordi Cruyff added a third in the 75th minute to move United into second place in the table, four points behind leaders Aston Villa going into the international break. Raimond van der Gouw who deputised for injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel at Southampton featured again at home to Wimbledon, a match that Manchester United won 5–1, the biggest win of the season at Old Trafford. Ryan Giggs, Beckham, Yorke and Cole (twice) all scored; Ferguson in particular hailed the contribution of 19-year-old defender Wes Brown. United earned a <b>point</b> <b>away</b> at Derby County on 24 October, and deservedly beat Everton 4–1 at Goodison Park on Halloween to cut the gap at the top to just a point.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980–81 season, Al-Talaba {{won their}} first ever league title after tying with Al-Shorta on both points and goal {{difference}} in the end where the Iraq Football Association declared Al-Talaba as champions due to them having more wins than Al-Shorta, even though Al-Shorta had scored more goals. Hussein Saeed was the top goalscorer of the league with 11 goals in 11 matches out of Al-Talaba's total 19 goals. In the cup, Al-Talaba reached the final {{for the second time}} in the row and came up against Al-Zawra'a and lost again in the final 1–0. In the 1981–82 season, Al-Talaba retained their league title, sitting in 1st at 34 points with Saeed being the second top goalscorer of the league with 11 goals, along with Al-Amana's Ghazi Hashim and behind Al-Zawra'a's Thamer Yousif. They reached the cup final for the third time in the row and lost to Al-Zawra'a again 2–1. The next season, Saeed continued his battle for the top goalscorer in which he scored 17 goals surpassing his teammate, Rahim Hameed, with 8 goals. Al-Talaba finished in 2nd place with one <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from the champions, Salahaddin.|$|E

In the following 1987-88 season, the team again dropped down. Coach Serra Ferrer was replaced by Frenchman Lucien Müller, who could not avoid relegation away to Oviedo.|$|E
25|$|Radulov {{delivered}} {{an incredible}} {{performance in the}} Remparts' 2006 Memorial Cup championship game victory over the Moncton Wildcats. In the 6–2 win, he netted two goals and assisted on three more, totaling five points, one <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from tying the all-time record in a Memorial Cup final. He registered nine points (five goals and four assists) in four games and won the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the tournament MVP.|$|E
25|$|He {{improved}} the training regime, introducing ballwork to training sessions, a practice rare in England at the time; the youth and scouting systems begun by his predecessor were extended and he abandoned the club's old recruiting policy of signing often unreliable stars, opting instead for lesser known but more reliable {{players from the}} lower divisions. He also urged the club's fans to be more partisan and to get behind the team. Drake's early years were unpromising, as Chelsea finished 19th and just a <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from relegation {{in his first season}} and 8th in his second.|$|E

25|$|Hull KR made {{significant}} changes to their squad for the 2008 season, which saw eleven new players brought in {{and a number}} of players released or sold. On 2 May the club announced that former captain James Webster had been released from the final six months of his contract due to a three to four-month lay off with a shoulder injury. He was replaced by new signing Michael Dobson, who was formerly a target of Hull. Canberra Raiders scrum half took squad number 26, and made his début against Harlequins RL on 25 May, scoring two tries. Rovers finished one <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from a play-off place.|$|E
25|$|Like Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, Saturn's {{is created}} by a fluid dynamo within a layer of circulating liquid metallic hydrogen in its outer core. Like Earth, Saturn's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. On Saturn, like on Jupiter, the north magnetic pole is located in the northern hemisphere, and the south magnetic pole lies in the southern hemisphere, so that magnetic field lines <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from the north pole and towards the south pole. This is reversed compared to the Earth, where the north magnetic pole lies in the southern hemisphere. Saturn's magnetic field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are much weaker than the dipole.|$|E

25|$|After the sacking of Mourinho, Guus Hiddink {{was named}} {{caretaker}} {{manager for the}} remainder of the 2015–16 season. The team went 12 consecutive matches without a loss following the sacking of Mourinho, winning six and drawing six. This streak ended on 16 February 2016 after Chelsea lost to Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16. Chelsea then lost the second leg of the round of 16, losing 2–1 at home thus being knocked out of the competition on 9 March. This was followed by an elimination from the FA Cup on 12 March after a 2–0 loss to Everton. League form improved, however, with Chelsea rising from 16th, one <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from relegation, to eighth place after an incredible fightback after going 1–0 down to win 1–2 away against Southampton.|$|E
25|$|The Crawford rule, {{named after}} John R. Crawford, is {{designed}} to make match play more equitable for the player in the lead. If a player is one <b>point</b> <b>away</b> from winning a match, that player's opponent will always want to double {{as early as possible}} in order to catch up. Whether the game is worth one point or two, the trailing player must win to continue the match. To balance the situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player first reaches a score one point short of winning, neither player may use the doubling cube for the following game, called the Crawford game. After the Crawford game, normal use of the doubling cube resumes. The Crawford rule is routinely used in tournament match play. It is possible for a Crawford game never to occur in a match.|$|E
25|$|The Irish FA, {{along with}} the other Home Nations, rejoined FIFA to compete in the World Cup; the 1949–50 British Home Championship was used as the {{qualifying}} group. Ireland hosted the first ever world cup qualifier in which a home nation side competed, losing 2–8 to Scotland in Belfast, and eventually finishing bottom of the group only managing to take a <b>point,</b> <b>away</b> to Wales. During the match against Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, the IFA fielded an all-Ireland team for the last time. The team included four players– Tom Aherne, Reg Ryan, Davy Walsh and the captain Con Martin– who were born in the Irish Free State, and all four of whom had previously played for the FAI international team in their qualifiers and as a result had played for two different associations in the same FIFA World Cup tournament.|$|E
