Merit Network awarded the contract to Livingston Enterprises that delivered their PortMaster series of Network Access Servers and the initial RADIUS server to Merit. RADIUS was later (1997) published as RFC 2058 and RFC 2059 (current versions are RFC 2865 and RFC 2866).|$|R

The VAX MS-DOS connection is a cost-effective way to combine the benefits of remote access and multiple simultaneous use. From the user's perspective, CDLink provides free, twenty-four-hour remote access to databases in a friendly, menu-driven environment.

In case {{there is only one}} or just a few network devices, some of them provide AUX ports making it possible to connect a dial-in modem for direct CLI access. The mentioned terminal server can often be accessed via a separate network that does not use managed switches and routers for a connection to the central site, and/or it has a modem connected via <b>dial-in</b> <b>access</b> through POTS or ISDN.|$|R

Like the cc:Mail desktop application, all of these can access the post office via the file-sharing facility of the local area network. However, some administrative functions required exclusive access to the post office, so post offices would be taken offline periodically for necessary maintenance (such as recovering disk space from deleted messages).|$|R

50|$|The first <b>public</b> <b>dial-in</b> {{networks}} used asynchronous TTY terminal protocols {{to reach}} a concentrator operated in the public network. Some networks, such as CompuServe, used X.25 to multiplex the terminal sessions into their packet-switched backbones, while others, such as Tymnet, used proprietary protocols. In 1979, CompuServe became the first service to offer electronic mail capabilities and technical support to personal computer users. The company broke new ground again in 1980 as the first to offer real-time chat with its CB Simulator. Other major dial-in networks were America Online (AOL) and Prodigy that also provided communications, content, and entertainment features. Many bulletin board system (BBS) networks also provided on-line access, such as FidoNet which was popular amongst hobbyist computer users, many of them hackers and amateur radio operators.|$|R

40|$|Gradual {{vascular}} <b>access</b> <b>port</b> or tunneled {{central venous catheter}} occlusion during total {{parenteral nutrition}} is a common complication of unknown etiology, usually unresponsive to treatment with urokinase, ethanol, or hydrochloric acid. After establishing safety with regard to catheter materials and efficacy in dissolving the occluding substance in vitro, we treated a total of 13 vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> (10 patients) that had occluded gradually during "three-in-one" total parental nutrition by slow perfusion with 10 to 20 mL of 0. 1 mmol/mL sodium hydroxide solution. We found a mean increase in flow (results are flow rates under gravity-dependent vascular <b>access</b> <b>port</b> inlet pressure of 1. 5 kPa) from 37 microL/s (95 % upper confidence limit, 45 microL/s) to 75 microL/s (95 % lower confidence limit, 64 microL/s; p <. 001). For normal use, a flow of 50 microL/s is sufficient. There were no side effects. Five vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> remained in excellent function during a follow-up period of 9 months.

40|$|Guidelines and {{clinical}} practice recommendations vary on {{the management of}} vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports.</b> Traditionally, patient, health system and healthcare professional's factors have been interrelated in studies of clinical practice variability. Understanding variation {{in the management of}} vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> and to identify the influence of these factors in the compliance with the most common recommendations of vascular access guidelines, is an important first step for designing targeted improvement interventions. We analysed data from a survey sent to all Spanish outpatient clinics. Overall, 185 units at Spanish outpatients clinics {{out of a total of}} 256 completed the survey. Geographical region and unit size are the most common associated factors in the management of vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> and there is a low level of compliance with many of the recommendations given by guidelines. Large outpatient chemotherapy units have been related to higher monitoring of the recommendations. Clinical practice and provided care to patients with vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> are influenced by region and structural and organisational differences in the outpatient chemotherapy units. It is important to identify additional factors that may explain the variability...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{distributed}} {{dynamic resource allocation}} (DRA) algorithm for the downlink of a SDMA broadband wireless packet network with multiple <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> and adaptive antennas. With the new scheme, each <b>access</b> <b>port</b> (AP) independently preallocates some beamforming s toward the most interfered users of the neighbor APs and broadcasts this information to the other APs. Then all APs independently and distributedly perform the allocation of their users using the distributed max-min fit (DMMF) scheme. Simulation results show a significant improvement over the DMMF without s preallocation and a significantly reduced gap between the DMMF and the centralized max-min fit (CMMF) algorithm, which performs the allocation by fully coordinating all the <b>access</b> <b>ports.</b> As a baseline case, {{the performance of a}} random slot allocation algorithm is also reported...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture for enabling communication between two systems that cannot ordinarily establish communication with each other, because Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls interfere. Called the Meet-Me Service, our {{solution to the}} NAT/firewall problem is generic, lightweight and secure. While it can be implemented as a standalone service, we propose a few changes to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to make SIP NAT and firewall friendly. SIP is gaining acceptance in the Internet community and currently requires that firewalls and NATs are aware of and support SIP services. We provide a simple solution to getting around firewalls and NATs that are not SIP-aware. Our Meet-Me Service provides an alternative to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and <b>dial-in</b> <b>access.</b> It supports general communication services including TCP and UDP data services {{as well as the}} more typical voice and video services supported by SIP...|$|R

40|$|Operating systems {{traditionally}} {{handle the}} task scheduling {{of one or}} more application instances on processor-like hardware architectures. RAMPSoC, a novel runtime adaptive multiprocessor System-on-Chip, exploits the dynamic reconfiguration on FPGAs to generate, start and terminate hardware and software tasks. The hardware tasks have to be transferred to the reconfigurable hardware via a configuration <b>access</b> <b>port.</b> The software tasks can be loaded into the local memory of the respective IP core either via the configuration <b>access</b> <b>port</b> or via the on-chip communication infrastructure (e. g. a Network-on-Chip). Recent-series of Xilinx FPGAs, such as Virtex- 5, provide two Internal Configuration <b>Access</b> <b>Ports,</b> which cannot be accessed simultaneously. To prevent conflicts, the <b>access</b> to these <b>ports</b> as well as the hardware resource management needs to be controlled, e. g. by a special-purpose operating system running on an embedded processor. For that purpose and to handle the relations between temporally and spatially scheduled operations, the novel approach of an operating system is of high importance. This special purpose operating system, called CAP-OS (Configuration Access Port-Operating System), which will be presented in this paper, supports the clients using the configuration port with the services of priority-based access scheduling, hardware task mapping and resource management...|$|R
