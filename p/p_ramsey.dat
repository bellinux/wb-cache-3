Ramsey showed that that any ∃⋆∀⋆ sentence Φ, when satisfied in a structure whose domain’s cardinality exceeds a specific threshold r(Φ), must admit models of every integer cardinality larger than r(Φ). We present two translations Φ → Φ ̇ and Φ → Φσ of ∃⋆∀⋆ sentences from pure logic to well-founded Set Theory and we prove that if Φ ̇ holds for sets, then Φ is satisfiable. Moreover, if Φσ holds, then Φ has a model whose cardinality exceeds r(Φ). A distinctive feature of our reduction is that Φ ̇ and Φσ are ∃⋆∀⋆ sentences whose sizes are polynomially related to the size of Φ. Our main result makes use of the fact that ∃⋆∀⋆ sentences, even though constituting a decidable fragment of Set Theory, offer ways to describe infinite sets. Such possibility is exploited to glue together infinitely many models of increasing cardinality of a given ∃⋆∀⋆ logical formula, within a single pair of infinite sets...|$|R
40|$|In general, F. <b>P.</b> <b>Ramsey’s</b> view on {{truth is}} said to have a {{deflationist}} tendency. But there can hardly be said to be consensus on (1) in what sense his view deflates the conception of truth, (2) what implications this kind of view has in the context of his whole philosophy, especially with regards to his theory of belief and judgement. This paper concerns these questions, arguing as follows, that in regard to the first question, what Ramsey says about truth, while surely leaving no room for accepting ontological or epistemological characterizations of the concept and thus having to be read as a sort of deflationism, is to be understood, not as the strong “redundancy” theory normally attributed to him, but rather as a moderate version of deflationism, similar to Horwich’s minimalism or Field’s deflationary theory. That is to say, Ramsey is not one of those who asserts that truth-predicate itself has no meaning and truth is not a property, but who indeed admits that truth is a property, a syntactic or ‘logical’ property. And, with regard to the second question, the relation between his pragmatic theory of judgement or belief and his deflationary theory of truth supports this kind of moderate interpretation. Moreover, the paper argues that today’s “success semantics” is, though often attributed to Ramsey, not intended by himself. ...|$|R

40|$|Epistemic Dexterity: A Ramseyian Account of Epistemic Virtue” by Abrol Fairweather 2 ̆ 6 Carlos Montemayor: A {{modification}} of F. <b>P.</b> <b>Ramsey’s</b> success semantics supports a naturalized theory of epistemic virtue that includes motivational components and can potentially explain both epistemic reliability and responsibility {{with a single}} normative-explanatory principle. An “epistemic Ramsey success” will also provide a better account of the “because of” condition central to virtue-reliabilist accounts of knowledge from Greco, Sosa and Pritchard. Ramsey said that the truth condition of a belief is the condition that guarantees the success of desires based on that belief. Taken as a theory of epistemic achievements, the truth condition for the attribution of an epistemic achievement is the condition that guarantees the success of epistemic desires and is also a success based on abilities attributable to the agent. One of its major advantages {{is that it may}} {{be the best way to}} achieve a naturalistic version of the etiologcal requirement on knowledge in virtue epistemology while also supporting important responsibilist desiderata. The account defended is robustly agent-centered in the straightforward sense that individual desires are partly constitutive of epistemic successes like having a rational belief, justified belief, and even of knowledge once we see the both the reliabilist and repsonsibilist desiderata are met. Another important aspect of the paper is that it provides a plausible psychology for virtue epistemology that is grounded in important empirical findings on agency, and thus constitutes a form of naturalized virtue epistemolog...|$|R

2500|$|According to the {{redundancy}} {{theory of}} truth, asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. [...] For example, making {{the assertion that}} [...] "'Snow is white' is true" [...] is equivalent to asserting [...] "Snow is white". [...] Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. [...] This theory is commonly attributed to Frank <b>P.</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> who held {{that the use of}} words like fact and truth was nothing but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a [...] "linguistic muddle".|$|E
2500|$|The {{differences}} between these interpretations are rather small, and may seem inconsequential. One of the main points of disagreement lies in the relation between probability and belief. [...] Logical probabilities are conceived (for example in Keynes' Treatise on Probability) to be objective, logical relations between propositions (or sentences), and hence not to depend in any way upon belief. [...] They are degrees of (partial) entailment, or degrees of logical consequence, not degrees of belief. [...] (They do, nevertheless, dictate proper degrees of belief, as is discussed below.) [...] Frank <b>P.</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> on the other hand, was skeptical {{about the existence of}} such objective logical relations and argued that (evidential) probability is [...] "the logic of partial belief". (p 157) [...] In other words, Ramsey held that epistemic probabilities simply are degrees of rational belief, rather than being logical relations that merely constrain degrees of rational belief.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} contribution to philosophy of language is Russell's theory of descriptions, set out in On Denoting (Mind, 1905). Frank <b>P.</b> <b>Ramsey</b> described this paper as [...] "a paradigm of philosophy." [...] The theory considers the sentence [...] "The present King of France is bald" [...] and whether the proposition is false or meaningless. Frege had argued, employing his distinction between sense and reference, that such sentences were meaningful but neither true nor false. [...] Russell argues that the grammatical form of the sentence disguises its underlying logical form. [...] Russell's Theory of Definite Descriptions enables the sentence to be construed as meaningful but false, without commitment {{to the existence of}} any present King of France. This addresses a paradox of great antiquity (e.g. [...] "That which is not must in some sense be. Otherwise, how could we say of it that it is not?" [...] etc.), going back {{at least as far as}} Parmenides. [...] In Russell's own time, Meinong held the view of that which is not being in some sense real; and Russell held this view prior to On Denoting.|$|E

The Paternalistic Relationship: Authenticity and credibility {{as a source of}} healthy relationships. Paper presented at the 2010 International Conference of Organizational Innovation, Bangkok, August 4 - 6. Paternalistic Leadership (PL) is characterised by a patriarchal and hierarchical authoritarian style of management. It is strongly characterised by absolute guidance, the protection of subordinates, harmony building and moral leadership. This thesis sets out a framework of enquiry that comprehensively answers the following three important questions. First, to what extent is Indonesian leadership paternalistic? Second, how is the leader-employee relationship constructed in Indonesia? Finally, to what extent is this relationship influenced by Javanese culture? Javanese is Indonesia’s dominant ethnicity and culture in the sociopolitical arena, colouring the socio-economic and political climate and affecting the way people perceive “leadership”. Generally speaking, Indonesia’s leadership and governmental style is paternalistic. For this study, the total population of civil servants was invited to answer a survey about their perceptions on leaders-leadership style, and eight hundred and seven (81 %) respondents responded. The research study was {{based on the assumption that}} current “topdown” leadership should be augmented by a more complex view of leadership as relationship. The study was operationalised within the concept of Paternalistic leadership described by Cheng et al. ’s (2004) 10 variables, which were validated using explanatory factor analysis. Additionally, the construction of relationship between leaders and employees was examined by relating employee demographic characteristics to Paternalistic leadership. Survey questionnaires were sent to civil servants in two provinces and returned directly to the researcher. Data analysis methods included descriptive statistics to examine how the respondents answered questions, explanatory factor analysis to examine suitability of paternalistic leadership, and one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine how the respondents’ demographic information correspondents to Paternalistic leadership Study results show that civil servants agree that leaders demonstrate Paternalistic leadership. Instead of Cheng et al ‘s (2004) 10 leadership factors, this study confirms that seven leadership styles are important aspects, highlighting “visible leadership” as the most important. Further, the most significant effect of employee demographic information to Paternalistic leadership is found in Visible leadership. Two-way ANOVA analysis suggest that Indonesian civil servants expect to “ride on the coattails” of their superiors. These results, supplemented by the literature, suggest that there should be an emphasis on the synergistic nature of the relationship between leaders and employees. It is also strongly recommended that further research replicate this study in other Indonesian provinces. Confirmation factor analysis and others variable measuring leaders-employees relationship in similar future research was also recommended...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{replacement}} of Neanderthal by anatomically and behaviorally modern populations in Europe is currently a topic of lively debate in human evolution. In an earlier paper [Gravina B, Mellars <b>P,</b> Bronk <b>Ramsey</b> C (2005) Nature 483 : 51 – 56], we published a series of radiocarbon accelerator mass spectrometer measurements for the site of Châtelperron in central France, which had been claimed to show a clear “interstratification” of successive levels of Neanderthal and modern human occupation, {{on the basis of}} excavations carried out by Henri Delporte in the 1950 s. This interpretation has recently been challenged by Zilhão and colleagues [Zilhão J, d'Errico F, Bordes J-G, Lenoble A, Texier J-P, Rigaud J-P (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103 : 12643 – 12648], who suggest that the deposits excavated in the 1950 s consisted largely, if not entirely, of the unstratified “backdirt” of the earlier, 19 th century excavations on the site. We show here that the excavation backdirt interpretation for the Châtelperron stratigraphy can be refuted from many different aspects of the stratigraphic, radiocarbon, and archaeological evidence. We reassess the significance of this site for current models of the coexistence and interactions between Neanderthal and anatomically modern populations in western Europe...|$|R

In experiments in south-eastern Australia, canola cultivars inoculated after the three to five leaf growth stage did not develop stem canker. Although mature canola plants are known to be less susceptible to blackleg than seedlings, this highlights {{for the first time the}} specific importance of protecting seedlings up to the three to five leaf growth stage in Australia. This would typically correspond to a period of four to six weeks after emergence. Canola plants are likely to be significantly less vulnerable to infection after this growth stage.
