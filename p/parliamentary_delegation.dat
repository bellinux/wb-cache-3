5|$|Bruxner detested the UAP Deputy Leader and Minister for Public Works and Local Government, Eric Spooner, whom Bruxner saw {{as trying}} to {{undermine}} confidence in Steven's leadership and reducing Country Party influence in the government. When Stevens went {{on a visit to}} London in March 1936 for six months until October, Bruxner became Acting Premier, with Spooner as Acting Deputy. The animosity between the two became most pronounced at this time, often over the most petty issues. In May 1937, Bruxner visited the United Kingdom {{as a member of the}} NSW <b>parliamentary</b> <b>delegation</b> to the coronation of King George VI. At the March 1938 election, the Stevens-Bruxner government retained power against Lang and the still-divided Labor Party. Bruxner was re-elected with 61% of the vote. Bruxner worked with his long-time friend, now Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish a regional tertiary education institution. After the 1938 election, they moved to establish the New England University College, a constituent college of the University of Sydney in the city of Armidale, and Bruxner was appointed to the first Advisory Council, on which he served until 1951.|$|E

25|$|Blažić {{received}} the twenty-fifth {{position on the}} Radical Party's electoral list for the 2000 Serbian parliamentary election, in which the entire country was counted as a single constituency. The party won twenty-three seats, and Blažić was included in its <b>parliamentary</b> <b>delegation.</b> (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order.) He {{received the}} twenty-ninth position on the Radical Party's list in the 2003 election and was again included in its delegation in the parliament that followed. The Radical Party remained in opposition throughout this period.|$|E
25|$|Visiting {{politicians}} and senior bureaucrats from South Asian countries {{are known to}} lack basic sense of social decorum and diplomatic finesse while on official representation. Lack of preparation in diplomatic protocol, cultural norms, culinary skills and restroom etiquette makes them prone to committing faux-pas to the embarrassment of their hosts, muted helplessness of embassy staff and amusement of the press-corps. Chinese officials are known {{to pay attention to}} their outward appearance and practice their roles/actions which are carefully choreographed before-hand to the minutest detail. In June 2015, an Indian <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>delegation</b> invited to the European Parliament in Brussels included a delegate who wore sports shoes to a meeting with the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz.|$|E

25|$|Hughes-Young {{served as}} Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State, Board of Trade for some months in 1956. Harold Macmillan {{appointed}} Hughes-Young as an Assistant Whip {{when he became}} Prime Minister in January 1957. This silenced him in the Chamber of the House of Commons (because whips {{were not supposed to}} speak), although it was an unpaid post. In 1958 he was part of a <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>delegation</b> to the United States. He was also a member of a team of Ministers who went round the country making speeches in support of the government in September 1958.

When, six weeks later, Hore-Belisha resigned from his post, Wickham also left his position in the War Office. He was appointed to another Parliamentary Private Secretary role in June 1940, assisting Victor Warrender, the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. Eight months later, he once took on the role under the Secretary of State for War, this time David Margesson.

500|$|Later, the SPD defence policy expert [...] and Helmut Schmidt, {{a member}} of SPD <b>parliamentary</b> <b>delegation</b> and a future Chancellor of West Germany, handled the {{relationship}} with HIAG. They maintained close contact, attending private and public meetings and keeping regular correspondence. They often admonished HIAG leadership for the membership's [...] "undemocratic" [...] ways, but these efforts at reforming the veterans were futile. Such dealing with the [...] "unteachables" [...] (Unbelehrbaren) only succeeded in causing concerns within SPD, as evidenced by internal party correspondence, where HIAG's members were thus described ("unteachable").|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom on Western European politics {{leads us to}} believe that all the “action” lies with parties, because the unified <b>parliamentary</b> <b>delegations</b> in Western Europe draw voters’ attention to parties’ policies and images. Though British elections take place under a single member district plurality system, British parties, like their continental counterparts, are highly centralised and feature disciplined <b>parliamentary</b> <b>delegations.</b> Despite the strong ties between British candidates and their parties, we demonstrate that perceptions of candidates’ personal at-tributes can be used to predict general election outcomes. Using a computer-based survey where subjects are asked to evaluate real British candidates using only rapidly determined first impressions of facial images, we successfully predict outcomes from the 2010 general election. Moreover, we find that perceptions of candidates’ relative attractiveness are particularly useful for predicting outcomes in marginal constituencies...|$|R

500|$|The {{discipline}} {{of working in}} a ministerial post, together with the influence of Morrison and her alienation from communism, turned Wilkinson away from many of her former left-wing stances. She supported Morrison's decision in January 1941 to suppress the communist newspaper The Daily Worker {{on the grounds of}} its anti-British propaganda, and voted for the wartime legislation that banned strikes in key industries. Now accepted within the mainstream of the Labour Party, she served on several key policy committees, and in June 1943 became vice-chairman of the party's National Executive. [...] She succeeded to the chair when the incumbent, George Ridley, died in January 1944. In the 1945 New Year Honours she was appointed a Privy Counsellor, only the third woman (after Margaret Bondfield and Lady Astor) to receive this honour. In April 1945 she was part of a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>delegation</b> that travelled to San Francisco to begin work on the establishment of the United Nations.|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} of the plan {{is that it is}} not victim-centric and that its support for victims is insufficient. Bethany Hastie of McGill University said that the HTNCC had a good track record of intelligence assessment and awareness-raising with respect to human trafficking, and she therefore approved of the plan's funding of the HTNCC. She was critical of the plan's emphasis on law enforcement, saying that [...] "the crime-fighting focus of the plan has unfortunately detracted from...victim services." [...] She said that more attention to victim services was necessary because most Canadian provinces were employing only ad-hoc methods of supporting victims, often omitting important elements such as legal aid and situation-appropriate shelter. A few weeks after the establishment of the NAP-CHT, Dean Allison, MP for Niagara West—Glanbrook, Ontario travelled to Cambodia and Thailand to learn more about human trafficking as part of a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>delegation</b> with World Vision Canada, and he said that his meetings there convinced him [...] "that we are on the right track in Canada with our National Action Plan." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1943, {{while in}} Edinburgh to {{campaign}} in another by-election, Driberg {{was caught by}} a policeman while {{in the act of}} fellating a Norwegian sailor. In his own account of the incident Driberg records that he escaped arrest by identifying himself as [...] "William Hickey" [...] and as a member of parliament. These disclosures evidently overawed the constable, who took no further action; indeed, Driberg says, the incident began a chaste friendship with the officer that endured for more than 10 years. Meanwhile, Beaverbrook had become disenchanted with him, and did not intervene when Arthur Christiansen, the Express editor, sacked the columnist in June 1943 over a story detrimental to a government minister, Andrew Rae Duncan. Driberg subsequently signed up with Reynolds News, a Sunday newspaper owned by the Co-operative Group, and undertook a regular parliamentary column for the New Statesman. He also contributed to a weekly BBC European Service broadcast until, in October 1943, he was banned after government pressure. He reported the post-D-Day allied advances in France and Belgium as a war correspondent for Reynolds News, and {{as a member of a}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>delegation</b> witnessed the aftermath of the liberation of Buchenwald concentration camp in April 1945.|$|E
