5|$|Another old {{structure}} {{removed from}} Europe was proposed for Wyntoon: the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England. Most of the priory {{had been used}} by Hearst to refurbish St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been crated and shipped to San Simeon for <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn be incorporated into his great castle, and had Morgan study the possibilities.|$|E
5|$|SS Black Osprey was a {{cargo ship}} for the American Diamond Lines and the British Cairn Line. She was {{formerly}} known as SS West Arrow when she was launched for the USSB during World War I. The ship was inspected by the United States Navy for <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> as USS West Arrow (ID-2585) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned under that name.|$|E
5|$|SS Mauna Loa was a steam-powered {{cargo ship}} of Matson Navigation Company that was sunk {{in the bombing}} of Darwin in February 1942.

5|$|Somerton {{was hit by}} four Luftwaffe {{bombs on}} the morning of 29 September 1942 during the Second World War. The bombs were aimed at the Cow and Gate milk factory and it was largely destroyed. Ten nearby houses were badly damaged. Nine people were killed and thirty seven injured. A {{memorial}} at the dairy site commemorates those killed. The factory later became a district council depot, and was recently bought by the town council for <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> as the site of a new town hall.|$|E
5|$|The Crimean War of 1854–55 and the Italian War of 1859 {{disrupted}} {{relations among}} Great Britain, France, Austria, and Russia. In {{the aftermath of}} this disarray, the convergence of von Moltke's operational redesign, von Roon and Wilhelm's army restructure, and Bismarck's diplomacy influenced the realignment of the European balance of power. Their combined agendas established Prussia as the leading German power {{through a combination of}} foreign diplomatic triumphs—backed up by the <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> of Prussian military might—and an internal conservativism tempered by pragmatism, which {{came to be known as}} Realpolitik.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Metarhizium acridum {{is found}} in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers. It is being investigated for <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E

5|$|As {{the date}} for the Normandy {{landings}} (codenamed Operation Overlord) drew near in early 1944, Groves considered that risk was sufficient to send an officer to brief the Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower of the <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> of radioactive poisons, particularly plutonium and fission products that might be created in their nuclear reactors. On 8 April 1944, Peterson reported to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and met with Eisenhower, his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, Assistant Chief of Staff (G-2) (Intelligence), Major General John Whiteley, and his Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) (Operations), Major General Harold R. Bull.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> {{of nuclear weapons}} in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him {{for a list of}} targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the use of nuclear weapons. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|Mastodon {{called for}} the {{deployment}} of two squadrons of eight Handley Page Victors to Tengah and one of eight Avro Vulcans to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, {{most of which were}} of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each Vbomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> by the Vbomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 1967, {{a patrol}} from Bravo Company became engaged with an NVA force of unknown size north of Hill 861. This action prematurely {{triggered}} a North Vietnamese offensive aimed at taking Khe Sanh. The NVA forces {{were in the}} process of gaining elevated terrain before the launching of the main attack. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 3rd Marine Regiment, under the command of Colonel John P. Lanigan, reinforced KSCB and were given the task of pushing the North Vietnamese off of Hills 861, 881 North, and 881 South. North Vietnamese forces were driven out of the area around Khe Sanh after suffering 940 casualties. The Marines suffered 155 killed in action and 425 wounded. To prevent NVA observation of the main base at the airfield (and their <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> as firebases), the hills of the surrounding Khe Sanh Valley had to be continuously occupied and defended by separate Marine elements.|$|E

The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the <b>possible</b> <b>use</b> of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a heat sink in electronics.|$|E
5|$|The easternmost {{enclosure}} {{is known}} as Fort St-Georges, the central is the Château du Milieu (the middle castle), while the westernmost {{is known as}} the Fort du Coudray. The Fort St-George was built under HenryII and contained a chapel dedicated England's patron saint. The Château du Coudray was added by PhilipII in the early 13thcentury, while the Château de Milieu was built in the 12th and 14thcenturies. The round Tour du Coudray built by PhilipII (which has parallels at Dourdan, Falaise, Gisors, Laon, and Lillebonne) guarded the bridge linking the Fort du Coudray and the Château de Milieu. While the curtain wall stands in many places, the buildings within the château do not survive to the same extent, and in many cases little more can be said about them than the location of their foundations and <b>possible</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
