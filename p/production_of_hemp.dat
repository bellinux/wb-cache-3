25|$|Dried hemp {{has about}} 57% {{cellulose}} (the principal ingredient in paper), compared to about 40-50% in wood. Hemp {{also has the}} advantage of a lower lignin content: hemp contains only 5-24% lignin against the 20-35% found in wood. This lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process. The actual <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> fiber in the U.S continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons/year. Between 1934 and 1935, the cultivation of hemp began to increase but still at a very low level and with no significant increase of paper from hemp.|$|E

50|$|Samar was a {{major centre}} for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> Manila <b>hemp,</b> the trade <b>of</b> which was {{financing}} Filipino forces on the island.

25|$|In the United States in 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed, and {{prohibited}} the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> {{in addition to}} cannabis. The reasons that hemp was also included in this law are disputed—several scholars have claimed that the act was passed in order to destroy the US hemp industry, with the primary involvement of businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family. But the improvements of the decorticators, machines that separate the fibers from the hemp stem, could not make hemp fiber a very cheap substitute for fibers from other sources because it could not change that basic fact that strong fibers are only found in the bast, the outer part of the stem. Only about 1/3 of the stem are long and strong fibers. The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the purpose of}} developing the nylon was to produce a fiber {{that could be used in}} thin stockings for females and compete with silk.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|E
2500|$|In Western Europe, the {{cultivation}} of hemp was not legally banned by the 1930s, but the commercial cultivation stopped by then, due to decreased demand compared to increasingly popular artificial fibers. Speculation {{about the potential for}} commercial cultivation of hemp in large quantities has been criticized [...] due to successful competition from other fibers for many products. The [...] world <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> fiber fell from over 300,000 metric tons 1961 to about 75,000 metric tons in the early 1990s and has after that been stable at that level.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} three years, {{there has been a}} renewed {{interest}} in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> fiber <b>hemp</b> (Cannabis sativa L., Cannabinaceae) in Alberta. This effort has sparked a great deal of interest and speculation regarding the crop’s potential. Since 1995 fiber hemp research plots have been grown in various parts of Alberta to evaluate the potential of this crop for both seed and fiber production (Blade 1998). Research licenses were granted by the Health Protection Branch of Health Canada, the branch of the federal government charged with enforcing legislation concerning this species. In March, 1998, Health Canada announced that commercial <b>production</b> <b>of</b> low-THC <b>hemp</b> would be allowed through a licensing process. Hemp is an annual herbaceous plant which flourishes in temperate regions (Bosca and Karus 1998). All cultivars tested in Alberta have been low-THC (delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol) genotypes.

40|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> {{cultivation}} {{is as old}} as {{the history}} of civilization. In North America, hemp was a crucial crop during the colonial period, and it continued to be produced right up to and through the Second World War.

In 1998, Canada joined the large international community <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> producers by permitting the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>hemp,</b> under a carefully monitored regulatory process. While the growth of the Canadian industrial hemp sector over the past decade has been uneven and at times fraught with challenges, as would be expected from a fledgling industry, there is considerable cause for optimism: The market for hemp seed materials for human health, nutrition, and personal care applications is strong and growing.

The Drug Enforcement Administration refused to issue permits for legal hemp cultivation and held that, since industrial hemp {{is from the}} same species plant as prohibited cannabis (despite its being of lower THC yield), both were prohibited under the Controlled Substances Act. In {{the words of a}} 2015 PBS NewsHour segment on hemp, [...] "To the federal government, hemp is just as illegal as marijuana", and according to Newsweek, [...] "all cannabis sativa—whether grown to ease chronic pain, get stoned or make rope—is a schedule I controlled substance".|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Design)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008 This thesis {{argues that}} the story <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> is one <b>of</b> mistaken {{identity}} and focuses on the potential <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> (Cannabis sativa L.) in a social and economic context. It also asserts how hemp with the application of appropriate technologies can be developed nationally 'new' material, with reference to examples from abroad. The current proliferation of raw material shortages means that designers have a social responsibility to seek new ways to source and process materials for a sustainable future. Designers are the "future creators" and should prescribe materials that are not only healthy in the cycle <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> but also ensure an afterlife (recycling). The methodology employed {{is a combination of}} qualitative (such as interviews) and quantitative methods (such as statistical analysis). Life Cycle Analysis is used to study the ecological impact <b>of</b> substituting <b>hemp</b> for current materials and processes. The study interrogates the historic significance <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> in various societies across the world with particular focus on Europe, Japan, the United States of America, Ireland and Australia. Such information is analysed within the realities of the South African context. A vast amount <b>of</b> information on <b>hemp</b> has been published but practical information is hard to obtain in South Africa necessitating a search for definite answers abroad, mainly in Europe where there is a strong development in this field. After researching the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hemp</b> raw materials and the manufacture <b>of</b> viable <b>hemp</b> products abroad, lessons could be assessed for application to the local market. The findings endorse the view that hemp is a sustainable zero-waste material; the whole plant can be used when harvested, which makes it an ideal material on which to base an eco-design system. Hemp can be processed by utilizing either high technology equipment or by the use of locally available equipment and manual labour. It can be converted into a multi-diverse range of viable products such as paper, thatching, building material and ceiling panels. The main reason for the isolation <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> in South Africa is the mistaken assumption that it is a drug and outlawed by our legislation. Since hemp (Cannabis sativa L) is perceived as a vilified cousin of marihuana it has lead to a blanket ban on both plants. This is certainly not warranted as hemp produces an extremely low value of the controversial hallucinogenic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) properties which is negligible...|$|R
