5|$|The crusaders {{decided to}} attack Damascus from the west, where {{orchards}} would <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> constant food supply. They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims {{were prepared for}} the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from Saif ad-Din Ghazi I of Mosul and Nur ad-Din of Aleppo, who personally led {{an attack on the}} crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, where they were prone to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{decided to}} attack Damascus from the west, where {{orchards}} would <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> constant food supply. Having arrived outside {{the walls of}} the city, they immediately put it to siege, using wood from the orchards. On 27 July, the crusaders decided to move to the plain on {{the eastern side of the}} city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water. Nur ad-Din Zangi arrived with Muslim reinforcements and cut off the crusaders' route to their previous position. The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. The entire crusader army retreated back to Jerusalem by 28 July.|$|E

25|$|Politeness is {{one measure}} that {{researchers}} {{have used to}} study human-computer interaction. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks a question about themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if {{it may be a}} dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise. The computer would <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions – a pencil and paper evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that participants who were asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, & Carney, 1999.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E
500|$|Similar to the [...] "minor gods" [...] {{system in}} Age of Mythology, Age of Empires III uses a [...] "Politician System" [...] to grant bonuses on a {{successful}} advancement to another age.

As the player's Home City increases in level, more Politicians are unlocked—at a rate of one for every ten Home City levels—up to level 60.|$|E

500|$|Various factors {{exacerbated}} the crisis. Economic growth {{had already begun}} to slow significantly in the years prior to the crisis and the English rural population was increasingly under economic stress, with around half the peasantry estimated to possess insufficient land to <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> secure livelihood. Where additional land was being brought into cultivation, or existing land cultivated more intensively, the soil may have become exhausted and useless. Bad weather also played an important part in the disaster; 1315–16 and 1318 saw torrential rains and an incredibly cold winter, which in combination badly impacted on harvests and stored supplies. The rains of these years were followed by drought in the 1320s and another fierce winter in 1321, complicating recovery. Disease, independent of the famine, was also high during the period, striking at the wealthier as well as the poorer classes. The commencement of war with France in 1337 only added to the economic difficulties. The Great Famine firmly reversed the population growth of the 12thand 13th centuries and left a domestic economy that was [...] "profoundly shaken, but not destroyed".|$|E
500|$|Joy Division were {{approached}} by RCA Records {{to record a}} cover of Nolan [...] "N.F." [...] Porter's [...] "Keep on Keepin' On" [...] and were afforded recording time at a professional Manchester studio in return. Joy Division spent late March and April 1978 writing and rehearsing material. During the Stiff/Chiswick Challenge concert at Manchester's Rafters Club on 14 April, the group {{caught the attention of}} Tony Wilson and Rob Gretton. Curtis berated Wilson for not putting the group on his Granada Television show So It Goes; Wilson responded that Joy Division would be the next band he would showcase on TV. Gretton, the venue's resident DJ, was so impressed by the band's performance that he convinced them to take him on as their manager. Gretton, whose [...] "dogged determination" [...] would later be credited for much of the band's public success, contributed the business skills that Joy Division lacked to <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> better foundation for creativity. Joy Division spent the first week of May 1978 recording at Manchester's Arrow Studios. The band were unhappy with the Grapevine Records head John Anderson's insistence on adding synthesiser into the mix to soften the sound, and asked to be dropped from the contract that they had recently signed with RCA.|$|E
500|$|The crusaders {{decided to}} attack Damascus from the west, where {{orchards}} would <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> constant food supply. They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July, {{with the army}} of Jerusalem in the vanguard, followed by Louis and then Conrad in the rearguard. The densely cultivated gardens and orchards {{would prove to be}} a serious obstacle for the crusaders. According to William of Tyre, the crusader army was prepared for battle: At Daria , since the city was now so near, the sovereigns drew up their forces in battle formation and assigned the legions to their proper places in the order of march...Because of its supposed familiarity with the country, the division led by the King of Jerusalem was, by common decision of the princes, directed to lead the way and open a path for the legions following. To the King of the Franks [...] and his army was assigned the second place or centre that they might aid those ahead if the need arose. By the same authority, the Emperor [...] was to hold the third or rear position, in readiness to resist the enemy if, perchance an attack should be made from behind. The Muslims were well prepared and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus on 24 July. These orchards were defended by towers and walls and the crusaders were constantly pelted with arrows and lances along the narrow paths.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Crawley, Anderson, Kiersten Clark, {{and their}} colleagues {{conducted}} another study {{on the effects of}} Blue's Clues, this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers. They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension, but they found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers. Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of Blue's Clues interacted more with other children's TV shows and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from Blue's Clues could be transferred to other shows. They found that although experienced viewers of Blue's Clues interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show. The researchers stated, [...] "It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of why they do so." [...] The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially in the way they interact with them. They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, children tend {{to pay more attention to}} novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered. The researchers predicted that since shows like Blue's Clues help children feel empowered to learn, it could have long-term effects in motivating children to learn and <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lifelong love of learning.|$|E
500|$|Brütal Legend {{features}} 107 {{heavy metal}} tracks from 75 different bands, selected by Schafer and Music Director Emily Ridgway as listed below, each song being a [...] "completely sincere choice" [...] by Schafer and Ridgway, {{with the whole}} track list being [...] "designed to be loved by Metal fans." [...] Schafer sought to include songs from most main subgenres of metal, including classic heavy metal, industrial metal, black metal, and doom metal, with each faction in the game favoring a specific type. Though Schafer {{and others on the}} Double Fine team had vast knowledge of specific types of metal, Ridgway turned to a used-CD store owner named Allan from Aquarius Records who had [...] "encyclopedic knowledge" [...] of the entire genre, and who provided the team with sample CDs to help them discover some of the more obscure metal bands. Schafer had identified many of the more well-known songs on the list, while Ridgway was able to locate mission-appropriate, more obscure titles for inclusion; for example, one mission, given by the Killmaster (voiced by Lemmy Kilmister), involves rescuing female troops for Ironheade's army; Ridgway had been able to locate a cover of [...] "Bomber", originally recorded by Motörhead (Kilmister's band) and performed by the all-female metal band Girlschool, recorded in their 1981 split EP St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Schafer also credits Black with some of the music selections for the game. Instead of relying on labels or bands to <b>provide</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> list of possible songs to select from, the development team sought permission to use specific songs they wanted in the game. In some cases, obtaining appropriate licensing proved difficult, as for songs from bands that had long split up, Double Fine needed to contact each band member to gain permission. This proved to be valuable, as some original bands were excited about their music being used in the game; in one case, Lita Ford was able to provide the game with a song with slight modifications to the lyrics from a version that she was about to release. One song is from the in-game band [...] "Kabbage Boy" [...] for which Eddie is a roadie {{at the start of the}} game.|$|E
