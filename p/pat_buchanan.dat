5|$|Paul {{considered}} {{campaigning for}} President in 1992, but instead chose to endorse <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> that year, {{and served as}} an adviser to Buchanan's Republican presidential primary campaign against incumbent President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 1995, Specter {{announced}} his candidacy for President of the United States, {{to challenge the}} incumbent Bill Clinton.

He was critical of <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> Pat Robertson, and Ralph Reed, saying all three were far too conservative.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{administration}} tacitly supported Keating's legal efforts, and Counsellor to the President John Ehrlichman assigned White House speechwriter <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> to help {{draft the}} dissenting report.

5|$|Lame duck {{incumbent}} president Bill Clinton was a Democrat, {{and the field}} for nomination for President of both parties was wide open. Bush was governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He entered a large field of hopefuls for the Republican Party presidential nomination that included John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Bob Smith.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{endorsement}} that Tancredo received {{was that}} of Bay Buchanan, the sister of perennial presidential candidate <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and former Treasurer of the United States under President Ronald Reagan. Immediately following her endorsement she was named the Senior Advisor of the campaign. Other advisors included Phil Alexander, formerly of the Buchanan campaigns in 1996, and 2000. New Hampshire advisor, Shelly Uscinski formerly the New Hampshire chairman of the Christian Coalition. Iowa advisor and former U.S. Senate candidate in 2002 Bill Salier.

50|$|Events off {{the pitch}} soon {{affected}} the club. In the autumn and winter of 1913 a major industrial dispute in the furniture trade in High Wycombe saw workers locked out and attendances were seriously affected. However, {{far more serious}} events were taking place in Europe and the First World War soon broke out. Wycombe players joined the two companies of Territorials and the Bucks Battalion. Loakes Park was used for training artillerymen and the club ceased to be active {{for the duration of}} the war. The club and football began to organise itself again and in the summer of 1919 the club held its AGM at the Red Lion Hotel and all stood for those who had lost their lives in the First World War. They included the following players; Charlie <b>Buchanan,</b> George <b>Buchanan,</b> <b>Pat</b> Carter, Bunny Fowler, Frank Langley, Jock Love, Jim McDermott, Edward Reynolds, A Saunders and Harry Stallwood.|$|R
5000|$|After {{moving to}} Cincinnati, she soon {{attracted}} the attention of various wealthy older men. She rarely dates younger men, claiming [...] "I like older men better. They're so mature and kind, and they tire easily." [...] Her dates, most of whom are never seen, shower her with expensive gifts, allowing her to live in a huge penthouse apartment with a piano and a doorbell that plays the song [...] "Fly Me to the Moon" [...] (in the original network run) or [...] "Beautiful Dreamer" [...] (in subsequent syndication and the original Fox Season 1 DVD release. Shout! Factory restored the original doorbell chime for their subsequent DVD releases.). Also through her wealthy boyfriends, she has made friends with a number of wealthy high-society people, including Ronald Reagan; she implies in one episode that the president offered her the job of Secretary of the Treasury, but she turned it down. Her most frequently mentioned boyfriend is someone referred to only as [...] "The Admiral," [...] who in one episode, flies her to Bethlehem for Christmas. The episode [...] "Jennifer and the Will" [...] introduces another: Colonel <b>Buchanan</b> (<b>Pat</b> O'Brien), who dies and makes Jennifer executrix of his will. Though the papers portray Jennifer as a gold-digging floozy, it turns out that Jennifer has asked the Colonel not to leave her any money; he accedes to her request, leaving her only one dollar, the symbolic first dollar he ever made. Furthermore, when the video will recording of Buchanan specifies that the bulk of his estate be used to fund a celebration and parade for the veterans who served under him, Jennifer immediately began preparing to fulfill his wishes while his greedy family protested this bequest.|$|R
5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b> That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b> Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b> Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E

25|$|Thereafter, {{the bottom}} fell out {{politically}} for Despot's favorite, the first President Bush. Challenged {{from the right}} by <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and plagued by a troubling economy, Bush failed nationally and in Louisiana {{as well in the}} 1992 elections.|$|E
25|$|Republican {{politicians}} such as Senator Trent Lott {{have also}} criticized Brown's leadership of FEMA. Brown's performance was defended, however, by Republicans such as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Florida Governor Jeb Bush and former Presidential speechwriter <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Previous to his {{employment}} with Fox News, Cafasso {{had worked}} for the <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> 2000 presidential campaign, fundraising and running petition drives. Official campaign finance records show that Cafasso was being reimbursed by the Buchanan campaign committee for travel and other expenses.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{after the}} Boston Marathon bombings, the {{immigration}} {{processes in the}} country are assumed to be harder. Far-right commentator Bryan Fischer asked that no more visas be granted to Muslims, and no more mosques built, his opinion received support, most notably by the former presidential candidate <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{nomination}} went to <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> {{and running}} mate Ezola Foster from California, {{over the objections}} of party founder Ross Perot and despite a rump convention nomination of John Hagelin by the Perot faction (see Other nominations below). In the end, the Federal Election Commission sided with Buchanan, and that ticket appeared on 49 of 51 possible ballots.|$|E
25|$|Capital Gang is one {{of cable}} news' longest-running programs; running from 1988 to 2005 on Saturday nights, it {{featured}} discussions of the week's political news stories. The original panelists were <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> Al Hunt, Mark Shields and Robert Novak. When Buchanan left the network to run for president, Margaret Warner, Mona Charen, and later Margaret Carlson and Kate O'Beirne became regular panelists.|$|E
25|$|Perot did {{not seek}} public office again after 1996 and did not enter the 2000 Reform Party presidential primaries. He {{endorsed}} Republican George W. Bush over Reform nominee <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> in the 2000 election, and supported Republican Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012. In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems for $3.9 billion. According to Forbes, Perot was the 129th-richest person in the United States in 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{he acted}} {{as an adviser}} on the Public Broadcasting Service {{documentary}} mini-series With God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America, which was later published as a book by William Martin. Berlet criticized Ralph Nader and his associates for a close working relationship with Republican textile magnate Roger Milliken, erstwhile major backer of the 1996 presidential campaign of <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> and anti-unionization stalwart.|$|E
25|$|The station {{switched}} to NBC News and Information Service programming from 1975 to 1977; {{and after the}} demise of NIS, the station aired an all-news format before switching to news-talk in 1979. The talk programming included the first pairing of <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and Tom Braden who became the original hosts of CNN's Crossfire, as well as satirist Mort Sahl, psychologist Karen Shanor and former Philadelphia talk-show host Jerry Williams. Jack Doniger hosted an evening sports-talk show.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000 presidential election, Perot {{refused to}} become openly {{involved}} with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters of <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and John Hagelin. Perot was reportedly unhappy with {{what he saw as}} the disintegration of the party, as well as his own portrayal in the press; thus, he chose to remain quiet. He appeared on Larry King Live four days before the election and endorsed George W. Bush for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers. Some state parties affiliated with the new (Buchananite) America First Party.|$|E
25|$|Novak {{appeared}} on CNN on its opening week in 1980. His {{status as a}} well-known print reporter brought a sense of credibility to the fledgling new network, and Novak soon created a weekly interview show that Evans co-hosted. Novak became a regular panel member of The McLaughlin Group in 1982, starring alongside McLaughlin as well as Novak's personal friends Al Hunt and Mark Shields. Novak sparred frequently with McLaughlin {{despite the fact that}} they both held similar political views. He established a public image as a combative debater on the program. Novak then became the executive producer of Capital Gang, which also featured him as a key member of the show. He also took over as host of Crossfire from <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traficant {{championed the}} unpopular cause of John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born autoworker from Seven Hills, {{who had been}} convicted in Israel and sentenced to hang for having been the brutal {{concentration}} camp guard Ivan the Terrible For almost a decade, Traficant (along with <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan)</b> insisted that Demjanjuk had been denied a fair trial, and {{been the victim of}} mistaken identity; in 1993 the Supreme Court of Israel overturned the conviction, on the basis of doubt. Demjanjuk was later deported to Germany on May 11, 2009, after the Supreme Court of the United States refused to overturn his deportation order. Demjanjuk was tried and convicted by a German criminal court of being an accessory to murder, but died before the German Appellate Court could hear his case, thereby voiding the conviction.|$|E
25|$|In June 1982, {{the channel}} {{launched}} {{a late night}} political debate program, Crossfire, which featured discussions on political issues from opposing viewpoints; it was hosted by liberal Tom Braden and conservative <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b> The idea of the program came about when Braden and Buchanan debated on a daily radio show in 1978. The show soon became popular and was moved to a primetime slot. In 1985, Buchanan left the show to become the communications director for the Ronald Reagan presidential administration. He was replaced by conservative columnist Robert Novak, who had already co-hosted another political program on CNN, Evans & Novak and was also a regular on The McLaughlin Group at the time. Buchanan returned to the show in 1987, replacing Novak. In 1989, Braden was replaced by Michael Kinsley, a liberal columnist for Time, and magazine editor for The New Republic.|$|E
500|$|Bob Dole {{and then}} <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> also used [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] in their {{respective}} 1996 and 2000 campaigns, until Springsteen objected.|$|E
500|$|Rothbard {{supported}} {{the presidential campaign}} of <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> in 1992, and wrote that [...] "with <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy." [...] When Buchanan {{dropped out of the}} Republican primary race, Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to Ross Perot, [...] who Rothbard wrote had [...] "brought an excitement, a verve, a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race." [...] Rothbard ultimately supported George Bush over Bill Clinton in the 1992 election.|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Kemp {{rescinded}} {{his support}} of Vernon Robinson for Congress due to the latter's views on immigration laws, citing Robinson's choice to run [...] "as a <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> Republican".|$|E
500|$|<b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> the {{conservative}} columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, came to Ohio {{to campaign for}} McEwen, as did Vice President Dan Quayle and Oliver North. Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland {{in the general election}} on November 3. While he won 55-45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller's district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen's 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. [...] "I think McEwen's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance," [...] said Alfred Tuchfarber, {{a political science professor at}} the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. [...] "He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn't go down well in a poor district." [...] Strickland said, [...] "I ran against Pat Robertson, <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw everything at me. I'm just so happy I beat back those guys. I think they're so divisive." ...|$|E
500|$|Conservative columnists George Will and <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> {{state that}} {{opponents of the}} team name are being oversensitive, {{although}} Charles Krauthammer drew a parallel between the evolution of [...] "Negro" [...] and [...] "Redskin" [...] from being in common use to being condescending and insulting. [...] W. James Antle III, Rich Lowry, and Dennis Prager wrote that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans.|$|E
500|$|During 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after a {{difficult}} campaign. The Republican National Committee endorsed incumbent Greg Laughlin in the primary; Paul won with assistance from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend Nolan Ryan, tax activist and publisher Steve Forbes and conservative commentator <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> (the latter {{two of whom}} had had presidential campaigns that year). Paul narrowly defeated Democratic attorney Charles [...] "Lefty" [...] Morris in the fall election, despite Morris' criticism over controversial statements in several newsletters that Paul published.|$|E
500|$|In February 1996, Ferraro {{joined the}} high-visibility CNN {{political}} talk show Crossfire, as the co-host representing the [...] "from the left" [...] vantage. She kept her brassy, rapid-fire speech and New York accent intact, and her trial experience from her prosecutor days {{was a good}} fit for the program's format. She sparred effectively with [...] "from the right" [...] co-host <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> for whom she developed a personal liking. The show stayed strong in ratings for CNN, and the job was lucrative. She welcomed how the role [...] "keeps me visible [...] keeps me extremely well informed on the issues." ...|$|E
