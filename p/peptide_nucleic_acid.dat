500|$|The {{structure}} of a nucleic acid molecule consists of a sequence of nucleotides distinguished by which nucleobase they contain. In DNA, the four bases present are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). [...] Nucleic acids have the property that two molecules will only bind to each other to form a double helix if the two sequences are complementary, meaning that they form matching sequences of base pairs, with A only binding to T, and C only to G. [...] Because the formation of correctly matched base pairs is energetically favorable, nucleic acid strands are expected in most cases to bind {{to each other in}} the conformation that maximizes the number of correctly paired bases. [...] The sequences of bases in a system of strands thus determine the pattern of binding and the overall structure in an easily controllable way. [...] In DNA nanotechnology, the base sequences of strands are rationally designed by researchers so that the base pairing interactions cause the strands to assemble in the desired conformation. [...] While DNA is the dominant material used, structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as RNA and <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (PNA) have also been constructed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOverexpression of {{inducible}} {{nitric oxide}} synthase causes the production of high levels of nitric oxide, which, under pathological conditions, leads to immunosuppression and tissue damage. The results recently obtained using <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> rather than traditional oligonucleotides as antigen and antisense molecules, prompted us to test their efficacy in the regulation of nitric oxide production, thereby overcoming the obstacle of cellular internalization. The cellular permeability of four inducible {{nitric oxide synthase}} antisense <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> of different lengths was evaluated. These <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> were covalently linked to a hydrophobic peptide moiety to increase internalization and to a tyrosine to allow selective 125 I radiolabelling.
