50|$|A {{carburetor}} basically {{consists of}} an open pipe through which the air passes into the inlet manifold of the engine. The pipe {{is in the form}} of a Venturi: it narrows in section and then widens again, causing the airflow to increase in speed in the narrowest part. Below the Venturi is a butterfly valve called the throttle valve — a rotating disc that can be turned end-on to the airflow, so as to hardly restrict the flow at all, or can be rotated so that it (almost) completely blocks the flow of air. This valve controls the flow of air through the carburetor throat and thus the quantity of air/fuel mixture the system will deliver, thereby regulating engine power and speed. The throttle is connected, usually through a cable or a mechanical linkage of rods and joints or rarely by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>link,</b> to the accelerator pedal on a car, a throttle level in an aircraft or the equivalent control on other vehicles or equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{carriages}} were {{fitted with}} automatic couplers with an implicit agreement that sets {{would not be}} separated; one of the sets in the mid-30's had drawbars fitted between its three carriages experimentally. The automatic couplers {{were expected to be}} temporary, with scharfenberg couplers expected in June 1983 to replace them and the hard-wired electrical and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>links</b> between carriages. However, a derailment in late 2011 revealed that set SN1 on the standard gauge still had [...] between the carriages.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of evaporative fluorocarbon cooling recirculators and their control systems for the ATLAS inner silicon tracker. We have developed a prototype circulator using a dry, hermetic compressor with C/sub 3 /F/sup 8 / refrigerant, and have prototyped the remote-control analog <b>pneumatic</b> <b>links</b> for the regulation of coolant mass flows and operating temperatures that will be necessary in the magnetic field and radiation environment around ATLAS. pressure and flow measurement and control use 150 + channels of standard ATLAS LMB ("Local Monitor Board") DAQ and DACs on a multi-drop CAN network administered through a BridgeVIEW user interface. A hardwired thermal interlock system has been developed to cut power to individual silicon modules should their temperatures exceed safe values. Highly satisfactory performance of the circulator under steady state, partial-load and transient conditions was seen, with proportional fluid flow tuned to varying circuit power. Future developments, including a 6 kW demonstrator with ~ 25 cooling circuits, are outlined...|$|R
5000|$|The organ was {{originally}} built by William Hill & Son of London. It was ordered in 1882 (as Job No. 1854) {{but was not}} completed until 1885. It had three manuals and pedals, with tubular <b>pneumatic</b> action <b>linking</b> the detached console {{on the south side}} of the choir stalls to the organ on the north side of the chancel, in an elevated position in the Triforium. It was rebuilt by Wadsworth Brothers of Manchester in 1929. During the late 1960s it was disastrously rebuilt by a small, local firm Charles H Smethurst Ltd, to a much reduced specification. The original specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{controlled}} during operation by two small control boxes. One {{of them is}} an electrical control box, with a speed adjustment knob, attached to the main box by an electrical cable. The other is a <b>pneumatic</b> control box, <b>linked</b> by a rubber tube to the diaphragm chamber, and has two push-buttons, one to add air to the system, {{and the other to}} remove air from the system. The final adjustment possible is an internal adjustment {{that can be used to}} change the amplitude of the pumping motion, but this is not available in operation, as adjusting it requires the main box of the machine to be dismantled and reassembled.|$|R
50|$|Air suspension, as standard, {{gives the}} driver {{the option of}} three ride height {{settings}} including a standard ride height of 172 mm, an off-road height of 227 mm and a lowered access mode. There is also an extra height available which is accessed by holding the respective button for when the off-road ride height is not enough. When the vehicle bellies out, its control system will sense weight being lessened on the air springs and the ride height is automatically raised to the suspensions greatest articulation. The cross-link aspect of the suspension system, which debuted on the L322 Range Rover in 2002, results in better off-road performance by electronically operating valves in <b>pneumatic</b> lines which <b>link</b> adjacent air springs. In {{the event of a}} wheel on one side being raised when travelling off-road, the pneumatic valves are opened and the adjacent wheel is forced down, simulating the action of a live axle setup.|$|R
40|$|Uniquely among extant vertebrates, birds possess complex {{respiratory}} systems characterised by {{the combination}} of small, rigid lungs, extensive pulmonary air sacs that possess diverticula that invade (pneumatise) the postcranial skeleton, unidirectional ventilation of the lungs, and efficient crosscurrent gas exchange. Crocodilians, the only other living archosaurs, also possess unidirectional lung ventilation, but lack true air sacs and postcranial skeletal pneumaticity (PSP). PSP {{can be used to}} infer the presence of avian-like pulmonary air sacs in several extinct archosaur clades (non-avian theropod dinosaurs, sauropod dinosaurs and pterosaurs). However, the evolution of respiratory systems in other archosaurs, especially in the lineage leading to crocodilians, is poorly documented. Here, we use µCT-scanning to investigate the vertebral anatomy of Triassic archosaur taxa, from both the avian and crocodilian lineages as well as non-archosaurian diapsid outgroups. Our results confirm previous suggestions that unambiguous evidence of PSP (presence of internal <b>pneumatic</b> cavities <b>linked</b> to the exterior by foramina) is found only in bird-line (ornithodiran) archosaurs. We propose that pulmonary air sacs were present in the common ancestor of Ornithodira and may have been subsequently lost or reduced in some members of the clade (notably in ornithischian dinosaurs). The development of these avian-like respiratory features might have been linked to inferred increases in activity levels among ornithodirans. By contrast, no crocodile-line archosaur (pseudosuchian) exhibits evidence for unambiguous PSP, but many of these taxa possess the complex array of vertebral laminae and fossae that always accompany the presence of air sacs in ornithodirans. These laminae and fossae are likely homologous with those in ornithodirans, which suggests the need for further investigation of the hypothesis that a reduced, or non-invasive, system of pulmonary air sacs may be have been present in these taxa (and secondarily lost in extant crocodilians) and was potentially primitive for Archosauria as a whole. ...|$|R
