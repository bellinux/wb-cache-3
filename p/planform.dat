5|$|While {{the wing}} <b>planform</b> was evolving, {{so was the}} basic SST concept. Bristol's {{original}} Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing, but evolved into the larger Type 223.|$|E
5|$|The {{design work}} was {{supported}} by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio delta wings. A supersonic Fairey Delta 2 was modified to carry the ogee <b>planform,</b> and, renamed as the BAC 221, used for flight tests of the high speed flight envelope, the Handley Page HP.115 also provided valuable information on low speed performance.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} of the 707 programme, the {{contribution}} of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant, though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give a ground incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude. The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta <b>planform.</b> A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} that the {{original}} proposals were being studied, advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly. The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred <b>planform</b> for supersonic flight, replacing earlier designs like the swept-wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the earlier WS-110 concepts. Engines {{able to cope with}} higher temperatures and widely varying intake ramp air speeds were also under design, allowing for sustained supersonic speeds.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1956, initial {{designs were}} {{presented}} by the two companies. Zip fuel was {{to be used in}} the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 percent over conventional fuel. Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time the highest performance <b>planform</b> known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest fineness ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility.|$|E
25|$|Low-speed {{testing of}} the concept was already being {{provided}} by the Handley Page HP.115. Although high-speed performance appeared to be predictable, a dedicated testbed aircraft was desired, especially for drag measurements. As early as 1958, the RAE and Fairey began discussions about converting one of the Delta 2 prototypes to support the ogee wing. Fairey proposed stretching the fuselage a further three feet to better match the long <b>planform,</b> with the wing extending out onto the drooping nose. However, calculations showed that this extension was not great enough to counter the forward moving centre of pressure (CoP) that resulted from the extended <b>planform,</b> and there were also concerns that the over-wing engine intakes would swallow the vortex above the wing.|$|E

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} five planar flying wing <b>planforms</b> suitable for micro air vehicles (MAVs) are investigated via {{a series of}} wind-tunnel tests. The external boundary of the five <b>planforms</b> result from slender carbon fibre (CF) struts under various degrees of buckling. The maximum lift/drag ratios were similar for all the (quite different) shapes but the stall characteristics {{were found to be}} markedly different. Results are presented of cross-plane traverses detailing the wake vector field and turbulence characteristics for two of the <b>planforms</b> at conditions close to stall. A MAV, based on mylar-covered buckled CF struts, is described. The MAV utilises elevon control based on modified commercially available micro radio control systems...|$|R
25|$|The {{elliptical}} <b>planform</b> keel {{is designed}} by C and fabricated by Mars Metal (MarsKeel). The keel is of lead alloyed with antimony for added strength and cast to exacting tolerances. In {{addition to providing}} the yacht's stability, the foil shape of the keel produces hydrodynamic lift while sailing to weather, enhancing upwind performance.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to a Navy request for proposals issued on 3 February 1941 for a replacement for the SB2C, Curtiss designed an improved and enlarged version of the Helldiver, which was, at the time, still only {{in the process of}} flight testing. A larger tail, revised wing <b>planform</b> and tricycle landing gear distinguished the aircraft from its predecessor, in addition to the provision of heavier armament.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} F.K.10 had a new, deeper fuselage, {{and a new}} tail, but {{retained the}} wing <b>planform</b> of the F.K.9. The F.K.10 showed inferior performance to the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, which was already in service as a successful two-seat fighter, and only five were built of the RFC order, with a further three built for the RNAS. They were not used operationally and the design was not developed further.|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{and experimental}} method {{for the evaluation}} of helicopter rotor tips in high-speed forward flight is presented which uses an unsteady full-potential solver on the advancing side of the rotor disk. Forces and moments measured during angle-of-attack sweeps reveal the soft-stall phenomenon of the double-swept <b>planforms</b> as well as the delayed stall of the single-swept hyperbolic tip. Double-swept <b>planforms</b> are shown to exhibit the most favorable performance, creating counter-rotating vortices that augment the lifting capabilities of the blade at high angles of attack and delay the onset of stall...|$|R
40|$|In the Boussinesq approximation, {{single-mode}} equations describing {{thermal convection}} are constructed by expanding the fluctuating velocity and temperature fields {{in a complete}} set of functions (or <b>planforms)</b> of the horizontal coordinates and retaining just one term. Numerical solutions of the single-mode equations are investigated, chief consideration being given to hexagonal <b>planforms.</b> Extensive surveys of steady solutions are presented for various Rayleigh numbers, Prandtl numbers, and horizontal wavenumbers. The dependences on Rayleigh number and Prandtl number at very large Rayleigh number are in satisfactory agreement with the results of asymptotic expansions...|$|R
25|$|The F-15 has an {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage {{with a large}} cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing <b>planform</b> of the F-15 {{suggests a}} modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|The {{low-speed}} concept {{allowed the}} design {{to dispense with}} several features normally found on jet aircraft, notably the sweptback wing. By using a conventional rectangular wing the high-speed drag was greatly increased (see wave drag) but the low-speed lift was likewise greatly increased. Further, the rectangular <b>planform</b> allowed the twin wing spars to be single pieces, {{and all of the}} engines, landing gear and cargo could be attached directly to the spar. With a swept wing this would place considerable torque loads on the point where the wings met the fuselage.|$|E

High-lift devices comprise full-span six-segment {{leading edge slats}} (contiguous at engine pylons) at up to 17.5% of chord (drooping to 35°), two-segment fixed-vane double-slotted trailing edge flaps occupying some 75% of the span (deploying to 40°) and five-segment spoilers (outboards used as spoilerons at high speeds, inboards used as lift dumpers on the ground). Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed roll control. Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as anti-flutter weights. Trim range is 16–33% of mean aerodynamic chord.|$|E

5000|$|Trapezoidal: a {{tapered wing}} with {{straight}} leading and trailing edges: may be unswept or swept. The straight tapered wing {{is one of}} the most common wing <b>planforms,</b> as seen on the Grumman F4F Wildcat.|$|R
40|$|In Rayleigh-Benard convection, the {{spatially}} uniform motionless {{state of}} a fluid loses stability as the Rayleigh number is increased beyond a critical value. In the simplest case of convection in a pure Boussinesq fluid, the instability is a symmetry-breaking steady-state bifurcation {{that leads to}} the formation of spatially periodic patterns. However, in many double-diffusive convection systems, the heat-conduction solution actually loses stability via Hopf bifurcation. These hydrodynamic systems provide motivation for the present study of spatiotemporally periodic pattern formation in Euclidean equivariant systems. We call such patterns <b>planforms.</b> We classify, according to spatio-temporal symmetries and spatial periodicity, many of the time-periodic solutions that may be obtained through equivariant Hopf bifurcation from a group-invariant equilibrium. Instead of focusing on <b>planforms</b> periodic with respect to a specified planar lattice, as has been done in previous investigations, we consider all <b>planforms</b> that are spatially periodic with respect to some planar lattice. Our classification results rely only on the existence of Hopf bifurcation and planar Euclidean symmetry and not on the particular differential equation...|$|R
25|$|Like the Bf 109, the Fw 190 {{featured}} a fairly small wing <b>planform</b> with relatively high wing loading. This presents a trade-off in performance. An aircraft {{with a smaller}} wing suffers less drag under most flight conditions and therefore flies faster and may have better range. However, it also means the wing generates less lift at lower speeds, making it less maneuverable and also reduces performance in the thinner air at higher altitudes. The wings spanned 9.5m (31ft 2in) and had an area of 15m² (161ft²). The wing was designed using the NACA 23015.3 airfoil at the root and the NACA 23009 airfoil at the tip.|$|E
25|$|The wing <b>planform</b> {{was changed}} to a near-elliptical shape to {{accommodate}} the 800 rounds of ammunition for the four 20mm Hispano cannons, which were moved back further into the wing. The new wing had greater area than the Typhoon's, however, the new wing design sacrificed the leading edge fuel tanks of the Typhoon: {{to make up for}} this loss in capacity, Hawker engineers added a new 21in (53cm) fuel bay in front of the cockpit, with a 76Igal (345l) fuel tank. In addition, two inter-spar wing tanks, each of 28Igal (127l), were fitted {{on either side of the}} centre section and, starting with late model Tempest Vs, a 30Igal (136l) tank was carried in the leading edge of the port wingroot, giving the Tempest a total internal fuel capacity of 162Igal (736l).|$|E
25|$|The wing {{was fixed}} to the {{fuselage}} at three points. There was a pivot at the centre {{of a pair of}} turntable rings, one on the fuselage, and one on the wing underside and just under 3ft (890mm) in diameter, plus two L-shaped locking bolts. Before the wings could be rotated, the flat-topped decking on the rear fuselage had to be swung out on hinges to hang down along the fuselage sides, then with these bolts removed, the wing could be swung through almost 90° so that one trailing edge, with its aileron raised vertically, lay close to the fin. The resulting storage <b>planform</b> was narrower than that of a typical folding aircraft, but longer. The aim of the rotating wing was not so much to save space as to make folding a one-man, rather than a two-man task.|$|E
40|$|It is {{impossible}} to know beforehand the <b>planforms</b> of a stretch of beach without being first aware of the maritime climate affecting it. This article describes a procedure for objectively calculating the uncertainty associated with the prediction of the evolution of a stretch of beach in terms of probability. On the basis of oceanographic data records as well as empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), we propose a procedure for the simulation of possible sequences of storm events. Such sequences were then entered as input for a morphodynamic model with a view to the subsequent generation of possible <b>planforms.</b> EOF methodology was then used to estimate the probability of each of the <b>planforms</b> thus generated. The case study presented here is that of the evolution of an initially straight sand beach where a rectangular tapered fill had been constructed. The beach is located upshore of a groin perpendicular to the coastline, and had blocked all longshore sediment transport. For this analysis we used a one-line model with time-dependent boundary conditions and a non-homogeneous diffusion coefficien...|$|R

25|$|An {{experiment}} of 1932 was {{the addition}} of a stamp vending machine {{to the end of the}} post box. This necessitated an oval <b>planform</b> for the box even though it was only provided with a single posting aperture. At one end of the oval is the stamp machine and at the other is the posting aperture. The boxes have two doors; one for clearance of mail and one for emptying the cash and reloading the stamp machines. The machines were set to vend two halfpenny stamps in exchange for one old penny, the stamps being supplied in a long continuously wound roll known as a coil. Boxes were again made in two sizes, designated Type D and Type E, and carried raised lettering on the castings indicating the position of the stamp vending machine, as well as an array of small enamel plates warning users of the danger of bent coins and the need to wait for stamps to be issued before inserting more money. Several of each have survived in use in England and in the Isle of Man.|$|E
25|$|The Su-57 will be {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft in Russian Air Force service to use stealth technology. Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the airframe incorporates <b>planform</b> edge alignment to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully aligned at several specific angles {{in order to reduce the}} number of directions the radar waves can be reflected. Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe, and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape. The IRST housing is turned backwards when not in use, and its rear is treated with radar-absorbent material (RAM) to reduce its radar return. To mask the significant RCS contribution of the engine face, the partial serpentine inlet obscures most, but not all, of the engine's fan and inlet guide-vanes (IGV). The production aircraft incorporates radar blockers similar in principle to those used on the F/A-18E/F in front of the engine fan to hide it from all angles. The aircraft uses RAM to absorb radar emissions and reduce their reflection back to the source, and the canopy is treated with a coating to minimize the radar return of the cockpit and pilot.|$|E
500|$|The program {{begin in}} 1977, with a {{reported}} budget of USD $24,000,000; {{the design of}} the aircraft was closely based on that of Have Blue, except scaled down. Intended for launch from Lockheed DC-130 Hercules drone launcher aircraft, the original configuration of the Senior Prom vehicle included winglets and a ventral fin; the aircraft was later modified to include a V-tail and more slender wings, closer in configuration to the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter. Radar-absorbent material was applied to the airframe as part of its stealth configuration; in addition to the faceting of the design, similar to that of Have Blue and the F-117, the [...] "sawtooth" [...] wing profile bore similarities to the B-2 stealth bomber's <b>planform.</b>|$|E

Although the amount {{and quality of the}} experimental data available for 3 -D dynamic stall does not match what is available for 2 -D cases, the computational fluid dynamics was found capable of predicting this complex 3 -D flow with good accuracy. Once confidence on the computational fluid dynamics method was established, further calculations were conducted for several wing <b>planforms.</b> The calculations revealed the detailed structure of the 3 -D dynamic stall vortex and its interaction with the tip vortex.
