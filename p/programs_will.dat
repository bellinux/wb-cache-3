25|$|The U.S. {{government}} is obligated {{under current law}} to make mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects that payouts for these <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing. The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8trillion. This is the amount that {{would have had to}} be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> require nearly five times more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62trillion. However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt, as shown in monthly Treasury reports of the national debt.|$|E
25|$|It will be {{difficult}} for any of the five countries to check their epidemics by 2010 without dramatic shifts in priorities. The disease has built up significant momentum, health services are inadequate, and the cost of education and treatment <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> be overwhelming. Government leaders will have trouble maintaining a priority on HIV/AIDS—which has been key to stemming the disease in Uganda, Thailand, and Brazil—because of other pressing issues and the lack of AIDS advocacy groups.|$|E

25|$|Graduate {{programs}} in BME, like in other scientific fields, are highly varied, and particular programs may emphasize certain aspects within the field. They may also feature extensive collaborative efforts with {{programs in}} other fields (such as the University's Medical School or other engineering divisions), owing again to the interdisciplinary nature of BME. M.S. and Ph.D. <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> typically require applicants to have an undergraduate degree in BME, or another engineering discipline (plus certain life science coursework), or life science (plus certain engineering coursework).|$|E
25|$|A key {{tenet of}} NKS {{is that the}} simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur {{in a wide variety}} of more {{complicated}} contexts. Therefore, NKS argues that systematically exploring the space of simple <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. NKS has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{programs}} use Unicode strings {{to allow}} internationalization of text. Often, these <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> convert incoming ASCII strings to Unicode before processing them. Unicode strings encoded in UTF-16 use two bytes to encode each character (or four bytes for some special characters). When an ASCII string {{is transformed into}} UTF-16, a zero byte is inserted after each byte in the original string. Obscou proved in Phrack 61 {{that it is possible}} to write shellcode that can run successfully after this transformation. Programs that can automatically encode any shellcode into alphanumeric UTF-16-proof shellcode exist, based on the same principle of a small self-modifying decoder that decodes the original shellcode.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the efforts}} of women's rights advocates in Iran, in 2001 Allameh Tabatabaii University, Tarbiat Modares University, and Alzahra University {{initiated}} women's studies programs at the Master of Arts level, and shortly thereafter Tehran University began a similar university course for a degree. There are three sub-specialties: women and family, the history of women, and women's rights in Islam. These programs are needed, it is stated, to try and remedy some of {{the damage caused by}} centuries of the dominance of negative views on women, sociologically and humanistically, and other hardships suffered by women in Iran. It is hoped that graduates of women's studies <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> be able to present gender-neutral points of view.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} has also started a massive program to rebuild local public-health facilities. SARS revealed that public-health facilities were largely outdated and inadequate to tackle existing public-health problems, {{not to mention}} addressing new or emerging challenges. The government is currently investing $1·3 billion to rebuild 2448 CDC facilities in 27 provinces. When completed, more than 80% of the country's CDC facilities will be new. The central government will provide 28% of the needed funding, with the rest coming from governments at various levels. However, China's poorer western provinces will receive preferential support, with 65% of the needed funding coming from the central government. Tuberculosis control <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> directly benefit from this approach, since more than 80% of China's tuberculosis dispensaries are located in local CDC facilities.|$|E
25|$|Target {{released}} a 13-page report in 2007 that outlined their {{current and future}} plans for becoming more earth-friendly according to LEED. Such efforts include installing sand filtration systems for the stores' wastewater.

All stores in Oklahoma will be partnered with Oklahoma Gas & Electric to exclusively use wind power for all Target stores {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions. Stores nationwide use only LED and fluorescent lights and low-flow restrooms that reduce waste water by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or green roofs, which absorb storm water and cut down on surface runoff, mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in Chicago.|$|E

25|$|Graduate {{education}} is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them. Since most BME-related professions involve scientific research, such as in pharmaceutical and medical device development, graduate {{education is}} almost a requirement (as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience). This can be either a Masters or Doctoral level degree; while in certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived need {{for some kind of}} graduate credential is so strong that some undergraduate BME <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed intention to also obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Mostly, {{a year is}} a {{leap year}} if it is evenly {{divisible}} by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that a year divisible by four is a leap year. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this leap year problem including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998. For information on why century years are treated differently, see Gregorian calendar.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that Americans have six {{lifestyle}} choices as they age: continuing to work full-time, continuing to work part-time, retiring from work and becoming engaged in a variety of leisure activities, retiring from work and becoming involved in a variety of recreational and leisure activities, retiring from work and later returning to work part-time, and retiring from work and later returning to work full-time. An important note to make from these lifestyle definitions are that four of the six involve working. America is facing an important demographic change in that the Baby Boomer generation is now reaching retirement age. This poses two challenges: whether there will be a sufficient number of skilled workers in the work force, and whether the current pension <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> be sufficient to support the growing number of retired people. The reasons that some people choose to never retire, or to return to work after retiring include not only the difficulty of planning for retirement but also wages and fringe benefits, expenditure of physical and mental energy, production of goods and services, social interaction, and social status may interact to influence an individual’s work force participation decision.|$|E
