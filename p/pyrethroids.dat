5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the <b>pyrethroids</b> cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, <b>pyrethroids</b> or other insecticides may need to be used.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, <b>pyrethroids</b> and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its {{attraction}} to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pyrethroids</b> are direct stimulators {{of sodium}} {{channels}} in neuronal cells, inducing rapid depolarization and spastic paralysis leading to death. The effect is {{specific to the}} parasite since the drugs used are only slowly absorbed by the host and rapidly metabolized once absorbed. Cypermethrin (Excis, Betamax) and deltamethrin (Alphamax) are the two <b>pyrethroids</b> commonly used to control sea lice. Resistance to <b>pyrethroids</b> {{has been reported in}} Norway and appears to be due to a mutation leading to a structural change in the sodium channel which prevents <b>pyrethroids</b> from activating the channel. Use of deltamethrin has been increasing as an alternate treatment with the rise in resistance observed with emamectin benzoate.|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science Johannesburg, 2014 Southern African <b>pyrethroid</b> resistant and insecticide susceptible laboratory colonies of the malaria vector Anopheles funestus were investigated to further understand the phenotypic expression of <b>pyrethroid</b> resistance and to establish at which life stage resistance was selected. <b>Pyrethroid</b> resistance levels of larvae and adults were assessed at the larval and adult life stages using WHO larval and CDC bottle bioassays. Subsequent resistance levels were then assessed following targeted selections at each life stage. Tests for an association between cuticle thickness and <b>pyrethroid</b> resistance were based on cuticle thickness measurements using scanning electron microscope imaging of prepared tissue sections. It is concluded that <b>pyrethroid</b> resistance in southern African An. funestus is only expressed in the adult life stage, and that selection for this phenotype can only be achieved by exposing adults.

40|$|<b>Pyrethroid</b> insecticides, {{especially}} permethrin and deltamethrin, {{have been}} used extensively worldwide for mosquito control. However, insecticide resistance can spread through a population very rapidly under strong selection pressure from insecticide use. The upregulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) has been reported upon <b>pyrethroid</b> treatment. In Aedes aegypti, the increase in ALDH activity against the hydrolytic product of <b>pyrethroid</b> has been observed in DDT/permethrin-resistant strains. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the role of individual ALDHs involved in <b>pyrethroid</b> metabolism. Three ALDHs were identified; two of these, ALDH 9948 and ALDH 14080, were upregulated in terms of both mRNA and protein levels in a DDT/pyrethroid-resistant strain of Ae. aegypti. Recombinant ALDH 9948 and ALDH 14080 exhibited oxidase activities to catalyse the oxidation of a permethrin intermediate, phenoxybenzyl aldehyde (PBald), to phenoxybenzoic acid (PBacid). ALDHs have been identified in association with permethrin resistance in Ae. aegypti. Characterisation of recombinant ALDHs confirmed the role of this protein in <b>pyrethroid</b> metabolism.

40|$|<b>Pyrethroid</b> {{insecticides}} {{are widely}} used to control insect pests and human disease vectors. Voltage-gated sodium channels are the primary targets of <b>pyrethroid</b> insecticides. Mutations in the sodium channel {{have been shown to}} be responsible for <b>pyrethroid</b> resistance, known as knockdown resistance (kdr), in various insects including mosquitoes. In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the principal urban vectors of dengue, zika, and yellow fever viruses, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in the sodium channel gene have been found in pyrethroid-resistant populations and some of them have been functionally confirmed to be responsible for kdr in an in vitro expression system, Xenopus oocytes. This mini-review aims to provide an update on the identification and functional characterization of <b>pyrethroid</b> resistance-associated sodium channel mutations from Aedes aegypti. The collection of kdr mutations not only helped us develop molecular markers for resistance monitoring, but also provided valuable information for computational molecular modeling of <b>pyrethroid</b> receptor sites on the sodium channel...|$|R
50|$|Bed bugs are {{developing}} resistance to various pesticides including DDT and organophosphates. Some populations {{have developed a}} resistance to <b>pyrethroid</b> insecticides. Although now often ineffective, the resistance to <b>pyrethroid</b> allows for new chemicals that work in different ways to be investigated, so chemical management can continue to be one part in the resolving of bed bug infestations. There is growing interest in both synthetic <b>pyrethroid</b> and the pyrrole insecticide, chlorfenapyr. Insect growth regulators, such as hydroprene (Gentrol), are also sometimes used.|$|R
25|$|Following World War II, the {{development}} of new pesticides such as DDT enabled U.S. farmers again to grow cotton as an economic crop. DDT was initially extremely effective, but U.S. weevil populations developed resistance by the mid-1950s. Methyl parathion, malathion, and <b>pyrethroids</b> were subsequently used, but environmental and resistance concerns arose as they had with DDT, and control strategies changed.|$|E
25|$|Another crucial {{preventive}} measure {{is the use}} of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (Amitraz), phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or permethrin (<b>pyrethroids).</b> These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{study in}} Thailand found the cost per malaria case {{prevented}} of DDT spraying (US$1.87) to be 21% greater than the cost per case prevented of lambda-cyhalothrin–treated nets (US$1.54), casting some doubt {{on the assumption that}} DDT was the most cost-effective measure. The director of Mexico's malaria control program found similar results, declaring that it was 25% cheaper for Mexico to spray a house with synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> than with DDT.

40|$|Background <b>Pyrethroid</b> {{pesticides}} cause abnormalities in the dopamine {{system and}} produce an ADHD phenotype in animal models, with effects accentuated in males versus females. However, data regarding behavioral effects of <b>pyrethroid</b> exposure in children is limited. We examined {{the association between}} <b>pyrethroid</b> pesticide exposure and ADHD in a nationally representative sample of US children, and tested whether this association differs by sex. Methods Data are from 8 – 15 year old participants (N =  687) in the 2001 – 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Exposure was assessed using concurrent urinary levels of the <b>pyrethroid</b> metabolite 3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (3 -PBA). ADHD was defined by either meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition criteria on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) or caregiver report of a prior diagnosis. ADHD symptom counts were determined via the DISC. Multivariable logistic regression examined the link between <b>pyrethroid</b> exposure and ADHD, and poisson regression investigated the link between exposure and ADHD symptom counts. Results Children with urinary 3 -PBA above the limit of detection (LOD) were {{twice as likely to}} have ADHD compared with those below the LOD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2. 42; 95  % confidence interval [CI] 1. 06, 5. 57). Hyperactive-impulsive symptoms increased by 50 % for every 10 -fold increase in 3 -PBA levels (adjusted count ratio 1. 50; 95  % CI 1. 03, 2. 19); effects on inattention were not significant. We observed possible sex-specific effects: <b>pyrethroid</b> biomarkers were associated with increased odds of an ADHD diagnosis and number of ADHD symptoms for boys but not girls. Conclusions We found an association between increasing <b>pyrethroid</b> pesticide exposure and ADHD which may be stronger for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms compared to inattention and in boys compared to girls. Given the growing use of <b>pyrethroid</b> pesticides, these results may be of considerable public health import...|$|R
25|$|Insecticides {{have also}} been used often in prevention, but with {{improper}} application and heavy reliance throughout the years, insecticide resistance and residues within the wool have caused much concern. The primary reason for failures in using insecticides is attributed to poor application. Jetting, dipping, and backlining are the three most commonly used methods for insecticide application, {{and most of the}} chemicals used belong to three types of chemicals: synthetic <b>pyrethroids,</b> organophosphates, insect growth regulators and spinosins. Insect growth regulators can provide the long term protection against flies and when applied correctly provide protection during the susceptible times of the year. Resistance to this group of insecticide has been identified. Spinosins are good for short term control of flies and leave no residues in wool. Many government agencies mandate that the wool be free of insecticidal residues forcing withholding periods by farmers before shearing. During this time, the flock can become extremely sensitive to flystrike.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E

500|$|Mosquito nets {{help keep}} {{mosquitoes}} {{away from people}} and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time {{to find a way}} past the net. Insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net. Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa. About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007 and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015. [...] Most nets are impregnated with <b>pyrethroids,</b> a class of insecticides with low toxicity. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.

2500|$|DDT {{can still}} be {{effective}} against resistant mosquitoes and the avoidance of DDT-sprayed walls by mosquitoes is an additional benefit of the chemical. For example, a 2007 study reported that resistant mosquitoes avoided treated huts. The researchers argued that DDT was the best pesticide for use in IRS (even though it did not afford the most protection from mosquitoes out of the three test chemicals) because the others pesticides worked primarily by killing or irritating mosquitoes – encouraging the development of resistance. Others argue that the avoidance behavior slows eradication. Unlike other insecticides such as <b>pyrethroids,</b> DDT requires long exposure to accumulate a lethal dose; however its irritant property shortens contact periods. [...] "For these reasons, when comparisons have been made, better malaria control has generally been achieved with <b>pyrethroids</b> than with DDT." [...] In India outdoor sleeping and night duties are common, implying that [...] "the excito-repellent effect of DDT, often reported useful in other countries, actually promotes outdoor transmission." ...|$|E
