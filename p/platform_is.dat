5|$|Structure C12 is a south-facing {{platform}} {{built from}} pumice. It divides the West Plaza in two. The upper {{surface of the}} <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> marked by a circle of burnt clay formed by the burning of incense.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E
5|$|Lions Entertainment {{is a new}} {{event at}} Cannes Lions where brands, {{agencies}} and entertainment companies can focus on producing outstanding creative work together. The Entertainment Lions for Music celebrate creative musical collaborations. Entries will need to demonstrate original production, promotion or distribution of music for brands; that is work where a recording artist or <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> innovatively leveraged to communicate with consumers. Adele has won once.|$|E

25|$|Wynyard {{railway station}} <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> still {{numbered}} from 3 to 6. Platforms 1 and 2 <b>were</b> tram <b>platforms</b> and the railway <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> never renumbered when the tram <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> removed.|$|R
50|$|Today both <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> {{still in}} use. The station offices on the {{eastbound}} <b>platform</b> <b>are</b> still standing but unused; on the westbound <b>platform</b> there <b>is</b> a waiting shelter.|$|R
5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
5|$|Rogerstone {{station is}} miles (2km) {{southeast}} of Risca and Pontymister station, and miles (6km) {{northwest of the}} South Wales Main Line. The station has one platform: the line reverts to single track after having passed Risca. Near the <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> a pick up/set down lay-by. Rogerstone station's car park has 64 spaces.|$|E
5|$|The Cuckoo Line closed {{shortly after}} the Hospital Railway. Hellingly station closed to {{passengers}} on 14June 1965, and the line closed for goods traffic on 26April 1968. The station building complete with <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> now a private residence, and the Cuckoo Line trackbed was converted to the Cuckoo Trail long-distance footpath in 1990. Much of {{the route of the}} Hospital Railway is also now a footpath.|$|E
50|$|In {{more recent}} times, viewing <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> {{installed}} above the original roof line of number 2 wharf shed. The <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> used {{as part of}} the terminal facilities for overseas passengers. These <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> removed sometime in 1998 or 1999.|$|R
5000|$|... 1990—The <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> extended, and the {{crosswalk}} {{between the}} <b>platforms</b> <b>was</b> removed as the station building was renovated.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} 3 {{platforms}} and 5 tracks. The <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> connected by Foot Over Bridge. These <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> built to accumulate 24 coaches express train. The <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> equipped with modern facility like display board of arrival and departure of trains.|$|R
5|$|The DLM {{appeals for}} {{administrative}} {{reform in the}} public sector through a decentralization, modernization, and mechanization plan. It defends human rights and calls for the respect of public freedoms and rule of law. Listed within its <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> support for the marginalized and the abandonment of divisive particularism. The movement supports prohibiting the discrimination of the disabled.|$|E
5|$|The {{brick wall}} around the <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> in a {{considerably}} preserved state as well, although {{parts of it}} have broken off. It is quite thickand was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides. There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, {{the side of the}} upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is the side of the lower platform.|$|E
5|$|The main {{access to}} the station is from Station Road to the east, however {{there is also a}} set of steps and a {{turnstile}} into the industrial estate to the west. Facilities at the station are minimal – there are small brick shelters on each platform, but no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms, as well as dot-matrix displays showing the next trains on each platform. A pay and display car park with 15 spaces, and racks for four bicycles, are {{on the east side of}} the station on Station Road. CCTV cameras are in operation at the station. Access to the eastern <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> step-free from the car park, however there is no step-free access to trains. The only public {{access to the}} western <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> via the stepped footbridge.|$|E
50|$|The <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> the IND's usual {{length of}} 660 feet, and {{the width of}} the <b>platforms</b> <b>is</b> 16 feet.|$|R
50|$|GM's Kappa <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} by the Y-body. The distinctive feature of both <b>platforms</b> <b>is</b> the backbone central-tunnel design.|$|R
50|$|The two <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> numbered; <b>Platform</b> 1 <b>is</b> for London-bound trains, <b>Platform</b> 2 <b>is</b> for trains for Basingstoke (and beyond).|$|R
5|$|The other fare {{control area}} at the station's east (railroad north) end, {{accessed}} by a ramp to the <b>platform,</b> <b>is</b> unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and two staircases {{going up to the}} northwest and southeast corners of East 205th Street and Perry Avenue. The token booth at this location was closed on July 30, 2005 and removed sometime afterward.|$|E
5|$|The {{southbound}} <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> {{adjacent to}} the station building, and its high-level section requires crossing only a lightly used spur of State Street. However, access to the northbound platform requires crossing both Northeast Corridor tracks. The footbridge to the planned Coast Guard Museum will allow access to the northbound platform without crossing tracks, which will improve safety and prevent passengers from being trapped on the platform by stopped trains.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population {{to care for the}} Earth. However, the VHEMT <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt around 1920. Before that the “home” <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> located {{next to the}} {{entrance}} building and other <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> reached by crossing the tracks. During the rebuilding, island <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> built {{on either side of}} the station building, which are reached by a tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The sub-surface Circle and District line <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> {{opened on}} 1 October 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR) {{as part of}} its {{extension}} from Paddington to Gloucester Road. The Central line <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> opened on 30 July 1900 by the Central London Railway (CLR). Entrances to the two sets of <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> originally via separate station buildings {{on opposite sides of the}} road and access to the CLR <b>platforms</b> <b>was</b> originally via lifts.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{buildings}} and <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> refurbished over the Christmas 2011 break and reopened on 24 January 2012. At {{a cost of}} over $320,000 both <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> resurfaced, the southbound <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> strengthened and the access path to it upgraded (the first refurbishment since the station opened in 1963).|$|R
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E
5|$|Built for the {{protection}} of a small stupa, the structure has two stone platforms decorated with elaborate stone carvings. The lower <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> entered through a single entrance facing the north, while the second platform can be accessed through four doorways facing the four cardinal points. The upper platform, surrounded by a brick wall, contains the stupa. Four Buddha statues are seated around it, each facing one of the entrances. Three concentric rows of stone columns had also been positioned here, presumably to support a wooden roof. The entire structure is decorated with stone carvings. Some of the carvings at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage, such as its sandakada pahanas, are considered to be the best examples of such architectural features. Although some archaeologists have suggested that it also had a wooden roof, this theory is disputed by others.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the nearly-40-year-old {{station and the}} older {{platforms}} were crumbling. Since the Newburyport/Rockport line {{was no longer a}} freight clearance route past the General Electric plant in West Lynn, a full-length high-level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms. The wide platform occupies the width of one former island platform plus one track slot, with the line's two current tracks on each side. The 800-foot-long <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> located west of the older low platforms, which are still extant on the viaduct. A 930-space parking garage with a drop-off lane was built off Market Street; buses continued to use the former busway on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square. Entrances to the platform are available from the garage and from Central Square. The new facility opened on January 21, 1992.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} station {{only had}} one platform serving the Moretonhampstead branch. In 1927 this <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> extended and a new passing loop and <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> provided for down trains came into use on 24 May 1927. Both <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> signalled for reversible running until 1943 when the crossover was removed.|$|R
50|$|The Shinkansen <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> {{opened on}} October 1, 2003, to relievecongestion at Tokyo Station. <b>Platforms</b> <b>are</b> {{on the east}} side of the station.|$|R
50|$|The Belfast-bound <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} {{during summer}} 2011 to allow longer trains to operate. The Larne-bound <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> similarly refurbished in early 2012.|$|R
5|$|In February 2017, UBS Group AG and the Northern Trust Corporation, an American {{international}} financial services company, announced an agreement for {{the acquisition of}} UBS Asset Management's fund administration servicing units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. This acquisition will facilitate {{the expansion of the}} Northern Trust Corporation into these two countries, turning the American company into the major fund administrator in the local markets and into one of the ten global leaders in the sector. At the end of the transaction, expected for the second half of 2017, the American company will administrate a total of CHF420 billion in assets. UBS Asset Management will continue anyway to offer Management Company, White Labelling and Representative Services to its clients. Ulrich Körner, president of the UBS Asset Management, affirms that the continuous transformation of their <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> due to a major efficiency, effectiveness and geographical dislocation of the services offered by the bank.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> {{the only one of the}} four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others by deep level walkways. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line platform {{was taken}} out of use and the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve {{the north side of the}} island platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island platform. The disused <b>platform</b> <b>is</b> used for Art on the Underground installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E
50|$|In June 2015, the {{outbound}} <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> {{removed to}} make way for the busway construction. A temporary asphalt <b>platform</b> <b>was</b> placed between the tracks.|$|R
50|$|In September 1967, the <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> {{extended}} to accommodate eight-car trains, and the <b>platforms</b> <b>were</b> again extended in November 1976 to accommodate ten-car trains.|$|R
50|$|North Korean <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> {{standardized}} at 1250 mm only. In there, 1250 mm is the norm, lower-level <b>platforms</b> <b>are</b> already {{raised to}} this height.|$|R
