In this paper, a special slope volute was proposed to reduce vibration level of centrifugal pump. The goal of this paper was to analyze vibration characteristics of slope <b>volute</b> <b>pump</b> and provide a new method to reduce vibration energy in centrifugal pump. Experiments were carried out to obtain vibration signals at different flow rates of slope <b>volute</b> <b>pump,</b> which were compared with conventional spiral <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Results show that vibration level is closely related to flow structure interior pump. At low flow rates, especially, vibration energy increases rapidly with the onset of rotating stall. Rotor-stator interaction mechanism changes when adopting slope volute. In slope <b>volute</b> <b>pump,</b> the peaks in power spectra correspond to different harmonics of fBPF at three measuring directions; however, in spiral <b>volute</b> <b>pump,</b> the predominant components always correspond to 2 fBPF.

40|$|Laser {{velocimetry}} {{measurements were}} taken in a double volute/single discharge centrifugal pump (0. 60 specific speed, 1583 US units) with symmetrical volute halves. Blade-to-blade radial and tangential velocity profiles at the impeller exit are presented and compared to data for a similar single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Flow rates ranged from 40 % of design flow to the design point. The blade-to-blade profiles were more uniform than for the single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Also, the average circumferential variations for the double <b>volute</b> <b>pump</b> were more symmetric than for the single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> For the double volute geometry measurements indicate that radial inward flow (recirculation) was only present for flow rates below 60 % of design flow, compared to 80 % of design flow for the single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Velocity data was also used to determine volute losses, slip factor, and momentum contributions to the impeller radial forces. Volute losses were quantified and shown to increase for flow rates below 80 % of design flow and were approximately 10 % of the developed head at 40 % flow. The efficiency in the double volute compared to the single volute shows decreased performance for flows above 55 % of design flow, which is attributed to increased boundary layer friction; at low flow rates increased performance is ascribed to better control over the recirculation regions. Slip factors were symmetric around the volute but were lower than for a single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Finally, momentum contributions to the total impeller radial load were shown to be maximum at the design point, contributing 40 % of the force developed by the pressure distribution; the significance diminished at lower flow rates and the contribution was negligible at 40 % of the design flow...|$|R

This study provides laser velocimetry measurements of the flow field within a centrifugal pump. The pump had a shrouded impeller of 254 mm diameter with five blades of backswept design. Measurements were made using a laser-two-focus (L 2 F) velocimetry system, both within the rotating impeller passages and in the <b>pump</b> <b>volute.</b> Both design operating conditions and off-design conditions were investigated. A comparison was made with a previous study, wherein measurements of the flow field were completed within the same pump, with an open face impeller. The absolute velocity, relative velocity, and turbulence kinetic energy levels were measured. The flow field within the impeller passages for the shrouded case was notably more uniform than for the unshrouded case. In addition, the turbulence kinetic energy within the passages was substantially lower. The efficiency of the shrouded pump was, however, lower than the unshrouded version. This was attributed primarily to losses due to leakage in the clearance region between the impeller shroud and the pump casing; a rather large passage was necessary to permit optical access. Velocimetry measurements were successfully made in the clearance region, and a leakage flow calculation was made...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith a {{decrease}} in orders for their regular standard cargo-pump for chemical tankers, Frank Mohn Fusa started developing a new cargo-pump for the Offshore Supply Vessel market. This meant designing a pump which both {{should be able to}} pump high viscous oil-emulsion and a fluid called drilling-mud, which is a mixture of salt-water and small particles of barite stone. The first test performed when the thesis started showed that their initial design would not withstand the erosion from the particles for a long enough period of time; this because both the pump impeller and the <b>pump</b> <b>volute</b> casing suffered from heavy erosion. This master thesis has the objective of first quantifying the erosion in the original design and then comparing the CFD-simulations with real physical tests. From these results, together with analytical estimations of the erosion on the components and in compliance with erosion and fluid mechanical theory, a recommendation for a new design will be given. CFD-results for this new design will also be given. There is also a focus on finding the areas where erosion often occurs. Recommendations for material choice and coating are given for the original design. The results from the impeller simulations show that there are still some unknown variables in the prediction of erosion in CFD. While the steady state simulation differs quite much from the physical test, the transient simulation gives a better prediction for the pump impeller. It is found that the boundary layer in the grid has a large influence for the prediction of particle erosion. For the impeller it is found that the new design is a better solution than the original open impeller in regards to erosion rates, both at full-load and in the best efficiency point, while they are almost equal at part-load. The result from the pumps volute casing gives a good representation of the measured erosion from the physical test. The volute casings inlet tongue in the original design is a region where design changes are needed, since it has a high erosion rate caused by high velocity and high impinging angle. The new volute casing designed in this thesis, where the volume expansion is changed from radial to axial, gives better results, having approximately three times less maximum erosion rate at the inlet tongue. The analytical model used in this thesis gives a good estimation for some of the surfaces, while others differs to some degree from the CFD calculations. This is mainly caused by forces acting on the particles that are not accounted for in the analytical model. </p...|$|E

40|$|Future space {{missions}} {{will require}} reusable engine platforms {{which in some}} instances will necessitate deep-engine throttling thrust capability. This is accomplished through the off-design operation of the engine fuel pumps. At off-design conditions, there are additional losses associated with centrifugal turbopump operation, leading to inefficiencies and poor pump performance. Future turbopump designs will incorporate various design changes/innovations to address these inefficiencies. Therefore a means to accurately evaluate proposed designs over extended operating ranges is required. The Centrifugal Pump Analysis Code (CPAC) provides this means. CPAC is a one-dimensional meanline analysis code which provides design and off-design performance predictions based on pump geometry and operating conditions.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{data obtained}} on 241 -SY- 101 pump performance. The period covered is January 1 through March 31, 1999. During the quarter: There were changes in pumping parameters. Both the <b>pump</b> <b>volute</b> pressure and amperage decreased during the quarter. It {{is not clear}} whether this was due to changes in waste properties (due to less solids or more entrained gas) or due to degradation of the pump. There was an indication of a 7. 5 -inch increase in the waste level at riser 1 A, and an average growth rate of 0. 082 inches per day. There was an indication of a 5. 7 -inch increase in the waste level at riser 1 C. This riser was flushed with water several times, which would lower the level of the crust at this location. Gases continued to be released at less than the pre-pump installation baseline rate, indicating a decrease in the gas generation rate, or an increase in gas retention, or both. The release rate was about 78 percent of the rate in the previous few quarters, and only 34 percent of the generation rate calculated prior to mixer pump installation in 1993. Key controls exist for waste temperature, gas concentration, pump parameters, and long-term waste behavior associated with the safe operation of the mixer pump that mitigates the buoyant displacement gas release event behavior of 241 -SY- 101. Table 1 - 1 compares the key controls and {{the current state of the}} waste as of March 3 1. 1999. The pump was run 28 times between January 1 and March 31, 1999. All of the pump runs were intended to be normal 25 -minute, 1000 -rpm excavation runs performed to mix the waste and release gas. Because of the pump oil often reached the high temperature alarm setpoint of 190 F, many of the runs were shortened (by as many as 8 minutes). This phenomenon was identified in November 1998, but got progressively worse over the quarter. The pump schedule was nominally three runs per week. However, core sampling activities interrupted the usual pump schedule several times during the quarter, resulting in less pump runs than normal. There is evidence that the pump is not operating the same as it has in previous years. Pump power and volute pressure have both been reduced. It {{is not clear whether}} this is a result of pump degradation or whether the fluid parameters of the waste have changed (less solids or more entrained gas) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of centrifugal pumps can generate instabilities and pressure pulsations {{that may be}} detrimental to the integrity and performance of the pump. Until recently these pressure pulsations could only be determined experimentally {{which resulted in a}} limited understanding of pressure pulsations around the pump. Industrial pump guarantees are limited to pulsation levels measured at the discharge. However, numerical analysis techniques have advanced to such a stage that they can now be used to explore these effects. The multi-block, structured grid CFD code TASCflow was used to investigate the time variation of pressure within a complete centrifugal pump. A parametric study covered four geometric parameters, namely the cutwater gap, vane arrangement, snubber gap and the sidewall clearance. Taguchi methods allowed the number of transient analyses to be limited to a total of twenty seven. Three flow rates were investigated and the pulsations were extracted at fifteen different locations covering important pump regions. The velocity flow patterns from the transient analyses exhibited important features that were in agreement with two independent sources. The transient flow results compared reasonably with the Weir experimental tests and clearly indicated the pump locations experiencing the largest pulsation levels. It was also noted that monitoring pulsations at the top dead centre of the <b>pump</b> <b>volute</b> casing would provide a better indication of internal pump pulsations than monitoring at the discharge. Taguchi post-processing analysis tools were used to rank the relative importance of the four geometric parameters at each location for each flow rate. The cutwater gap and vane arrangement were found to exert the greatest influence across the various monitored locations and the flow range. However the snubber gap had a dominant influence on the pressure differential across the impeller shroud and pulses in the pressure differential were evident at reduced flows. Through a rationalisation process reductions in pressure pulsations aimed at increased component life and reduced noise/vibration have resulted in a single recommended geometric arrangement. Further analyses confirmed that the new arrangement did indeed produce lesser pulsations levels. Multiple steady state simulations were analysed to determine if they were a viable substitute for the transient analyses. However it was demonstrated that the steady state pulsations did not adequately capture the magnitude and phase of the pulsations shown by the transient results. Likewise the steady state analyses were unable to predict trends for two differing pump geometries. In order to identify the implications of the CFD data for mechanical integrity, the pressure differential predicted by the transient analyses was compared with the pressure loadings currently utilised in Weir design guidelines; this resulted in a new recommendation for use in future designs. Also finite element analyses were conducted using four pressure loadings taken from the numerical results and a centrifugal loading. These supported the recommendation for an increased loading {{to be used in the}} design guidelines. The stress levels at the impeller outlet were found to be extremely sensitive to the snubber gap. The completion of this project has allowed a useful set of recommendations to be made regarding the design of high head double entry pumps...|$|E

In addition, one of the standard pumps in Tank 50 H exhibits high seal leakage and vibration. SRS Liquid Waste requested Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility of mixing the contents of Tank 50 H with one to three standard slurry pumps. To determine the pump requirements to mix solids with liquids in Tank 50 H, the author reviewed the pilot-scale blending work performed for the Small Column Ion Exchange Process (SCIX), SRNL computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, Tank 50 H operating experience, and the technical literature, and applied the results to Tank 50 H to determine the number, size, and operating parameters of pumps needed to mix the solid particles with the liquid in Tank 50 H. The analysis determined pump requirements to suspend the solids with no 'dead zones', but did not determine the pump requirements to produce a homogeneous suspension.

The design of the tongue region of the centrifugal pump casing plays an important role in influencing the pump performance and cavitation.

Practically, at the site location it was observed that the crack was formed at the tongue region when the casing was tested under hydrostatic pressure. Static linear analysis is performed to identify the critical zone where the maximum stress occurs that causes failure. Maximum stress is observed at the tongue region. To reduce the maximum stress, ribs thickness was increased in addition to increasing the portion of the volute thickness.

The {{results show that the}} fluid force varies with the flow rate and shape of the volute, that the fluctuations of fluid force decrease with increasing flow rate and that the vibratory movement of the impeller is more efficiently suppressed in a narrow volute...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} pressure fluctuation of a single-suction volute-type centrifugal <b>pump,</b> particularly <b>volute</b> casing, by using numerical and experimental methods. A new type of hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes/Large Eddy Simulation, {{referred to as the}} shear stress transport-scale-adaptive simulation (SAS) model, is employed to study the unsteady flow. Statistical analysis method is adopted to show the pressure fluctuation intensity distribution in the volute channel. A test rig for pressure pulsation measurement is built to validate the numerical simulation results using eight transient pressure sensors in the middle section of the volute wall. Results show that the SAS model can accurately predict the inner flow field of centrifugal pumps. Radial force acting on the impeller presents a star distribution related to the blade number. Pressure fluctuation intensity is strongest near the tongue and shows irregular distribution in the pump casing. Pressure fluctuation is distributed symmetrically at the cross-section of the volute casing because the volute can eliminate the rotational movement of the liquid discharged from the impeller. Blade passing frequency and its multiples indicate the dominant frequency of the monitoring points within the volute, and the low-frequency pulsation, particularly in the shaft component, increases when it operates at off-design condition, particularly with a small flow rate. The reason is that the vortex wave is enhanced at the off-design condition, which has an effect on the axle and is presented in the shaft component in the frequency domain...|$|R
40|$|Multistage Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) undergo {{performance}} degradation when operating with highly viscous fluids. Several studies {{on this subject}} seek to provide models to predict the pump performance under such conditions. However, some of those models require knowledge of geometric parameters or are only designated for radial-type pumps. In this article, dimensional analysis is used {{as an alternative to}} analyse head and flow rate degradation of different pumps without the need of any major geometric parameters. To accomplish this task, head curves for two multistage, mixed-flow type ESPs are obtained through a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program {{for a wide range of}} viscosities and different rotational speeds. The numerical head curves were compared with experimental data under equivalent operating conditions and a good agreement was found. When adequate normalisations are used together with relevant dimensionless numbers, the head values obtained from the different ESPs proved to match quite well along curves of constant specific speeds. Experimental head values from literature for a radial-type centrifugal <b>pump</b> with <b>volute</b> operating with different fluid viscosities were used to extend the present analysis for a different pump geometry. Results from this procedure turned out to match the ESPs data well. A straightforward expression to correlate head and flow rate correction factors due to viscosity follows from the present approach, thus yielding a useful tool that might help in proposing a general method to estimate {{performance degradation}}...|$|R
40|$|A double {{volute casing}} {{is widely used}} to balance the radial thrust of {{centrifugal}} pumps, but the optimum volute configuration {{has not yet been}} determined. The {{purpose of this study is}} to search for the optimum design of a double volute, and several configurations have been investigated. Experiment using the double volute of two-dimensional shape has been performed to investigate the internal flow characteristics, and the changes of both pump overall performances and radial thrust due to the difference of volute configuration have been measured and discussed. The results showed that the best efficiency point of the double <b>volute</b> <b>pump</b> shifts to 90 % design flow rate and the main reason of the performance drop by the double volute is attributed to the mixing loss at the volute outlet. The outer channel flow is not effective as the diffuser and the pump performance can be improved by changing the inner volute wall configuration. And the optimum design of a double volute is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Pump {{efficiency}} drops rapidly with {{a decrease}} in specific speed n_s in the very low n_s range. In order to improve a pump efficiency and to establish the optimum design method of a <b>volute</b> <b>pump</b> of very low specific speed around n_s= 60 ～ 70 [m, m^ 3 /min, rpm], several combinations of centrifugal impeller and volute casing were tested. The {{results showed that the}} maximum efficiency is largely influenced by the volute design parameters, such as a volute tongue, a volute width and a gap between the impeller exit and the volute tongue, while the maximum efficiency differs little by the design of impeller. The BEP of a very low n_s pump agrees well with the designed discharge of a volute and is far form that of an impeller. With {{a decrease in}} the space between an impeller and a volute-tongue, the pump efficiency increases, and the pressure fluctuation due to interference does not increase, which is quite different from usual n_s pumps...|$|R
