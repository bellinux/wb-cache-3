Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil <b>purification</b> <b>plant,</b> which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century the number of {{companies}} using the railroad for shipping on Chicago's near north side declined severely. In the 1970s customers at the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine Water <b>Purification</b> <b>Plant.</b> The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part of the right of way and the spur to Navy Pier was abandoned. Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position. On December 12, 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E

5|$|While Hudah {{was located}} in the Mozambique Channel, the cyclone was {{expected}} to cause flood conditions in the Mozambican provinces of Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and potentially Zambezia. Even prior to Hudah, Mozambique was already facing a widespread flood and resultant humanitarian crisis; conditions which were further exacerbated by three tropical cyclones which impacted the country within the previous four months. The Instituto Nacional de Gestão de Calamidades(INGC) warned residents in potentially affected areas to take precautionary measures and secure fishing boats. The South African National Defense Force(SANDF) maintained 50soldiers and other military personnel {{and a number of}} aircraft to monitor the ongoing floods in Mozambique and potential impacts from Hudah. An Australian contingency held operations for a hospital and water <b>purification</b> <b>plant</b> in Chibuto to assist potentially affected populations. Multiple other relief organizations began to supply Mozambique with relief supplies due to the threat of the impending storm. The UN World Food Programme(WFP) sent 1,000tonnes (1,100short tons) of food to Nampula Province and 500tonnes (550short tons) of food to Quelimane Province. The WFP also placed relief aircraft on standby. The Mozambican Ministry of Health sent 30tents and 10rolls of plastic to Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia provinces. The United States Agency for International Development(USAID) dispatched a group of 12-member search and rescue team to Maputo in order to train local relief crews.|$|E

As {{a result of}} the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water <b>purification</b> <b>plant</b> to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water.

The largest spring, called Susakadā, covered all areas of Miyakojima; but after the drought of 1971, the water source of Sodeyama was developed. After the drought of 1993, water sources of Ōno, Nyātsu, Sokohara were developed. There are Sodeyama <b>Purification</b> <b>Plant</b> and Kajidō <b>Purification</b> <b>Plant,</b> and service {{reservoirs}} are at Hisamatsu, Shijō, Karimata and Bora. Two underground reservoirs were completed in 1989 in Susakadā, both 40,000 cubic meters. The water in Miyakojima is hard water, which is unsatisfactory both in taste and in the handling of metallic tableware. In 1999, adjustments to the pH were started at Sodeyama with water softening using lime softening in a pellet-reactor.

2500|$|The US$8.2 million Clean Drinking Water Initiative, {{approved}} in 2004, {{provides for the}} construction of 445 water purification plants of 2,000 gallons per hour in all Pakistani tehsils. The Ministry of Environment is to [...] "provide the technical support to the provinces by installing various plants at selected places on turn key basis and then handing it over to local municipal administration." [...] The plants would be installed in [...] "public places", which together with the limited capacity of the plants suggests that the purified water is not to be used for network supply, but rather for distribution as bottled water. The much larger US$168 million Clean Drinking Water for All Programme aims at delivering one <b>purification</b> <b>plant</b> to each Pakistani Union Council. The plants are expected to be maintained through contracting out for three subsequent years. It is estimated that one <b>purification</b> <b>plant</b> will serve 2-20% of each Union Council's population, which on average have 20,000 inhabitants. Under the programme, the establishment of 6,035 purification plants with capacities of 500, 1,000 and 2,000 gallons per hour is planned.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn 1994, 28 sewage <b>purification</b> <b>plants</b> {{based on}} common reed Phragmites australis were analyzed, to study {{fragmentation}} effects on diversity and on food web structure of insect communities. <b>Purification</b> <b>plants</b> differed in age (2 to 11 years) and area (10 to 2, 500 m 2). Both age and area were {{significantly correlated with}} species richness of herbivores. Populations {{of the two most}} abundant herbivores, the gall makers Lipara pullitarsis (Diptera, Chloropidae) and Giraudiella inclusa (Diptera, Cecidomyiidae), increased significantly with age and size of the Phragmites habitats, i. e. the <b>purification</b> <b>plants.</b> Incidence curves showed that only habitats older than 6 years and larger than 100 m 2 have a 50 % probability of finding these two most abundant gall makers, and can correspondingly be considered to contribute to insect species conservation. Natural enemies were even more susceptible to habitat fragmentation than their phytophagous hosts or prey, thereby hampering possible biocontrol. Percent parasitism of both the Lipara and Giraudiella gall makers significantly increased with habitat age...|$|R

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of water {{which is the}} basic condition of human living and economy becomes a more and more up-to-date problem for all humanity. The situation is growing worse {{because of the fact}} that with the social-economic development the demand for water increases but the water resources decrease and the water contamination increases at a terrifying rate. The struggle for clean water can be observed in abolishing of the main sources of contamination and in an effective water economy in all branches of the national economy. The problem becomes particularly significant in the water deficient areas with unfavourable hydrologic-meteorologic conditions where it is necessary to transport water from long distances. The main source of water supply are first of all surface flow waters and they ought to be the subject of great care and protection because of their destination particularly for drinking purposes but meanwhile they are the basic sewage collectors and they show a high level of contamination. In our country only about 50 % of sewages are purified because of the small number of <b>purification</b> <b>plants</b> as well as their inefficiency. The building of <b>purification</b> <b>plants</b> is an invest-consuming undertaking. The building of new industrial-municipal <b>purification</b> <b>plants</b> creates the necessity to invest considerable amounts of money on the factories producing prefabricated elements.

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} {{the prevalence of}} Acanthamoeba in drinking water treatment plants {{during the course of}} the purification processes. Methods Samples were taken from two drinking water <b>purification</b> <b>plants</b> and monitored for the presence of Acanthamoeba in order to estimate the removal capacity of treatment methods employed. Water samples were collected at each step in the purification, during the one year survey, and analysed for the presence of Acanthamoeba spp. by plating on bacterial-seeded plates. Results : The results showed that amoebae were present in surface raw waters in 100 % of the samples tested. Acanthamoeba spp. were isolated from 71 % and 57 % of the water samples collected from post flat-bottom clarifier 1 and post-sedimentation plant respectively. Considering the outflow drinking waters, the removal capacity was 100 % in both <b>purification</b> <b>plants</b> monitored. The occurrence of Acanthamoeba was not associated with seasonality. Conclusion : These findings confirm that water <b>purification</b> <b>plants</b> employing methods of flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration in combination with activated charcoal filtration, ozonisation and chlorination exhibited sufficient Acanthamoeba removal capacity and the presence of amoebae in the tap water may be due to older plumbing, water storage tanks, tap water hygiene, and/or environmental settings...|$|R
