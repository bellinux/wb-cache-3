40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Pachydermoperiostosis</b> or primary hypertrophic osteoathropathy {{is a rare}} {{genetic disease}} with {{autosomal}} transmission. This disorder, which affects both bones and skin, is characterized by the association of dermatologic changes (pachydermia or thickening of the skin) and rheumatologic manifestations (periostosis and finger clubbing). Here, we report a new observation of <b>pachydermoperiostosis.</b> Case presentation A 20 -year-old North African Tunisian Caucasian man presented with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. On a clinical examination, we found morphologic abnormalities of his face and extremities associated with skin changes. The laboratory findings were normal. A work-up disclosed no organic etiology. The final diagnosis consisted of <b>pachydermoperiostosis</b> syndrome.

40|$|<b>Pachydermoperiostosis</b> or primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is an {{uncommon}} disease of acromegaloid facial feature, but characterized by unique phenotype (digital clubbing and pachydermia) and distinctive radiographic appearances like periostosis. We experienced a case with complete form of <b>pachydermoperiostosis</b> accompanied by heart failure. He presented with typical features consisting of clubbing with {{enlargement of the}} hand, thickening of facial skin and periosteal new bone formation involving lower leg.

40|$|Five {{patients}} with <b>pachydermoperiostosis</b> are described. Three ofthem showed the incomplete form, and two the forme fruste. Four {{of the five}} patients showed #{ 225 }cro-osteolysis, a finding which is not well recognised in this syndrome. The natural history ofthe disease is reviewed, and the differential diagnosis is discussed, with particular reference to hypertrophic pulmonary osteo-arthropathy. <b>Pachydermoperiostosis</b> is an uncommon clinical condition, {{and as far as}} we can ascertain fewer than 100 cases have so far been described. Angel (1957) claimed to describe the first three cases in England. We have been unable to find any record of a description of <b>pachydermoperiostosis</b> with acro-osteolysis, although this association is mentioned in textbooks by Kreel (1971) and Taybi (1975).

40|$|<b>Pachydermoperiostosis</b> (primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy) is a {{very rare}} genetic disease {{characterized}} by pachydermia, periostosis, arthralgia, and finger clubbing. Its pathophysiology is still unclear, but previous studies have reported connective tissue hypertrophy in the skin of these patients. We investigated the synthesis of collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycans by fibroblasts from affected and unaffected skin from one patient with <b>pachydermoperiostosis</b> and four normal donors. We found that collagen synthesis was largely decreased in fibroblasts from the diseased skin, whereas the synthesis of the small dermatan-sulfate-containing proteoglycan decorin strongly increased. Fibroblasts from the unaffected skin of the patient exhibited syntheses of these macromolecules similar to control fibroblasts from healthy donors. Northern blot and dot blot analyses showed decreased pro α 1 (I) collagen in patient's affected and unaffected skin fibroblasts whereas increased decorin mRNA levels were found in fibroblasts from the patient's affected skin. No change in cell proliferation was observed. These data demonstrate an alteration of fibroblast biosynthetic activity in the skin lesions of <b>pachydermoperiostosis,</b> which may be responsible, at least in part, for the patient's phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Touraine-Solente-Gole syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>pachydermoperiostosis,</b> is {{transmitted}} as an autosomal recessive trait. It is characterized by enlargement of fingers and toes, pachyderma, excessive sweating, and pain. In this paper, we present a 9 -year-old patient to attract attention to this rare disease. A 9 -year-old female patient was brought to our outpatient clinics with sweating and enlargement of hands and feet. She was the fourth child born to consanguineous parents. Her 26 -year-old elder sister also had the same symptoms. Her physical examination revealed clubbing of the hands, and thick and sweating fingers. Her test results were unremarkable. Hand x-ray revealed epiphyseal, and metaphyseal thickening of the hands, and periostal hyperosteosis. <b>Pachydermoperiostosis</b> usually begins in childhood, progresses till 20 years of age, then, ceases. Delayed closure of fontanelles, and patent ductus arteriosus may be symptoms of the disease. Patients with deletions and mutations in HPGD (15 -hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase) gene (4 q 33 -q 34) demonstrate this phenotype. This syndrome is more frequent in females, and mimics rheumatic diseases. Ibuprofen therapy {{may be used for}} bone pain. Colchicine is the alternative treatment.

40|$|A case of <b>pachydermoperiostosis</b> characterised by the {{presence}} of finger clubbing, periostosis, sweating of hands and feet is described. Modifications of capillaroscopic pattern and of arteriovenous anastomoses are reported. The periungual border and finger tip tissue showed diffuse endothelial hyperplasia, hyalinosis, and sclerosis with packing of collagen fibres. Electron microscopy showed hypertrophic and activated endothelia (numerous and hypertrophic Golgi complexes, several Weibel-Palade bodies, vesicles of micropinocytosis, and glycogen particles), the basal membrane thickened and reduplicated, perivasal infiltrate in superficial derma, reticulation and segmentary reduplication of basal membrane in arteriovenous shunt.

40|$|<b>Pachydermoperiostosis</b> {{is a rare}} osteo-cutaneous disease {{characterized}} by hypertrophy of bones and surrounding soft tissues. The cutaneous manifestations include coarsening of facial features, cutis verticis gyrata, digital clubbing, hyperhydrosis and seborrhoea. The pathogenetic mechanism of the disease is still debated, and proposed aetiological factors include genetic influences, anomalies in fibroblast activity, or alteration in peripheral blood flow. We studied a patient with the incomplete form of <b>pachydermoperiostosis,</b> assessing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and sex hormone steroid receptors (SR) in the affected skin, and also evaluating the urinary excretion of EGF. The results showed high levels of nuclear steroid receptors, increased cytosolic oestrogen receptors, and no detectable progesterone and androgen cytosolic receptors. EGF-R was also undetectable, and the urinary excretion of EGF was elevated. These {{findings suggest that the}} increased tissue sensitivity to circulating sex-steroids could induce enhanced tissue EGF/transforming growth factor Î± (TGF-Î±) production and utilization.

40|$|Sclerosing bone {{disorders}} can be subdivided {{according to}} their clinical presentation, the primarily affected cell type, and the cellular pathways.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{determine}} the genetic basis of two interesting syndromes, segregating in large pedigrees. These syndromes presented with interesting features including some ENT problems that formed part of the presenting phenotype. Better understanding of the molecular basis of these conditions might explain the pleiotropic effects of mutation in a single gene on various tissues in the body. The specific conditions being studied were (a) <b>Pachydermoperiostosis</b> (Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy, PHO) and (b) a novel syndrome with mental retardation, epilepsy, spastic paraplegia, sensorineural hearing loss and early onset obesity. 2. 1 <b>Pachydermoperiostosis</b> (Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy) Introduction: Affected individuals belonging to consanguineous families with PHO came to my attention because of features such as thickening of facial and scalp skin leading to aesthetic facial deformities. Another phenotype in these families was digital clubbing, an ancient clinical sign, the aetiopathogenesis of which has been much debated but still remained unexplained at the molecular level. The {{aim of this}} project was to identify the PHO gene(s). Methods: Autozygosity mapping was used to identify the PHO gene. Results: The PHO gene was localized to chromosome 4 q 33 -q 34 and three novel biallelic inactivating mutations were identified in HPGD, encoding the enzyme 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. In two families segregating the HPGD mutations in a pseudo-dominant manner, affected patients were found to have marked clubbing and markedly elevated levels of urinary PGE 2, while heterozygous patients with mild or no clubbing had a more varied and moderate elevation in the level of urinary PGE 2. Conclusions: The fact that PHO results from persistently raised levels of PGE 2 secondary to deficiency of 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase suggests that hypertrophic osteoarthropathy secondary to other pathologies may also be mediated by altered prostaglandin metabolism. Mutation testing of HPGD and measurement of urinary PGE 2 levels may avoid morbidity from invasive searches for occult pathology in patients presenting with idiopathic clubbing.
