40|$|This paper {{considers}} three policy reforms {{current in}} Africa: financial liberalisation, consumer <b>price</b> <b>decontrol,</b> and trade liberalisation. It {{is argued that}} financial liberalisation is not only fiscally very costly, but that the gains from improved financial intermediation depend upon a prior fiscal improvement to reduce public indebtedness. It is therefore intrinsically a slow process. By contrast, <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> is straightforward, and in most severe cases, decontrol may remonetise transactions, actually increasing seigniorage. Trade liberalisation is analysed through a political economy model of foreign aid. Donor preferences are characterised by an offer curve, subject to which the government maximises. If the resulting outcome breaches macroeconomic compatibility, private agents respond by speculating. Whereas financial liberalisation is intrinsically difficult and <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> straightforward, trade liberalisation is shown to be highly sensitive to detailed policy design...|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{wellhead}} <b>price</b> <b>decontrols</b> {{that began in the}} late 1970 s and the development of open access pipelines in the 1980 s and 90 s, gas local distribution companies (LDCs) now have increased responsibility for their gas supplies and face an increasingly complex array of supply and capacity choices. Heretofore this responsibility had been share with the interstate pipelines that provide bundled firm gas supplies. Moreover, gas supply an deliverability (capacity) options have multiplied as the pipeline network becomes increasing interconnected and as new storage projects are developed. There is now a fully-functioning financial market for commodity price hedging instruments and, on interstate Pipelines, secondary market (called capacity release) now exists. As a result of these changes in the natural gas industry, interest in resource planning and computer modeling tools for LDCs is increasing. Although in some ways the planning time horizon has become shorter for the gas LDC, the responsibility conferred to the LDC and complexity of the planning problem has increased. We examine current gas resource planning issues {{in the wake of the}} Federal Energy Regulatory Commission`s (FERC) Order 636.

To assist us, we utilize a commercially-available dispatch and resource planning model and examine four types of resource planning problems: the evaluation of new storage resources, the evaluation of buyback contracts, the computation of avoided costs, and the optimal tradeoff between reliability and system costs.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} extensive {{new data}} on the legal independence of new central banks in 26 former socialist economies (FSE). This data is constructed using the codification system for measuring legal independence developed in Cukierman, Webb and Neyapti (1992) and in chapter 19 of Cukierman (1992). This makes it comparable with earlier data on central bank independence (CBI) in the industrial democracies and in, non FSE, developing countries and permits experimentation with alternative indices of CBI like those reviewed in Eijffinger and van Keulen (1995). The new indices of independence indicate that central bank (CB) reform in the FSE during the nineties has been quite ambitious. In spite of the large price shocks induced by the transformation from plan to market, reformers in those countries chose to create central banks with levels of legal independence that are substantially higher, on average, than those of developed economies during the eighties. Based on data from 1989 through 1998 {{the evidence in the}} paper suggests that CBI is unrelated to inflation during the early stages of liberalization. But for sufficiently high and sustained levels of liberalization, and controlling for variables like <b>price</b> <b>decontrols</b> and wars, legal CBI and inflation are significantly and negatively related. These findings are consistent with the view that legal CBI, no matter how high, cannot contain the powerful inflationary impact of wide scale liberalization of formerly controlled prices. But once the process of liberalization has gathered sufficient momentum legal independence becomes effective in slowing inflation down and the cumulative liberalization index developed by de Melo et. al. (1996) becomes relatively less important. The paper also presents evidence on factors that affect the level of CBI and examines the relation between inflation and CBI within a broader sample composed of the transition and of the developed economies. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} world markets, trade {{liberalisation}} and <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> have left smallholder farmers {{more vulnerable to}} the vagaries of market forces. Constraints such as poor technology, weak organisational structures and high transaction costs due to long and inefficient supply chain means that smallholders cannot compete with large corporations. Collective action which has been successfully applied within natural resources management if properly institutionalised among smallholder farmers can improve their marketing in a number of ways. It can reduce transaction costs of taking produce to the market; increase the smallholders’ bargaining power and enable them to access services that private sector or government are not readily willing to investigate. This paper uses the Sub Saharan Africa Challenge Programme panel data to investigate enabling factors for collective marketing. Based on these factors the paper discusses how Integrated Agriculture Research for Development (IAR 4 D) can be fashioned to improve upon collective marketing among smallholder farmers in Sub Saharan Africa...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the effects on real income and the price level of the 1973 - 1974 oil price {{increase}} are quite ambiguous on both theoretical and empirical grounds. The theoretical analysis reviews standard results and extends them to analyze the steady-state equilibrium and endogenous monetary policy reaction functions. It is shown that standard models and parameter values imply trivial reductions in real income and ambiguously signed changes in the price level. It is noted, however, that other special models can rationalize empirical findings of large effects. Direct real- oil-price effects in an extended Barro-Lucas real income equation are estimated for eight countries. Although statistically significant and substantial direct effects are found for about half the countries, {{it is noted that}} these coincided with countries undergoing <b>price</b> <b>decontrol</b> during 1973 - 1974.
