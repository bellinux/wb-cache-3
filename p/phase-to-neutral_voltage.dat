40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for characterizing voltage dips based on the space phasor model of the three <b>phase-to-neutral</b> <b>voltages,</b> instead of the {{individual}} voltages. This has several advantages. Using a K-means clustering algorithm, a multi-stage dip is separated into its individual event segments directly instead of first detecting the transition segments. The logistic regression algorithm fits the best single-segment characteristics to every individual segment, instead of extreme values being used for this, as in earlier methods. The method is validated by applying it to synthetic and measured dips. It can be generalized for application to both single- and multi-stage dips...|$|R

50|$|High-leg delta {{service is}} {{supplied}} {{in one of}} two ways. One is by a transformer having four wires coming out of the secondary, the three phases, plus a neutral connected as a center-tap on one of the windings. Another method requires two transformers. One transformer is connected to one phase of the overhead primary distribution circuit to provide the 'lighting' side of the circuit (this will be the larger of the two transformers), and a second transformer is connected to another phase on the circuit and its secondary is connected {{to one side of the}} 'lighting' transformer secondary, and the other side of this transformer is brought out as the 'high leg'. The voltages between the three phases are the same in magnitude, however the voltage magnitudes between a particular phase and the neutral vary. The <b>phase-to-neutral</b> <b>voltage</b> of two of the phases will be half of the phase-to-phase voltage. The remaining <b>phase-to-neutral</b> <b>voltage</b> will be √3/2 the phase-to-phase voltage. So if A-B, B-C and C-A are all 240 volts, then A-N and C-N will both be 120 volts, but B-N will be 208 volts.|$|E

Consequently, the <b>phase-to-neutral</b> <b>voltages</b> within the supply system will be unbalanced because the voltage at any point of a power system {{is the difference between}} the generated voltage and the voltage drops due to the load current. Due to the negative effects of unbalance currents and voltages, the necessity of studying the propagation phenomenon of this electric disturbance at different voltage levels becomes a pertinent aspect of power quality. This paper presents the propagation process of unbalance through the electric power system, upstream from the LV distribution level. Using the symmetrical components theory, transformers with different types of connections are studied thus conclusions are taken regards transformers influence on the unbalance propagation...|$|R

40|$|Multilevel {{converters}} {{provide an}} attractive solution {{to bring the}} benefits of speed-controlled rotational movement to high-power applications. Therefore, multilevel inverters have attracted wide interest in both the academic community and in the industry {{for the past two}} decades. In this doctoral thesis, modulation methods suitable especially for series connected H-bridge multilevel inverters are discussed. A concept of duty cycle modulation is presented and its modification is proposed. These methods are compared with other well-known modulation schemes, such as space-vector pulse width modulation and carrier-based modulation schemes. The advantage of the modified duty-cycle modulation is its algorithmic simplicity. A similar mathematical formulation for the original duty cycle modulation is proposed. The modified duty cycle modulation is shown to produce well-formed <b>phase-to-neutral</b> <b>voltages</b> that have lower total harmonic distortion than the space-vector pulse width modulation and the duty cycle modulation. The space-vector-based solution and the duty cycle modulation, on the other hand, result in a better-quality line-to-line voltage and current waveform. The voltage of the DC links in the modules of the series-connected H-bridge inverter are shown to fluctuate while they are under load. The fluctuation causes inaccuracies in the voltage production, which may result in a failure of the flux estimator in the controller. An extension for upper-level modulation schemes, which changes the switching instants of the inverter so that the output voltage meets the reference voltage accurately regardless of the DC link voltages, is proposed. The method is shown to reduce the error to a very low level when a sufficient switching frequency is used. An appropriate way to organize the switching instants of the multilevel inverter is to make only one-level steps at a time. This causes restrictions on the dynamical features of the modulation schemes. The produced voltage vector cannot be rotated several tens of degrees in a single switching period without violating the above-mentioned one-level-step rule. The dynamical capabilities of multilevel inverters are analyzed in this doctoral thesis, and it is shown that the multilevel inverters are capable of operating even in dynamically demanding metal industry applications. In addition to the discussion on modulation schemes, an overvoltage in multilevel converter drives caused by cable reflection is addressed. The voltage reflection phenomenon in drives with long feeder cables causes premature insulation deterioration and also affects the commonmode voltage, {{which is one of the}} main reasons for bearing currents. Bearing currents, on the other hand, cause fluting in the bearings, which results in premature bearing failure. The reflection phenomenon is traditionally prevented by filtering, but in this thesis, a modulationbased filterless method to mitigate the overvoltage in multilevel drives is proposed. Moreover, the mitigation method can be implemented as an extension for upper-level modulation schemes. The method exploits the oscillations caused by two consecutive voltage edges so that the sum of the oscillations results in a mitigated peak of the overvoltage. The applicability of the method is verified by simulations together with experiments with a full-scale prototype...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a new classification of voltage sags {{which is based}} on its types, characteristic voltage and zero-sequence component of voltage. It is extremely difficult to distinguish between the voltage sags which have same type, same characteristic voltage and same zero-sequence component of voltage due to load effects and hence such classification is significant. The proposed classification is mathematically justified by introducing two new indices, namely, <b>phase-to-neutral</b> and phase-to-phase <b>voltage</b> indices. Using the theoretical relation between these two indices, it has been revealed that the voltage sags which have the same type, same characteristic voltage and same zero-sequence component of voltages, have same mathematical relations. Further, to reveal the accuracy of the proposed classification and type detection, it is validated through recorded waveforms available in IEEE database, Scottish Power, data obtained from Matlab simulation under different conditions of voltage sags and data of real power station. In addition, the proposed classification and type detection are compared with other established algorithms for type detection of voltage sags. The comparative results show that the proposed classification not only removes the existing anomalies in the earlier proposals but also shows its superiority by presenting more accurate and less confusing results...|$|R
