Noble Druze men from nearby countries visited Druze villages in Palestine and preached neutrality. During {{the early days of the}} conflict, a meeting of all the noblemen from all the Druze villages was conducted in Daliyat al-Karmel, where they all agreed not to take part in the riots instigated by the Arab Higher Committee. This decision was backed by Druze leaders in Jabal al-Druze. In the Druze community there were opposing trends: In mixed Druze and Muslim villages such as Isfiya, Shefa-'Amr and Maghar where there were old sectarial disputes and in Druze villages near Haifa and the Jewish settlement in the western Galilee, the local Druze leaders tended to prefer the Jews in the conflict; at the Druze villages deep in Arab areas, the local leaders were more careful with support of the Jews. Josh Palmon was tasked by the Jewish Agency for Israel to manage the relationship with the Druze. He initially led a <b>preventive</b> <b>approach</b> with the Druze, aimed at making sure the Druze will not join the Arab Higher Committee.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{hormonal}} approaches for prevention of endometrial and breast cancers have been proposed. Because of the hormonal responsiveness of both tumors, much attention {{has focused on}} effects of exogenous hormone use. Although estrogens in hormone replacement therapy {{increase the risk of}} endometrial cancer, the disease is substantially reduced by long-term use of oral contraceptives. The issues with breast cancer are more complex, mainly because of a variety of unresolved effects. Long-term estrogen use is associated with some increase in breast cancer risk, and certain patterns of oral contraceptives appear to predispose to early-onset disease. With respect to estrogens, <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches</b> for both tumors would include use for as limited periods of time as possible. Addition of a progestin appears to lower estrogen-associated endometrial disease, but its effect on breast cancer risk remains less clear. Additional studies on effects of detailed usage parameters should provide useful insights into etiologic mechanisms. Other <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches</b> for endometrial cancer that may work through hormonal mechanisms include staying thin, being physically active, and maintaining a vegetarian diet. Breast cancer risk may possibly be reduced by extended periods of breastfeeding, restriction of intake of alcoholic beverages, remaining thin later in life, and being physically active. Additional research is needed to clarify the biologic mechanisms of these associations. The bridging of epidemiology with the biologic sciences should clarify many unresolved issues and lead to better <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches.</b> - Environ Health Perspect 103 (Suppl 8) : 185 - 189 (1995...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{review the}} {{evidence}} regarding prevention of Alzheimer disease (AD) {{in order to}} highlight the role of family medicine. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE Most of the evidence relating to prevention of AD is derived from observational (cross-sectional, case-control, or longitudinal) studies. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is available only for blood pressure control and for hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women. MAIN MESSAGE Many <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches</b> to AD have been identifi ed, but no RCTs support their effi cacy. Evidence from RCTs supports the eff ectiveness of blood pressure control in reducing incidence of AD, but demonstrates that postmenopausal women’s use of estrogen is ineff ective in reducing it. Observational studies suggest that some <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches,</b> such as healthy lifestyle, ongoing education, regular physical activity, and cholesterol control, {{play a role in}} prevention of AD. These approaches can and should be used for every patient because they carry no signifi cant risk. Currently, no eff ective pharmacologic interventions have been researched enough to support their use in prevention of AD. CONCLUSION Health professionals should educate patients, especially patients at higher risk of AD, about preventive strategies and potentially modifi able risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Lymphedema is {{characterized}} by generalized or regional accumulation of protein-rich interstitial fluid that occurs {{as a consequence of}} congenital or acquired disruption of lymphatic circulation. Cancer-related lymphedema is {{the most common cause of}} secondary upper and lower extremity lymphedema. Secondary arm lymphedema is a chronic and disabling condition which affects a significant number of women who undergo breast cancer treatment. The incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema was reported to be between 2. 4 to 56 %. Extensive surgical nodal clearing and irradiation are the most important risk factors for the development of lymphedema. Besides <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches</b> of treatment related complications and lymphedema, various therapeutic interventions have been proposed to treat this disabling condition. In the absence of well-designed randomized studies, consensus has not been attained concerning the appropriate treatment of lymphedema. Complex decongestive therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, self-adminitered lymphatic drainage, pneumatic pumps, laser therapy, oral pharmaceuticals, compression bandaging and garments, limb exercises and elevation are among the common conservative therapies used for managing lymphedema. This review overviews the risk factors, assessment methods, <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches</b> and treatment regimens that have been used for the management of lymphedema...|$|R

Although we may characterize psychiatry during the twentieth century as being dominated first by psychoanalysis and then later by psychopharmacology, <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches</b> which examined the socioeconomic, environmental, and interpersonal determinants of mental health were also important, though they are less understood. Among these initiatives were the mental hygiene, child guidance, social psychiatry, community mental health, and radical psychiatry movements, all of which sought not only to identify the causes of mental illness, but also to take steps to alleviate them. Moreover, such <b>preventive</b> <b>approaches</b> were attractive to American politicians, not least President Kennedy, who pledged in 1963 "to seek out the causes of mental illness and mental retardation and eradicate them.

50|$|Preventive {{approaches}} to classroom management involve creating a positive classroom community with mutual respect between teacher and student. Teachers using the <b>preventive</b> <b>approach</b> offer warmth, acceptance, and support unconditionally - {{not based on}} a student’s behavior. Fair rules and consequences are established and students are given frequent and consistent feedback regarding their behavior. One way to establish this kind of classroom environment is through the {{development and use of}} a classroom contract. The contract should be created by both students and the teacher. In the contract, students and teachers decide and agree on how to treat one another in the classroom. The group also decides on and agrees to what the group will do if someone violates the contract. Rather than a consequence, the group should decide how to fix the problem through either class discussion, peer mediation, counseling, or by one on one conversations leading to a solution to the situation.|$|E
50|$|The above models {{underwent}} {{further development}} in Germany in the 1980s. Child-oriented {{school social work}} applies a <b>preventive</b> <b>approach</b> to find solutions to children's problems. School social work acts as an autonomous institution. Social workers keep in close touch with families and pay frequent visits to them.The above approach together with the ecological model worked up in the mid 1990s by Florance Costin influenced the Pécs model. The model is intended to help pupils acquire social competences and to senzitize schools {{to the needs of}} children. The social worker is in contact both with the child, the family and the school, focuses on the whole, and considers the complexity of the personality and the environment at the same time. She/he basically concentrates on health. She/he endeavours to find and make use of resources in order to surmount environmental constraints (Costin, quoted by Balikó 2000).

5000|$|Improving {{the school}} climate {{can be one}} of the tasks of a school psychologist. School climate is {{consistently}} identified by researchers as a variable that is related to effectiveness of schools. [...] Specifically, positive school climate is associated with several student outcomes including achievement, attendance, self-concept, and behavior. Therefore, school psychologists seek to improve school climate as a school-wide preventative approach rather than a reactive or remedial approach. [...] Best practice proposes that school climate is first described and measured before a plan of action is developed and implemented. While efforts to improve school climate can be implemented at the national level with large-scale reform, or on a smaller scale at the individual school or district level, the strategies used to improve school climate need to be based on the individual strengths and weaknesses of each school. School psychologists can play an integral part in promoting positive school climate within their schools and districts.
