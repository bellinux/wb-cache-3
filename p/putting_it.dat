5000|$|What was Rabbi Akiva like? - A {{worker who}} goes {{out with his}} basket. He finds wheat - he <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in, barley - he <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in, spelt - he <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in, beans - he <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in, lentils - he <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in. When he arrives home he sorts out the wheat by itself, barley by itself, spelt by itself, beans by themselves, lentils by themselves. So did Rabbi Akiva; he {{arranged}} the Torahrings by rings. Avot deRabbi Natan ch. 18; see also Gittin, 67a ...|$|R
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E
5|$|Lionsgate {{gave the}} film a limited release in North America on November 6, 2009 (the release was {{expanded}} on November 20). Precious received largely positive reviews from critics; the acting, the story, and its message were generally praised. In the film's opening weekend in limited release, it grossed $1.8million, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> in 12th {{place at the}} box office. As of February 2010, the film had grossed over $47million domestically, ranking no. 65 for 2009, recouping its $10million budget, and making it a box office success.|$|E

5|$|Lords first {{talked about}} her plans {{to write a book}} during an {{interview}} with Ross Shafer on April 18, 1988. Later, in July, it was confirmed that a book entitled Out of the Blue: The Traci Lords Story was in development. However, the project was shelved due to problems with the publishing deal. On November 4, 2000, when Lords was a guest on The Howard Stern Show, she was again asked about the book but said she had no intentions of <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> out at that time.|$|E
5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> within the reach {{of a large number}} of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E

Dell calls this feature PowerShare, while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge. On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops, sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a non-standard symbol (the letters USB over a drawing of a battery); the feature is simply called Power-off USB. On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models, {{it is possible to}} plug a device in, close the laptop (<b>putting</b> <b>it</b> into sleep mode) and have the device continue to charge.|$|E

5|$|The Mae Shi drummer Brad Breeck commented in an {{interview}} that the band decided to make a song about the incident late in the evening of February 2, 2009. Breeck noted that they listened to the audio of the Bale diatribe and put together their tribute piece within a span of two hours before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> online. Jacob Cooper, another drummer in the band, commented to The Arizona Daily Star that he was surprised how popular their piece became when they had devoted relatively little time to composing and recording it.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{historians have}} grouped the Precious Blood-related churches of far western Ohio into four {{different}} generations: the first, composed primarily of small log buildings {{from the first}} years of settlement until 1865; the second, composed of moderately sized brick churches built between 1865 and 1885; the third, composed mostly of large High Gothic Revival churches with massive towers constructed from 1885 to 1905; and the fourth, composed of churches built between 1905 and 1925 {{in a wide range of}} styles. Immaculate Conception's place at the end of the third generation is significant: its Romanesque Revival style is atypical of that period and much more common in the fourth generation that would soon arise, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> in somewhat of a transitional place between the third and fourth generations.|$|E
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not want it to get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time came for the film's climax, where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt, and neither wanted to damage the mask by <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> on a dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E

5|$|Entering {{college at}} the age of 18 Hsing discovers that 4-Hiroshi Canaval, the teacher of Navigation, has asked her to be placed {{directly}} into the second-year navigation course. Hsing shows an aptitude for the subject, and in her third year chooses to make it her profession. Luis chooses to become a doctor, and their academic separation leads to Hsing and Luis slowly drawing apart from one another. Hsing finds herself attracted to Hiroshi, and the two begin a romantic relationship. Three days after their wedding Hiroshi tells Hsing that the focus of his life's work is not simply navigation, as is generally believed, but concealing a secret {{from the rest of the}} ship. A few years earlier an unexpected gravitational effect led to the ship experiencing a vast acceleration, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> 40 years ahead of schedule; it is expected to arrive at Hsin Ti Chiu in five years.|$|E
5|$|Holmboe {{published}} his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' bomb went {{straight}} through the roof of pen 3, damaging it beyond repair and <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war. The base was handed over to the Allies, along with the rest of occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of the intensive bombing of the city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area was one of the worst damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E

On 1 February, she continued her attack on Japanese positions as the U.S. landing forces advanced. She became the flagship for Admiral Connally for the next two weeks, resupplying and refueling many of the smaller ships in the operation until she departed with a task unit of carriers and destroyers on 15 February 1944, steaming for Bremerton Navy Yard, where she underwent another overhaul, with her guns being replaced.|$|E
5|$|Kỳ {{specifically}} said {{nine or ten}} {{other officers}} should be dismissed for involvement in the coup, but refused to identify who he had in mind. Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> down in order to embarrass Khánh and allow themselves to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi {{a few days before}} the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for overthrowing Khánh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Trần Văn Đôn, who conjectured that Khánh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khiêm, into revolting against him so he could defeat and remove them from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image.|$|E

The aircraft flew separately to Bahrain, where they made a brief refuelling stop, then continued to Ratmalana Airport and Cocos Island where they refuelled again. One of A84-202's tyres burst while landing at Cocos Island, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> out of the race.
