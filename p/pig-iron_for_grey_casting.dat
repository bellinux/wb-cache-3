40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the geochemical and microbial {{as well as the}} technical basis for an effective in-situ immobilisation of arsenic and ura-nium. To do this, we combined microbial sulphate reduction with anaero-bic corrosion of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron powder and nano-scale iron colloids, re-spectively. While nano scale iron showed an extremely high, but temporary reactivity, a lasting iron corrosion and environmental reduction was observed <b>for</b> <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron powder. By adding methanol or H 2 /CO 2 respectively, heterotrophic and autotrophic sulphate reduction as well as iron sulphide precipitation were stimulated and therewith reducing condi-tions were maintained. In the tests, iron sulphide was shown to co-precipitate arsenic and to catalyse reductive uranium precipitation, which was indicated by X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an energy-dispersive X-Ray (EDX) measurement pointed out, that most uranium was fixed directly {{to the surface of the}} <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron particles. <b>For</b> in-situ immobilisation, a suitable treatment zone technology must be developed.

40|$|Disc brakes are {{commonly}} used in motorcycles, passenger cars, commercial vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, passenger trains and landing gears of airplanes. Depending on the application, {{a wide variety of}} brake discs have been developed, with a multitude of designs, geometries and materials. The brake disc materials used for heavy-duty vehicles are still mostly based on traditional <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron, due to its favourable performance and low cost. Gradual improvements of the thermal and mechanical properties of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron <b>for</b> production of brake discs have been introduced over the years through fine-tuning of the alloying elements. Nevertheless, because of a material behaviour that comprises non-linear elasticity and non-symmetric yield stress in tension and compression, the mechanical properties of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron are not as well established as those of steel or aluminium alloys. The subject of the present work is {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms that control the life of cast iron brake discs. In the end, the aim is an enhanced vehicle performance and reduced maintenance costs of heavy-duty vehicles. First, a state of the art survey has been carried out with a review of brake disc technology and mechanisms related to brake disc life. Second, full-scale brake dynamometer experiments have been carried out and analysed, with brake discs made from eight different <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron alloys, at controlled torque, speed and cooling conditions. Crack propagation and disc temperatures have been studied. Disc temperatures were recorded by use of a thermocamera and embedded thermocouples. Detailed analyses were performed on temperature data to clarify characteristics of the tested brake discs. The main phenomena influencing the life of brake discs were identified, and the spatial fixation of bands and/or hot spots was found to have a major impact on disc life. Third, a constitutive model useful <b>for</b> <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron was implemented for use with a commercial finite element software. The model was calibrated for temperatures relevant for braking applications using dedicated isothermal tests and, finally, validated against monotonic tensile tests, isothermal fatigue tests and thermomechanical fatigue tests. Fourth, a parametric study was performed to explore potential improvements of the cooling channels of a brake disc design when considering an established fatigue criterion. The thermal loading of the brake discs was chosen to represent the full-scale experiments. In the end, a response surface methodology was applied to optimize six types of cooling arrangements (one with straight vanes and five with different numbers of pillar rows) in order to minimize brake disc mass and/or maximize fatigue life. Finally, fifth, some fatigue life models useful <b>for</b> <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron were calibrated and used to assess brake disc design.

40|$|Design of {{the brake}} disc {{geometry}} {{for a given}} brake disc material {{provides an opportunity for}} improvement in the fatigue life of the brake disc. High thermomechanical loads at braking lead to substantial local plastification and also induce tensile residual stresses in certain areas of the brake disc. This contributes to shortening of the fatigue life of the brake disc by possible initiation and growth of cracks. In the present paper, a simulation approach for evaluation of brake disc designs with respect to thermomechanical performance is developed and applied. Brake disc performance is analysed using commercial finite element software by employing a constitutive model <b>for</b> <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron implemented in a Fortran subroutine. The thermal loading consists of consecutive severe braking cycles at a constant brake power and a constant speed, with cooling between the brake cycles. Based on a previous experimental study, three different assumptions are made regarding the spatial distribution of the thermal load at braking. A standard commercial brake disc made from <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron having straight vanes is used as the reference case. Geometrical modifications are introduced in the ventilation arrangement using a design-of-experiments approach, studying both straight cooling vanes and different pillar layouts. A preliminary assessment of the fatigue life of the brake discs is carried out. The results indicate that the introduction of different pillar arrangements instead of straight vanes make it possible to decrease the mass of the brake disc by up to 13 % or to increase the fatigue life of the brake disc by about 50 %...|$|R

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are two studies that apply {{nondestructive}} testing methods to civil engineering problems. The first study examines {{the relationship between the}} small-strain and large-strain properties of exhumed cast iron water pipes. Nondestructive and destructive testing programs were performed on eight pipes varying in age from 40 to 130 years. New applications of frequency domain analysis techniques including Fourier and wavelet transforms of ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements are presented. The effects of Lamb wave propagation on the ultrasonic testing results are investigated. Microstructure evaluation revealed two different types of cast iron within the pipes sampled: <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron and ductile iron. A low correlation between wave propagation and large-strain measurements was observed. However, the wave velocities were consistently different between ductile and <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron pipes (14 % to 18 % difference). Lamb waves were found to contribute significantly to the frequency content of the ultrasonic signals possibly resulting in the poor correlations observed. Therefore, correlations between wave velocities and large strain properties obtained using samples from exhumed water pipes must be used with caution in the condition assessment of aged water pipes especially <b>for</b> <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron pipes. The second study presented {{in this thesis}} was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} three geophysical methods for geotechnical site characterization in swamps and environmentally sensitive wetland areas. The geophysical methods evaluated were electrical resistivity imaging (ERI), seismic refraction (SR), and multiple-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW). The geophysical test results were verified against the results from borehole and CPT logs. The ERI results were best for determining the depth to the glacial till. The SR results overestimated the depth to the till because of the presence of a stiffness reversal. The MASW results predicted the depth to the refusal till layer less accurately than the ERI method. However, this method was able to detect the three distinct layers above the till. These methods can be used as a basis for further development to optimize a procedure to reduce the number of boreholes required for conventional site investigations in areas that are environmentally sensitive or where access is restricted...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{structural}} optimization of castings and thermomechanical analysis of castings are studied. In paper I an optimization algorithm {{is created by}} using Matlab. The algorithm {{is linked to the}} commercial FE solver Abaqus by using Python script. The optimization algorithm uses the successive response surfaces methodology (SRSM) to create global response surfaces. It is shown that including residual stresses in structural optimization of castings yields an optimal shape that differs significantly from the one obtained when residual stresses are excluded. In paper II the optimization algorithm is expanded to using neural networks. It is tested on some typical bench mark problems and shows very promising results. Combining paper I and II the response surfaces can be either analytical functions, both linear and non-linear, or neural networks. The optimization is then performed by using sequential linear programming or by using a zero-order method called Complex. This is all gathered in a package called StuG-OPT. In paper III and IV focus is on the thermomechanical problem when residual stresses are calculated. In paper III a literature review is performed and some numerical simulations are performed to see where numerical simulations can be used in the industry today. In paper IV simulations are compared to real tests. Several stress lattices are casted and the residual stresses are measured. Simulations are performed by using Magmasoft and Abaqus. In Magmasoft a J 2 -plasticity model is used and in Abaqus two simulations are performed using either J 2 -plasticity or the ”Cast Iron Plasticity” available in Abaqus that takes into account the different behavior in tension and compression <b>for</b> <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron.

At room temperature, the wear loss of coatings was independent of the substrate dilution and similar to the <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron. At high temperatures, coating produced with high dilution displayed the highest wear resistance between all the samples. This is attributed to the formation of a protective tribo-layer resulting from the agglomeration of a high amount of oxide debris due to its lower oxidation resistance when compared to the sample produced with low dilution...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{electrochemical}} characteristics of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron in Upon, a commercial alkaline cleaning agent. The {{influence of a}} chloride solution was also studied. The passive region narrows with increasing chloride concentration, with the breakdown potential shifting to more negative values. The influence of a temperature increase is shown in a higher current density in the passive region due to a lower corrosion resistance. The mechanisms of pitting formation under various experimental conditions were studied using the cyclic potentiodynamic polarization technique. The ability of bicarbonate and carbonate salts to inhibit the pitting corrosion was also studied. The proposed solution exhibited excellent inhibition characteristics to prevent the pitting corrosion of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron, irrespective of the temperature and the chloride concentration gradient.

40|$|Purpose of the {{research}} is to know effect of preheating of permanent ductile cast iron mold at 400 C on physical and mechanical characteristics of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron. Solidification of the <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron was monitored by using CE meter and after solidification was completed, the metal was tested for hardness test, metallographic test and chemical composition test. The research used tapered <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron. Sixteen points of tests will be determined in the specimens of <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron in order to know physical and mechanical characteristics in the predetermined points. Chemical composition test used JIS standards. Results of {{the research}} indicated that effect of preheating at temperature of 400 C in permanent ductile iron mold with <b>grey</b> <b>cast</b> iron material produced varied hardness distribution. At the middle of diameter of the specimen, 5 points of tests taken bottom-up indicated values of hardness as follow: 219. 54 Hv, 127. 28 Hv, 150. 80 Hv, 189. 18 Hv and 144. 54 Hv. At upside part of the middle of diameter to the side part were as follow: 144. 54 Hv, 167. 99 Hv, 159. 50 Hv, 174. 41 Hv and 176, 23 Hv. At outer side that were taken bottom-up were as follow: 176. 23 Hv, 269. 23 Hv, 220. 93 Hv, 258. 03 Hv and 175, 14 Hv. At lower side from edge to middle of the diameter were as follow: 175. 14 Hv, 188. 10 Hv, 190. 97 Hv, 195. 77 Hv and 216, 54 Hv. Results of metal smelting test by using CE meter showed that initial temperature was 1356. 80 C, liquid temperature was 1155. 40 C, and solid temperature was 1113, 60 C in which the iron began to solid but it’s color was still red until final temperature of 1060 C when it solidified.
