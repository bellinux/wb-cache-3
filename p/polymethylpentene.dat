A centrifugal magnetic pump with a Permanent Life Support (PLS) system using a <b>polymethylpentene</b> oxygenator (Rotaflow/Jostra Quadrox - D, Maquet CardiopulmonaryAG, Hirrlingen, Germany) was employed in all cases.

30|$|Hydrophobic {{interactions}} between the contrast microsphere and hollow fibre membranes within an oxygenator (and other components within an ECMO circuit) may also contribute to microsphere destruction. These hydrophobic interactions {{have been shown to}} be of importance during ECMO pharmacokinetic studies, where up to 90  % of some drugs may be removed by the circuit [27, 28]. Common reasons for drug pharmacokinetics being influenced by ECMO in vivo include circuit sequestration, increased volume of distribution, and decreased drug elimination [29]. Whilst not all of these are relevant to our ex vivo circuit, contrast microspheres are hydrophobic but not lipophilic. As such, direct {{interactions between}} these hydrophobic microspheres and the hydrophobic <b>polymethylpentene</b> hollow fibres may also result in trapping of the microspheres within the oxygenator.|$|E

A 2 -mm-diameter plastic tube was inserted through the space between the pledget and the hole to provide an oxygen supply.

30|$|However, {{the results}} of this study showed that there was a {{significant}} difference (increase) in microbubble destruction between a full circuit (with an oxygenator) versus a circuit with no oxygenator, and this occurred at all pump head speeds. This suggested that the presence of an oxygenator was a more important predictor of microbubble destruction than the actual pump head speed. There are several mechanisms that may explain this unexpected increase in microbubble destruction with the oxygenator in situ. Firstly, between the entry and exit points of an oxygenator, the flow path may be complex and involve numerous acute changes in direction, with repeated contact against the rigid <b>polymethylpentene</b> fibres. This could increase the shear stress on microbubbles and hence promote destruction. As the oxygenator is designed to maximise mass transfer within a relatively small and confined space, the repeatedly interposed fibre mats would act as recurrent sites for microbubble trauma.|$|E

40|$|The biomechanical {{properties}} of soft tissues vary with pathological phenomenon. Ultrasound elasticity imaging is a noninvasive method {{used to analyze}} the local biomechanical {{properties of}} soft tissues in clinical diagnosis. However, the echo signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR) is diminished because of the attenuation of ultrasonic energy by soft tissues. Therefore, {{to improve the quality of}} elastography, the eSNR and depth of ultrasound penetration must be increased using chirp-coded excitation. Moreover, the low axial resolution of ultrasound images generated by a chirp-coded pulse must be increased using an appropriate compression filter. The main aim of this study is to develop an ultrasound elasticity imaging system with chirp-coded excitation using a Tukey window for assessing the biomechanical properties of soft tissues. In this study, we propose an ultrasound elasticity imaging system equipped with a 7. 5 -MHz single-element transducer and <b>polymethylpentene</b> compression plate to measure strains in soft tissues. Soft tissue strains were analyzed using cross correlation (CC) and absolution difference (AD) algorithms. The optimal parameters of CC and AD algorithms used for the ultrasound elasticity imaging system with chirp-coded excitation were determined by measuring the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) of a homogeneous phantom. Moreover, chirp-coded excitation and short pulse excitation were used to measure the elasticity properties of the phantom. The elastographic qualities of the tissue-mimicking phantom were assessed in terms of Young’s modulus and elastographic contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRe).

40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) {{has been}} shown to improve outcomes in neonatal patients with respiratory and/or cardiac failure. Insensible water loss is defined as water loss via evaporation from the skin and respiration. Fluid and electrolyte balance are a pri-mary concern and very challenging in the neonatal patient population. Hypernatremia can result from untreated insensible water loss, leading to possible cere-bral complications. A new type of fiber used in the Jostra Quadrox D oxygenator has recently been approved for use in the United States of America. This oxygenator uses a <b>polymethylpentene</b> closed hollow-fiber technology and has been approved for six hours of continuous use by the Federal Drug Administration.

30|$|Oxygenator: {{there are}} two types of oxygenator; bubble oxygenators, which are used for {{perioperative}} extracorporeal circulation during heart surgery, and membrane oxygenators, which avoid hemolysis associated with bubbling [25, 26]. Only membrane oxygenators are used for peripheral ECMO. There are two types of membrane: flat and tubular [28]. The former have flat silicone membranes or membranes assembled in layers. Oxygenators with tubular membranes comprising nonporous hollow fibers generally made of <b>polymethylpentene</b> avoid loss of plasma components. The oxygenator should be located downstream of the pump and permit gas exchange by artificially reproducing the function of the alveolar capillary membrane. It also ensures heat exchange and warms the blood of the extracorporeal circuit [25]. It has an inlet and an outlet and is connected to a gas mixer, which is used to adjust the oxygen fraction delivered by the extracorporeal circuit (FECO 2) and the gas flow (sweep gas rate). Oxygenators are tested for measurement of pressure as a function of flow rates. The pressure gradient generated by the passage of the blood through the oxygenator should be lower than 50  mmHg/L/minute. The pressure drop corresponds to the transmembrane pressure gradient. Treatment goals distinguish oxygenation and decarboxylation. Membrane performance is evaluated by the rated flow of the oxygenator which corresponds to the amount of desaturated (75 %) venous blood that can be nearly fully saturated (95 %) in a given time. The flow rate is adjusted to that of the assist system. Most oxygenators support sweep flow rates of 10  mL/minute to 100  L/minute [25]. The oxygenator should be placed below the level of the patient. The gas outlet port should be directed downwards to limit the risk of obstruction [25].|$|E

Those efficiencies have been compared to results from other experiments, when available. The efficiencies of the samples are all in the range of E- 24 g/atom. The results indicate that the reaction efficiencies of the reported materials can be grouped in about three ranges of values. The least affected materials which have efficiencies varying from 1 to 10 (exp 25) g/atom, include silicones, epoxies, Uralane and Teflon.

To explore these inconsistent findings, we estimated the influence of the oxygen environment on wound healing with our original model. Experiment 1 (Establishment of the model) : To modify the topical oxygen tension, oxygen impermeable (polyvinylidene chloride) and permeable (<b>polymethylpentene)</b> membranes were applied to symmetrical excisional wounds in ddy mice (n =  6). Oxygen tension under the membrane was quantified with a device using photo-quenching technique. Experiment 2 (Influence of oxygen environment on wound healing) : The wound area, granulation thickness and vascular density were analyzed under different oxygen environments (n =  24). Experiment 1 : The permeable group maintained equivalent oxygen level to atmosphere (114. 1 ± 29. 8 mmHg on day 7), while the impermeable group showed extremely low oxygen tension (5. 72 ± 2. 99 mmHg on day 7). Accordingly, each group was defined as the normoxia group and the hypoxia group. Experiment 2 : Percent decrease in wound size was significantly enhanced in the normoxia group (11. 1 ± 1. 66 % on day 7) in comparison with the hypoxia group (27. 6 ± 3. 47 % on day 7). The normoxia group showed significantly thicker granulation tissue than the hypoxia group (491. 8 ± 243. 2 vs. 295. 3 ± 180. 9 µm).

However, the circuit behaviour of protein bound drugs is not fully elucidated. Study objectives: This ex vivo experiment aimed to investigate the disposition of protein bound drugs in ECMO circuits. Methods: Four identical ECMO circuits comprising centrifugal pumps and <b>polymethylpentene</b> oxygenators were primed with crystalloid, albumin and fresh human whole blood and maintained at physiological conditions for 24 hours. After baseline sampling, known quantities of study drugs (ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, fluconazole, caspofungin and thiopentone) were injected into the circuit. Equivalent doses of these drugs were also injected into four polyvinylchloride jars containing fresh human whole blood for drug stability testing. Serial blood samples were collected from the controls and the ECMO circuits over 24 hours and the concentrations of the study drugs were quantified using validated chromatographic assays. Results: Four hundred and eighty samples were analysed. All of the study drugs were stable in controls (100 % recovery at 24 hours). The mean total plasma protein and albumin concentration in the circuit were 33 ± 2. 5 g/L and 25 ± 0. 9 g/L respectively. The average drug recoveries from the ECMO circuits at 24 hours respectively were ceftriaxone 80 %, ciprofloxacin 96 %, linezolid 91 %, fluconazole 91 %, caspofungin 56 % and thiopentone 12 %. There was a significant reduction of ceftriaxone (p= 0. 01), caspofungin (p= 0. 01) and thiopentone (p < 0. 008) concentrations in the ECMO circuit at 24 hours. Circuit drug recovery correlated with degree of protein binding of drugs studied (Pearson r= - 0. 71, p < 0. 05). Conclusion(s) : Protein bound drugs may be significantly degraded/sequestered in ECMO circuits. The absence of data on unbound concentrations for these drugs limits any strong conclusions. Pending future clinical population PK studies, therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered for highly protein bound drugs where possible.

40|$|Microporous {{hollow fibre}} {{membrane}} oxygenators with clinically-established polypropylene (PP) or innovative <b>polymethylpentene</b> (PMP) membranes are used clinically for cardiopulmonary bypasses (CPB) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Membrane oxygenators with silicone plates {{may also be}} used. During long-term use of PP membrane oxygenators, plasma leakage is possible due {{to a variety of}} factors. The PMP membrane oxygenators developed to avoid this undesirable occurrence should be able to prevent this due to their modified, denser membrane structure. In the clinical use of PMP membrane oxygenators for CPB, the halogenated anaesthetic isoflurane cannot be administered in sufficient amounts. In the set-up to test steam transfer, the PP and PMP oxygenator modules were analysed for differences in permeability through perfusion with distilled water on the fluid side and streaming of dry gas on the gas side. No differences could be detected in the amount of water condensate, whose function as a trigger for plasma leakage is controversial. As with the silicone membrane oxygenators, the gas was fully saturated with water condensate. Should the condensation process in the microporous membrane be a trigger mechanism for plasma leakage, using a PMP membrane oxygenator would not offer a higher level of safety. However, the thin sealing membrane at the surface of PMP membrane oxygenators should theoretically provide greater resistance to capillary attraction. Leakage tests of the microporous hollow fibre membranes with Perfluorcarbon FC- 43 ® and oxygenator test modules showed that PP membranes were able to prevent considerably less transfer. Admittedly, transfer was also detected with the PMP membranes. Silicone membranes appeared to retain FC- 43 ® the best. Thus although PMP membranes could be considered to have better liquid retention properties than PP membranes, they are not 100 % impervious. This observation means that plasma leakage seems far unlikelier when PMP membranes are used, although cannot be ruled out definitively. Thus in long-term clinical application for ECLS, PMP hollow fibre membrane oxygenators should be favoured over those with PP membranes. The narcotic gas transport capacity of hollow fibre membranes was explored in an in-vitro investigation. The oxygenator modules were perfused with saline solution and native porcine blood on the liquid side and aerated with the gaseous anaesthetics isoflurane, nitrous oxide and xenon on the gas side. The transport capacity of PP and PMP membranes showed no difference in the case of nitrous oxide and xenon, but the gas transfer performance of PP membranes was lower with isoflurane. Should a halogenated anaesthetic such as isoflurane be used during CPB and administered via a hollow fibre membrane oxygenator, use of PMP hollow fibre membrane oxygenators should be discouraged. This restriction does not apply to the administering of nitrous oxide or xenon. As purely in-vitro-experiments, the new test set-ups developed for the investigations could provide clinically-relevant knowledge. Further standardisation of the set-up could establish its use in future studies...|$|E

The uniformity, within the axial slice and along the longitudinal direction, and noise power spectrum were assessed by scanning a water bucket; the contrast and CT number linearity were measured using the Catphan phantom; and the spatial resolution was evaluated using a tungsten wire phantom. A skull phantom and a ham were also scanned to provide qualitative evaluation of high- and low-contrast resolution. Each measurement was compared between dual and single CBCT systems. Compared with single CBCT, the DCBCT presented: 1) a decrease in uniformity by 1. 9 % in axial view and 1. 1 % in the longitudinal view, as averaged for four energies (80, 100, 125 and 150 kVp); 2) comparable or slightly better contrast to noise ratio (CNR) for low-contrast objects and comparable contrast for high-contrast objects; 3) comparable spatial resolution; 4) comparable CT number linearity with R 2 &# 8805; 0. 99 for all four tested energies; 5) lower noise power spectrum in magnitude. DCBCT images of the skull phantom and the ham demonstrated both high-contrast resolution and good soft-tissue contrast. One of the major challenges for clinical implementation of four-dimensional (4 D) CBCT is the long scan time. To investigate the 4 D imaging capabilities of the DCBCT system, motion phantom studies were conducted to validate the efficiency by comparing 4 D images generated from 4 D-DCBCT and 4 D-CBCT. First, a simple sinusoidal profile was used to confirm the scan time reduction. Next, both irregular sinusoidal and patient-derived profiles were used to investigate the advantage of temporally correlated orthogonal projections due to a reduced scan time. Normalized mutual information (NMI) between 4 D-DCBCT and 4 D-CBCT was used for quantitative evaluation. For the simple sinusoidal profile, the average NMI for ten phases between two single 4 D-CBCTs was 0. 336, indicating the maximum NMI {{that can be achieved}} for this study. The average NMIs between 4 D-DCBCT and each single 4 D-CBCT were 0. 331 and 0. 320. For both irregular sinusoidal and patient-derived profiles, 4 D-DCBCT generated phase images with less motion blurring when compared with single 4 D-CBCT. For dual kV energy imaging, we acquired 80 kVp projections and 150 kVp projections, with an additional 0. 8 mm tin filtration. The virtual monochromatic (VM) technique was implemented, by first decomposing these projections into acrylic and aluminum basis material projections to synthesize VM projections, which were then used to reconstruct VM CBCTs. The effect of the VM CBCT on metal artifact reduction was evaluated with an in-house titanium-BB phantom. The optimal VM energy to maximize CNR for iodine contrast and minimize beam hardening in VM CBCT was determined using a water phantom containing two iodine concentrations. The linearly-mixed (LM) technique was implemented by linearly combining the low- (80 kVp) and high-energy (150 kVp) CBCTs. The dose partitioning between low- and high-energy CBCTs was varied (20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % for low-energy) while keeping total dose approximately equal to single-energy CBCTs, measured using an ion chamber. Noise levels and CNRs for four tissue types were investigated for dual-energy LM CBCTs in comparison with single-energy CBCTs at 80, 100, 125 and 150 kVp. The VM technique showed a substantial reduction of metal artifacts at 100 keV with a 40 % reduction in the background standard deviation compared with a 125 kVp single-energy scan of equal dose. The VM energy to maximize CNR for both iodine concentrations and minimize beam hardening in the metal-free object was 50 keV and 60 keV, respectively. The difference in average noise levels measured in the phantom background was 1. 2 % for dual-energy LM CBCTs and equivalent-dose single-energy CBCTs. CNR values in the LM CBCTs of any dose partitioning were better than those of 150 kVp single-energy CBCTs. The average CNRs for four tissue types with 80 % dose fraction at low-energy showed 9. 0 % and 4. 1 % improvement relative to 100 kVp and 125 kVp single-energy CBCTs, respectively. CNRs for low contrast objects improved as dose partitioning was more heavily weighted towards low-energy (80 kVp) for LM CBCTs. For application of the dual-energy technique in the kilovoltage (kV) and megavoltage (MV) range, we acquired both MV projections (from gantry angle of 0 ° to 100 °) and kV projections (90 ° to 200 °) with the current orthogonal kV/MV imaging hardware equipped in modern linear accelerators, as gantry rotated a total of 110 °. A selected range of overlap projections between 90 ° to 100 ° were then decomposed into two material projections using experimentally determined parameters from orthogonally stacked aluminum and acrylic step-wedges. Given attenuation coefficients of aluminum and acrylic at a predetermined energy, one set of VM projections could be synthesized from two corresponding sets of decomposed projections. Two linear functions were generated using projection information at overlap angles to convert kV and MV projections at non-overlap angles to approximate VM projections for CBCT reconstruction. The CNRs were calculated for different inserts in VM CBCTs of a CatPhan phantom with various selected energies and compared with those in kV and MV CBCTs. The effect of overlap projection number on CNR was evaluated. Additionally, the effect of beam orientation was studied by scanning the CatPhan sandwiched with two 5 cm solid-water phantoms on both lateral sides and an electronic density phantom with two metal bolt inserts. Proper selection of VM energy (30 keV and 40 keV for low-density polyethylene (LDPE), <b>polymethylpentene</b> (PMP), 2 MeV for Delrin) provided comparable or even better CNR results as compared with kV or MV CBCT. An increased number of overlap between kV and MV projections demonstrated only marginal improvements of CNR for different inserts (with the exception of LDPE) and therefore one projection overlap was found to be sufficient for the CatPhan study. It was also evident that the optimal CBCT image quality was achieved when MV beams penetrated through the heavy attenuation direction of the object. In conclusion, the performance of a bench-top DCBCT imaging system has been characterized and is comparable to that of a single CBCT. The 4 D-DCBCT provides an efficient 4 D imaging technique for motion management. The scan time is reduced by approximately a factor of two. The temporally correlated orthogonal projections improved the image blur across 4 D phase images. Dual-energy CBCT imaging techniques were implemented to synthesize VM CBCT and LM CBCTs. VM CBCT was effective at achieving metal artifact reduction. Depending on the dose-partitioning scheme, LM CBCT demonstrated the potential to improve CNR for low contrast objects compared with single-energy CBCT acquired with equivalent dose. A novel technique was developed to generate VM CBCTs from kV/MV projections. This technique has the potential to improve CNR at selected VM energies and to suppress artifacts at appropriate beam orientations. Dissertatio...|$|E
