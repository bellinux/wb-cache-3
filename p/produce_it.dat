Although Np2O5 was initially subject to several studies that claimed to <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> with mutually contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300-350°C for 2–3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an ampoule at 180°C.|$|E
5|$|The 'defects' of one organ are {{remedied}} by {{the structure}} of another. The elephant has, Paley argues, a short neck because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it to reach out. Similarly the spider has no wings to enable it to chase its flying prey, but has a web, and organs adapted to <b>produce</b> <b>it,</b> which compensates for the lack.|$|E
5|$|The {{case set}} a legal {{precedent}} which has shaped copyright law {{to the present}} day.

5|$|Though {{it was one}} of {{the three}} first {{elements}} to be synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium, together with beryllium and boron, is markedly less abundant than other elements.

It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed tool steels.

5|$|After being {{signed by}} Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1973 to poor sales. Although it was praised by critics, {{the band was}} not satisfied with producer Todd Rundgren's sound for the album and had disagreements with him before choosing not to retain him.

During the Second World War he provided James Chadwick with samples of uranium hexafluoride for Tube Alloys, the British wartime nuclear weapons program, and later established a pilot plant to <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> in Widnes. In 1944, in response to a request from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, he went to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to assist the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to <b>produce</b> <b>it</b> in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} was {{announced}} on 20 December 2008, although writer Alex Garland had begun working on the script in 2006. British studio DNA Films produced the film, and partnered with sales agency IM Global to sell the worldwide distribution rights. By May 2010, this partnership saw IM Global and its owner Reliance Big Pictures agree to co-finance the 3-D project with a $45 million production budget, and a schedule to begin filming in Johannesburg, South Africa in late 2010. Pete Travis was named as the film's director and Garland, Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich would <b>produce</b> <b>it.</b> Duncan Jones had previously been offered the role of director. In a 2010 interview, Jones said that his vision for the film was unconventional—describing it as weird, dark, and funny—and it did not mesh well with Garland's script. In September 2010, {{it was reported that}} the film would be titled Dredd.|$|E
