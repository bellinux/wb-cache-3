40|$|Abstract: <b>Pipe</b> <b>spool</b> {{fabrication}} is {{an early}} stage in industrial construction projects and is crucial for the successful delivery of a project. <b>Pipe</b> <b>spool</b> fabrication is a complex and uncertain process due to the uniqueness of its products. The productivity of the fabrication process and the factors affecting productivity are therefore of great importance to project managers and construction researchers alike. Being able to identify all of the sig-nificant factors affecting productivity {{is critical to the}} ability to accurately estimate productivity and ultimately improve the fabrication process. This paper introduces the factors that affect the productivity of the <b>pipe</b> <b>spool</b> fabrication process that are not accounted for in the production unit of spools. In addition, the impact of each factor on productivity is illustrated, and different methods for modeling these factors are proposed. This paper provides a framework for a more comprehensive approach to estimating the productivity using the production unit of spools...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{management}} is {{inextricably linked to}} the awareness and control of 3 D geometry. Progress tracking, quality assurance/quality control, and the location, movement, and assembly of materials are all critical processes that rely {{on the ability to}} monitor 3 D geometry. Therefore, advanced capabilities in site metrology and computer vision will be the foundation {{for the next generation of}} assessment tools that empower project leaders, planners, and workers. 3 D imaging devices enable the capture of the existing geometric conditions of a construction site or a fabricated mechanical or structural assembly objectively, accurately, quickly, and with greater detail and continuity than any manual measurement methods. Within the construction literature, these devices have been applied in systems that compare as-built scans to 3 D CAD design files in order to inspect the geometrical compliance of a fabricated assembly to contractually stipulated dtolerances. However, before comparisons of this type can be made, the particular object of interest needs to be isolated from background objects and clutter captured by the indiscriminate 3 D imaging device. Thus far, object of interest extraction from cluttered construction data has remained a manual process. This thesis explores the process of automated information extraction in order to improve the availability of information about 3 D geometries on construction projects and improve the execution of component inspection, and progress tracking. Specifically, the scope of the research is limited to automatically recognizing and isolating <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> from their cluttered point cloud scans. Two approaches are developed and evaluated. The contributions of the work are as follows: (1) A number of challenges involved in applying RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) to <b>pipe</b> <b>spool</b> recognition are identified. (2) An effective spatial search and <b>pipe</b> <b>spool</b> extraction algorithm based on local data level curvature estimation, density-based clustering, and bag-of-features matching is presented. The algorithm is validated on two case studies and is shown to successfully extract <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> from cluttered point clouds and successfully differentiate between the specific <b>pipe</b> <b>spool</b> of interest and other similar <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> in the same search space.

30|$|The typical {{real-world}} {{scenario is}} that multiple <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> are fabricated simultaneously in one shop, {{sharing the same}} labor resources and drawing from the same inventory for most raw materials. And every spool has an expected delivery date to the module yard or to the construction site. As shown above, various types of raw materials (e.g., pipe sections of different sizes, elbows, olets and flanges) are connected in the spool fabrication process. Timely supply of all materials is critical to achieve the smooth execution of the fabrication process. Any delay in material supply processes would postpone start time on corresponding activities, potentially extending the project duration.|$|R
40|$|A {{maintenance}} strategy to repair or modify the dissimilar weld on the branch connection of the steam generator hot leg in CANDU 6 was developed. The repair {{method is to}} add a carbon steel <b>pipe</b> <b>spool</b> as a transition fitting to transfer the dissimilar weld to shop welding, and the modification method {{is to use the}} backup tap fabricated during plant installation, so that the weld quality would be superior comparing with field welding, and the quantity of argon gas getting into the primary heat transport system would be reduced simultaneously. A gasbag is used to isolate the branch connection for welding performance when the primary heat transport system is drained to low level state during the prolonged shutdown.

30|$|However, in {{the current}} practice, raw {{materials}} are stored in the open area outside the fabrication shop. Although different types of materials are intended to be stored in their predefined areas and classified by using color tapes, they can be moved to other storage areas during retrieval of nearby items (Caldas et al. 2006), which would increase the difficulty of locating raw materials. Also, most raw materials for fabricating <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> are bulky and heavy. Equipment (i.e., crane) is required for handling them. Storing raw materials much sooner than needed would result in double-handling waste, thereby increasing the effort and reducing the efficiency in material management (Ballard and Arbulu 2004). So, the fabricator tends to procure required raw materials based on the actual demand of fabrication {{in line with the}} “pull” principle in lean manufacturing. Nonetheless, this would unavoidably give rise to tardy material delivery due to uncertainties along the material supply chain.|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} above, modern {{construction projects}} are evolving {{to resort to}} modular and off-site prefabrication technologies for better quality and productivity benefits (Construction 2011; Eickmann and Fagerlund 1999). Due to the low labor cost and convenient procurement of basic materials like steel, the engineering and manufacturing for prefabrication components (i.e., <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> or steel structure) and modules is usually undertaken by overseas vendors in East Asia, such as South Korea, China (Choi and Song 2014). After the components or modules are manufactured, they will be shipped from the manufacturers in East Asia to the construction sites in North America such as Alberta, Canada. Thus, {{with more and more}} prefabricated materials and assemblies, the material supply chain becomes increasingly complicated and uncertain for industrial modular construction projects (Choi and Song 2014; Song et al. 2005). Material supply presents itself as a driver in planning crew installation operations on site, which is aimed to maximize the productivity of skilled labor and heavy equipment, keep schedule extension to the minimum while mitigating project budget overrun.|$|R
40|$|Mineral scale {{deposition}} on {{surfaces of}} oil production equipment has been recognised {{as a major}} flow assurance problem. Most of the mineral scale deposition work published has solely focused on laboratory experiments and very little data are available that demonstrate such results are relevant and can be scaled-up to field environments. The current study focuses on mineral scale formation on surfaces and compares laboratory results with field data. A field test has been running for half a year on commercially-coated <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> along with uncoated ones. The different pipe sections were positioned along a water line injection system in an oilfield. In the laboratory, a standard bulk jar test was used {{and the ability of}} a range of chemically and morphologically modified coatings to prevent/reduce mineral scale surface fouling were assessed under different flow conditions (ranging from laminar to turbulent flow). The current study shows that if properly selected, surface engineering offers great promise as an approach to prevent mineral scale deposition in the piping system of oilfields...|$|R
30|$|Another reason {{accounting}} for temporary material shortage in the spool fabrication practice {{is attributed to}} the fact that raw materials can be misused in fabrication of spools. For example, a 12 -meter-long piece and two 6 -meter-long pieces of pipe of the same size, thickness and material type are procured to fabricate Spools A and B. Note the two 6 -meter-long pieces of raw pipe are intended for fabricating the two 5 -meter-long <b>pipe</b> runs on <b>Spool</b> A. However, in the fabrication process, the 12 -meter-long piece of raw pipe is cut into the two 5 -meter-long pipe runs. This happens to cause material storage in fabricating the 10 -meter-long <b>pipe</b> section on <b>Spool</b> B, which actually requires the 12 -meter-long piece of raw pipe.|$|R
40|$|Visual Management (VM) is a {{distinctive}} communication strategy that is frequently observed at lean work settings to varying degrees. It {{relies on the}} effectiveness of visual communication and catchy visual systems to create visual communication for different managerial purposes.

This paper investigates the VM realisation means (visual tools) and attributes in the construction process of a very large industrial facility, which mainly involves mechanical and electrical construction works. A VM research on the construction site of an industrial facility will help address a gap in the field and extend the understanding of the VM applications in a different construction context other than the building construction/renovation. The research question of how VM is realized in the industrial construction context was investigated through the case study research method. One of the biggest subcontractors of a very large gas-processing facility was studied in terms of their VM approach and applications. Interviews, site observation and photographic documentation are the main data collection methods.

40|$|Within {{industrial}} construction, piping can constitute up to 50 % of {{the cost}} of a typical project. It has been shown that across the activities involved in pipe fabrication, pipe fitting has the highest impact on the critical path. The pipe fitter is responsible for interpreting the isometric drawing and then performing the tack welds on piping components so that the assembly complies with the design. Three main problems in doing this task are identified as: (1) reading and interpreting the isometric drawing is challenging and error prone for spatially complicated assemblies, (2) in assemblies with tight allowable tolerance, a number of iterations will take place to fit the pipes with compliance to the design. These iterations (rework) will remain unrecorded in the production process, and (3) no continuous measurement tool exists to let the fitter check his/her work in progress against the design information and acceptance specifications. Addressing these problems could substantially improve pipe fitters’ productivity. The objective of this research is to develop a software package integrating a threefold solution to simplify complex tasks involved in pipe fabrication: (1) making design information easier to understand, {{with the use of a}} tablet, 3 D imaging device and an application software, (2) providing visual feedback on the correctness of fabrication between the design intent and the as-built state, and (3) providing frequent feedback on fabrication using a step-by-step assembly and control framework. The step-by-step framework will reduce the number of required iterations for the pipe fitter. A number of challenges were encountered in order to provide a framework to make real time, visual and frequent feedback. For frequent and visual feedback, a real time 3 D data acquisition tool with an acceptable level of accuracy should be adopted. This is due to the speed of fabrication in an industrial facility. The second challenge is to find the object of interest in real time, once a point cloud is acquired, and finally, once the object is found, to optimally remove points that are considered as clutter to improve the visual feedback for the pipe fitters. To address the requirement for a reliable and real time acquisition tool, Chapter 3 explores the capabilities and limitations of low cost range cameras. A commercially available 3 D imaging tool was utilized to measure its performance for real time point cloud acquisition. The device was used to inspect two <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> altered in size. The acquired point clouds were super-imposed on the BIM (Building Information Model) model of the <b>pipe</b> <b>spools</b> to measure the accuracy of the device. Chapter 4 adapts and examines a real time and automatic object finding algorithm to measure its performance with respect to construction challenges. Then, a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm was employed to classify points as being clutter or corresponding to the object of interest. Chapter 5 investigates the effect of the threshold value “K” in the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and optimizing its value for an improved visual feedback. As a result of the work described in this thesis, along with the work of two other master students and a co-op student, a software package was designed and developed. The software package takes advantage of the investigated real time point cloud acquisition device. While the object finding algorithm proved to be effective, a 3 -point matching algorithm was used, as it was more intuitive for the users and took less time. The KNN algorithm was utilized to remove clutter points to provide more accurate visual feedback more accurate to the workers...|$|R
30|$|As Canada’s leading {{producer}} of oil, gas, and petrochemicals, Alberta {{is home to}} four ethane-cracking plants, including two of the world’s largest, with combined annual capacity to produce 8.6 billion pounds of ethylene. In the foreseeable future, new refining capacity {{will be added to}} produce ethane from bitumen upgrading, which will directly source feedstock from downstream oil sands mining (Government of Alberta 2010). New construction and turnaround activities at industrial process plants consume substantial resources and involve diverse stakeholders who work closely towards delivering a project under a finite time window and a tight cost budget. In general, work items such as a <b>pipe</b> <b>spool,</b> a valve or a storage tank undergo a sequence of tasks which take place in a fabrication shop, at a module yard and on an industrial site. Each task is conducted by a specialist crew in a confined work space with the assistance of temporary facilities and equipment such as scaffolding, rigging system and cranes. A newly engineered rigging system was designed by a major industrial contractor to handle super modules with a maximum 160 -ton lift capacity. The rigging frame system is made of steel and subjected to bending under loadings (Westover et al. 2012). Length-adjustable slings connect the rigging frame and an overhead plate to form a rigging system. The sling length measurements are critical to balance the frame. This ensures the load is evenly spread and carried by each sling. However, direct measurement of sling lengths such as using measurement tape is not feasible due to safety hazards and the dynamic movement of the rigging system.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{industrial}} construction, each fabricated material item {{such as a}} steel piece or a <b>pipe</b> <b>spool</b> is {{a unique}} building element. They are typically staged in a large laydown yard before final on-site installation. Manually tracking and locating each particular item in a large laydown yard can be very time consuming, and excessive man hours spent in this process can negatively impact on field installation activity and overall project performance. This study developed a robust and accurate yet cost effective material tracking and locating solution based on mature tracking technologies. The proposed solution features a handheld computer equipped with barcoding and GPS technologies for laydown yard material tracking and fast retrieval in a cost effective manner. The device scans item barcodes when the item is unloaded in the yard and, meanwhile, captures the GPS coordinates along with the item image, and stores these data in a central database. For material retrieval, material lookup through the database provides geographical location and images of an item, and navigation function gets the crew to the item in a shorter duration. To validate the accuracy of GPS and practicality of this solution, various handheld computing devices with built-in GPS functions were tested by comparing their GPS recordings against the true coordinates of selected geological survey benchmarks. The accuracy {{is measured by the}} distance between the true coordinates to the device-recorded coordinates using Vincenty's formula. A prototype system consisting of a mobile device and a software module was developed, and the achieved GPS accuracy is within 3 meters. While the proposed solution has the potential to significantly improve material tracking efficiency, its low initial and operating costs and robust performance make it practical to use {{in a wide range of}} projects...|$|R

The new OGT line will provide a waste transfer pipeline between these valve pits in support of saltwell pumping activities. The length of the OGT line is approximately 180 ft from pit to pit. The primary pipe is nominal 1 -in. diameter stainless steel (SST) braided Ethylene-propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) hose. The encasement pipe is a nominal 3 -in., flanged, SST pipe made up of several different length <b>pipe</b> <b>spool</b> pieces (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 1 and sh. 2). The OGT line slopes from valve pit 241 -S-B toward valve pit 241 -S-D. At each end, the primary and encasement pipe connect to a pit entry spool piece. The pit entry spool pieces are constructed of prefabricated SST materials. These spool pieces allow for {{the separation of the}} primary and encasement pipelines after the pipes have entered the valve pits (drawing H- 2 - 818280, sh. 2). The pit entry spool pieces also allow for leak detection of the encasement pipe at each end (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 2). The OGT encasement pipeline is supported above ground by adjustable height unistrut brackets and precast concrete bases (drawing H- 2 - 829654, sh. 1). The pipeline is heat-traced and insulated. The heat tracing and insulation supply and retain latent heat that prevents waste solidification during transfers and provides freeze protection.

40|$|Fabrication {{of steel}} {{assemblies}} is a challenging process using existing machines {{to perform the}} tasks involved such as cutting, drilling, and punching. Due to inaccuracies in the fabrication processes, imperfections will inevitably happen. In addition to the fabrication inaccuracies, errors may occur during transportation or due to the temperature changes on construction sites. These challenges become {{more important in the}} offsite construction as it requires sequenced fabrication, transportation and installation. Current approaches for quality inspection, in general, and discrepancy analysis, in particular, lack a sufficient level of automation and are prone to error due to the intensive manual work involved. Hence, a proactive framework is substantially required to systematically monitor the fabrication process and control the accuracy of assemblies in order to expedite the erection and installation processes. Additionally, finding defective assemblies is traditionally done through fitting trials on construction sites, which has always been a key challenge as it is associated with rework. Furthermore, realigning the defective assemblies is currently performed based on the workers’ experience and lacks automated planning. Therefore, detecting the defective parts in a timely manner and in a systematic way can expedite the erection process and avoids significant delays in construction projects and huge costs as a consequence. This research aims to improve the fabrication and installation processes by detecting the incurred inaccuracies automatically and plan for realignment of the defective components systematically. In summary, the required framework to achieve these objectives includes four primary steps: (1) Preprocessing and basic compliance checking, (2) Spatial discrepancy detection and characterization, (3) Calculation of the required alignments and adjustments, and (4) Generalization of the realignment planning and actuation strategy frameworks for parallel systems. The automated compliance checking and discrepancy analysis is performed employing advanced 3 D imaging technologies which have recently opened up a wide range of solutions to acquire as-built status. Characterization of the detected discrepancies is performed by employing robotics forward kinematics concepts and combining with 3 D imaging techniques. The required alignment is calculated accordingly using the robotic analogy and inverse kinematic concept. Although the proposed approach can be applied in any types of construction assembly, this thesis mainly focuses on industrial facilities such as steel pipe modules and <b>pipe</b> <b>spools,</b> in particular. Contributions of developing the described framework include: (1) Developing a proactive strategy for rework avoidance, (2) Algorithmic and programmable framework, (3) Efficiency and robustness of the functions and metrics developed, and (4) Time effectiveness of the framework...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 110 - 113). This {{thesis is}} part of an extensive study conducted by Research Team 308 Achieving Zero Rework Through Effective Supplier Quality Practices from the Construction Industry Institute (CII). The main objectives of this study are centered on the belief that owners, contractors, and suppliers in the construction industry engage in multiple supplier quality (SQ) practices to ensure that project components are procured to the site with the highest quality possible in order to avoid any rework associated with components that are defective or do not conform to the required specifications. Furthermore, data obtained for this study focuses on four different types of material: tagged/engineered equipment, fabricated goods (structural steel and <b>pipe</b> <b>spools),</b> and manufactured/bulk goods (non-engineered/bulk valves). 	The first outcome of this study was the development of a Supplier Quality Process Map (SQPM) that illustrates how the process of procuring components to the project site with sufficient quality is currently being implemented by the Engineer-Procure-Construct (EPC) industry. A detailed description of the SQPM is provided and depicts five major stages within the process. The first two stages illustrate the supplier selection process {{and the development of a}} quality plan. These stages are known as planning and selection and execution. The last three stages pertain to key milestones where measurements for the quality of the production process occur; these stages are release from shop, received on site, and mechanical completion. 	 The second outcome was a statistical analysis of how SQ practices are used by EPC contractors and how these SQ practices impact the resulting quality of goods supplied based on the number of non-conformances (NCs) throughout the process outlined in the SQPM. The statistical analysis resulted in several findings related to the SQ process: More NCs are found when more time is spent observing and inspecting work; developing a quality control/inspection and testing (QC/IT) plan, and projecting the cost of the inspection effort with the supplier helps find problems earlier in the SQ process. Moreover, for meetings held before execution (specifically before any manufacturing, fabrication, or assembly takes place) results suggest that NCs will appear at the shop (upstream), which is a good way of avoiding higher costs associated with the correction of NCs on site (downstream). Moreover, the use and implementation of registered or certified quality management systems (QMS) does not affect the number of NCs found throughout the SQPM. 	The third outcome is the statistical comparison of a group of companies, labeled as highly effective companies (HECs), to regular companies. Results show that HECs find NCs earlier in the SQPM, engage in more hours of observation in suppliers' facilities, and put more effort in the planning phases by conducting more pre-award and pre-inspection meetings, aimed at reducing the number of NCs.

Such valves are mainly used to discharge the excess flow generated by a fixed displacement pump, moreover they can also be used as pilot stage to control the displacement in the new generation of vane pumps. In the paper the transfer function that relates the pressure in the main gallery with the valve spool position is determined. It was found that, when the valve is provided with an external pilot, the interaction between the hydraulic inductance of the pilot <b>pipe</b> and the <b>spool</b> decreases by many times the mechanical frequency of the valve, leading to a reduction of the stability. The experimental procedure used to measure the frequency response of the valve is also described. The test rig was provided with a servovalve used to generate a sinusoidal excitation pressure with variable frequency.

Tight Fit Pipe is a mechanically bonded double walled pipe where a corrosion resistant alloy liner pipe is mechanically fitted inside a carbon steel outer pipe through a thermo-hydraulic manufacturing process. Reeling is a fast method of offshore pipeline installation where a <b>pipe</b> is <b>spooled</b> on a reel, which is positioned on a vessel. The vessel subsequently sails to the offshore location where the pipe is unwound, straightened and deployed to the seabed. However, reeling of Tight Fit Pipe is not yet proven technology. The reeling process imposes high plastic strains (due to bending) in the pipe, which may cause unacceptable liner pipe wrinkling and Tight Fit Pipe ovalisation. This PhD project aimed to make a contribution to the possible development of the installation of Tight Fit Pipe by means of the reeling method. The focus of this research was on the initiation and the degree of liner pipe wrinkling as well as the degree of ovalisation occurring during the spooling-on phase of the reeling process, both theoretically and experimentally; the latter by performing full scale bending tests on 12. 75 inch outer diameter Tight Fit Pipe. One of the test results indicates that a higher mechanical bending strength decreases liner pipe wrinkling and makes the Tight Fit Pipe more suitable for reeling. However, test results also show that the mechanical bonding strength for the Tight Fit Pipe tested was significantly reduced, irrespective of whether a high or a low initial mechanical bonding strength had been used prior to spooling-on. These findings justify further research into this phenomenon as the eventual mechanical bonding strength after reeling installation may be vital for its anticipated application during operation.

50|$|Based on {{embroidery}} machinery used in {{the garment}} textile industry, the machines have been adapted to deposit and stitch fiber roving material onto a base material. Roving material, mostly common carbon fibers, from about 3.000 up to 50.000 filaments can be applied. The preform is produced continuously by the placement of a single roving. The roving material pulled of a spool is guided by a pipe which is positioned {{in front of the}} stitching needle. The roving pipe and the frame, where the base material is fixed onto, move synchronized stepwise to perform a zigzag stitch relative to needle position. The stitching head equipped with roving <b>spool,</b> <b>pipe</b> and needle can rotate arbitrarily 360 degrees. During each stitch the upper thread is pulled through the base material and looped around the lower thread spool. Hence a double backstitch is performed. Currently, up to 800 stitches per minute can be achieved. The base material can be a 2D-textile such as woven or non-woven fabric or a matrix-compatible foil material for thermoplastic composites. The stitching path can be designed in form of a pattern either with the help of classical design embroidery software or more recent by use of 2D-CAD systems. Afterwards necessary information of the stitch positions are added to the pattern with the help of so-called punch software and finally transferred to the TFP machine.|$|R

The need to reach and bring the hydrocarbons from the fields located in deep and ultra-deep waters, imposes the need to improve the technologies and techniques in order to repair any unacceptable damage in pipeline. The main objective of this work is to investigate various methods for repairing a subsea pipeline that has been damaged and that is below diving depth. The investigation covers the methods that are applicable for three different water depths of 150, 350 and 1350 meters, two different pipe sizes of 12 and 28 inches and two different length of lines: 5 km (e. g. in-field pipeline) and 500 km (e. g. export pipeline). Since the cause and severity of damage determines the necessity and type of required repair, it is significant to study different scenarios of damage: dent, crack (field joint) and corrosion. For this purpose, the studies and investigations that have been performed so far will be reviewed. Welding sleeves and mechanical couplings provide the main solutions for major damages. High pressure and structural clamps are also repair tools for minor damages. Remote welding concept is under development for deep waters. The repair challenges have been discussed and some ideas are concluded.

While {{each of the three}} topics in the thesis is investigated and discussed in a stand-alone manner, they all share a common industry objective; increasing the yield and prolonging the viable production period of hydrocarbon producing fields. More specifically, they reside within two important classes of production technology challenges; (a) boosting the deliverability and the flow of wells with high water content, and (b) separating and removing of water from hydrocarbon streams {{as close as possible to}} the source in a production gathering system. Numerical modeling is the main methodology employed in the three topics, where modeling results are substantiated by field scale or laboratory generated data. The inline oil-water separation technology addressed in this thesis is based on a controlled and distributed tapping from the lower side of a water rich stream flowing in an inclined <b>pipe</b> <b>spool.</b> The long term objective is to develop a capability for seabed separation near the subsea wells in mature offshore fields with high water production and declining reservoir pressure. The intention is to reduce the backpressure on the wells and increase or maintain their production level. The production gain is achieved by harnessing and hydraulically manipulating the energy of the inlet mixture stream to reduce the backpressure exerted by the outlet streams. Important and unique features of the concept are; the separation and phase splitting do not consume external energy, there are no major moving parts, and there is inherent performance tolerance to deviations from the design set-points. The thesis expands an earlier IPT/NTNU concept verification research project (Sponsored by the Research Council program DEMO 2000) which involved experimenting with a low pressure full scale separator test facility. This thesis progresses the relevant previous knowledge and information from a concept validation level to establishing and validating a more detailed design strategy and a more focused performance design for the separator. The thesis brings the investigated separation approach to a mature level where the fluid mechanics design aspects are largely clear and understood and are ready as an input for the mechanical design of a separator prototype. The separation was analyzed from the multiphase hydraulic design point of view using numerical experimentation as the primary tool. The research methodology comprised of conducting the following tasks: (a) developing a procedure to assess the potential production gain of installing the inline separator in a subsea production system and to identify the design requirements for obtaining a specified separator performance, (b) introducing and demonstrating concepts to quantify the drainage performance of a single and multiple taping points, (c) Validating the usefulness of 3 D CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) methods to represent  the fluid dynamics details of an oil-in-water dispersion and separation, (d) Employing the same 3 D CFD model to reproduce the laboratory experimental results. The other two topics in the thesis constitute a response to emerging field scale problems where the industry have called for an immediate and sound modeling based diagnostic and modeling based investigative design. The second topic addresses an optimization strategy for large oil production systems consisting of clusters of high water cut, low GOR oil wells producing by ESP. The production streams of the wells converge through a multi branched surface gathering system into a system of main flow conduits leading to a single processing plant. The objective is to perform a model based numerical optimization to maximize oil production and reduce lift costs by modifying ESP rotor rotation frequency while complying with multiple operational constraints. While industry is currently in possession of tools to perform such tasks the outcome is inconsistent and yields poor optimization result when modeling large system with many wells, complex network and large number of constraints. An investigative task to clarify the source of the difficulties was deemed necessary. The optimization technique is described in the thesis and employed to quantifying the achievable production gains. It also identifies the computational hurdles encountered in computing the global production optimum. The thesis reports and discusses modeling and optimization using three cases: two are scaled-down synthetic cases to establish the fundamentals of the computational process, and one case on a field-scale production system is used to capture the impact of system complexity. The observed outcome and the conclusions of the investigation provide bases for a robust and consistent production optimization program of a large field. The details of this industrial scale project are beyond the scope of this thesis The third topic deals with modeling and critical analysis of a novel design of a positive displacement pump for drilling mud circulation. The concept has been commercialized and launched to the offshore market in recent years (commercially called “Hex pump”). The obvious attractiveness of the pump is its compactness and its small footprint when mounted on congested offshore platforms. However, the pumping performance of the pilot installation was very poor exhibiting excessive pulsation, vibration, mechanical failures and noise. These have driven expensive and critical drilling operations offshore to a halt. It has been recognized at this stage that the unique and innovative design features of the pump together with the criticality of it good and safe performance warned a thorough model based concept analysis and verification. The thesis describes the hydraulic performance modeling and its use to identify the concept inherent pulsation generating source. The conducted modeling and its interpretation are of novel nature and the results revealed a fundamental conceptual flaw. The research outcome had a prompt and an immediate impact on the industry decision of deploying this novel pump type.
