5|$|Some ant {{species are}} {{considered}} as pests, primarily those {{that occur in}} human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the Argentine ant, pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ant,</b> carpenter ants, odorous house ant, red imported fire ant, and European fire ant. Some ants will raid stored food, others may damage indoor structures, some can damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests), and some will sting or bite. The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed {{by a combination of}} approaches that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis. Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> queen can lay {{hundreds}} of eggs in her lifetime. Most lay 10 to 12 eggs per batch {{in the early}} days of egg production and only four to seven eggs per batch later. At 27°C (80°F) and 80 percent relative humidity, eggs hatch in five to seven days. The larval period is 18 to 19 days, pre-pupal period three days and pupal period nine days. About four more days are required to produce sexual female and male forms. From egg to sexual maturity, it takes the <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> about 38 to 45 days, depending on temperature and relative humidity. They breed continuously throughout the year in heated buildings and mating occurs in the nest. Mature colonies contain several queens, winged males, workers, eggs, larvae, pre-pupae and pupae.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> copulation, {{like that}} of many social insects, is harmful to the female. The penis valve {{contains}} sharp teeth, which latch onto a thick, soft cuticular layer in the female. This method of copulation too has an evolutionary basis. The teeth ensure sex lasts long enough for sufficient sperm transfer. Also, the pain caused to the female may, in some ways, lessen her desire to mate again.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> are a {{tropical}} species, but they thrive in buildings almost anywhere, even in temperate regions provided central heating is present.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> {{have also}} been exterminated by placing baits of ground liver mixed with boric acid, in places where the ants forage.|$|R
25|$|Both the {{attractive}} and repellent pheromones are utilized {{in the decision-making}} an ant must make while foraging. The repellent pheromone is especially useful in the repositioning of trails after a new food source has been introduced. It also helps prevent ants from concentrating on an undesirable trail. Thus, the repellant pheromone makes the <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> a particularly efficient forager. Despite their extreme importance, there is an adaptive value to using pheromones sparingly, as it streamlines communication during important decision-making situations, such as a nest migration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> colonies {{appear to}} prefer {{familiar}} nests to novel nests while budding. This suggests {{the ability for}} colonies to remember certain qualities of their living space. However, if the novel (unfamiliar) nest is of superior quality, the colony may initially move toward the familiar, but will eventually select the unfamiliar. The colony assumes the familiar nest is preferable, unless they sense better qualities in the novel nest. This decision-making process seeks to minimize the time the colony is without a nest while optimizing the nest the colony finally chooses.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{collective}} defences in some eusocial taxa {{also shows that}} social immunity may also not always be adaptive (due to life history costs or ineffectiveness against a particular parasite's infective strategy), and that living in a group does not necessitate the expression of any particular suite of social immunity mechanisms. For example, worker termites (Zootermopsiss angusticollis) do not discriminate between infected and uninfected conspecifics, <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> colonies (Monomorium pharaonis) choose to move into infected nests over uninfected ones and queen wood ants (Formica paralugubris) are not repelled but actually attracted to habitats contaminated with entamopathogenic fungi.|$|E

25|$|Budding is a {{major factor}} {{underlying}} the invasiveness of <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ants.</b> A single seed colony can populate a large office block, almost to the exclusion of all other insect pests, in less than six months. Elimination and control are difficult because multiple colonies can consolidate into smaller colonies during extermination programs only to repopulate later. <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> are a major hazard in hospitals, where their small size means they can access wounds and medical instruments, causing the spread of infection and electrical interference.|$|R
25|$|Many {{invasive}} ants display unicoloniality. The {{adaptive value}} of this nonaggression among colonies {{has to do with}} avoiding unnecessary injury and allowing proper resource allocation, ensuring success for all the colonies. Low nestmate recognition, caused in part by polygyny, also has a biochemical basis in M. pharaonis. Cuticular hydrocarbons are compounds, often found on antennae, that allow for communication in many social insects. In ant species, these compounds play an especially key role in nestmate recognition. Differences in cuticular hydrocarbons are detected by other ant species, who respond accordingly. However, all <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> colonies have the same hydrocarbons on their antennae. This leads to ineffective nestmate recognition, and nonaggression between colonies.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> is a {{polygynous}} {{species that}} has a relatively low worker to queen ratio of around 12.86. This allows the pharaoh ants {{to be able to}} exert social control over the size of the colony and the size of each caste. In the average nest, there are around 170 ± 8 queens every nest, which comprises around 5.2% of the total population, whereas there are around 2185 ± 49 workers, which make up around 66.6% of the population. This low worker to queen ratio is usually associated with swift changes in the nest and may be why pharaoh ants form many new nest buds quickly. To branch out and form a new bud nest, pharaoh ants need a minimum of 469 ± 28 individuals, which explains how they proliferate so quickly.|$|E
25|$|In <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> colonies new {{males and}} queen ants can be {{produced}} when the existing fertile queen is removed. When queens are absent, the workers in the nest can do two things: either rear existing sexual larvae or transport sexual larvae from other bud nests or from the main nest to its own nest. However, when there are fertile queens still within the nest, the worker ants will cannibalize the sexual larvae and will either reject or consume sexual larvae from other nests. On the other hand, the worker ants will always accept and nurture worker larvae from other nests. Furthermore, according to Schmidt et al., polygamous species such as pharaoh ants will have higher resource allocations towards the female caste instead of the worker caste to ensure rapid growth of new budding colonies.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> utilize 3 {{types of}} pheromones. One is a {{long-lasting}} attractive chemical {{that is used}} to build a trail network. It remains detectable even if the ants do not use the trail for several days. <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> cease activity at night and begin each day of work at around 8am, yet parts of the trail network are identical each day. [...] The second pheromone is also attractive, but will decay to imperceptible amounts {{in a matter of minutes}} without reapplication. This pheromone is useful in marking food sources, as these are unpredictable and the colony must be able to respond to environmental changes quickly. Individuals will not waste their time on an unprofitable trail route. The third pheromone is a repellant. [...] <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> were the first species found to use a negative trail pheromone. If an individual finds an unprofitable area with little food or significant danger, it will release this repellant pheromone, which will warn others and cause them to look elsewhere. While positive pheromones indicating lucrative foraging sites are very common in social insects, the <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant's</b> negative pheromone is highly unusual. [...] Like the food source marker, the negative pheromone is volatile, decaying roughly two hours after being emitted. It may even be insecticidal in some cases. It is so powerful that an individual can detect it from [...] away. <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> utilize this pheromone near forks in the trail network, and an ant that detects it will begin to walk in a zigzag manner.|$|R
50|$|Cockroaches, black garden <b>ants,</b> <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> and {{burgundy}} snails {{have also}} been found, {{but it is not}} clear if they have become part of the established fauna.|$|R
25|$|After foraging, <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> will wash {{themselves}} when a worker enters the cell. <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> will also wash {{after a long}} feed. It has been proposed that washing has a hygienic value, keeping the nest area clean, staving off disease and disorder. Right before workers leave to forage, they also may wash themselves. However, in this instance the behavior is extremely violent, often causing the ants to fall over. It is thought that here, the washing behavior has no hygienic value and instead may be a displacement activity, {{a sign that the}} ants are deliberating whether or not to exit the nest.|$|R
25|$|While pheromones {{explain the}} pharaoh ant's {{remarkable}} foraging ability, each forager’s uncanny capability {{to find its}} {{way back to the}} nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> relies on geometry to show it the way home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost always take the path that deviates less from its current direction. In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to find its way back to the nest. If the fork angle is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, M. pharaonis foragers were significantly less able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the wasted energy that would result from traveling in the wrong direction and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> (Monomorium pharaonis) {{is a small}} (2mm) {{yellow or}} light brown, almost {{transparent}} ant notorious for being a major indoor nuisance pest, especially in hospitals. [...] The <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant,</b> whose origins are unknown, has now been introduced to virtually every area of the world, including Europe, the Americas, Australasia and Southeast Asia.|$|E
2500|$|Pharaoh {{workers are}} about 2 millimeters, {{a little more}} than 1/16-inch, in length. They are light yellow to reddish brown in color with a darker abdomen. <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> workers have a {{non-functional}} stinger used to generate pheromones. The petiole (narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen) has two nodes and the thorax has no spines. <b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> eyesight is poor and they possess on average 32 ommatidia. [...] The antennal segments end in a distinct club with three progressively longer segments. This ant can be found almost anywhere in the world. It is a major pest in the United States, Australia, and Europe.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} not to attempt extermination using insecticidal sprays and dusts {{because they will}} cause the <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> to scatter and colonies to split, although non-repellent residual insecticides {{have been reported to}} be effective.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> have a {{sophisticated}} strategy for food preference. They implement two related behaviors. The first {{is known as}} satiation. The workers will at first show a strong preference for a particular food type. However, if this food is offered alone, with no other options, for several weeks, workers will afterward show a distinct preference for {{a different type of}} food. In this way, the ants become satiated on a certain food group and will change their decision. The second behavior is called alternation. If given the continuous choice between food groups, <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> will tend to alternate between carbohydrate-rich foods and protein-rich foods. These satiation and alternation behaviors are evolutionarily adaptive. The decision to vary the type of food consumed ensures that the colony maintains a balanced diet.|$|R
25|$|If a {{large amount}} of larvae results in a surplus of secretions, <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ants</b> will store the excess in the gasters of a unique caste, the replete workers. Members of this group have {{enormous}} gasters and can regurgitate their stored food when needed. In this way, the colony has a cushion against food shortages.|$|R
2500|$|... "Group {{living is}} always {{associated}} with the expression of social immunity" [...] – this is false; worker termites (Z. angusticollis) do not discriminate between infected and uninfected conspecifics, <b>pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> colonies (Monomorium pharaonis) choose to move into infected nests over uninfected ones and [...] queen wood ant (Formica paralugubris) [...] are not repelled but actually attracted to habitats contaminated with entamopathogenic fungi.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pharaoh</b> <b>ant</b> colonies contain many queens. The {{ratio of}} queens to workers is {{variable}} and {{dependent on the}} size of the colony. An individual colony normally contains 1,000–2,500 workers, but often a high density of nests gives the impression of massive colonies. In a small colony, there will be more queens relative to workers. In addition, individuals will be larger than those in a more populous colony. This ratio is controlled by the workers in the colony. Larvae that will produce workers have characteristic hairs all over them, while larvae that will produce sexual males or females are bare. It is thought that workers can use these distinguishing features to identify larvae. Workers may cannibalize larvae in order to ensure a favorable caste ratio. This decision to cannibalize is largely determined by the present caste ratio. If plenty of fertile queens are present, for example, the workers may eat sexual larvae. [...] The caste ratios are controlled in an attempt to maximize the growth of the colony. For example, in a small colony, the ratio of queens to workers is increased. This in turn increases the potential for reproduction, allowing colony growth. Conversely, in a large colony, the high worker to queen ratio maximizes the foraging capacity of the nest, helping sustain the population size.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pharaoh's</b> <b>ants</b> organise their {{foraging}} system {{using three}} types of trail pheromone. All previous foraging models based on specific ant foraging systems have assumed that only a single attractive pheromone is used. Here we present an agent-based model based on trail choice at a trail bifurcation within the foraging trail network of a <b>Pharaoh's</b> <b>ant</b> colony which includes both attractive (positive) and repellent (negative) trail pheromones. Experiments have previously shown that <b>Pharaoh's</b> <b>ants</b> use both types of pheromone. We investigate how the repellent pheromone affects trail choice and foraging success in Our simulated foraging system. We find that both the repellent and attractive pheromones {{have a role in}} trail choice, and that the repellent pheromone prevents random fluctuations which could otherwise lead to a positive feedback loop causing the colony to concentrate its foraging on the unrewarding trail. An emergent feature of the model is a high level of variability in the level of repellent pheromone on the unrewarding branch. This is caused by the repellent pheromone exerting negative feedback on its own deposition. We also investigate the dynamic situation where the location of the food is changed after foraging trails are established. We find that the repellent pheromone has a key role in enabling the colony to refocus the foraging effort to the new location. Our results show that having a repellent pheromone is adaptive, as it increases the robustness and flexibility of the colony's overall foraging response. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
