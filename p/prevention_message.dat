40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the current <b>prevention</b> <b>messages</b> that exist {{surrounding}} the prevention of online fraud. In particular, it focuses on the amount and level of detail that is promoted for each type of potential fraudulent approach. Design/methodology/approach - Multiple data sources are used to establish the main premise of this paper. This includes the publication entitled Little Black Book of Scams, qualitative data from victims who have experienced online fraud, and materials collected through a police investigation into online fraud. Findings - Results of this analysis indicate that current <b>prevention</b> <b>messages</b> are characterised by a large degree of detail about the various ways that (online) fraud can be perpetrated. This is argued to be ineffective, based on the experiences of victims who were unable to apply their previous knowledge about fraud to their experiences. Additionally, the categorisation of fraudulent approaches is highlighted as unimportant to offenders, who are focused on obtaining money by whatever means (or approach) possible. Practical implications - This article provides the impetus to evaluate the effectiveness of current <b>prevention</b> <b>messages.</b> It points to a simplification of existing <b>prevention</b> <b>messages</b> to focus more importantly on the transfer of money and the protection of personal information. Originality/value - This article argues that current <b>prevention</b> <b>messages</b> are characterised by too much “white noise”, in that they focus on an overwhelming amount of detail. This is argued to obscure what should be a straightforward message which could have a greater impact than current messages...|$|R

LoveLife media messages (as gain-framed HIV/AIDS <b>prevention</b> <b>messages)</b> were purposefully sampled. Qualitative content analysis allowed loveLife media messages to be analysed through coding, categorisation and memoing. The analysis process revealed core values and developmental assets portrayed in gain-framed HIV/AIDS <b>prevention</b> <b>messages.</b> Core values identified included, love, respect (portrayed least), dignity (portrayed most) and responsibility. Internal assets identified included, achievement motivation, school engagement, responsibility, integrity, restraint, honesty, planning and decision making, resistant skills, personal power, sense of purpose, self-esteem and positive view of personal future., External assets identified included, family support and positive family communication. Responsibility and personal power, were portrayed most and honesty together with family support, and positive family communication, least. Broadcast messages portrayed the most developmental assets and outdoor messages the least. Correlations were found between core values love, dignity, and responsibility, and the identified developmental assets. Insight was gained into three potential roles developmental assets could play in framing HIV/AIDS <b>prevention</b> <b>messages.</b> Firstly, developmental assets could serve as a source of enablement to make youth aware of strengths they could utilise to foster well-being. Secondly, developmental assets could direct incorporation of positive psychology principles in designing HIV/AIDS <b>prevention</b> <b>messages.</b> Lastly, the study revealed that the developmental asset framework could be used in conjunction with the theory of message framing in designing HIV/AIDS <b>prevention</b> <b>messages.</b> Dissertation (MEd) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Major burn {{injuries}} cause devastating {{physical and}} psychosocial morbidity, combined with significant {{health care and}} community costs. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of a targeted burn <b>prevention</b> <b>message</b> on burn safety knowledge and behavior. METHODS: An 11 -year retrospective review of patients admitted to an adult tertiary burn center identified flammable liquid burn injuries in males older than 15 years as 23 % of admissions and the most common preventable injury. Burn safety knowledge and experience were measured in a single-blinded, controlled, restricted (male, > 15 years), interventional, (therapeutic) prevention study using a total of 2, 053 computer-assisted telephone interviews in an intervention region (IR) and control region. A two-week multimedia campaign with the theme "Don't Be a Flamin' Fool" was delivered in the IR. RESULTS: The preintervention survey revealed that 13 % (218 of 1, 637) reported having previously had a gasoline (petrol) burn. Following the intervention, there was a higher percentage of respondents in the IR that had seen or heard a burn <b>prevention</b> <b>message</b> in the previous 3 months (51 % vs. 10 %; p < 0. 001) and perceived that gasoline was a danger when used to start a fire (97 % vs. 91 %; p = 0. 001), that any volume of gasoline was unsafe (85 % vs. 65 %; p < 0. 001), and that gasoline can explode (96 % vs. 92 %; p = 0. 001). Awareness and memory reverted to preintervention levels at 12 months. Eighty-three percent of respondents (100 of 120) who had seen the "Flamin' Fool" campaign thought it was effective in getting its message across.

40|$|Corporate cancer {{marketers}} use advertising {{strategies to}} meet business goals such as building awareness, attracting new patients or increasing philanthropic {{support for an}} organization. Traditionally, marketers have promoted the treatments and services offered at their healthcare facilities to consumers or potential patients to meet these objectives. ^ This study sought to assess the relationship between marketing messages and a cancer center 2 ̆ 7 s business results. Specifically, could <b>prevention</b> <b>messaging,</b> which is typically not used to drive metrics such as patient leads, {{have a positive impact}} on business indicators? A retrospective, quantitative study was performed to execute this research with the aim of identifying any association between the type of messaging used in an ad campaign and subsequent business indicators. A brand advertising campaign from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center served as the case for this research. ^ This dissertation presented nine hypotheses regarding the relationship between marketing messages and business results. A combination of descriptive statistics, correlations, linear regression analyses and Chi-Square tests was used to evaluate each of the hypotheses. This research confirmed that <b>prevention</b> <b>messages</b> were not only a viable option in the marketing program, but also led to strong action and loyalty behaviors from consumers. ^ The results found that there were positive relationships between <b>prevention</b> <b>messaging</b> and consumer engagement, new patient leads and donations. Each of these relationships was statistically significant, and the proposed hypotheses were accepted. Similarly, there were positive relationships between the treatment message and consumer engagement, new patient leads and donations. However, only the relationship between appointment messages and consumer engagement was statistically significant. Therefore, this hypothesis was accepted and the remaining treatment hypotheses were rejected. ^ Recommendations were made to include more <b>prevention</b> <b>messaging</b> in corporate cancer marketing programs due to its positive impact on business indicators. Inclusion of <b>prevention</b> <b>messaging</b> can not only help to enhance business results but also spread more critical health information to consumers to reduce the burden of cancer in our communities. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how clergy are dealing with HIV prevention and sexuality education of young people in their congregations. An electronic questionnaire was filled in by 142 clergy from white Afrikaans-speaking churches in the Reformed tradition. Results showed that 77 % clergy believed that unmarried young people in their congregations are sexually active. More than 85 % clergy agreed that it is the task of the church to provide sexuality and HIV prevention education to young congregants. However, not many clergy (13 %) offered HIV prevention programmes for young people in their own congregations. The main HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>message</b> 85 % of clergy were prepared to share with young congregants was �abstinence only� or �your body is the temple of God�. Only 15 % clergy (significantly more female clergy) were prepared to offer comprehensive sexuality education (abstinence PLUS) programmes. The HIV <b>prevention</b> <b>message</b> of the church should at least be in line with the lived experiences and reality of its youth in today�s society. The church can no longer afford to alienate young people through moralism only. She needs an approach that satisfies both morality and reality. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article has implications for the fields of psychology, HIV and AIDS research and pastoral care. It challenges the way the church prepares young people to cope with HIV in a modern society and suggests change in terms of a greater participation in the sexuality education of young people. </p...|$|E

Underlying reasons for these false perceptions have received limited research attention and {{little is known about}} effective WTS prevention messaging. This study examined perceptions of the addictiveness of WTS among young adults and ascertained their feedback on WTS <b>prevention</b> <b>message</b> content. Methods Young adult (n= 44, Mean [M] age 25. 3, SD 2. 7, range 18 - 30) waterpipe tobacco users were recruited online for a cross-sectional survey. Closed-ended measures assessed demographics, waterpipe use, other tobacco consumption, and perceived addictiveness of WTS. Open-ended items assessed perceptions of WTS and ascertained feedback on WTS <b>prevention</b> <b>message</b> content. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively. Open-ended data were coded to identify emerging themes. Results Participants reported low perceived addictiveness of WTS (Mean 2. 0, SD 0. 9, range 1 - not at all, 4 - very), perceived chances of becoming addicted (Mean 3. 0, SD 1. 6, range 1 - no chance, 7 - certain), and desire to quit (Mean 3. 0, SD 1. 8, range 1 - not at all, 7 - very). In open-ended responses, participants indicated social WTS does not lead to addiction and believe it is easy to quit. Some expressed concerns that WTS addiction may lead to health harms, social stigma, and financial costs. Participants indicated messages using vivid imagery and conveying negative health effects could motivate cessation. Conclusions Young adults view that WTS is not addictive, particularly related to use in social settings.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2011, {{a patient}} was {{admitted}} to our hospital with acute schistosomiasis after having returned from Madagascar and having bathed at the Lily waterfalls. On {{the basis of this}} patient's indication, infection was suspected in 41 other subjects. This study investigated (1) the knowledge of the travelers about the risks of schistosomiasis and their related behavior to evaluate the appropriateness of prevention messages and (2) the diagnostic workup of symptomatic travelers by general practitioners to evaluate medical care of travelers with a history of freshwater exposure in tropical areas. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the 42 travelers with potential exposure to schistosomiasis. It focused on pre-travel knowledge of the disease, bathing conditions, clinical presentation, first suspected diagnosis, and treatment. RESULTS: Of the 42 questionnaires, 40 (95 %) were returned, among which 37 travelers (92 %) reported an exposure to freshwater, and 18 (45 %) were aware of the risk of schistosomiasis. Among these latter subjects, 16 (89 %) still reported an exposure to freshwater. Serology was positive in 28 (78 %) of 36 exposed subjects at least 3 months after exposure. Of the 28 infected travelers, 23 (82 %) exhibited symptoms and 16 (70 %) consulted their general practitioner before the information about the outbreak had spread, but none of these patients had a serology for schistosomiasis done during the first consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The usual <b>prevention</b> <b>message</b> of avoiding freshwater contact when traveling in tropical regions had no impact on the behavior of these travelers, who still went swimming at the Lily waterfalls. This <b>prevention</b> <b>message</b> should, therefore, be either modified or abandoned. The clinical presentation of acute schistosomiasis is often misleading. General practitioners should at least request an eosinophil count, when confronted with a returning traveler with fever.
