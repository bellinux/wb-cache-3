Once, indeed, it seemed likely to be buried; for three hundred years ago it had become covered to the depth of sixteen feet, but the soil has since been dug away from its base, which is now {{lower than that of}} the road which passes through the neighboring gate of San Paolo. Midway up the <b>pyramid,</b> <b>cut</b> in the marble, is an inscription in large Roman letters, still almost as legible as when first wrought.|$|E
6000|$|That then which I {{would have}} the reader inquire {{respecting}} every work of art of undetermined merit submitted to his judgment, is not {{whether it be a}} work of especial grandeur, importance, or power; but whether it have any virtue or substance as a link in this chain of truth, whether it have recorded or interpreted anything before unknown, whether it have added one single stone to our heaven-pointing <b>pyramid,</b> <b>cut</b> away one dark bough, or levelled one rugged hillock in our path. This, if it be an honest work of art, it must have done, for no man ever yet worked honestly without giving some such help to his race. God appoints to every one of his creatures a separate mission, and if they discharge it honorably, if they quit themselves like men and faithfully follow that light which is in them, withdrawing from it all cold and quenching influence, there will assuredly come of it such burning as, in its appointed mode and measure, shall shine before men, and be of service constant and holy. Degrees infinite of lustre there must always be, but the weakest among us has a gift, however seemingly trivial, which is peculiar to him, and which worthily used will be a gift also to his race forever-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{of the dam}} {{was made}} {{possible}} by California voter approval in 1960 of the California Aqueduct project, also referred to as the Feather River project (the source of the water {{in the northern part of}} the state north of Auburn). State bonds were issued to finance the project. Pyramid Dam, which first began construction in 1968, is 386 feet (118 m) high. It lies directly behind the mountain rock giving the dam and lake its name - <b>Pyramid</b> <b>Cut</b> - which before the Ridge Route Alternate (later signed as U.S. Route 99) was built through the area in the 1931 to 1933 time period, was just another ordinary mountain. The highway construction of the Ridge Route Alternate caused this mountain to have part of its mass [...] "shaved" [...] off - reduced in size - and after the work to accommodate highway traffic was finished, the shape of the cut was found to resemble a pyramid, and hence the name.|$|E
50|$|Only the {{primitives}} {{which are}} within the visual volume need to actually be rastered (drawn). This visual volume {{is defined as the}} inside of a frustum, a shape {{in the form of a}} <b>pyramid</b> with a <b>cut</b> off top. Primitives which are completely outside the visual volume are discarded; This is called frustum culling. Further culling methods such as backface culling, which reduce the number of primitives to be considered, can theoretically be executed in any step of the graphics pipeline. Primitives which are only partially inside the cube must be clipped against the cube. The advantage of the previous projection step is that the clipping always takes place against the same cube. Only the - possibly clipped - primitives, which {{are within the}} visual volume, are forwarded to the final step.|$|R
50|$|Panels of RAM are {{typically}} {{installed on the}} walls of an EMC test chamber with the tips pointing inward to the chamber. Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by two effects: scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from the receiver, or incoherently where waves are picked up by the receiver but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. This incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended carbon particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10 dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the <b>pyramid</b> shapes are <b>cut</b> at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the Pyramid-Technique, a new {{indexing}} method for high-dimensional data spaces. The Pyramid-Technique is highly adapted to range query processing using the maximum metric L max. In contrast {{to all other}} index structures, {{the performance of the}} Pyramid-Technique does not deteriorate when processing range queries on data of higher dimensionality. The Pyramid-Technique is based on a special partitioning strategy which is optimized for high-dimensional data. The basic idea is to divide the data space first into 2 d pyramids sharing the center point of the space as a top. In a second step, the single <b>pyramids</b> are <b>cut</b> into slices parallel to the basis of the pyramid. These slices form the data pages. Furthermore, we show that this partition provides a mapping from the given d-dimensional space to a 1 -dimensional space. Therefore, we are able to use a B+-tree to manage the transformed data. As an analytical evaluation of our technique for hypercube range queries and uniform data distribution shows, the Pyramid-Technique clearly outperforms index structures using other partitioning strategies. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our technique, we experimentally compared the Pyramid-Technique with the X-tree, the Hilbert R-tree, and the Linear Scan. The results of our experiments using both, synthetic and real data, demonstrate that the Pyramid-Technique outperforms the X-tree and the Hilbert R-tree by a factor of up to 14 (number of page accesses) and up to 2500 (total elapsed time) for range queries. ...|$|R
40|$|Think Thingamajig and Other Things was {{commissioned}} {{as a solo}} exhibition by Kunsthaus Glarus. The exhibition consisted of three sculptural motifs - a ceramic cube with a pink and black pattern, a large <b>pyramid</b> with a <b>cut</b> out face and a sculptural speech-bubble. The exhibition used spectacle, figuration and narrative to coerce the viewer to engage with what was presented. The work {{can be understood as}} a series of devices that provoke critical reflection on this coercive role. As the title suggests, the work functions as a riddle or conundrum which eludes definitive meaning. This commission was the starting point for a series of works that used these devices to question different contexts. In 2004 the pyramid was exhibited on wasteland in Cardiff Bay, where its relationship to brutalist art forms questioned the traditions of sited public works in an area that, due to redevelopment, had a large number of such works.

40|$|Although {{photogrammetry}} employs photographs (or digital imagery today) for measurements, {{the concepts}} {{go back into}} history even earlier. In 1480, Leonardo da Vinci wrote the following: “Perspective is nothing else than the seeing of an object behind a sheet of glass, smooth and quite transparent, {{on the surface of}} which all the things may be marked that are behind this glass. All things transmit their images to the eye by pyramidal lines, and these <b>pyramids</b> are <b>cut</b> by the said glass. The nearer to the eye these are intersected, the smaller the image of their cause will appear ” [Doyle, 1964]. In 1492 he began working with perspective and central projections with his invention of the Magic Lantern 2 [Gruner, 1977], although {{there is no evidence that}} he actually built a working model and some claim the device actually dates back to the early Greeks. The principles of perspective and projective geometry form the basis from which photogrammetric theory is developed.

40|$|The {{application}} of an Isopropanol IPA free potassium hydroxide KOH {{solution was evaluated}} in order to prepare random <b>pyramids</b> on as <b>cut</b> crystalline n type Si wafers to reduce reflection losses of substrates for high efficiency hetero junction solar cells. The influence of saw damage removal and texturization processes on the resulting pyramid morphology and the corresponding interplay between optical and electronic properties are revealed. It is shown that both {{the depth of the}} saw damage etching SDE and the duration of the texturization etching have crucial influence on the resulting pyramid size distribution.

5000|$|As {{the stones}} forming {{the core of}} the <b>pyramids</b> were roughly <b>cut,</b> {{especially}} in the Great Pyramid, the material used to fill the gaps was another problem. Huge quantities of gypsum and rubble were needed. The filling has almost no binding properties, but it was necessary to stabilize the construction. To make the gypsum mortar, it had to be dehydrated by heating which requires large quantities of wood. According to Egyptologists, the findings of both the 1984 and 1995 David H. Koch Pyramids Radiocarbon Projects may suggest that Egypt had to strip its forest and scrap every bit of wood it had to build the pyramids of Giza and other even earlier 4th Dynasty pyramids. Carbon dating samples from core blocks and other materials revealed that dates from the 1984 study averaged 374 years earlier than currently accepted and the 1995 dating averaging 100-200 years. As suggested by team members, [...] "We thought that it was unlikely that the pyramid builders consistently used centuries-old wood as fuel in preparing mortar. The 1984 results left us with too little data to conclude that the historical chronology of the Old Kingdom was wrong by nearly 400 years, but we considered this at least a possibility". To explain this discrepancy, Egyptologists proposed the [...] "old wood" [...] theory claiming the earlier dates were possibly derived from recycling large amounts of centuries old wood and other earlier materials.|$|R
40|$|The Liquid Phase Epitaxy {{technique}} {{has been applied}} for the formation on InAs (100) substrates self-assembled InAsSbP-based strain induced islands. The evaluation of these objects from pyramids to globe and quantum dots (QD) was detected and investigated.

5000|$|Panels of RAM are {{installed}} with {{the tips of}} the pyramids pointing toward the radar source. These pyramids may also be hidden behind an outer nearly radar-transparent shell where aerodynamics are required. [...] Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from the receiver, or incoherently where waves may be reflected back to the receiver but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. A good example of coherent reflection is in the faceted shape of the F-117A stealth aircraft which presents angles to the radar source such that coherent waves are reflected away from the point of origin (usually the detection source). Incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended conductive particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10 dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the <b>pyramid</b> shapes are <b>cut</b> at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength. Other foam absorbers are available in flat sheets, using an increasing gradient of carbon loadings in different layers. Absorption within the foam material occurs when radar energy is converted to heat in the conductive particle. Therefore, in applications where high radar energies are involved, cooling fans are used to exhaust the heat generated.|$|R
