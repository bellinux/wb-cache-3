40|$|AbstractAimThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of person-centred care (PCC) after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in relation to educational level of participants. Method 199 Patients < 75 years with ACS were randomised to PCC plus usual care or usual care alone and followed for 6 months from hospital to outpatient care and primary care. For the PCC group, patients and health care professionals co-created a PCC health plan reflecting both perspectives, which induced a continued collaboration in person-centred teams at each health care level. A composite score of changes that included general self-efficacy assessment, return to work or previous activity level, re-hospitalisation or death was used as outcome measure. ResultsIn the group of patients without postsecondary education (n= 90) the composite score showed a significant improvement in favour of the PCC intervention (n= 40) vs. usual care (n= 50) at six months (35. 0 %, n= 14 vs. 16. 0 %, n= 8; odds ratio (OR) = 2. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 0 – 7. 7, P= 0. 041). In patients with postsecondary education (n= 109), a non-significant difference in favour of the PCC intervention (n= 54) vs. usual care (n= 55) was observed in the composite score (13. 0 %, n= 7 vs 3. 6 %, n= 2; OR= 3. 9, 95 % CI: 0. 8 – 19. 9, P= 0. 097). ConclusionA PCC approach, which stresses the necessity of a patient–health care professional partnership, is beneficial in patients with low education after an ACS event. Because these patients have been identified as a vulnerable group in cardiac rehabilitation, we suggest that PCC can be integrated into conventional cardiac rehabilitation programmes to improve both equity in uptake and health outcomes.

50|$|Although One Day... {{was better}} {{received}} by record buyers than the rapper's previous album, it was criticized by some longtime Common fans, mainly for its slightly more conventional production.
