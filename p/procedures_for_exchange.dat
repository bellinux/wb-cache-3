Rule-based storage {{accounting}} {{provides a}} framework for efficient and equitable allocation of the benefits, costs and risks associated with operation of multipurpose federal reservoir systems through (1) policies and <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchange</b> of storage among included purposes, and (2) a system of credits and penalties associated with storage use designed to prevent cross-subsidization among included purposes and to check unsustainable demands on storage. Rule-based storage accounting does not allocate water or storage, but defines procedures to ensure operational compliance with allocation formulas agreed upon by users of storage or included purposes. The principal features of rule-based storage accounting are listed as follows: Quantitative accounting of all demands on conservation storage based on established purposes, storage allocation, and system operating rules, priorities and constraints; Tracking and adaptation of reservoir system operating rules, instream flow requirements and water demands to ensure operational compliance and recovery of over-utilized storage. By giving all included purposes {{a stake in the}} management of the reservoir system, rule-based storage accounting provides an opportunity for parties in river basin water allocation or management conflicts to achieve consensus on water allocation formulas initially, and for participatory management of the Basins and comprehensive water planning thereafter. Rule-based storage accounting applies to consumptive and non-consumptive uses of water, and provides a practical means to allocate benefits, costs and risks of water management under riparian, appropriative and hybrid river basin management systems.

ICOPER Deliverable D- 6. 2 - Production flow {{description}} and prototype {{for the two}} platforms under study (Moodle and. LRN) including the required steps to exchange the material in both platforms. Madrid: Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; ICOPER. [contributors: Zuzana Bizonova, Michael Derntl, Tore Hoel, Roland Klemke, Tomaz Klobucar, Daniel Mueller, Jad Najjar, Anh Vu Nguyen-Ngoc, Elisabetta Parodi, Marcela Porta, Mirja Pulkkinen, Martin Sillaots, Michael Totschinig, Peter Vinnervik]In deliverable D 6. 1, assessment formats were studied from a language-theoretic point of view. In this deliverable D 6. 2, the analysis is done from a practical, tool-oriented point of view, with particular emphasis on interoperability. More precisely, {{the objective of this}} deliverable is twofold. First, to provide an in-depth analysis of interoperability and present a step-by-step <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchanging</b> e-learning material in two open source learning management systems (Moodle and. LRN). This procedure is then framed in the more general evaluation and production flow, which is analysed in order to enhance e-learning material. The first part thus addresses mainly tool developers, whereas the second is focused on final users related to assessment content, particularly content developers or even teachers. The exchange of assessment material between learning management systems is not a trivial issue. The usage of IMS QTI for this purpose provides us with the advantages of a well-known assessment specification, but with the disadvantages of its complexity (due to its high flexibility) and instability of versions. A prototype solution has been developed that, making use of IMS QTI 1. 2. 1, succeeds in this task. Although this solution is not complete, as it just covers a subset of the IMS QTI specification, it serves as a proof of concept for describing the detailed <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchanging</b> material between the two aforementioned open source LMSs (and also with Clix). Thus, users of LMSs have a step-by-step guide to exchange assessment material among these platforms. On the basis of the experience gained from the development of this prototype, a series of recommendations for assessment interoperability have been proposed. The first part of these recommendations is related to the idea of extending the QTI specification in order to link it to other e-learning fields. This integration brings some benefits, which emerge in the context of e-learning material repositories with several types of content, i. e., learning assessments, units of learning, learning outcomes, etc. A complete chapter has been devoted to the integration of assessment material in the Open ICOPER Content Space. For that purpose, a prototype is being developed for. LRN that covers a predefined set of assessment scenarios. These scenarios have been defined based on the assessment use cases {{that are part of the}} ICOPER Reference Model (IRM). Besides, this prototype implementation is helpful for evaluation of assessment recommendations and the IRM itself. Additional recommendations are also made about the usage of the IMS QTI specification per se. Nevertheless, to complete these recommendations is still work in progress. They will finally be presented in the last deliverable of Work Package 6. Regarding production flow, there are no unified procedures to carry it out in the studied European institutions. In addition, the platforms under study (Moodle and. LRN) do not provide support for it. Mechanisms for course evaluation and review are not supported by the platforms, because they tend to implement a more agile content production flow (e. g. the instructors themselves can edit the content in the final production system directly). In order to solve this problem, an example of a production flow and a series of quality assurance parameters have been presented. ICOPE...|$|R
40|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} predicts the formation of distinct parallel worlds {{as a result of}} a quantum mechanical measurement. Communication among these parallel worlds would experimentally rule out alternatives to this interpretation. A <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> ``interworld'' <b>exchange</b> of information and energy, using only state of the art quantum optical equipment, is described. A single ion is isolated from its environment in an ion trap. Then a quantum mechanical measurement with two discrete outcomes is performed on another system, resulting in the formation of two parallel worlds. Depending on the outcome of this measurement the ion is excited from only one of the parallel worlds before the ion decoheres through its interaction with the environment. A detection of this excitation in the other parallel world is direct evidence for the many-worlds interpretation. This method could have important practical applications in physics and beyond.

5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% <b>for</b> <b>exchange</b> rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> managing <b>exchange</b> rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible <b>for</b> <b>exchange</b> rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|R
