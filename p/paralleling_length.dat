With a favorable critical point at 31 °C and 7. 4 MPa, reaching above the critical point for scCO 2 is fairly accessible. Because of the compressible nature of scCO 2 and the large changes of viscosity and density with temperature and pressure, {{there is a need to}} determine the behavior of scCO 2 in microfluidic systems. Here, the influence of how parameters such as flow rate, temperature, pressure, and flow ratio affects the <b>length</b> of <b>parallel</b> flow of water and scCO 2 and the length of the created CO 2 segments are investigated and modeled using multivariate data analysis for a 10 mm long double-y channel. The <b>parallel</b> <b>length</b> and segment size were observed in the laminar regime around and above the critical point of CO 2. The flow ratio between the two fluids together with the flow rate influenced both the <b>parallel</b> <b>length</b> and the segment sizes, and a higher pressure resulted in shorter <b>parallel</b> <b>lengths.</b> Regarding the segment length of CO 2, longer segments were a result of a higher Weber number for H 2 O together with a higher temperature in the channel. ...|$|R

The effects arising from the finite <b>parallel</b> <b>length</b> of the blobs along the magnetic field lines are included in the analysis.

We find that the finite parallel blob size results in a modest reduction in the growth rates of the small (• 10 km) for the observed <b>parallel</b> blob <b>lengths</b> ( [...] - 300 - 600 kin). Further, it is found that the instability growth rates show a moderate reduction at higher altitudes (where ion-inertial effects may be dominant over the ion-neutral collisional effects).

The flow rate of oil is fixed at Qo= 0. 19 l/s and the {{flow rate of water}} Qw is varied from 0. 20 l/s to 0. 46 l/s. For large values of Qw (typically Qw> 0. 23 l/s), the CAF is unstable, and it becomes stable for low values of Qw (typically Qw< 0. 23 l/s). The spatiotemporal diagram technique is used to determine the characteristics of the water-oil interface, namely the entry <b>length,</b> height, <b>parallel</b> <b>length,</b> frequency, wavenumber, phase velocity, amplitude and spatial growth rate of wave amplitude as function of the water flow rate Qw.

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically how sheath radio-frequency (RF) oscillations {{relate to}} the spatial structure of the near RF parallel electric field E// emitted by Ion Cyclotron (IC) wave launchers. We use a simple model of Slow Wave (SW) evanescence coupled with Direct Current (DC) plasma biasing via sheath boundary conditions in a 3 D parallelepiped filled with homogeneous cold magnetized plasma. Within a "wide sheaths" asymptotic regime, valid for large-amplitude near RF fields, the RF part of this simple RF+DC model becomes linear: the sheath oscillating voltage VRF at open field line boundaries can be re-expressed as a linear combination of individual contributions by every emitting point in the input field map. SW evanescence makes individual contributions all the larger as the wave emission point is located closer to the sheath walls. The decay of |VRF| with the emission point/sheath poloidal distance involves the transverse SW evanescence length and the radial protrusion depth of lateral boundaries. The decay of |VRF| with the emitter/sheath parallel distance is quantified {{as a function of}} the <b>parallel</b> SW evanescence <b>length</b> and the <b>parallel</b> connection <b>length</b> of open magnetic field lines. For realistic geometries and target SOL plasmas, poloidal decay occurs over a few centimeters. Typical <b>parallel</b> decay <b>lengths</b> for |VRF| are found smaller than IC antenna parallel extension. Oscillating sheath voltages at IC antenna side limiters are therefore mainly sensitive to E// emission by active or passive conducting elements near these limiters, as suggested by recent experimental observations. Parallel proximity effects could also explain why sheath oscillations persist with antisymmetric strap toroidal phasing, despite the parallel anti-symmetry of the radiated field map. They could finally justify current attempts at reducing the RF fields induced near antenna boxes to attenuate sheath oscillations in their vicinity...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{turbulence}} is {{the dominant}} transport mechanism for heat and particles in magnetized plasmas in linear devices and tokamaks, so the study of turbulence is important in limiting and controlling this transport. Linear devices provide an axial magnetic field that serves to confine a plasma in cylindrical geometry as it travels along the magnetic field from the source to the strike point. Due to perpendicular transport, the plasma density and temperature have a roughly Gaussian radial profile with gradients that drive instabilities, such as resistive drift-waves and Kelvin-Helmholtz. If unstable, these instabilities cause perturbations to grow resulting in saturated turbulence, increasing the cross-field transport of heat and particles. When the plasma emerges from the source, there is a time, τ_∥, that describes the lifetime of the plasma based on <b>parallel</b> velocity and <b>length</b> of the device. As the plasma moves down the device, it also moves azimuthally according to E× B and diamagnetic velocities. There is a balance point in these parallel and perpendicular times that sets the stabilisation threshold. We simulate plasmas {{with a variety of}} <b>parallel</b> <b>lengths</b> and magnetic fields to vary the parallel and perpendicular lifetimes, respectively, and find that there is a clear correlation between the saturated RMS density perturbation level and the balance between these lifetimes. The threshold of marginal stability is seen to exist where τ_∥≈ 11 τ_. This is also associated with the product τ_∥γ_*, where γ_* is the drift-wave linear growth rate, indicating that the instability must exist for roughly 100 times the growth time for the instability to enter the non-linear growth phase. We explore the root of this correlation and the implications for linear device design. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
