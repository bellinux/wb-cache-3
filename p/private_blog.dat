40|$|Abstract Objectives of the Study The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to understand how consumers talk about authenticity in the context of private fashion and lifestyle blogs. Theoretical foundation The theoretical background is compiled of previous research on the discourses, which construct the discussion of authenticity. The literature review discusses authenticity in consumer behaviour, presenting life in <b>private</b> <b>blogs,</b> motivations for <b>blogging</b> and <b>private</b> <b>blogs</b> as consumer-generated advertising. Methodology This study applied methods of qualitative research. The empirical part is based on data collected in nine semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were selected based on their familiarity with private fashion and lifestyle blogs. Additionally, voluntary readership and following these blogs on one's own time was required. Data is analysed by using methods of thematic analysis and discourse analysis. Findings The main results of the thesis stress the emergence of three discursive main themes. The three discussions used to construct meanings of authenticity in the context of private fashion and lifestyle blogs are: life retold in personal blogs, motivations for blogging and weighing authority and agency. In the theme of life retold in blogs, authenticity is approached by meanings of real life and life that is perceived as modified. In the second discursive main theme meanings of self-expression motivations and desire for financial rewards are being pondered. The third discursive theme includes making sense of the balance of authority and agency between independent bloggers and company involvement in <b>private</b> <b>blogs.</b> Together these discursive themes construct the discussion of authenticity in this study. Talk of authenticity builds on self-referential goals. Blog readers talk about identification and personal benefit while negotiating self-referral authenticity...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This is {{an action}} {{research}} study, undertaken across two universities, investigating {{the use of}} <b>private</b> <b>blogs</b> to develop reflective learners within teacher training. Previous research into using blogs to promote reflection has determined {{that the use of}} publicly available blogs can impede deeper reflection due to lack of confidentiality (Divintini, et al., 2005; Oti and Clarke, 2007). The theory behind the use of blogs in {{this study was to determine}} if <b>private</b> <b>blogs</b> could provide a setting for reflective practice, a ‘practicum’ (Moon, 1999), where learners could be encouraged to reflect on their learning over a sustained period of time. Method: An action research, practitioner-led approach was taken for the study using two cohorts of trainee teachers at Sheffield Hallam University and Nottingham Trent University. Over the course of one year trainees were required to produce reflective blogs which were analysed for themes pertaining to their development as reflective practitioners. In addition to this, interviews and questionnaires were conducted at the end of the year with the trainees about their use of the blogs. Results: Thematic analysis of the blogs supported the work of Oti and Clarke (2007) and revealed specific instances of the trainees' emerging development both as reflective practitioners and as professionals. Overall, there is substantial evidence that the blogs were a useful tool by which to record reflections and development as teachers, and the quality of the reflections in the blog entries increased throughout the year. The trainees indicated that although they found reflection difficult in itself, having the blogs enabled them to reflect more effectively than using pen and paper. Conclusion: The research conducted demonstrated that the use of <b>private</b> <b>blogs</b> showed evidence of self-reflection and a developing professional identity among the learners, contrary to the limited reflection shown in previous research on public blogs. This paper seeks to share the findings of this research which the authors believe will be useful across other areas of Higher Education as well...|$|R

They are able to obtain the target’s private information by visiting those websites. Eventually they would post and show the information they get to the public through the internet.|$|R

Eventually, though, they bump into each other, and Jilly becomes Mark's girlfriend. Erin is (teenage) heartbroken, and thinks lowly of Mark and his actions. Later on, Jilly wants to break up with Mark because she thinks he is [...] "losing interest" [...] in her, and asks Erin to choose between Mark's friendship or hers. Erin chooses [...] "not to choose", instigating a dispute. Erin writes mean things about Jilly in her <b>private</b> <b>blog.</b> Through this time, Erin has written about how she practices kissing on a pillow for Mark, made a Hate-O-Rama page for Serena, and has talked about her suspicion of Tyler leaving notes in her locker - notes that smell like his hair gel.
