25|$|Even {{minor changes}} in the weather, <b>physical</b> <b>layout</b> or even bumping the chassis {{containing}} the tunable capacitors can cause the tuning to vary. For this reason a variety of systems were used to decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} radiogoniometer to mis-tuning. Primary among these was the aperiodic aerial concept, which described the mechanical layout of the radiogoniometer's internal wiring. By winding the sense coil wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the field coils in a similar arrangement {{as close as possible to}} the sense coil, the entire circuit became capacitively coupled. A single tunable capacitor on the output from the sense coil could then be used to tune the entire system.|$|E
25|$|The <b>physical</b> <b>layout</b> of {{the engine}} is novel. The {{oxidizer}} tank is a primary structural component, {{and is the only}} part {{of the engine}} that is structurally connected to the spacecraft: the tank is in fact an integral part of the spacecraft fuselage. The tank is a short cylinder of diameter approximately , with domed ends, and is the forwardmost part of the engine. The fuel casing is a narrow cylinder cantilevered to the tank, pointing backwards. The cantilevered design means that a variety of motor sizes can be accommodated without changing the interface or other components. The nozzle is a simple extension of the fuel casing; the casing and nozzle are actually a single component, referred to as the CTN (case, throat, and nozzle). Burt Rutan has applied for a patent on this engine configuration.|$|E

500|$|From the <b>physical</b> <b>layout</b> of the club, as {{described}} by Ed Sullivan in a 1939 column, the Stork should have been doomed to failure, since it was strangely shaped and far from roomy in places. The club's ladies' room was {{on the second floor}} of the structure and the men's room was on the third; only the dining room, bar, and later the Cub Room were on the first floor. Despite this, the club could hold 1,000 guests. A feature of the club was a solid 14-karat gold chain at its entrance; patrons were allowed entry through it by the doorman. When the East 53rd Street building came down to make way for Paley Park, one of the artifacts found in it was a still.

500|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for {{studying}} book embedding cited by [...] involves an application in VLSI design, to the organization of fault-tolerant multiprocessors. In the DIOGENES system developed by these authors, the CPUs of a multiprocessor system are arranged into a logical sequence corresponding to the spine of a book (although this sequence {{may not necessarily be}} placed along a line in the <b>physical</b> <b>layout</b> of this system). Communication links connecting these processors are grouped into [...] "bundles" [...] which correspond to the pages of a book and act like stacks: connecting one of the processors to {{the start of a new}} communications link pushes all the previous links upward in the bundle, and connecting another processor to the end of a communication link connects it to the one at the bottom of the bundle and pops all the other ones down. Because of this stack behavior, a single bundle can handle a set of communications links that form the edges of a single page in a book embedding. [...] By organizing the links in this way, a wide variety of different network topologies can be implemented, regardless of which processors have become faulty, as long as enough non-faulty processors remain to implement the network. [...] The network topologies that can be implemented by this system are exactly the ones that have book thickness at most equal to the number of bundles that have been made available.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} mobile ad-hoc indoor networks {{consisting of}} simple inexpensive robots, LANdroids, with limited wireless communication range {{and without any}} range or location sensors. We focus {{on the problem of}} using the mobile LANdroids to take responsibility for maintaining connectivity between a static Gateway and mobile Targets that move beyond the communication range of an established network. We refer to such a tracking task as Target Tethering. This type of network commonly uses IEEE 802. 11 wireless protocols for communication, with Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a measure of radio signal strength. RSSI data is noisy and poorly relates to distance in indoor environments, leading to a challenging Target Tethering task. Some algorithms use the trace of single-source RSSI data to infer distance between two nodes and use it to compute a Target Tethering policy. However, such distance estimates are poor. We instead aim at inferring <b>physical</b> network <b>layout</b> from RSSI data among multiple nodes. We introduce a novel approach based on Cluster Geometries, classes of network nodes corresponding to rotationinvariant <b>physical</b> <b>layouts</b> of LANdroids and a mobile Target, with the conjecture that multi-robot RSSI data can distinguish the Cluster Geometries and therefore the <b>physical</b> <b>layouts.</b> We proceed with extensive experiments and support our conjecture by showing successful classification of the designed Cluster Geometries given the multi-robot RSSI-based data. We then combine the estimated Geometries with motion patterns of the moving Targets to show that suitable multi-robot Target Tethering policies for unknown indoor environments can be learned using multi-agent reinforcement-learning. Specifically, we use an interesting variation of Q-learning where we first learn offline base policies in general open environments and later specialize the policies seamlessly during online execution to account for obstacles in the indoor environment.

40|$|Abstract—Parallel {{applications}} benefit {{considerably from}} the rapid advance of processor architectures and the available massive computational capability, but their performance suffers from large latency of I/O accesses. The poor I/O performance has been attributed {{as a critical}} cause of the low sustained performance of parallel systems. Collective I/O is widely considered a critical solution that exploits the correlation among I/O accesses from multiple processes of a parallel application and optimizes the I/O performance. However, the conventional collective I/O strategy makes the optimization decision based on the logical file layout to avoid multiple file system calls and does not take the <b>physical</b> data <b>layout</b> into consideration. On the other hand, the <b>physical</b> data <b>layout</b> in fact decides the actual I/O access locality and concurrency. In this study, we propose a new collective I/O strategy that {{is aware of the}} underlying <b>physical</b> data <b>layout.</b> We confirm that the new Layout-Aware Collective I/O (LACIO) improves the performance of current parallel I/O systems effectively with the help of noncontiguous file system calls. It holds promise in improving the I/O performance for parallel systems...|$|R
2500|$|All FETs have source, drain, {{and gate}} {{terminals}} that correspond roughly to the collector, emitter, and base of BJTs. Most FETs have a fourth terminal called the body, base, bulk, or substrate. This fourth terminal serves to bias the transistor into operation; {{it is rare}} to make non-trivial use of the body terminal in circuit designs, but its presence is important when setting up the <b>physical</b> <b>layout</b> of an integrated circuit. The size of the gate, [...] length L in the diagram, is the distance between source and drain. The width is {{the extension of the}} transistor, in the direction perpendicular to the cross section in the diagram (i.e., into/out of the screen). Typically the width is much larger than the length of the gate. A gate length of 1µm limits the upper frequency to about 5GHz, 0.2µm to about 30GHz.|$|E
2500|$|Integrated {{circuit design}} {{involves}} {{the creation of}} electronic components, such as transistors, resistors, capacitors and the metallic interconnect of these components onto a piece of semiconductor, typically silicon. A method to isolate the individual components formed in the substrate is necessary since the substrate silicon is conductive and often forms an active region of the individual components. The two common methods are p-n junction isolation and dielectric isolation. [...] Attention {{must be given to}} power dissipation of transistors and interconnect resistances and current density of the interconnect, contacts and vias since ICs contain very tiny devices compared to discrete components, where such concerns are less of an issue. Electromigration in metallic interconnect and ESD damage to the tiny components are also of concern. Finally, the <b>physical</b> <b>layout</b> of certain circuit subblocks is typically critical, in order to achieve the desired speed of operation, to segregate noisy portions of an IC from quiet portions, to balance the effects of heat generation across the IC, or to facilitate the placement of connections to circuitry outside the IC.|$|E
