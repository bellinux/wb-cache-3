The Constitution declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions, but provides that people cannot be discriminated against on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws. Furthermore, no person may be compelled to receive instruction in or take part in any ceremony or act of worship of a religion apart from his or her own.|$|E

25|$|By February 2007, {{the land}} swap {{agreement}} {{still had not}} been finalized. The zoning changes had not occurred, although city officials pledged they were coming. No agreement over parking garage management had been signed, either. The city declined {{to get involved in}} operation of the hotel, and advised Gould to negotiate with Marriott about parking garage management. The long negotiations triggered the late-fee clause that required the city to pay Gould $2.2 million. This, too, delayed the swap, since <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> greater than $1 million required city council approval. In September, Gould and the city public accused each other of stalling the deal.|$|E

25|$|A {{trade secret}} is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are {{that the value of}} a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E
25|$|In February 2000, KPMG were {{appointed}} as provisional liquidators of Airdrieonians. This move came soon after Rangers chairman David Murray had {{applied for a}} court order to seize some of Airdrie's revenue in lieu of funds owed to another of his companies. KPMG and the board hoped more private investment would be made in the club. Most of the playing staff were made redundant {{at the end of the}} 1999–2000 season. Steve Archibald put forth a bid for the club and during the 2000–01 season he brought in many foreign players, including David Fernández, Jesus Sanjuán, Antonio Calderón and Javier Sánchez Broto, that became popular with the fans and won the Scottish Challenge Cup in 2000. KPMG terminated their management deal with Archibald in February 2001, stating that Archibald had not kept up to date with <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees.</b> After difficulty fulfilling their fixtures, Airdrie narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division.|$|E
500|$|Article 16(1) of the Constitution prohibits {{discrimination}} against citizens of Singapore {{on the ground}} only of religion, race, descent or place of birth {{in the administration of}} public educational institutions (and, in particular, as regards the admission of students or the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees),</b> and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution.

500|$|After {{the death}} in 1817 of Thomas Wyon Sr, {{the father of}} the man who had adapted Pistrucci's designs, Pole most {{probably}} offered Pistrucci the post of chief engraver at the Royal Mint, with a salary of £500 per annum. and a house within the grounds of the Mint. However, it soon appeared that a law passed under William III barred foreigners from the post, and so Pole left it vacant, while granting Pistrucci the salary and emoluments of the office. Sir John Craig wrote in his history of the Royal Mint: [...] "The arrangement was not put into writing, and misunderstanding was easy for a foreigner. Pole categorically denied any commitment beyond the grant for the time being of a salary for coinage designs as cheaper than <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees.</b> The Italian persistently contended that he was seduced into Mint service by a promise of formal appointment to the chief engravership". According to H.W.A. Linecar in his book on British coin designs and designers, [...] "the arrangement might have worked very well, even though it was against accepted procedure, had Pistrucci been other than he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was assumed}} by ancient sources that Pindar's odes were {{performed}} by a chorus, but this has been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that the odes were in fact performed solo. It is not known how commissions were arranged, nor if the poet travelled widely: even when poems include statements like [...] "I have come" [...] it is not certain that this was meant literally. Uncomplimentary references to Bacchylides and Simonides were found by scholiasts {{but there is no}} reason to accept their interpretation of the odes. In fact some scholars have interpreted the allusions to fees in Isthmian 2 as a request by Pindar for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> owed to himself. His defeats by Corinna were probably invented by ancient commentators to account for the Boeotian sow remark, a phrase moreover that was completely misunderstood by scholiasts, since Pindar was scoffing at a reputation that all Boeotians had for stupidity.|$|E
2500|$|Warez is {{a common}} {{computing}} and broader cultural term referring to pirated software (i.e. illegally copied, often after deactivation of anti-piracy measures) that is distributed via the Internet. Warez is used most commonly as a noun, a plural form of ware (short for computer software), and {{is intended to be}} pronounced like the word , [...] The circumvention of copy protection (cracking) is an essential step in generating warez, and based on this common mechanism, the software-focused definition has been extended to include other copyright-protected materials, including movies and games. The global array of warez groups has been referred to as [...] "The Scene," [...] deriving from its earlier description as [...] "the warez scene." [...] Distribution and trade of copyrighted works without <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> or royalties generally violates national and international copyright laws and agreements. The term warez covers supported as well as unsupported (abandonware) items, and legal prohibitions governing creation and distribution of warez cover both profit-driven and [...] "enthusiast" [...] generators and distributors of such items.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike pre-Islamic Arabian society, the Qur'anic idea of {{economic}} circulation as {{a return of}} goods and obligations was for everyone, whether donors and recipients know each other or not, in which goods move, and society does what {{it is supposed to}} do. The Qur'an's distinctive set {{of economic}} and social arrangements, in which poverty and the poor have important roles, show signs of newness. The Qur'an told that the guidance comes to a community that regulates its flow of money and goods in the right direction (from top down) and practices generosity as reciprocation for God's bounty. In a broad sense, the narrative underlying the Qur'an is that of a tribal society becoming urbanized. Many scholars, such as Charles C. Torrey and Andrew Rippin, have characterized both the Qur'an and Islam as highly favorable to commerce and to the highly mobile type of society that emerged in the medieval Near East. Muslim tradition (both hadith and historiography) maintains that Muhammad did not permit the construction of any buildings in the market of Medina other than mere tents; nor did he permit any tax or rent to be taken there. This expression of a [...] "free market"—involving the circulation of goods within a single space without <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees,</b> taxes, or rent, without the construction of permanent buildings, and without any profiting {{on the part of the}} caliphal authority (indeed, of the Caliph himself)—was rooted in the term sadaqa, [...] "voluntary alms". This coherent and highly appealing view of the economic universe had much to do with Islam's early and lasting success. Since the poor were at the heart of this economic universe, the teachings of the Qur'an on poverty had a considerable, even a transforming effect in Arabia, the Near East, and beyond.|$|E
