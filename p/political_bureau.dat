5|$|In 1960 Podgorny {{became a}} member of the Politburo (<b>Political</b> <b>Bureau)</b> and by 1963 had risen to {{prominence}} within the Soviet hierarchy as a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). As a protégé and close companion of Nikita Khrushchev, he travelled with him to United Nations headquarters in 1960. He acted as a Soviet emissary to Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Canada, and Yugoslavia. Podgorny's beliefs were strongly influenced by Khrushchev, and under Leonid Brezhnev's rule, Podgorny was one of the most liberal members within the Soviet leadership, even more liberal than Premier Alexei Kosygin.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau</b> paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war. Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau</b> approved the General Staff’s plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and {{the goal was to}} capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng placed great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and surprise to draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective. For the element of surprise to be successful, North Vietnamese forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of surprise had been achieved, the North Vietnamese would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|E

Jugnauth became leader of the alliance with the same conditions. He would hold office of Prime Minister for 3 years before resigning {{to make way for}} Berenger.|$|R

50|$|Since its {{establishment}} in 1924, the Whampoa Military Academy had already set up its political work system. In April 1950, the academy reformed the political work system {{by changing the}} <b>Political</b> Staff <b>Bureau</b> to <b>Political</b> Department. In May 1951, it was renamed General Political Department and in August 1963 as General Political Warfare Department with some modifications to its structural agencies. On 1 March 2002, the Organizational Ordinance of the General <b>Political</b> Warfare <b>Bureau</b> was put into performance.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the party}} was {{established}} a <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau</b> ("Politburo") and Organisation Bureau ("Orgburo") to accompany the existing Central Committee; the decisions of these party bodies had to be adopted by Sovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence. Lenin was the most significant figure in this governance structure; {{as well as being}} the Chairman of Sovnarkom and sitting on the Council of Labour and Defence, he was on the Central Committee and Politburo of the Communist Party. The only individual to have anywhere near this influence was Lenin's right-hand man, Yakov Sverdlov, who died in March 1919 during a flu pandemic. In November 1917, Lenin and his wife took a two-room flat within the Smolny Institute; the following month they left for a brief holiday in Halia, Finland. In January 1918, he survived an assassination attempt in Petrograd; Fritz Platten, who was with Lenin at the time, shielded him and was injured by a bullet.|$|E

In 1960, Yugoslavia opened an embassy in Colombo, and he advised the new ambassador unofficially on how to operate in Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|Having risen {{and fallen}} several times, Deng showed little {{interest}} in politics after the Sino-Japanese War. He arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and retired as Director of the <b>Political</b> Work <b>Bureau.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>political</b> <b>bureaus</b> {{were first}} overseen in 1949 by a Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Prior to the {{creation}} of the position of Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs in August 1959, the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs assisted the Secretary and Under Secretary of State in the formulation and conduct of U.S. foreign policy. After August 1959, the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs served as a focal point for interdepartmental relations, especially those dealing with politico-military issues. During 1969, the Department discontinued the position and created a new Bureau for Politico-Military Affairs, which exists today as the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs under another Under Secretary.|$|R

25|$|When Chernenko died, Shevardnadze {{became a}} strong {{supporter}} of Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership candidacy. Shevardnadze {{became a member of the}} Central Committee (CC) of the CPSU in 1976, and in 1978 was promoted to the rank of non-voting candidate member of the Soviet <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau</b> (Politburo). His chance came in 1985, when the veteran Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko left that post for the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The de facto leader, Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, appointed Shevardnadze to replace Gromyko as Minister of Foreign Affairs, thus consolidating Gorbachev's circle of relatively young reformers.|$|E

In April 2009, Kim was promoted to General and then migrated to the KPA General <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau's</b> Organisation Department, at the same time when Kim Jong-il reportedly put Kim Jong-un in charge of the Ministry of State Security to which the Military Security Command is affiliated. Kim was also made a member of the Party's Central Committee and Central Military Commission in September 2010 and was reported to having a role in ensuring Kim Jong-un's succession.|$|R

25|$|Kulakov {{served as}} Stavropol First Secretary from 1960 until 1964, {{immediately}} following Nikita Khrushchev's ouster.

Kulakov was elected to several important seats in the 1960s. In 1971 {{he was elected to}} the <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau</b> (Politburo). He became a leading figure of Soviet leadership, and impressed Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to such an extent that commentators believed that Kulakov would become Brezhnev's successor. This did not happen since Kulakov died in 1978, four years before Brezhnev.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{deposition}} of Emperor Haile Selassie on 12 September 1974, the Derg {{was faced with}} a number of civilian groups competing for control of Ethiopia, most notably the communist Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP). In September 1976, EPRP militants were arrested and executed, {{at the same time as}} the EPRP carried out an assassination campaign against ideologues and supporters of the Derg. Although an unsuccessful attempt to kill Mengistu on 23 September was attributed to the EPRP, the first prominent victim of the EPRP's terror was Dr. Feqre Mar'ed, a member of the <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau</b> and All-Ethiopia Socialist Movement (MEISON), another Marxist-Leninist party.|$|E
25|$|In May 1982 the Fourth International {{opened the}} {{discussion}} for the Twelfth World Congress. The period before the Twelfth World Congress {{coincided with a}} deep crisis in the SWP (US). The SWP's leaders started to register a number of disagreements with the International, and withdrew from the day-to-day leadership of the International. In 1982 the <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau</b> of the SWP decided against the theory of Permanent Revolution, {{a key element of}} Trotskyism. The SWP's evolution was a central discussion at the congress, by which time the SWP's leadership had withdrawn from active participation in the International, prompting the International to launch International Viewpoint in 1982 and International Marxist Review in 1983. The International also supported the establishment of the International Institute for Research and Education in 1982.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} no open splits within the older {{generation}} of Fatah politicians since the 1980s, though there is occasional friction between members of the top leadership. One founding member, Faruq al-Qaddumi (Abu Lutf), continues to openly oppose the post-Oslo arrangements and has intensified his campaign for a more hardline position from exile in Tunis. Since Arafat's death, he is formally head of Fatah's <b>political</b> <b>bureau</b> and chairman, but his actual political following within Fatah appears limited. He has at times openly challenged the legitimacy of Abbas and harshly criticized both him and Mohammed Dahlan, but despite threats to splinter the movement, he remains in his position, and his challenges have so far been fruitless. Another influential veteran, Hani al-Hassan, has also openly criticized the present leadership.|$|E
25|$|Masrour, Masoud’s son, {{is now in}} the <b>Political</b> <b>Bureau.</b> Nechirvan, as Prime Minister, spearheaded {{unprecedented}} {{social and}} economic reforms, including attention to violence against women, improvements in infrastructure, and a focus on the private sector and foreign investment. He has also {{been at the forefront of}} the rapprochement with Turkey and the active development of oil and gas fields in the Region. According to Bruinessen, the traditional structure of Kurdish social and political organization was inherently tribal, with a tribe being a socio-political unit with distinct territorial limits and membership based on kinship. Tribal power is widespread in Erbil and Dahuk. And one must recognize the cultural differences between Erbil and Sulaymaniyah to understand the political nature of the region.|$|E
