A preliminary step to the conduct of the PIT is application of rapid inventory procedures that serve to provide the benchmark for the inventory, e. g., by identifying if any items are missing and also, if any unrecorded items are present. The Rapid Inventory approach is being implemented by the Research Institute for Atomic Reactors (RIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Russia, {{as one of the first}} steps in the program to enhance nuclear materials safeguards at the site. This effort is being conducted under the US-Russian Cooperative Program on Nuclear Materials Protection.

40|$|Following the Communication of Vice-President de Palacio to the Commission, dated 30 April 2004 on the {{implementation}} of nuclear inspection and safeguards tasks within the European Union, {{there have been a}} number of discussions with the Member States on this subject. These discussions have been related to and concentrated on, among other aspects, the improvement of future nuclear safeguards effectiveness and efficiency within the Community. This debate resulted in a 'non-paper' issued by the Council¿s Working Party on Atomic Questions (WPAQ) entitled ¿A New Framework for Euratom Safeguards¿. The WPAQ non-paper describes audits as a tool that can play a role in problem resolution and to check that the relevant standards are in place and being implemented effectively. Since the publication of the WPAQ non-paper, the Commission has undertaken the necessary steps to organise trial audits in a number of nuclear facilities in order to evaluate this new tool for the verification of the performance of the operator's nuclear material accounting and control (NMAC) systems. This paper is a report on the initial planning, preparation, and organisation of the first audit trials to be carried out as part of the proposed new framework related to the nuclear safeguards approach of the Commission for nuclear installations in the European Union.

40|$|To {{enhance and}} modernise the Nuclear Material Accountancy and Control (NMAC) at Mayak RT- 1 {{reprocessing}} plant {{the concept of}} near real time accountancy (NRTA) is applied. A defence in depth concept is proposed with the superposition of the following barriers: (i) 	continuous survey of the functional status, (ii) 	the follow-up of the nuclear material (NM) flow and inventory, (iii) 	Near real time control of declared NM in processed solutions, (iv) 	Periodical <b>Physical</b> <b>Inventory</b> <b>Takings</b> and Verifications. The combination of an operational network architecture, allowing automatic data acquisition and an efficient plant-specific data analysis and interpretation software enables to follow in near real-time the NM flow and inventory through the plant. The JRC data analysis and interpretation kernel DAI integrated with the commercial data historian Wizcon is proposed to establish the RT- 1 specific NM monitoring software tool. The data analysis focuses firstly {{on a combination of}} the pressure signals (for level and density) and the temperature signal, determining the total volume. This is then combined with the volume concentration measurement performed by the hybrid K-edge to derive the total mass of nuclear material.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. The telecommunication sector of Bangladesh has been booming with the current six compa-nies that are operating. The telecommunication sector of Bangladesh commenced with small steps in 1989 when the license to a private operator was issued {{for the provision of}} inter alia cellular mobile services to strive with the previous monopoly provider of telecommunications services, the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB). In the late 1990 s, remark-able number of fixed and mobile services made their mark in Bangladesh. Thus, the number of services in operation has increased in the past fifteen years. Undoubtedly, the measures taken by the government and public sector have facilitated to grow this sector. Bangladesh, a highly populated market has attracted many foreign investors to invest in this sector. Fixed assets are very important for the business. Well we can say that without a fixed asset a company cannot physically exist. Fixed assets help a businessman to perform his activities and duties in the best way. Varieties of fixed asset make a businessman versatile in every ac-tivity of business. In 2015, Banglalink undertook a project on the fixed assets verification, which was mainly comprised of the physical assets verification of the company. Banglalink being a telecommu-nication company, its main fixed assets are the BTS (Base Transceiver Station) equipment that is situated on different regions across the country. This verification or auditing of fixed assets was previously done by a third party auditor. PITS (<b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>taking</b> sheets) consists the numbers of the physical assets that were visually seen on the sites. The PITS was a hardcopy done by the auditors manually by visiting every single site. This had to be com-pared with the softcopy document FAR (fixed asset registrar) which was a spreadsheet doc-ument containing all the lists of the physical assets along with the numbers of the assets that should have been on the sites as those were purchased.

40|$|Traditional {{materials}} accounting is focused {{exclusively on the}} material balance area (MBA), and involves periodically closing a material balance based on accountability measurements conducted during a <b>physical</b> <b>inventory.</b> In contrast, the <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> for Los Alamos National Laboratory's near-real-time accounting system is established around processes and looks more like an item inventory. That is, the intent is not to measure material for accounting purposes, since materials have already been measured in {{the normal course of}} daily operations. A given unit process operates many times {{over the course of a}} material balance period. The product of a given unit process may move for processing within another unit process in the same MBA or may be transferred out of the MBA. Since few materials are unmeasured the <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> for a near-real-time process area looks more like an item inventory. Thus, the intent of the <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> is to locate the materials on the books and verify information about the materials contained in the books. Closing a materials balance for such an area is a matter of summing all the individual mass balances for the batches processed by all unit processes in the MBA. Additionally, performance parameters are established to measure the program's effectiveness. Program effectiveness for verifying the presence of nuclear material is required to be equal to or greater than a prescribed performance level, process measurements must be within established precision and accuracy values, <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> results meet or exceed performance requirements, and inventory differences are less than a target/goal quantity. This approach exceeds DOE established accounting and <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> program requirements.

Our replenishment policies avoid the problem of "freezing," in which a <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> position persists at zero while the corresponding record is positive. In addition, simulation studies show that our replenishment policies recoup much of the cost of inventory record inaccuracy, and that our audit policy significantly outperforms the popular "zero balance walk" audit policy. retail execution, inventory control, record inaccuracy, inventory shrinkage, Bayes rule...|$|R
