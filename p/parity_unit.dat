Due to its supplementary nature, SPP provides a more efficient and flexible redundancy protection mechanism than the conventional full parity approach. SPP offers multiple optional levels depending on partial parity coverage and performance/cost targets. According to the actual workload and the available re-source, the SPP approach can be adaptively and dynamically activated, deactivated and adjusted while the original RAID system continues to serve user requests on-line. We conduct extensive trace-driven experiments to evaluate the performance of the SPP approach.

Data consist of real exchange rate series for 20 countries including developed and developing economies. Structural breaks are detected in 18 countries and real exchange rates are found to be stationary in all countries except Japan. Estimated linear trends are the result of cross-country total factor productivity differentials between tradable and nontradable sectors. Estimated breaks correspond to large and permanent total factor productivity shocks associated with historical events like wars, structural reforms or deep economic recessions. An exercise with total factor productivity data shows that the Balassa-Samuelson effect explains the estimated long run trends in most countries.

We study the case of Portugal vis-à-vis Germany and Spain, and the case of Spain vis-à-vis Germany, in the period 1960 - 1990. The empirical analysis was based on unit-root testing (using ADF tests) and Johansen’s methodology for the study of co-integration. We worked with linear long-run relationships based exclusively on PPP, as well as with long-run relations that also allowed for the effect of interest rates. In a situation in which PPP does not hold, one could think that on account of some “natural reason” agents believe that, as time goes by, the dominant currency, which is also the reference currency of the EMS (the German Mark), will appreciate. We concluded, on the contrary, that the weaker currencies were the ones that with the passing of time appreciated in real terms.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a simple but}} {{powerful}} on-line availability upgrade mechanism, Supplementary Parity Augmentations (SPA), to address the availability issue for parity-based RAID systems.

By applying the exclusive OR operations appropriately among supplementary parity, full <b>parity</b> and data <b>units,</b> SPA can reconstruct the data on the failed disks with a fraction of the original overhead that is proportional to the supplementary parity coverage, thus significantly reducing the overhead of data regeneration and decreasing recovery time in parity-based RAID systems. In particular, SPA has two supplementary-parity coverage orientations, SPA Vertical and SPA Diagonal, which cater to user’s different availability needs. The former, which calculates the supplementary parity of a fixed subset of the disks, can tolerate more disk failures and sector errors; whereas, the latter shifts the coverage of supplementary parity by one disk for each stripe to balance the workload and thus maximize the performance of reconstruction during recovery. The SPA with a single supplementary-parity disk {{can be viewed as a}} variant of but significantly different from the RAID 5 + 0 architecture in that the former can easily and dynamically upgrade a RAID 5 system to a RAID 5 + 0 -like system without any change to the data layout of the RAID 5 system.

Moreover, our reliability analytical modeling and Sequential Monte-Carlo simulation demonstrate that both SPA orientations consistently more than double the MTTDL of the RAID 5 system and improve the reliability of the RAID 5 + 0 system noticeably...|$|R

Panel cointegration tests support evidence of cointegration between the nominal exchange rate and relative prices. These results contrast with those obtained from unit root tests.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the design of}} low complexity capacity approaching codes suitable for data transmission. The research documented in this thesis describes new and novel design methods for three well-known error control coding techniques, Turbo codes, LDPC block codes and LDPC convolutional codes, which are suitable for implementation {{in a number of}} modem digital communication systems. Firstly, we present Partial Unit Memory (PUM) based Turbo codes. A variant of Turbo codes which encompasses the advantages of both block and convolutional codes. The design methods of PUM Turbo codes are presented and Bit Error Rate (BER) simulations and Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis illustrates their performance. Partial Unit Memory codes are a class of low complexity, non-binary convolutional codes and have been shown to outperform equivalent convolutional codes. We present the EXIT charts of parallel concatenated PUM codes and PUM Woven Turbo Codes and analyse them to assess their performance compared with standard Turbo code designs. Resulting Extrinsic Information Transfer charts indicate that the proposed PUM-based codes have higher mutual information during iterative decoding than the equivalent Recursive, Systematic, Convolutional Turbo codes (RSC- TC) for the same Eb/No, i. e. the output of the decoders provides a better approximation of the decoded bits. The EXIT chart analysis is supported by BER plots, which confirms the behaviour predicted by the EXIT charts. We show that the concatenated PUM codes outperform the well-known turbo codes in the waterfall region, with comparable performance in the error floor region. In the second section we present Low Density Generator Matrix codes; a variant of LDPC codes that have low complexity encoding and decoding techniques. We present results of three construction methods and describe how LDGM codes can be modified to improve the error-floor region. We describe the design of random, structured and semi-random, semi- structured codes and how, by replacing the identity matrix with a staircase matrix, LDGM codes can show significant improvements in the error-floor region. Furthermore, we analyse the performance of serially concatenated LDGM codes and how they can benefit when we use the modified LDGM codes in either the outer code or the inner code. The results indicate that concatenated LDGM codes that incorporate LDGM staircase codes in the inner code will show improvements in error-floor performance while maintaining near capacity limit performances. While in the case of LDGM staircase codes being used as the outer codes no significant improvements in waterfall or error-floor regions are observed compared to a concatenated scheme that employs an LDGM identity outer code. Finally, we propose a new design of LDPC convolutional code, which we term as time invariant Low Density <b>Parity</b> Check <b>Unit</b> Memory (LDPC-UM) codes. The performance of LDPC block and Low Density <b>Parity</b> Check <b>Unit</b> Memory codes are compared, in each case, the Low Density <b>Parity</b> Check <b>Unit</b> Memory codes performance is at least as good as that of the LDPC block codes from which they are derived. LDPC-UM codes are the convolutional counterparts of LDPC block codes. Here, we describe techniques for the design of low complexity time invariant LDPC-UM codes by unwrapping the Tanner graph of algebraically constructed quasi-cyclic LDPC codes. The Tanner graph is then used to describe a pipelined message passing based iterative decoder for LDPC-UM codes and standard LDPC convolutional codes that outputs decoding results continuously.

These findings imply that Southeast Asian currencies may not form a yen-dominated Asian exchange rate system. Second, when the dollar-based real exchange rates of Southeast Asian countries are nonlinear mean reverting, we find that the mean-reverting process could be well described by the Exponential Smooth Transition Autoregressive (ESTAR) model, rather than the Double Threshold Autoregressive (DTAR) or Double Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive (DLSTAR) model.

The estimated PPP for total manufacturing suggests that the relative level of the producer price in China, Japan and Korea was about half to two thirds of the prevailing market exchange rates, respectively. The estimated PPPs are used to calculate comparative output and labor productivity for individual industries of these countries for ca. 1935. It shows that the size of factory manufacturing in Japan was 12 percent of the US level and in China only about one percent of the US level.
