40|$|The {{problem with}} which this {{investigation}} was concerned is that of treating agoraphobia with cognitive-behavioral group therapy and cognitive-behavioral group therapy combined with the drug alprazolam (Xanax). The purpose of the research was twofold. The first goal {{was to determine the}} relative effectiveness of the two treatment conditions on <b>phobic</b> behavior, <b>anxiety,</b> and depression. A second goal was to analyze the results and make recommendations concerning each of these modalities available to agoraphobics, their families, and to treatment specialists. The research design of this study was a randomized, pretest-posttest, experimental group design. The sample (N = 15) consisted of Group I (N = 7), who received behavioral-cognitive group therapy combined with the medication alprazolam, and Group II (N = 8), who received behavioral-cognitive group therapy only. The treatment included 15, 2 -hour weekly group sessions, {{with the addition of a}} brief medication evaluation prior to each group meeting for Group I. During these sessions, the subjects received information about agoraphobia in the form of brief didactic segments, treatment materials, homework assignments, group interaction, and various forms of desensitization. Based on the findings of this study, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Multidimensional behavioral-cognitive group therapy can significantly reduce <b>phobic</b> avoidance, <b>anxiety,</b> and depression associated with agoraphobia; and 2.

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the long-term stability of anxiety diagnoses starting with pre-school age children through adolescence evaluated at multiple time points. Prospective cohort study was conducted of all children and adolescents receiving psychiatric care at all pediatric psychiatric clinics belonging to two catchment areas in Madrid, Spain, between 1 January, 1992 and 30 April, 2006. Patients were selected from among 24, 163 children and adolescents who received psychiatric care. Patients had to have a diagnosis of an ICD- 10 anxiety disorder during at least one of the consultations and had to have received psychiatric care for the anxiety disorder. We grouped anxiety disorder diagnoses according to the following categories: <b>phobic</b> disorders, social <b>anxiety</b> disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), stress-related disorders, and “other” anxiety disorders which, among others, included generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Complementary indices of diagnostic stability were calculated. As much as 1, 869 subjects were included and had 27, 945 psychiatric/psychological consultations. The stability of all ICD- 10 anxiety disorder categories studied was high regardless of the measure of diagnostic stability used. <b>Phobic</b> and social <b>anxiety</b> disorders showed the highest diagnostic stability, whereas OCD and “other” anxiety disorders showed the lowest diagnostic stability. No significant sex differences were observed on the diagnostic stability of the anxiety disorder categories studied. Diagnostic stability measures for <b>phobic,</b> social <b>anxiety,</b> and “other” anxiety disorder diagnoses varied depending on the age at first evaluation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors' {{goal was}} to {{identify}} predictors of 1 -year outcomes for consecutive patients in a hospital emergency department following motor vehicle accidents and to describe the prevalence and course of four types of psychiatric outcomes after such accidents. METHOD: Consecutive patients aged 17 - 69 years who attended a general hospital emergency department following a motor vehicle accident were identified. Medical information for these patients was extracted from case notes, and the patients completed self-report questionnaires at baseline (soon after the accident), 3 months after the accident, and 1 year after the accident. Measures included a self-report scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and questions about <b>phobic</b> travel <b>anxiety.</b> Logistic regression {{was used to examine}} predictors of outcome. RESULTS: Different frequencies and courses of PTSD, <b>phobic</b> travel <b>anxiety,</b> general anxiety, and depression were reported by a third of the subjects at both 3 -month and 1 -year follow-up. Many of the subjects reported improvements between 3 and 12 months, but others described late onset of psychiatric outcomes after the accident. There were differences in baseline and 3 -month predictors of each type of 1 -year outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The four types of psychiatric outcomes after a motor vehicle accident that were noted overlap, are persistent, and have different early predictors.

In addition, the treatments evaluated {{in each of the}} 32 studies are classified according to Chambless et al. ’s (1996) and Chambless and Hollon’s (1998) criteria. Findings from a series of meta-analyses of the studies that used waitlists also are reported. In accordance with Nathan and Gorman, the majority of the studies were either methodologically robust or fairly rigorous. In accordance with Chambless and colleagues, although no treatment was well-established, Individual Cog-nitive Behavior Therapy, Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy (GCBT), GCBT with Par-ents, GCBT for social phobia (SOP), and Social Effectiveness Training for children with SOP each met criteria for probably efficacious. The other treatments were either possibly efficacious or experimental. Meta-analytic results revealed no significant differences between individual and group treatments on diagnostic recovery rates and anxiety symp-tom reductions, as well as other youth symptoms (i. e., fear, depression, internalizing and externalizing problems).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} whether <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{is associated with}} increased risk of cardiac mortality in individuals with established coronary heart disease (CHD) and to examine the role of reduced heart rate variability (HRV) in mediating this risk. Previous findings suggest that <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> may pose increased risk of cardiac mortality in medically healthy cohorts. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study in 947 CHD patients recruited during hospitalization for coronary angiography. At baseline, supine recordings of heart rate for HRV were collected, and participants completed the Crown-Crisp <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale. Fatal cardiac events were identified over an average period of 3 years. RESULTS: Female CHD patients reported significantly elevated levels of <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> when compared with male patients (p <. 001), and survival analysis showed an interaction between gender and <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> in the prediction of cardiac mortality (p =. 058) and sudden cardiac death (p =. 03).

Long-term efficacy was examined {{in terms of}} diagnostic recovery, symptom reductions, and clinically significant change. This dissertation also examined predictors of long-term efficacy (e. g., age, gender, and other clinical characteristics) {{as well as the}} relative long-term efficacy of CBT for Hispanic/Latino and European American youth. ^ Participants consisted of 67 youth (age range 15 – 26 years; M = 19. 43, SD = 3. 02 years at time of follow-up assessment), (47. 8 % females, 37. 3 % Hispanic/Latino) who had participated in one of two clinical trials (Silverman et al., 1999 a, b). After providing informed consent to participate in the long term follow-up, youths completed a diagnostic interview and a battery of questionnaires. Results indicated that treatment gains were maintained about 9. 5 years after treatment was completed. Maintenance of treatment gains was evident in terms of diagnostic recovery, symptom reductions, and clinically significant change. Long-term treatment gains extended to both ethnic groups and the two ethnic groups were functionally equivalent along most indices examined. Analyses of predictors of long-term outcome showed that parent self-reported pre-treatment depression, youth-reported pre-treatment depression, and youths retrospective reports of negative life events were significantly associated with less favorable long-term gains in terms of total symptoms of anxiety at long-term follow-up. In terms of long-term sequelae, youths with less successful post-treatment outcomes reported seeking-out additional treatment as well as using/abused substances and substance dependence significantly more than youths with successful post-treatment outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of the contribution of the present study to knowledge base about the long-term efficacy of exposure-based CBT procedures for <b>phobic</b> and <b>anxiety</b> disorders in youth. Findings also are discussed in terms of the need to modify CBT procedures to target youths with less successful post-treatment outcomes. Limitations and future directions are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Anxiety {{disorders}} are common, with a lifetime prevalence of 20 % in the U. S., and {{are responsible for}} substantial burdens of disability, missed work days and health care utilization. To date, no causal genetic variants have been identified for anxiety, anxiety disorders, or related traits. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> symptom score was associated with 3 alternative polygenic risk scores, derived from external genome-wide association studies of anxiety, an internally estimated agnostic polygenic score, or previously identified candidate genes. DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up study. Using linear and logistic regression we investigated whether <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was associated with polygenic risk scores derived from internal, leave-one out genome-wide association studies, from 31 candidate genes, and from out-of-sample genome-wide association weights previously shown to predict depression and anxiety in another cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Study participants (n =  11, 127) were individuals from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Anxiety symptoms were assessed via the 8 -item <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale of the Crown Crisp Index at two time points, from which a continuous phenotype score was derived. RESULTS: We found no genome-wide significant associations with <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety.</b> <b>Phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was also not associated with a polygenic risk score derived from the genome-wide association study beta weights using liberal p-value thresholds; with a previously published genome-wide polygenic score; or with a candidate gene risk score based on 31 genes previously hypothesized to predict anxiety. CONCLUSION: There is a substantial gap between twin-study heritability estimates of anxiety disorders ranging between 20 - 40 % and heritability explained by genome-wide association results. New approaches such as improved genome imputations, application of gene expression and biological pathways information, and incorporating social or environmental modifiers of genetic risks {{may be necessary to}} identify significant genetic predictors of anxiety...|$|E

Yet, little is known about associations between a common form of distress -phobic anxiety- and global oxidative stress. Thus, we related <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> to plasma fluorescent oxidation products (FlOPs), a global oxidative stress marker. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among 1, 325 women (aged 43 - 70 years) from the Nurses' Health Study. <b>Phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was measured using the Crown-Crisp Index (CCI). Adjusted least-squares mean log-transformed FlOPs were calculated across phobic categories.

Results: No association was found between <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> categories and mean FlOP levels in multivariable adjusted linear models. Similarly, in multivariable logistic regression models there were no associations between FlOPs quartiles and likelihood of being in the highest phobic category.

Setting and Participants: Study participants (n = 11, 127) were individuals from the Nurses ’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Main Outcome Measure: Anxiety symptoms were assessed via the 8 -item <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale of the Crown Crisp Index at two time points, from which a continuous phenotype score was derived...|$|E
50|$|The terms {{distress}} and impairment {{as defined by}} the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR) should also take into account the context of the person's environment if attempting a diagnosis. The DSM-IV-TR states that if a phobic stimulus, whether it be an object or a social situation, is absent entirely in an environment — a diagnosis cannot be made. An example of this situation would be an individual who has a fear of mice but lives in an area devoid of mice. Even though the concept of mice causes marked {{distress and}} impairment within the individual, because the individual does not encounter mice in the environment no actual distress or impairment is ever experienced. Proximity {{and the degree to which}} escape from the phobic stimulus is impossible should also be considered. As the person approaches a <b>phobic</b> stimulus, <b>anxiety</b> levels increase (e.g. as one gets closer to a snake, fear increases in ophidiophobia), and the degree to which escape of the phobic stimulus is limited has the effect of varying the intensity of fear in instances such as riding an elevator (e.g. anxiety increases at the midway point between floors and decreases when the floor is reached and the doors open).|$|R
40|$|The N-methyl-D-aspartate {{receptor}} (NMDAR) {{is critical}} for learning-related synaptic plasticity in amygdala and hippocampus. As a consequence, there is considerable interest in drugs targeting this receptor to help enhance amygdala- and hippocampus-dependent learning. A promising candidate in this respect is the NMDAR glycine-binding site partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS). Accumulating clinical evidence indicates the efficacy of DCS in the facilitation of amygdala-dependent fear extinction learning in patients with <b>phobic,</b> social <b>anxiety,</b> panic, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. An important unresolved question though is whether the use of DCS can also facilitate hippocampus-dependent declarative learning in healthy people {{as opposed to being}} restricted to the fear memory domain. In the present study, we investigated whether or not DCS can facilitate hippocampus-dependent declarative learning. We have therefore combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with two different declarative learning tasks and cytoarchitectonic probabilistic mapping of the hippocampus and its major subdivisions in 40 healthy volunteers administered either a 250 mg single oral dose of DCS or a placebo. We found that DCS facilitates declarative learning as well as blood-oxygen level dependent activity levels in the probabilistically defined cornu ammonis region of the hippocampus. The absence of activity changes in visual control areas underscores the specific action of DCS in the hippocampal cornu ammonis region. Our findings highlight NMDAR glycine-binding site partial agonism as a promising pharmacological mechanism for facilitating declarative learning in healthy people...|$|R
30|$|Functional {{impairment}} {{was assessed}} using the Sheehan disability scale (SDS) (Sheehan et al. 1996; Sheehan and Sheehan 2008), a measure validated for use in patients with bipolar disorder (Arbuckle et al. 2009). The SDS is a composite of three self-rated items designed to measure {{the extent to which}} three major sectors in the subject’s life are impaired by panic, <b>anxiety,</b> <b>phobic,</b> or depressive symptoms: work/school, social life, and family life. The three items are rated using an 11 -point visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10. In addition, two questions are used to assess the number of days lost due to symptoms and the number of days unproductive due to symptoms over the last week. The SDS total score is the sum of the three items and ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired).|$|R
