40|$|Objective: Nicotinamide {{nucleotide}} transhydrogenase (NNT), one of {{the several}} genes recently discovered in familial glucocorticoid deficiencies (FGD), is involved in reactive oxygen species detoxification, suggesting that extra-adrenal manifestations may occur, due to the sensitivity to oxidative stress of other organs rich in mitochondria. Here, we sought to identify NNT mutations in a large cohort of patients with <b>primary</b> congenital <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> without molecular etiology and evaluate the degree of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and onset of extra-adrenal damages. Methods: Sanger or massive parallel sequencing of NNT and patient monitoring. Results: Homozygous or compound heterozygous NNT mutations occurred frequently (26 %, 13 unrelated families, 18 patients) in our cohort. Seven new mutations were identified: p. Met 337 Val, p. Ala 863 Glu, c. 3 G>A (p. Met 1 ?), p. Arg 129 ∗, p. Arg 379 ∗, p. Val 665 Profs∗ 29 and p. Ala 704 Serfs∗ 19. The most frequent mutation, p. Arg 129 ∗, was found recurrently in patients from Algeria. Most patients were diagnosed belatedly (8 - 18 months) after presenting severe hypoglycemia; others experiencing stress conditions were diagnosed earlier. Five patients also had mineralocorticoid deficiency at onset. One patient had congenital hypothyroidism and two cryptorchidism. In follow-up, we noticed gonadotropic and genitalia impairments (precocious puberty, testicular inclusions, interstitial Leydig cell adenoma, azoospermia), hypothyroidism and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Intrafamilial phenotype heterogeneity was also observed. Conclusions: NNT should be sequenced, not only in FGD, but also in all <b>primary</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiencies</b> for which the most frequent etiologies have been ruled out. As NNT is involved in oxidative stress, careful follow-up is needed to evaluate mineralocorticoid biosynthesis extent, and gonadal, heart and thyroid function.

40|$|Background. Shock {{syndrome}} is an acute tissue hypoperfusion. Early diagnosis and adequate symptomatic and causal treatment are mandatory. In spite of different etiologies (dehidration, bleeding, heart failure, sepsis), clinical signs and symptomes are similar (hypotension, tachicardia, tachipnoe, pallor, {{cold and wet}} skin, oliguria and metabolic acidosis). Rarely, the shock {{syndrome is}} the consequence of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> due to hypopituitarism caused by brain tumor where early treatment with hydrocortisone is urgent. Methods. This article presents a patient with a shock syndrome and multiorgan failure. Endocrinological testing and brain CT demonstrated an endocrinologically inactive tumor of hypophysis. The tumor was growing into adjacent hypophyseal tissue and causing hypopituitarism with secondary hypothyroidism and <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and deficit of both gonadotropins and growth hormone. Conclusions. <b>Primary</b> or secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> are among rare causes of shock syndrome.

40|$|Short Synacthen {{tests are}} used to {{diagnose}} <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> The standard test uses supraphysiological adrenocorticotropic hormone (250 μg). The low-dose test (1 μg) was proposed to be more sensitive. In outpatients with nonspecific symptoms referred for exclusion of <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> we assessed whether the low-dose test was an appropriate initial investigation. Results of 233 low-dose tests were obtained from pathology database 2007 - 2009. Clinical data were available for 169 patients: 37 taking glucocorticoids or with known pituitary/adrenal disease were excluded.

Recently, testicular dysfunction was described in ALD/AMN patients but no information on sperm characteristics was provided. In this paper we studied the reproductive function of a patient with adult cerebral ALD, focusing our attention on sperm characteristics. At the time of diagnosis the patient was 22 years old, had high plasma C 26 and C 24 very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) concentrations and <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Plasma testosterone concentration was in the normal range. The patient was prescribed a low-fat diet and 'Lorenzo's oil', which led to normalization of plasma VLCFA concentrations within 3 months of therapy. Semen analysis showed normal sperm count, gross morphological alterations and reduced motility. Electron microscopy analysis of sperm cells showed pathological changes in the head, the plasma membrane and the nucleus in 60 % of the spermatozoa examined. However, isolated motile spermatozoa showed normal molecular dynamics of phospholipid bilayer surface and physiological responsiveness to progesterone. At the 12 months follow-up, the patient became azoospermic and testicular histology showed arrested maturation. To our knowledge, this is the first description of sperm alterations in a post-pubertal ALD patient, in which severe impairment of spermatogenesis and rapid progression to azoospermia occurred despite normalization of plasma VLCFA concentrations...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patients {{who need}} {{glucocorticoid}} replacement in both <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{have the choice}} of either once daily prednisolone or thrice daily hydrocortisone. A recent European study found no difference between prednisolone and hydrocortisone users in several markers including glucose, weight, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure and waist circumference, although an increase in cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) was suggested in a subgroup of these patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to expand the evidence base for the use of these agents as replacement therapy. METHOD: Data from 82 patients on hydrocortisone and 64 patients on prednisolone for <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> at Imperial College Healthcare Trust were analysed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in total cholesterol, LDL levels or any other risk factors between hydrocortisone and prednisolone patients. Prednisolone was subjectively significantly more convenient than hydrocortisone (p= 0. 048). CONCLUSIONS: Prednisolone once daily is more convenient than hydrocortisone thrice daily, and there is no difference in the markers of cardiovascular risk measured. Because prednisolone mimics the circadian rhythm better than other glucocorticoids, it should be considered as an alternative to hydrocortisone for <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: <b>Primary</b> <b>adrenal</b> {{lymphoma}} {{is extremely}} rare. We analyzed our cases to further illustrate the clinical charac-teristics of this rare disease. Methods: In the past 10 years, {{there have been}} three patients diagnosed as <b>primary</b> <b>adrenal</b> lymphoma in our institution. There have been another three patients with secondary adrenal lymphoma, involving not only the adrenal glands but also other organs or lymph nodes. The clinical and pathological characteristics of the six cases were compared and analyzed. Results: The three cases of <b>primary</b> <b>adrenal</b> lymphoma were characterized with old age, male-predominance, bilateral <b>adrenal</b> involvement, <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> and histological type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. All of them received chemotherapy but died within half year of diagnosis: one died of disease progression; the other two died of complications. The three cases of secondary adrenal lymphoma were relatively young. All had unilateral adrenal involvement and no <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> The pathological examinations revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The prognosis was better: two of them have been disease-free after treatment; the other died of disease progression. Conclusions: <b>Primary</b> <b>adrenal</b> lymphoma is extremely rare. It predominantly affects the elderly and men, mostly in-volves the bilateral adrenal glands, and usually causes <b>adrenal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> The majority of the cases are of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Test results were compared with a Bland-Altman plot and McNemar's test. The mean difference between the cortisol responses in the two ACTH tests was 26  nmol/l (95 % confidence interval (CI) 13, 40), showing a marginally higher response for the 250  μg test. The diagnostic performances of the two tests were similar (P= 0. 49) using a cut-off value for cortisol of 550  nmol/l. A normal cortisol response to the 1  μg ACTH test could be accompanied by an abnormal response to the 250  μg ACTH test, and vice versa.
