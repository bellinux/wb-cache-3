5|$|Through 1935, as {{the breakup}} {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly {{passed a bill}} for the breakup, Willkie {{made a series of}} speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> requiring the breakup to take place within three years.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passage}} of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was {{required}} to strike millions of silver dollars, and began to do so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get Congress to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> requiring the redesign, they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing the redesign of United States coinage that had begun in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Aubame {{served as}} foreign {{minister}} under the coalition government, though in early 1963 he was {{dropped from the}} Cabinet for refusing to create a single-party Gabon. To oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February, practically a powerless post. M'ba supporters tried to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that declared that a member of parliament could only hold a single role in government. The president claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with {{the functions of the}} assembly. Aubame, however, unexpectedly resigned from the Supreme Court on 10 January 1964, complicating matters for M'ba. In a fit of rage, M'ba dissolved the National Assembly on 21 January 1964. The New York Times speculates that this was due to it not supporting M'ba in Aubame's removal.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Burnham {{was living}} in California and was active in counterespionage for Britain. Much of it {{involved}} a famous Boer spy, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed Field Marshal Kitchener while en route {{to meet with the}} Russians. During the Second Boer War, Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other, {{but it was not until}} 1910 that the two men first met while both were in Washington, D.C., separately lobbying Congress to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> in favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States (H.R. 23621). Duquesne was twice arrested by the FBI and in 1942 he and 32 other Nazi agents (the Duquesne Spy Ring) were jailed for espionage in the largest spy ring conviction in U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} {{the apex}} of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state antitrust law and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not <b>pass,</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> granting women's suffrage, failed in the House by a single vote.|$|E

25|$|In November 1779 The Maryland House of Delegates {{moved to}} <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> confiscating the {{property}} {{of those who had}} sided with the Crown during the Revolution. Carroll opposed this measure, questioning the motives of those who pressed for confiscation and arguing that the measure was unjust. However, such moves to confiscate Tory property had much popular support and eventually, in 1780, the measure passed.|$|E

25|$|In 1874, Piper {{represented}} Storey County in the Nevada Senate. In {{an effort}} {{to raise money for}} Storey County to pay for railroad bonds, Piper managed to get the state senate to unanimously <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that became law, removing the taxation limits on bullion in the county. Piper ran a chain of venues to accommodate touring companies. Among these were McKissick's Opera House in Reno and the Carson Opera House in Carson City.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, Ogletree {{appealed to}} the U.S. Congress to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> {{extending}} {{the statute of limitations}} for the case, given the state and city's accountability for the destruction and the long suppression of material about it. The bill was introduced by John Conyers, Jr. of Michigan and heard by the Judiciary Committee of the House but not passed. Conyers re-introduced the bill in 2009 as the John Hope Franklin Tulsa-Greenwood Race Riot Claims Accountability Act of 2009 (H.R. 1843), and in 2012. It has not gotten out of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Rauschenberg unsuccessfully lobbied U.S. Congress to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that would {{compensate}} artists when {{their work is}} resold. The artist later supported a state bill in California that did become law, the California Resale Royalty Act of 1976. Rauschenberg took up his fight for artist resale royalties after the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his art collection in a 1973 auction, including Rauschenberg's 1958 painting Thaw that he had originally sold to Scull for $900 but brought $85,000 at an auction at Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, Daley {{succeeded in}} getting the state senate to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> calling for a Chicago campus. Daley became mayor of Chicago in 1955 and pressed the University of Illinois to upgrade the Chicago Undergraduate Center to a {{full-fledged}} four-year institution. After a long and controversial site decision process, in 1961, Mayor Daley offered the Harrison and Halsted Streets site for the new campus. In December 1961, the final decision to establish a four-year university in Chicago was made. In that same year, the Chicago Professional Colleges became the University of Illinois at the Medical Center (UIMC). In 1963, construction began on the University's new Chicago campus at Harrison and Halsted Streets.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} two years Berry clung to office while the colony was gripped with class conflict, {{including}} huge torchlit processions through Melbourne sponsored by The Age (pro-Berry) and The Argus (anti-Berry) - although, remarkably, there was almost no violence. Almost no legislation was passed and the administration ground to a halt as funds ran out. Berry's next tactic was to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> through the Assembly stating that finance bills {{did not need to be}} passed by the Council, but would become law when passed by the Assembly. Bowen thought this bill unconstitutional, but signed it on Berry's advice. When the Colonial Office learned of this, Bowen was recalled and the bill overturned.|$|E
25|$|In early April 2009, the Georgia General Assembly {{created a}} budget crisis for MARTA {{by failing to}} <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that would allow it to access its own capital reserve account, in order to {{compensate}} for a severe drop in sales-tax revenue during the late-2000s recession. MARTA stated that this could force the agency to discontinue operations one day out of the week, possibly a weekday. The agency's budget crisis forced MARTA to lay off 700 employees. Service cuts and other budget-stabilizing measures began in fiscal year 2011, with the first affected service mark-up in September 2010. Governor Sonny Perdue refused to call a special session as requested, and did not issue an executive order as he stated {{it would not be}} legal to do so.|$|E

50|$|A bureaucratic {{oversight}} {{meant that}} the borough council <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> to allow {{the development of a}} tramway network in Worthing. Between 1901 and 1903, The British Electric Traction Company sought permission to open tram routes between Hove, Worthing and Littlehampton.

25|$|Oberstar {{was given}} a rating of 100 by the Environment America and the League of Conservation Voters in 2009. The American Wind Energy Association also gave him a rating of 100 in 2006. He voted to pass the Energy and Environmental Law Amendments which had the goal of {{establishing}} a program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in 2009. He also voted to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill,</b> Trade-in Vouchers for Fuel-Efficient Cars, in 2009 which granted a $3,500 voucher, or document that could be exchanged for services {{in the place of}} money, for trading in an old vehicle with at least 4 miles per gallon more, the purpose of which was to increase the purchasing of fuel efficient cars. However, Oberstar went against most Democrats and voted in favor of allowing drilling in ANWR.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} attracted little notice at the time. Two years later, {{the possibilities}} it opened up became clearer when Citibank, squeezed by interest rate caps, {{decided to move}} its credit-card operations out of New York City. The company persuaded Bill Janklow, then governor of South Dakota, whose agricultural economy was struggling at the time due to high fuel prices, to persuade that state's legislature to formally invite the bank there, as required by federal law before a national bank can do business from a state. He then successfully lobbied the legislators to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> drafted by the bank that repealed the state's cap on interest rates, something {{a small group of}} legislators were already trying to do. Citibank quickly moved the 300 white-collar jobs in its credit-card division to Sioux Falls, where it has been ever since.|$|E
25|$|Sewall became {{involved}} in the state fight for women's right to vote in 1880, when the Indianapolis suffragists lobbied the Indiana General Assembly to <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that would give Indiana women the right to vote on an equal basis with men. The suffrage supporters, including Sewall, were successful in getting the Indiana Senate and the Indiana House of Representatives to adopt a suffrage amendment to the state constitution in 1881, but state law required amendments to the state constitution to be passage at two consecutive legislative sessions. Indiana's suffrage groups worked statewide to secure passage of the amendment in the 1883 legislative session. The House resolution passed on February 20, 1883, but the Senate refused to act on it. Frustrated with the Indiana legislature's failure to amend the state constitution, Sewall turned her efforts to securing voting rights for women at the national level.|$|E
