40|$|Abstract. Five/six {{nephrectomy}} induces systemic and glomerular hypertension, glomerulosclerosis, proteinuria, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. <b>Polysulfate</b> <b>pentosan</b> (PPS) decreases mesangial {{proliferation and}} extracellular matrix accumulation. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether PPS prevents glomerular hemodynamic changes and renal damage. Micropuncture studies were performed in three groups of eight male Wistar rats. Two groups included rats with 5 / 6 nephrectomy—one of which was treated with PPS in drinking water (100 mg/kg body wt) and the second of which received normal drinking water—and the third group consisted of normal rats that served as controls. Five/six nephrectomy produced systemic hypertension, a 50 % reduction in GFR, and a 67 % increase in single-nephron GFR due to elevated glomerular pressure and single-nephron plasma flow as well as proteinuria...|$|R

In one study, the antidepressant duloxetine was found to be ineffective as a treatment, although a patent exists for use of duloxetine in the context of IC, and is known to relieve neuropathic pain. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A has been studied as a treatment for interstitial cystitis due to its immunosuppressive properties.

5000|$|Regardless of the origin, {{most people}} with IC/BPS {{struggle}} with a damaged urothelium, or bladder lining. When the surface glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer is damaged (via a urinary tract infection (UTI), excessive consumption of coffee or sodas, traumatic injury, etc.), urinary chemicals can [...] "leak" [...] into surrounding tissues, causing pain, inflammation, and urinary symptoms. Oral medications like <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> and medications placed directly into the bladder via a catheter sometimes work to repair and rebuild this damaged/wounded lining, allowing for a reduction in symptoms. Most literature supports the belief that IC's symptoms {{are associated with a}} defect in the bladder epithelium lining, allowing irritating substances in the urine to penetrate into the bladder—essentially, a breakdown of the bladder lining (also known as the adherence theory).

40|$|A {{conformational}} {{conversion of}} the normal, protease- sensitive prion protein (PrP-sen or PrPC) to a protease-resistant form (PrP-res or PrPSc) is commonly thought to be required in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Endogenous sulfated glycosaminoglycans are associated with PrP-res deposits in vivo, suggesting that they may facilitate PrP-res formation. On the other hand, certain exogenous sulfated glycans can profoundly inhibit PrP-res accumulation and serve as prophylactic anti-TSE compounds in vivo. To investigate the seemingly paradoxical effects of sulfated glycans on PrP-res formation, we have assayed their direct effects on PrP conversion under physiologically compatible cell-free conditions. Heparan sulfate and <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> stimulated PrP-res formation. Conversion was stimulated further by increased temperature. Both elevated temperature and <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> promoted interspecies PrP conversion. Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry measurements showed that <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> induced a conformational change in PrP-sen that may potentiate its PrP-res-induced conversion.

However, because of a priori trial design features, important posthoc analyses were able to answer many of the important clinical issues on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of IC that to date had remained unanswered. Seven published follow-up reports based on data and outcomes from the original study evaluated the clinical significance of a positive Potassium Sensitivity Test, confirmed the O’Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index as a valid and sensitive outcome measure, and determined that doses of <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> higher than the standard US Food and Drug Administration—approved dose of 300 mg/d did not increase efficacy although increased duration of therapy increases the chance of symptom amelioration. Further analyses determined that sexual dysfunction is an important parameter to assess in IC and that successful therapy can improve sexual functioning. Finally, the data showed that symptom severity, quality of life (QoL), and sleep function are interrelated. Consequently, symptom improvement with therapy correlates with improvement in both sleep function and QoL.

40|$|Calcium oxalate {{monohydrate}} (COM) {{kidney stones}} {{are the most}} common type of renal calculi. COM kidney stones are shown using polarized optical microscopy (POM) to develop by following a combined mechanism of direct crystal growth from a nidus, and by adsorption of preformed crystals. POM, X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate that stones grow in layers consisting of COM crystals amalgamated with unidentified, optically inactive material. The stones have an intrinsic, non-water permeable core covered with a developing, crystalline COM, water permeable shell.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of an abnormal, protease-resistant {{form of the}} protein PrP (PrP-res) in hosts with scrapie and related transmissible spongiform encephalopathies appears {{to be important in}} disease pathogenesis. To gain insight into the mechanism of PrP-res accumulation and the in vivo antiscrapie activity of certain polyanions, we have studied effects of sulfated glycans on PrP metabolism in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells. <b>Pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate,</b> like the amyloid-binding dye Congo red, potently inhibited the {{accumulation of}} PrP-res in these cells without apparent effects on the metabolism of the normal isoform. The inhibition was due primarily to prevention of new PrP-res accumulation rather than destabilization of preexisting PrP-res. PrP-res accumulation remained depressed in the cultures after removal of the inhibitors. The activities of other sulfated glycans, nonsulfated polyanions, dextran, and DEAE-dextran were compared with those of <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> and Congo red. This comparison provided evidence that the density of sulfation and molecular size are factors influencing anti-PrP-res activity of sulfated glycans. The relative potencies of these compounds corresponded well with their previously determined antiscrapie activities in vivo, suggesting that the prophylactic effects of sulfated polyanions may be due to inhibition of PrP-res accumulation. Since PrP-res amyloid is known to contain sulfated glycosaminoglycans, we reason that these inhibitors may competitively block an interaction between PrP and endogenous glycosaminoglycans that is essential for its accumulation in a protease-resistant, potentially amyloidogenic state...|$|E

Methods: A study was performed of 111 patients with chronic pelvic pain whose pain persisted after hysterectomy. Patients were screened with the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency symptom scale, and underwent Potassium Sensitivity Testing. Patients were treated with dietary changes alone or in combination with cystoscopic hydrodistention or oral <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate,</b> or both of these, for 3 to 6 months. Results: Of the 111 patients enrolled, 79 % (n� 88) were diagnosed with bladder dysfunction consistent with interstitial cystitis. For patients treated with dietary modification alone (n� 33), the mean score on the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency questionnaire improved 15. 4 %, from 13. 18 at baseline to 11. 15 at follow-up.

40|$|Degradation of the {{cartilage}} proteoglycan aggrecan {{is a key}} early {{event in}} the development of osteoarthritis. Adamalysin with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) - 4 and ADAMTS- 5 are considered to be the main enzymes responsible for aggrecan breakdown, making them attractive drugs targets. Here we show that calcium <b>pentosan</b> <b>polysulfate</b> (CaPPS), a chemically sulfated xylanopyranose from beechwood, is a multifaceted exosite inhibitor of the aggrecanases and protects cartilage against aggrecan degradation. CaPPS interacts with the noncatalytic spacer domain of ADAMTS- 4 and the cysteine-rich domain of ADAMTS- 5, blocking activity against their natural substrate aggrecan with inhibitory concentration 50 values of 10 – 40 nM but only weakly inhibiting hydrolysis of a nonglycosylated recombinant protein substrate. In addition, CaPPS increased cartilage levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 3 (TIMP- 3), an endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS- 4 and - 5. This was due to the ability of CaPPS to block endocytosis of TIMP- 3 mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. CaPPS also increased the affinity of TIMP- 3 for ADAMTS- 4 and - 5 by more than 100 -fold, improving the efficacy of TIMP- 3 as an aggrecanase inhibitor. Studies with TIMP- 3 -null mouse cartilage indicated that CaPPS inhibition of aggrecan degradation is TIMP- 3 dependent.
