40|$|A {{stochastic}} game {{is played}} in a sequence of steps; at each step the play {{is said to be}} in some state i, chosen from a finite collection of states. If the play is in state i, the first player chooses move k and the second player chooses move l, then the first player receives a reward a kl i, and, with probability p kl ij, the next state is j. The concept of stochastic games was introduced by Shapley <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>proviso</b> <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> probability 1, play terminates. The authors consider the case when play never terminates, and show properties of such games and offer a convergent algorithm for their solution. In the special case when one of the players is a dummy, the nonterminating stochastic game reduces to a Markovian decision process, and the present work can be regarded as the extension to a game theoretic context of known results on Markovian decision processes. ...|$|R

However, their scope of applicability was limited to propositional-based logics. Herein, we extend these results to a broader class of logics, possibly including variables, terms and quantifiers. On the way, we need to consider an enriched notion of proof-calculus <b>that</b> deals explicitly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> substitution <b>provisos</b> <b>that</b> often appear in schematic inference rules. For illustration of the concepts, constructions and results, we shall adopt modal first-order logic as a working example. ...|$|R
