25|$|Silver nitrate is {{the least}} {{expensive}} salt of silver; it offers several other advantages as well. It is non-hygroscopic, in contrast to silver fluoroborate and silver perchlorate. It is relatively stable to light. Finally, it dissolves in numerous solvents, including water. The nitrate can be easily replaced by other ligands, rendering AgNO3 versatile. Treatment with solutions of halide ions gives a precipitate of AgX (X = Cl, Br, I). When making photographic film, silver nitrate is treated with halide salts of sodium or potassium to form insoluble silver halide in situ in photographic gelatin, which is then applied to strips of tri-acetate or polyester. Similarly, silver nitrate is used to prepare some silver-based explosives, such as the fulminate, azide, or acetylide, through a <b>precipitation</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Magnetite can be {{prepared}} in the laboratory as a ferrofluid in the Massart method by mixing iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride {{in the presence of}} sodium hydroxide. Magnetite can also {{be prepared}} by the chemical co-precipitation in presence of ammonia, which consist in a mixture of a solution 0.1 M of FeCl3·6H2O and FeCl2·4H2O with mechanic agitation of about 2000 rpm. The molar ratio of FeCl3:FeCl2 can be 2:1; heating this solution at 70°C, and immediately the speed is elevated to 7500 rpm and adding quickly a solution of NH4OH (10 volume %), immediately a dark precipitate will be formed, which consists of nanoparticles of magnetite.O4 Magnetic Nanoparticles in Aqueous Solution|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|date=2010|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1541–1543|doi=10.1109/TMAG.2010.2040588}} In both cases, the <b>precipitation</b> <b>reaction</b> rely on a quick transformation of acidic hydrolyzed iron ions into the spinel iron oxide structure, by hydrolysis at elevated pH values (above ca. 10).|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation can be used to describe the progress of a large number of nucleation and growth <b>reactions,</b> including diffusion-controlled <b>precipitation</b> <b>reactions,</b> provided that nucleation is random. However, its validity has only been proved for reactions with a linear growth and not for diffusion-controlled <b>precipitation</b> <b>reactions.</b> Here, the ability of the JMAK equation to fit the experimental data of diffusion-controlled <b>precipitation</b> <b>reactions</b> has been compared with the Austin-Rickett (AR) equation ?= 1 ?{[k(T) t]n+ 1 }- 1 In all cases studied the AR equation provides a better fit to the data and the obtained integer and half-integer values of n can be interpreted in terms of the physics of the transformation processes.

25|$|Before Jaffe, Neubauer {{described}} a similar <b>precipitation</b> <b>reaction</b> by mixing creatinine with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and performing a Weyl's test—the addition of SNP to NaOH and then incubating with acetic acid (CH3CO2H) {{to develop a}} color change. Until Folin developed Jaffe's reaction into a clinical procedure, Neubauer's method was how creatinine was measured. As Folin's method evolved, various techniques were implemented to remove Jaffe-reacting substances, mostly protein, from the sample and increase specificity. By the 1950s, precipitated aluminum silicate, called Lloyd's reagent, was being used to remove protein from serum, further improving accuracy. Fuller's earth was also used for protein-binding, but the reference method until the 1980s was adsorption with Lloyd's reagent. New concerns arose due to non-standardization of procedures; different labs were reading results at different endpoints. This problem was resolved {{with the advent of}} automated analyzers in the 1960s and 1970s, which introduced a kinetic reading of results rather than a specific endpoint. Kinetic Jaffe methods involve mixing serum with alkaline picrate and reading the rate of change in absorption spectrophotometrically at 520nm. This not only standardized the procedure, but also removed the need for sample deproteinization. It also introduced two new problems—analyzers used an algorithmic compensation to correct for pseudochromogens, and calibrations were not yet standardized between instruments.|$|E

40|$|In hydroponic plant {{nutritional}} research, nutrient solutions can {{be considered}} as aqueous solutions of inorganic ions. In this aqueous solution, the ions are submitted to the laws of aquatic inorganic chemistry.
