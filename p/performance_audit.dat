40|$|The New Public Management {{supplies}} {{a rationale}} for broadening the mandate of external audit institutions to encompass <b>performance</b> <b>auditing.</b> This article examines conceptual, empirical, and managerial issues raised by external <b>performance</b> <b>auditing.</b> Conceptually, <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> is a misnomer for a class of mainly evaluative review activities. Empirically, OECD countries vary {{in terms of the}} specific types of <b>performance</b> <b>audits</b> conducted by their principal external audit bodies. Explaining such variation offers some insight into the contemporary politics of public management policy. Managerially, audit bodies whose mandate includes <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> confront two major strategic issues: whether to conduct such evaluative reviews in an auditing style and whether to gear their work to achieving performance improvement in auditee organizations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>auditing</b> is {{an online}} {{optimization}} strategy that empirically measures {{the effectiveness of}} an optimization on a particular code region. It {{has the potential to}} greatly improve performance and prevent degradations due to compiler optimizations. <b>Performance</b> <b>auditing</b> relies on the ability to obtain sufficiently many timings of the region of code to make statistically valid conclusions. This work extends the state-of-the-art of <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> systems by allowing a finer level of granularity for obtaining timings and thus, increases the overall effectiveness of a <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> system. The problem solved by our technique is an instance of the general problem of correlating a program’s high-level behavior with its binary instructions, and thus, can have uses beyond a <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> system. We present our implementation and evaluation of our technique in a production Java VM. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} state <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> in Denmark – {{a practice that}} the National Audit Office of Denmark (NAOD) is mandated to undertake. My analysis of <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> takes {{as a starting point}} the fact that <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> is a kind of writing and that one immediate and obvious output of <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> consists of written reports. In a sense {{it could be argued that}} <b>performance</b> <b>auditing</b> is a particular kind of writing. However, not much research has paid attention to the question of how the writing of audit report is performed in concrete settings. What characterizes such processes? Does it follow certain rules? How are different actors involved? What kinds of effects follow from the writing and how, and to what extent, are the possible effects constrained by the particular kind of writing? The dividing line between the auditors as the writers, the auditee as the object of writing and the public as readers of the message conveyed by the report also seems to be questionable. In the dissertation, I show that in processes where it is difficult to determine in what sense a report is an output or an input and where these processes begin and end, the roles between writing and reading, active and passive may get blurred too...|$|R
