5|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director <b>pictured,</b> <b>the</b> rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar.

5|$|On 20 January 1942, Finucane {{was given}} command of No. 602 Squadron RAF at RAF Redhill. Five days later Group Captain Victor Beamish arrived {{as the new}} station commander. Beamish {{promoted}} Finucane instantly {{to the rank of}} squadron leader. Beamish had flown in the Battle of Britain and was posted to Group Captain Operations headquarters at 11 Group in 1941. Beamish frequently asked for an operational command and eventually Leigh-Mallory relented and gave him Redhill. Beamish was ordered not to fly on operations but usually flew whenever he felt like it. Beamish was killed on operations just two months later. Finucane observed 602's Glasgow traditions by reviving the squadron badge which <b>pictured</b> <b>the</b> Scottish lion rampant in red.|$|E

25|$|The second medieval city of Siri Fort {{was built}} during {{the rule of}} Ala-ud-Din Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate with the major {{objective}} of protecting the city from the onslaught of the Mongols. The city, when built with an oval plan, was best described as presenting an embodiment of richness with palaces and other structures and had seven gates for entry and exit. But, at present, only the Southeastern gate exists, also in ruins (<b>pictured).</b> <b>The</b> destruction of the fort and its gates are attributed more to the local rulers of subsequent dynasties who removed the stones, bricks and other artifacts of the fort for their own buildings and palaces.|$|E
25|$|At {{right is}} <b>pictured</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} flower of Bhutan (Meconopsis gakyidiana), commonly called the blue poppy (though taxonomically {{it is not}} of the poppy Genus or species, but only poppy-like; thus it cannot produce opiom or its derivatives). The blue poppy (national flower of Bhutan) was the source of an ecological mystery for nearly a century, due to its misclassification as Meconopsis grandis. In 2017, after three years of field work and taxonomic studies, its classification was corrected by Bhutanese and Japanese researchers. The problem may have originally arisen due to the now understood finding that some Himalayan flora readily hybridize with each other and produce viable seeds, causing wider (and unknown) morphological diversity.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{was one of}} {{the first}} tall brick-and-sandstone {{buildings}} in the city. The original 13th-century Gothic structure was consecrated before 1269, and expanded in 1260–70. Not much remains from that particular period other than the ribbed 13th-century vault. Presbytery was elongated beginning in 1401 with the three-sided apsis (<b>pictured).</b> <b>The</b> cross-shaped central part with nave arcades was added around 1420–36 (the original chancel was straight). The annexes gave the temple a shape of a Greek cross for the first time. The expansion was re-consecrated by Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki in 1436. In spite of various calamities (1462, 1476, 1655), the Church of St. Francis of Assisi and the adjacent Monastery experienced the most destructive fire only in 1850. The written records of its consecration along with priceless artifacts were lost.|$|E

25|$|The {{photograph}} of Siffleet's execution was discovered {{on the body}} of a dead Japanese major near Hollandia by American troops in April 1944. It {{is believed to be the}} only surviving depiction of a western prisoner of war being executed by a Japanese soldier. The photo was published in Australian newspapers and in Life magazine but was thought to depict Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton VC, who had been captured in Salamaua, Papua New Guinea, and beheaded on 29 March 1943. It later went on display at the Australian War Memorial. Elsewhere, despite positive identification in 1945 of Siffleet as the soldier <b>pictured,</b> <b>the</b> image continues on occasion to be misidentified as Newton. Siffleet is commemorated on the Lae Memorial in Lae, Papua New Guinea, together with all other Commonwealth war dead from actions in the region who have no known grave. A memorial park commemorating Siffleet was also dedicated at Aitape in May 2015.|$|E
25|$|Gambier-Parry was the {{architect}} of All Saints' Church, Winthorpe (pictured), which was rebuilt in 1886 to 1888 to replace the old building. The church was built {{on behalf of the}} Reverend Edward Handley, the rector of All Saints'. Gambier-Parry was also {{the architect}} of the restoration of St Michael and All Angels parish church at Bulley in the Gloucestershire, a Grade I listed building. Also referred to as St Michael & All Angels, Bulley (<b>pictured),</b> <b>the</b> church, aside from the nave walls, was rebuilt according to his design in 1886 and 1887. Changes included a new chancel, north vestry, timber-framed south porch, bell turret, and churchyard gates. Members of his family donated some of the new furnishings; Gambier-Parry supplied an oak lectern. About 1887, he designed a pair of cottages at Highnam Green in Highnam. In 1888 he built St Michael at Tidenham Chase, Gloucestershire, for Reverend Fielding Palmer. The Grade II listed St Peter's parish church (now St John Chrysostom Greek Orthodox Church) in Bentham, Badgeworth, Gloucestershire, was built in 1888 to his design. The churches of Bulley, Tidenham Chase, and Bentham are among those which demonstrate the influence of Woodyer.|$|E
25|$|Since most {{conifers}} are evergreens, {{the leaves}} of many conifers are long, thin and have a needle-like appearance, but others, including most of the Cupressaceae {{and some of the}} Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. Some, notably Agathis in Araucariaceae and Nageia in Podocarpaceae, have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves. Others such as Araucaria columnaris have leaves that are awl-shaped. In the majority of conifers, the leaves are arranged spirally, exceptions being most of Cupressaceae and one genus in Podocarpaceae, where they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of 3 (-4). In many species with spirally arranged leaves, such as Abies grandis (<b>pictured),</b> <b>the</b> leaf bases are twisted to present the leaves in a very flat plane for maximum light capture. Leaf size varies from 2mm in many scale-leaved species, up to 400mm long in the needles of some pines (e.g. Apache Pine, Pinus engelmannii). The stomata are in lines or patches on the leaves, and can be closed when it is very dry or cold. The leaves are often dark green in colour, which may help absorb a maximum of energy from weak sunshine at high latitudes or under forest canopy shade. Conifers from hotter areas with high sunlight levels (e.g. Turkish Pine Pinus brutia) often have yellower-green leaves, while others (e.g. blue spruce, Picea pungens) have a very strong glaucous wax bloom to reflect ultraviolet light. In the great majority of genera the leaves are evergreen, usually remaining on the plant for several (2-40) years before falling, but five genera (Larix, Pseudolarix, Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) are deciduous, shedding the leaves in autumn and leafless through the winter. The seedlings of many conifers, including most of the Cupressaceae, and Pinus in Pinaceae, have a distinct juvenile foliage period where the leaves are different, often markedly so, from the typical adult leaves.|$|E
