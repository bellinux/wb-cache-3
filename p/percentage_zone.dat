40|$|In {{the present}} study, twelve hybridized {{triazole}} derivatives were synthesized as Glucosamine- 6 -phosphate synthase inhibitor and evaluated for in-vitro antimicrobial activity. The in-vitro antimicrobial results demonstrated that compound B 4 b, B 4 g and B 4 j possesses potential antibacterial activity {{against all the}} tested Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains with <b>percentage</b> <b>zone</b> of inhibition 70 – 89 % and antifungal activity against all the screened fungal strains with 85 – 105 %, displaying minimal inhibitory concentration values of 3. 125 – 6. 25  μg/mL against bacteria strains and 3. 125 – 12. 5  μg/mL against fungi strains compared with standard Gatifloxacin (for bacteria) and Clotrimazole (for fungi). Docking study reviews that the compounds which bind with Ser 347, Thr 352 and Val 399 have significant anti-microbial activity. Comparing antimicrobial activity and docking results, conclude that triazolone derivatives linked through NC with substituted phenyl ring at 4 th position seem to be potentially active. The docking study reveals that high affinity of synthesized derivatives (B 4 b, B 4 g and B 4 j) within the binding pocket of glucosamine- 6 -phosphate synthase strongly enhances the determined activities of these derivatives as potent antimicrobial agents, particularly as antifungal agents...|$|E

30|$|Higher-order {{statistical}} metrics retain {{spatial information}} {{and are used}} to quantify inter-voxel intensity relationships. Dissimilarity is the quantification of variation in voxel pairs and is calculated using a Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) generated for each unique direction and averaged. A low dissimilarity is resultant of neighbouring voxels having similar values [32]. <b>Zone</b> <b>percentage</b> is calculated from a Grey Level Size Zone matrix (GLSZM) by assessing the fraction of recorded zones compared to {{the maximum number of}} possible zones. Heterogeneous MTVs have high <b>zone</b> <b>percentage</b> scores. Grey Level Non-Uniformity (GLNU) is an evaluation of the distribution of zone counts for each intensity value. The feature value is low when the number of zones associated with each intensity value are similar. Coarseness is a neighbourhood grey-tone difference matrix (NGTDM) feature that gives an indication of the level of spatial rate of change in intensity [33]. GLCM, GLSZM and NGTDM can be computed in 2 D or 3 D. The matrices in this study were computed in 3 D as this may highlight the multi-scale, directional properties of tumour tissue [34].|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo detect {{structural}} {{adaptations of}} collagen fiber matrix in compressed articular cartilage in individual sub-tissue zones by microscopic {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (μMRI) at 23 μm in-depth resolution. DesignEach of the six beagle humeral cartilage specimens {{was placed in a}} specially built nonmetallic compression device inside an in-situ rotation device, and was imaged four times at 7 T: without and during static compression, and at two orientations: 0 ° and 55 °. Proton intensity images and quantitative T 2 maps were constructed and analyzed. ResultsUpon compression at 55 ° (the magic angle), rather than appearing homogenous, T 2 -weighted intensity images of cartilage showed a distinct laminar appearance and the T 2 profiles exhibited two distinctive peaks. At both 0 ° and 55 ° orientations, lower values of T 2 were observed in compressed tissue. A significant correlation was established between changes in tissue T 2 at 55 ° and a thickness reduction due to compression. At a mean of 20 % strain value, modifications in cartilage structure were studied at each histological zone. We found that the <b>percentage</b> of superficial <b>zone</b> was significantly doubled, the <b>percentage</b> of radial <b>zone</b> was significantly decreased by 10 %, and no significant change in the transitional zone.

In this study, we investigated the influence of respiratory motion and varying noise levels on quantification of textural parameters in patients with lung cancer. Methods: We used an optimal-respiratory-gating algorithm on the list-mode data of 60 lung cancer patients who underwent 18 F-FDG PET. The images were reconstructed using a duty cycle of 35 % (percentage of the total acquired PET data). In addition, nongated images of varying statistical quality (using 35 % and 100 % of the PET data) were reconstructed to investigate the effects of image noise. Several global image-derived indices and textural parameters (entropy, high-intensity emphasis, <b>zone</b> <b>percentage,</b> and dissimilarity) that {{have been associated with}} patient outcome were calculated. The clinical impact of optimal respiratory gating and image noise on assessment of intratumor heterogeneity was evaluated using Cox regression models, with overall survival as the outcome measure. The threshold for statistical significance was adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. Results: In the lower lung lobes, respiratory motion significantly affected quantification of intratumor heterogeneity for all textural parameters (P 0. 007). The mean increase in entropy, dissimilarity, <b>zone</b> <b>percentage,</b> and high-intensity emphasis was 1. 3 % ± 1. 5 % (P = 0. 02), 11. 6 % ± 11. 8 % (P = 0. 006), 2. 3 % ± 2. 2 % (P = 0. 002), and 16. 8 % ± 17. 2 % (P = 0. 006), respectively. No significant differences were observed for lesions in the upper lung lobes (P > 0. 007). Differences in the statistical quality of the PET images affected the textural parameters less than respiratory motion, with no significant difference observed. The median follow-up time was 35 mo (range, 7 – 39 mo). In multivariate analysis for overall survival, total lesion glycolysis and high-intensity emphasis were the two most relevant image-derived indices and were considered to be independent significant covariates for the model regardless of the image type considered.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that after an acute myocardial infarction, endothelin- 1 release with subsequent calcium overload is a mediator of myocardial reperfusion injury, which can be inhibited, in part, by left ventricular unloading immediately before reperfusion. We recently have reported that left ventricular unloading before reperfusion reduces infarct size after acute myocardial infarction. However, the biologic mechanisms of infarct salvage in unloaded hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion remain undefined. MethodsTwelve pigs were subjected to 1 hour of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. A left ventricular assist device was initiated 15 minutes before reperfusion and maintained during reperfusion (assist device group, n = 6). A control group (n = 6) was subjected to reperfusion alone. Infarct size, endothelin- 1 plasma levels, intracellular calcium levels, and apoptosis were analyzed in both groups. ResultsAt reperfusion, left ventricular unloading significantly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic pressures. Infarct size, expressed as a <b>percentage</b> of <b>zone</b> at risk, was also significantly reduced by 54 % in the group with the left ventricular assist device compared with controls. Support with a left ventricular assist device reduced endothelin- 1 release from the heart at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour of reperfusion. Myocardial release of endothelin- 1 was significantly correlated with infarct size at 15 minutes of reperfusion (r = 0. 79; P =. 008). Left ventricular unloading caused a significant reduction of calcium overload and of the percentage of apoptotic cells in the ischemic region. ConclusionOur findings suggest that endothelin- 1 release and calcium overload are important mediators of reperfusion injury and that they can be significantly reduced by left ventricular unloading before coronary artery reperfusion during myocardial infarction...|$|R

The reproducibility of zone diameters (i. e., the <b>percentage</b> of replicate <b>zone</b> diameters that were within 2 {{standard deviations of}} the means), their correlation with either MICs or minimum effective concentrations (for caspofungin only), and the categorical agreement were similar between tablet and disk assays (93 to 100 % [R, > 0. 70] and 79 to 96 %, respectively) with {{four of the five}} agents.

40|$|International audienceOur {{goal was}} to develop a {{nomogram}} by exploiting intratumour heterogeneity on CT and PET images from routine (18) F-FDG PET/CT acquisitions to identify patients with the poorest prognosis. This retrospective study included 116 patients with NSCLC stage I, II or III and with staging (18) F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Primary tumour volumes were delineated using the FLAB algorithm and 3 D Slicer™ on PET and CT images, respectively. PET and CT heterogeneities were quantified using texture analysis. The reproducibility of the CT features was assessed on a separate test-retest dataset. The stratification power of the PET/CT features was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. The best standard metric (functional volume) was combined with the least redundant and most prognostic PET/CT heterogeneity features to build the nomogram. PET entropy and CT <b>zone</b> <b>percentage</b> had the highest complementary values with clinical stage and functional volume. The nomogram improved stratification amongst patients with stage II and III disease, allowing identification of patients with the poorest prognosis (clinical stage III, large tumour volume, high PET heterogeneity and low CT heterogeneity).

40|$|AbstractThe {{behavior}} of an Andasol-like thermocline tank {{with and without}} solid filler has been predicted with an analytical Logistic Cumulative Distribution Function not only during dynamic processes of charge/discharge but also during stand-by periods of no operation. The evolution of thermocline thickness with dwelling time in stand-by periods has been studied under the condition of energy conservation when thermocline zone is total or partially inside the tank. Thermocline degradation is faster for the tank with molten salt and solid filler than for the tank with only molten salt because thermal diffusivity of the molten salt is lower than thermal diffusivity of the solid material. The strong decrease in tank efficiency with consecutive charge/discharge cycles when thermocline zone is left inside the tank can be relieved if a certain <b>percentage</b> of thermocline <b>zone</b> is extracted. Actually, if 50 % thermocline is extracted, efficiency after a second process can {{be as high as}} 96 % comparing with the 77 % obtained if thermocline is not extracted. However, extracting thermocline zone implies a decrease of outlet temperature in discharge or an increase of outlet temperature if the process is a charge. Therefore, temperature limits and operation strategies should be defined for the solar thermal power plant that includes a thermocline storage tank in order to establish which amount of thermocline zone can be extracted...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though it}} might have taken some time, the three-point line {{ultimately}} changed the way {{the game is played}} as evidenced by the increase in the three-point shot attempts over the years. However, during the last few years we have experienced record-breaking seasons in terms of both three-point attempts and field goals made. This brings back to the surface questions such as "What is the rationale behind the three-point line?", "Is the three-point shot distance appropriate?" and many more similar questions. In this work, even though we do not take a stand against the three-point line, we provide evidence that challenge its distance. In particular, we analyze shot charts and we identify a statistically significant discontinuity in the shot attempts between 1 -feet zones just inside and outside the three-point line. In addition we introduce a metric inspired by fractal theory to quantify this bias and our results clearly indicate that the space dimensionality in these areas of the court is not fully exploited. By further examining the field goal <b>percentages</b> in the <b>zones</b> considered, we do not identify a similar discontinuity, i. e., the field goal percentage just inside the three-point line and just outside the line are statistically identical.

30|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{influence}} of sandstone architecture on waterflooding mechanisms using the architecture method, and taking as an example the M-I layer of the Kumkol oilfield in the South Turgay Basin, Kazakhstan, we portrayed the architecture features of different types of sandstones and quantitatively characterized heterogeneities in a single sand body in meandering river facies. Based on the waterflooding characteristics of point bar sand and overbank sand according to waterflooded interpretation results in 367 wells and numerical simulation results of well groups, we finally analyzed the remaining oil potential of the meandering river sandstone and pointed out its development directions at the high water cut stage. The result shows that because lateral accretion shale beds are developed inside single sand bodies, the point bar sand is a semi-connected body. The overbank sand is thin sandstone with poor connectivity, small area and fast lateral changes. The heterogeneity of the overbank sand is stronger than the point bar sand. The sandstone architectures control the waterflooding characteristics. In meandering river sandstones, the bottom of the point bar sand is strongly waterflooded, while the top of the point bar sand and most of the overbank sand are only weakly waterflooded or unflooded. The thickness <b>percentage</b> of unflooded <b>zone</b> and weakly waterflooded zone in point bar sand is 40 %, and the remaining oil in its top part is the main direction for future development.|$|R

The main intention {{of this study was}} to identify significant environmental effects on production and fertility traits to give advices for farm management. Additionally, adjusting records for environmental impact is essential to define appropriate models for estimation of variance components and improving selection procedures. The data consists of production and reproduction records and body measurements from 2764 Holstein upgrade cows in 252 farms. With a body weight of 415 kg and a production level of 3668 kg milk Thai Holsteins only reach approximately 60 % of performances of Holsteins in temperate <b>zones.</b> <b>Percentages</b> of Holstein genes of cows and quality of roughage sources showed a certain effect on calving interval and services per conception but not on milk performances.

Estimates of variance components applying REML and animal models were in the range as expected, i. e. heritabilities for production traits between 0. 34 and 0. 37, for fertility lower than 0. 03 and for body weight 0. 46. Genetic correlations between fertility and production traits were near zero.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} electrical neuromodulation using spinal cord stimulation (SCS) mitigates transient ischemia-induced ventricular infarction and, if so, whether adrenergic neurons are involved in such cardioprotection. The hearts of anesthetized rabbits, subjected to 30 min of left anterior descending coronary arterial occlusion (CAO) followed by 3 h of reperfusion (control), were compared with those with preemptive SCS (starting 15 min before and continuing throughout the 30 -min CAO) or reactive SCS (started at 1 or 28 min of CAO). For SCS, the dorsal C 8 -T 2 segments of the spinal cord were stimulated electrically (50 Hz, 0. 2 ms, 90 % of motor threshold). For preemptive SCS, separate groups of animals were pretreated 15 min before SCS onset with 1) vehicle, 2) prazosin (alpha(1) - adrenoceptor blockade), or 3) timolol (beta- adrenoceptor blockade). Infarct size (IS), measured with tetrazolium, was expressed as a <b>percentage</b> of risk <b>zone.</b> In controls exposed to 30 min of CAO, IS was 36. 4 +/- 9. 5 % (SD). Preemptive SCS reduced IS to 21. 8 +/- 6. 8 % (P < 0. 001). Preemptive SCS- mediated infarct reduction was eliminated by prazosin (36. 6 +/- 8. 8 %) and blunted by timolol (29. 4 +/- 7. 5 %). Reactive SCS did not reduce IS. SCS increased phosphorylation of cardiac PKC. SCS did not alter blood pressure or heart rate.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} mechanism-based anti-anxiety {{effects of}} Shudihuang (Radix Rehmanniae Preparata) polysaccharides (RRPPs) through two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) analysis with mass spectrometry (MS) of hippocampus proteins in rats treated with monosodium L-glutamate (MSG). MethodsMSG (4 g/kg) or normal saline (NS) was injected subcutaneously into infant male rats on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 after birth. MSG-treated rats at 8 weeks old were given NS, diazepam, or RRPPs daily for seven consecutive days by intragastric administration, while NS-treated rats {{given the same}} volume of NS. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark transition (LDT) tests were used to observe anti-anxiety effects of RRPPs at 1 h after the last administration. After EPM and LDT tests, hippocampus tissues were excised on ice rapidly from the brains of rats. Thereafter, 2 -DE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) were used for detecting differential proteins in hippocampus of rats so as to explore the potential mechanisms. ResultsRRPPs (200, 400 mg/kg) could significantly inhibit MSG-induced decrease of time and entries <b>percentages</b> in open <b>zones</b> in EPM test and numbers of light-dark transition in LDT test. Further analysis of 2 -DE and MALDI-TOF/MS indicated that β-synuclein, protein DJ- 1, peroxiredoxin- 2, peroxiredoxin- 6, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH- 1) and iron-sulfur proteins were all found to be down-regulated significantly in MSG-treated rats, while such down-regulation was significantly inhibited after treatment with RRPPs. ConclusionRRPPs showed anti-anxiety effects and potential mechanisms {{might be related to}} inhibiting MSG-induced down-regulation of β-synuclein, DJ- 1, peroxiredoxin- 2, peroxiredoxin- 6, DDAH- 1 and iron-sulfur proteins in hippocampus of rats...|$|R
40|$|Utah {{oil fields}} have {{produced}} over 1. 2 billion barrels (191 million m{sup 3 }). However, the 13. 7 million barrels (2. 2 million m{sup 3 }) of production in 2002 {{was the lowest}} level in over 40 years and continued the steady decline {{that began in the}} mid- 1980 s. The Utah Geological Survey believes this trend can be reversed by providing play portfolios for the major oil producing provinces (Paradox Basin, Uinta Basin, and thrust belt) in Utah and adjacent areas in Colorado and Wyoming. Oil plays are geographic areas with petroleum potential caused by favorable combinations of source rock, migration paths, reservoir rock characteristics, and other factors. The play portfolios will include: descriptions and maps of the major oil plays by reservoir; production and reservoir data; case-study field evaluations; summaries of the state-of-the-art drilling, completion, and secondary/tertiary techniques for each play; locations of major oil pipelines; descriptions of reservoir outcrop analogs; and identification and discussion of land use constraints. All play maps, reports, databases, and so forth, produced for the project will be published in interactive, menu-driven digital (web-based and compact disc) and hard-copy formats. This report covers research activities for the third quarter of the first project year (January 1 through March 31, 2003). This work included gathering field data and analyzing best practices in the eastern Uinta Basin, Utah, and the Colorado portion of the Paradox Basin. Best practices used in oil fields of the eastern Uinta Basin consist of conversion of all geophysical well logs into digital form, running small fracture treatments, fingerprinting oil samples from each producing zone, running spinner surveys biannually, mapping each producing zone, and drilling on 80 -acre (32 ha) spacing. These practices ensure that induced fractures do not extend vertically out of the intended <b>zone,</b> determine the <b>percentage</b> each <b>zone</b> contributes to the overall production of the well, identify areas that may be by-passed by a waterflood, and prevent rapid water breakthrough. In the eastern Paradox Basin, Colorado, optimal drilling, development, and production practices consist of increasing the mud weight during drilling operations before penetrating the overpressured Desert Creek zone; centralizing treatment facilities; and mixing produced water from pumping oil wells with non-reservoir water and injecting the mixture into the reservoir downdip to reduce salt precipitation, dispose of produced water, and maintain reservoir pressure to create a low-cost waterflood. During this quarter, technology transfer activities consisted of technical presentations to members of the Technical Advisory Board in Colorado and the Colorado Geological Survey.

40|$|The {{shear stress}} {{distribution}} assessment can provide useful insights for the hemodynamic {{performance of the}} implanted stent/scaffold. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of a novel bioresorbable scaffold, Mirage on local hemodynamics in animal models. The main epicardial coronary arteries of 7 healthy mini-pigs were implanted with 11 Mirage Microfiber sirolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Scaffolds (MMSES). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed post scaffold implantation and the obtained images were fused with angiographic data to reconstruct the coronary artery anatomy. Blood flow simulation was performed and Endothelial Shear Stress(ESS) distribution was estimated for each of the 11 scaffolds. ESS data were extracted in each circumferential 5 -degree subunit of each cross-section in the scaffolded segment. The generalized linear mixed-effect analysis was implemented for the comparison of ESS in two scaffold groups; 150 -µm strut thickness MMSES and 125 -µm strut thickness MMSES. ESS was significantly higher in MMSES (150 µm) [0. 85 (0. 49 - 1. 40) Pa], compared to MMSES (125 µm) [0. 68 (0. 35 - 1. 18) Pa]. Both MMSES (150 µm) and MMSES (125 µm) revealed low recirculation <b>zone</b> <b>percentages</b> per luminal surface area [3. 17 %[*]±[*] 1. 97 % in MMSES (150 µm), 2. 71 %[*]±[*] 1. 32 % in MMSES (125 µm) ]. Thinner strut Mirage scaffolds induced lower shear stress due to the small size vessels treated as compared to the thick strut version of the Mirage which was implanted in relatively bigger size vessels. Vessel size should be taken into account in planning BRS implantation. Small vessels may not get benefit from BRS implantation even with a streamlined strut profile. This pilot study warrants comparative assessment with commercially available bioresorbable scaffold...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of megakaryocytes in femur bone marrow of dog after left side lumbar sympathectomy or left side parasympathectomy, sectioning the posterior roots of fifth, sixth and seventh lumbar spinal cord {{as well as}} the first sacral segment, was observed by means of clinical bone marrow tissue culture. And also observed the change of platelet counts in nutrient vessel of tibia after these operations, comparing with those on the another right side as control. The results are as follows. 1) In the cases of sympathectomy, megakaryocyte functions (number of megakaryocytes in growth <b>zone,</b> <b>percentages</b> of moving type of megakaryocyte and tentacle formation type for platelet formation) on bone marrow tissue culture was accelerated. And the platelet counts in nutrient vessel of tibia was increased on the sympatheticomized side. The maxima of these changes were showed on around 10 th day after the operation, then these changes had been disapeared until 60 th day. 2) Megakaryocyte function on the parasympatheticomized cases was diminished. And also the platelet counts in nutrient vessel of tibia was decreased on the parasympatheticomized side. The maxima of these changes were on around 10 th day. But the change of number of megakaryocytes in growth zone was maximum on 5 th day after the operation. These results should be presumed that sympathetic denervation introduce increase of blood flow in the bone marrow and parasympathetic denervation introduce decrease of blood flow in the bone marrow, then secondarily lead up to increase or decrease the {{function of}} megakaryocytes. Futhermore, it may be thought that parasympatics influences some direct effect for the function of megakaryocytes in bone marrow...|$|R
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from short PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 25, 2014). Road maintenance {{has been growing}} in the United States and brings a variety of challenges to the transportation profession. Work zone congestion {{is one of the}} most important factors contributing to the delay and safety of freeways. Many control methodologies have been applied to work zones in order to reduce freeway congestion and delay. One means of control is ramp metering, which has been deployed since 1963 in the United States and has proven to be successful. This thesis’ objective is to evaluate and simulate the effect of ramp metering on freeway work zones; traffic performance measures such as delay, speed, and number of stops are used for the evaluation. A literature review showed that a main factor contributing to the freeway work zone delay is a high percentage of commercial trucks. Due to the role of truck <b>percentage</b> in work <b>zone</b> performance, effectiveness of ramp metering in work zone control is evaluated with different truck percentages. The lane configuration for all the studied sites work zones was 2 lanes to 1 lane, because it‘s frequency in real-world applications. In the evaluation of ramp metering in work zones, the traffic volumes investigated were less than, equal to, and more than capacity (650 vph, 1240 vph, and 1854 vph). Mainline (a link used for trough traffic) truck percentage and ramp truck percentage varied from 10 % to 40 %, and 10 % to 20 %, respectively. As a result, a total of 8 cases were created and simulated using VISSIM traffic simulation software...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Intratumour uptake {{heterogeneity}} in PET quantified {{in terms}} of textural features for response to therapy has been investigated in several studies, including assessment of their robustness for reconstruction and physiological reproducibility. However, {{there has been no}} thorough assessment of the potential impact of preprocessing steps on the resulting quantification and its predictive value. The goal of this work was to assess the robustness of PET heterogeneity in textural features for delineation of functional volumes and partial volume correction (PVC). METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 50 patients with oesophageal cancer. PVC of each PET image was performed. Tumour volumes were determined using fixed and adaptive thresholding, and the fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian algorithm, and heterogeneity was quantified using local and regional textural features. Differences in the absolute values of the image-derived parameters considered were assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. The impact on their predictive value for the identification of patient nonresponders was assessed by comparing areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: Heterogeneity parameters were more dependent on delineation than on PVC. The parameters most sensitive to delineation and PVC were regional ones (intensity variability and size zone variability), whereas local parameters such as entropy and homogeneity were the most robust. Despite the large differences in absolute values obtained from different delineation methods or after PVC, these differences did not necessarily translate into a significant impact on their predictive value. CONCLUSION: Parameters such as entropy, homogeneity, dissimilarity (for local heterogeneity characterization) and <b>zone</b> <b>percentage</b> (for regional characterization) should be preferred. This selection is based on a demonstrated high differentiation power {{in terms of}} predicting response, as well as a significant robustness with respect to the delineation method used and the partial volume effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt has {{commonly}} {{been suggested}} that in modern cities individual or household deprivation (for example, low income or education) is amplified by area level deprivation (for example, lack of jobs or good schools), in ways which damage {{the health of the}} poorest and increase health inequalities. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the location of a range of resources and exposures by deprivation in a UK city. We examined the location of 42 resources in Glasgow City, Scotland, in 2005 – 2006, by quintile of small area deprivation. Measures included number per 1000 population, network distance to nearest resource, and <b>percentage</b> of data <b>zones</b> containing at least one of each type of resource. Twelve resources had higher density in, and/or were closer to or more common in, more deprived neighbourhoods: public nurseries, public primary schools, police stations, pharmacies, credit unions, post offices, bus stops, bingo halls, public swimming pools, public sports centres, outdoor play areas, and vacant and derelict land/buildings. Sixteen had higher density in, and/or were closer to, or more common in, more affluent neighbourhoods: public secondary schools, private schools, banks, building societies, museums/art galleries, railway stations, subway stations, tennis courts, bowling greens, private health clubs, private swimming pools, colleges, A & E hospitals, parks, waste disposal sites, and tourist attractions. Private nurseries, Universities, fire stations, general, dental and ophthalmic practices, pawn brokers, ATMs, supermarkets, fast food chains, cafes, public libraries, golf courses, and cinemas showed no clear pattern by deprivation. Thus it appears that in the early 21 st century access to resources does not always disadvantage poorer neighbourhoods in the UK. We conclude that we need to ensure that theories and policies are based on up-to-date and context-specific empirical evidence on the distribution of neighbourhood resources, and to engage in further research on interactions between individual and environmental factors in shaping health and health inequalities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: The cardioprotective {{effects of}} {{activation}} of the A 2 A adenosine receptor (A 2 AAR) on ischemia/ reperfusion injury in the heart remain controversial. We investigated whether ATL 313, a new selective A 2 AAR agonist, could reduce myocardial infarct size in a rat ischemia/reperfusion model. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 40 minute occlusion of the left coronary artery followed by 3 hours reperfusion. Hemodynamics were monitored during the procedure. The rats were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 received continuous intravenous infusion of saline given 10 min prior to ischemia and throughout reperfusion (n= 8); Group 2 received continuous intravenous infusion of 10 ng/kg/min of ATL 313 given 10 min prior to ischemia, and throughout reperfusion (n= 8); and group 3 received an intravenous bolus of ATL 313 (900 ng/Kg body weight) given 10 min prior to ischemia, and continuous intravenous infusion of 10 ng/kg/min of ATL 313 started at 20 min after ischemia and throughout reperfusion (n= 8). After euthanasia of the rats, the hearts were harvested {{for the assessment of}} risk zone and zone of necrosis of the left ventricle. Results: The <b>percentage</b> of risk <b>zone</b> in the left ventricle was similar among group 1 (47 ± 3. 7 %), group 2 (41. 5 ± 4. 2 %) and group 3 (42. 4 ± 3. 8 %). However, the infarct size, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} risk zone, was significantly decreased in group 3 (30. 6 ± 5 %, P= 0. 01) compared with group 1 (53. 8 ± 6. 2 %) and group 2 (52. 1 ± 4. 8 %). In group 3, the bolus injection of ATL 313 caused a reduction in blood pressure during the procedure, and decreased heart rate and LV ±dp...|$|R
