50|$|This {{error code}} is usually caused by failure {{of one or}} more {{hardware}} components, although it can indicate that the console is not receiving enough power from the power supply, which can either be due to a faulty power supply or if the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>cable</b> is not fully inserted into the console. The 3 flashing lights can also be caused by power surges; if the console is connected to an outlet that receives a power surge, it may have a failure and the 3 lights will appear as long as the console is plugged into the outlet. Turning off the console, unplugging all power cables and plugging them back in, and restarting the console may fix this issue in some cases.|$|E
50|$|PVC Bendit is a {{tool that}} uses heat to soften PVC pipe from the inside. It {{consists}} of an electrical resistance heating element jacketed in a metal hose with a <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>cable.</b> It is primarily used to bend PVC pipe, though {{it can also be}} used to bend other thermoplastic tubes and sheets. It works by bringing up the temperature of the pipe or sheet to the softening point of 176 degrees or higher. Naturally, the longer the pipe is on the bender, the hotter and softer it will get. Once the pipe is softened, it can be formed into different shapes within the limitations of the material. When cooled, the pipe will retain all of the properties of the original material, but it will have additional stress on the points of the pipe that are stretched or compressed in the bending process.|$|E

So far, solar cell embedded on the top of FMSs have been used only as a light intensity sensors. The power source for FMS is supplied by a cable, since the solar cell's power alone is not sufficient to run conventional FMSs. To construct a massively distributed monitoring system by using wireless sensor network in fields- especially in paddy fields, a <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>cable</b> is obstructive. We developed power-saving technologies so that the solar cell can drive the FMS. New network architecture was developed which combined access-point (hotspot), ad-hoc network among access-points (repeating mode) and client connection to access-point. Conventional wired FMSs function as a backbone by using an ad-hoc network, where power is usually supplied by cable or larger solar cell. Simultaneously, the conventional FMSs provide a hotspot, where residents, gussets and full-wireless FMSs also can connect to the Internet by client connection. Energy consumption of full-wireless FMSs is half that of conventional FMSs. Yet energy consumption must be reduced up to 1 / 200 - 1 / 1000 for embedded solar cell to drive the FMS. Sleep mode also is introduced, and FMS is switched off immediately after the Fieldserver-agent collects data...|$|E

40|$|More than 70 % of {{the load}} in metallurgy, mining, gas, and other {{industries}} of the CIS consist of asynchronous motors. A relevant objective for all enterprises is to reduce consumption of reactive power in the network and ensuring reliable start of the engine by controlling the resistance value of the insulation. The most effective measure for reactive power compensation is placing the capacitor batteries directly at the points of connection of the asynchronous motor i. e. local reactive power compensation. The aim of the present research was {{to reduce the cost}} of production of the enterprise (which provides reactive power compensation), and in the period of technological pause to use the power stored in the capacitor to batteries in order control the changes of resistance value of insulation. After disconnecting the motor from the mains and its stop, the windings is being connected in parallel to the capacitor bank. The discharge of the capacitor is performed in the circuit consisting of the inductance of the motor winding, the integrated insulation resistance and battery capacity. Characteristic features of the transitional discharge process of the capacitor depend {{on the size of the}} equivalent circuit elements. The transition process may be aperiodic and periodic in its nature. Aging of motor winding causes a decrease of its impedance. When the magnitude of the insulation resistance reaches a critical value, this causes a change of the nature of the process.
