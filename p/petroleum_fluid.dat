Asphaltenes and resins are polar, while the maltene compounds are either non-polar or mildly polar. The interaction among these species strongly affects asphaltene precipitation from <b>petroleum</b> <b>fluids</b> (Goual and Firoozabadi 2004).|$|R

Estimation of reserves in an oil reservoir or determination of its performance and economics requires a good knowledge of the fluid physical properties. Bubble point pressure, gas solubility and viscosity of oils are the most important parameters in use for petroleum and chemical engineers. In this study a simple-to-use, straight-forward mathematical model was correlated on a set of 94 crude oil data. Three correlations were achieved based on an exponential regression, which were different from conventional empirical correlations, and were evaluated against 12 laboratory data other than those used for the regression. It is concluded that the new exponential equation is of higher precision and accuracy than the conventional correlations and is a more convenient mathematical formulation.|$|E

The model contains several tuning parameters {{that have to be}} identified based on the experimental data. In the most recent work, Hashmi et al. (2015) assumed that diffusion is the main driving mechanism in asphaltene deposition on the metal surface and introduced a new deposition model. Asphaltene deposition was assessed by injecting precipitating <b>petroleum</b> <b>fluid</b> mixtures into a small metal pipe, which results in deposition and clogging. Measurement of pressure drop across the pipe was used to understand dynamics of asphaltene deposition. The agreement was found between model predictions and experimental data.

The solubility class definition of asphaltenes generates a broad distribution of molecular structures. Asphaltenes and resins differ in color and texture. Asphaltenes are black, shiny, and friable solids, while resins are dark brown, shiny, and gummy.|$|R
3000|$|Proportional {{coefficient}} of solubility is strictly dependent on injected gas. The more soluble is the gas, the higher is a. Also, {{with the presence}} of reservoir water, oil swelling was increased 3 times. This might be illusionary as {{only a small fraction of}} gas is distributed in the brine phase. Thus, the jump in a value is likely to be attributed to the expansion of the <b>petroleum</b> <b>fluid</b> (which is obviously higher with water). The non-uniformity in correction factors could be justified with how the miscibility front is developed. In binary systems, the advancing gas is in contact with a pseudo-single phase while in ternary (or multiple component) system, the sweeping fluid contacts multiple layers. In the latter case, miscible conditions are developed in situ (within the cell) through composition alteration of the injected gas. The interfacial tension (IFT) or surface tension is altered. This leaves the thought that oil swelling is viscosity and IFT dependent (Or et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|There were {{different}} {{opinions about the}} origin of petroleum property variations in the Lunnan Low Uplift of the Tarim Basin. In this paper, a software PVTsim was applied to investigate the compositions of the <b>petroleum</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions in different sets of reservoir rocks from this area. The results show that there are three phases of petroleum inclusions in the Ordovician carbonate reservoirs and two types of petroleum inclusions in the Carboniferous and Triassic sandstone reservoirs. The three phases of the petroleum inclusions from the Ordovician reservoir rocks have similar compositions with the type 1 petroleum inclusion from the carboniferous and Triassic reservoir rocks, but the type 2 petroleum inclusion from the carboniferous and Triassic reservoirs is characterized by higher content of C(1) and higher GOR values. With the combination of the geological background, it was inferred that the current petroleum pools in the Lunnan Low Uplift were formed mainly by two phases of petroleum charges, one is normal oils and another light oils, and both occurred during the late Tertiary. The light oils came from eastern-south direction, and migrated and charged into the reservoirs upward and toward northern west directions. On the basis of this, it was believed that the multiphases of the petroleum charges and some composition dissipation caused by the preserved condition changes would be the main reason of the petroleum property variations in the petroleum pools in this area...|$|E

The GRNN model was trained with 91 samples and was successfully validated with a blind testing data set of 22 samples. The MMP for six of these data samples was experimentally measured at the <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fluid</b> Research Centre at Kuwait University. The remaining data consisted of experimental MMP data collected from the literature. The GRNN model was used to estimate the MMP from the training data set with an average absolute error of 0.2  %. The GRNN model was used to predict the MMP for the blind test data set with an average absolute error of 3.3  %. The precision of the introduced model and models in the literature was evaluated by comparing the predicted MMP values with the measured MMP values and using training and testing data sets. The GRNN model significantly outperformed the prominent models that have been published in the literature and commonly used for estimating MMP. The use of the GRNN model was reliable over a large range of crude oil compositions, impurities, and temperature conditions. The GRNN model provides a cost-effective alternative for estimating the MMP, which is commonly, measured using experimental displacement procedures that are costly and time consuming.

3000|$|ML {{techniques}} usually utilise input variables {{similar to}} the empirical correlations. Mostly, <b>petroleum</b> <b>fluid</b> properties which are easily measured {{in the field and}} which have direct physical relationship with the target output are used as the correlating variables (Standing 1947; Chew and Connally 1959). Also, a trial and error method can be used to eliminate any correlating variable that does not improve the performance of the correlation significantly (Chew and Connally 1959). Pruning of the correlating variables, often referred to as feature selection, can be achieved by some statistical tools to select input variables that are used in the regression analysis to develop the empirical correlations or by common feature selection techniques such as neighbourhood component analysis (NCA), sequential feature selection and LASSO. NCA is an embedded and nonparametric feature selection method. NCA mainly learns the feature weights with the aim of minimising the objective function that measures the mean leave-one-out regression or classification loss over the given training data set (Goldberger et al.  2005; Yang et al.  2012). LASSO minimises the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. LASSO includes a penalty term that constrains the size of the estimated coefficients to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero in order to trim the selected features for prediction (Tibshirani 1996, 2011). Sequential feature selection in its basic form involves minimisation of an objective function over all feasible feature subsets by adding or removing features from a candidate subset while evaluating the criteria (Liu and Motoda 2007; Stańczyk and Jain 2015).|$|E

40|$|The {{dependence}} on oil {{and the fact that}} petroleum conventional reservoirs are becoming depleted direct attentions toward unconventional-and harder to access-reservoirs. Among those, heavy and extremely heavy oil reservoirs and tar sands form a considerable portion of all petroleum resources. Conventional thermal and thermocatalytic refining methods are not affordable choices in some cases, as they demand a considerable energy investment. On the other hand, electron irradiation, as a novel technology, provides more promising results in heavy oil upgrading. Electron irradiation, as a method of delivering energy to a target molecule, ensures that most of the energy is absorbed by the molecule electronic structure. This leads to a very efficient generation of reactive species, which are capable of initiating chemical reactions. In contrast, when using thermal energy, {{only a small portion of}} the energy goes into the electronic structure of the molecule; therefore, bond rupture will result only at high energy levels. The effect of electron irradiation on different heavy <b>petroleum</b> <b>fluids</b> is investigated in this study. Radiation-induced physical and chemical changes of the fluids have been evaluated using different analytical instruments. The results show that high energy electron particles intensify the cracking of heavy hydrocarbons into lighter species. Moreover, irradiation is seen to limit any post-treatment reactions, providing products of higher stability. Depending on the characteristics of the radiolyzed fluid, irradiation may change the distribution pattern of the products, or the radiolysis process may follow the same mechanism that thermal cracking does.
