40|$|Abstract. Polymeric {{particle}} composites which synergically combine {{properties of}} filler {{and of a}} matrix are of a great potential to satisfy a number of requirements of many branches by their resulted behaviour. Using surface mechanical treatment waste as the composite filler adds also a possibility of economical non-dangerous waste material recyclation way to the resulted properties of the formed material as {{the form of the}} fortifying phase of the particle composites. The experimental specimens filler (the fortifying phase) was waste from the process of machining and blasting. Its fraction differs from common particle filler by a large dimension and heterogenity of single particles. The two-component epoxy adhesive was used as the matrix (the connected phase). The influence of various fortifying phase coming from waste and composite mechanical properties changes depending on different filler volume portion was experimentally tested at the formed polymeric particle composite. Setting the polymeric particle composites behaviour is important for a definition of their application possibilities. It is supposed to use such systems in the sphere of <b>puttying</b> adhesive bondings or renovation of various materials and machine particles. Key words: mechanical properties, particle polymeric composite, waste...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the possibilities of a construction company’s cost data classification. The case company’s cost data became inaccurate when proceeding from cost estimation to execution and the objective was to gather comparable data from projects. The cost data was examined with 5 D BIM application iTWO, which was studied in this research. The research consists of a literature review and a case study. The implementation of 5 D BIM application was studied and essential cost management decisions were documented during the research. The case study demonstrated the usage of 5 D BIM application. This was limited by using an example of light partition walls and the <b>puttying</b> and painting of them in an ongoing project. It could be conducted that the used 5 D BIM application enables controlling of cost data by low hierarchy level {{from the beginning of the}} project to the end. The most important part of cost data management is the controlling structure, which is used for reports and comparing projects. The usage of the application was good and it was considered as a reliable source of information. Collaboration between project participants is needed to use 5 D BIM application in the most efficient way. The same data is used throughout the project, so sequential phases should be taken into consideration when creating new information or structuring it. Most of the essential information of the project can be found in the building information model, which means that the designers must have clear instructions about the use of information fields or additional application should be used for standardization...|$|E

50|$|Already US$12,000 in debt, Hodgson {{borrowed}} US$147 {{to buy a}} {{batch of}} the <b>putty</b> to pack 1 oz portions into plastic eggs for US$1, calling it Silly <b>Putty.</b> Initially, sales were poor, but after a New Yorker article mentioned it, Hodgson sold over 250,000 eggs of silly <b>putty</b> in three days. However, Hodgson was almost put {{out of business in}} 1951 by the Korean War. Silicone, the main ingredient in silly <b>putty,</b> was put on ration, harming his business. A year later the restriction on silicone was lifted and the production of Silly <b>Putty</b> resumed. Initially, it was primarily targeted towards adults. However, by 1955 the majority of its customers were aged 6 to 12. In 1957, Hodgson produced the first televised commercial for Silly <b>Putty,</b> which aired during the Howdy Doody Show.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{measure the}} {{temperature}} {{change in the}} pulp cavity of an extracted tooth during the polymerization of provisional resins within impression <b>putty</b> and polyethylene matrices. The effect of precooling the <b>putty</b> matrix was also evaluated. Methods. A freshly extracted premolar tooth had <b>putty</b> impressions recorded prior to crown preparation. <b>Putty</b> matrices were stored at room temperature, 4 and − 12 C prior to use. A thermocouple placed in the pulp chamber recorded the temperature change every 15 s for a 10 min duration during polymerization of three resins using <b>putty</b> and clear polyethylene matrices. Five recordings were made with each material at each storage temperature. Results. There is a temperature rise of 3. 4 – 5. 5 C when the resins were autocured in a <b>putty</b> matrix. When the polyvinyl matrix was used the temperature rise increased to 4. 0 – 8. 2 C (P < 0. 001). The temperature rise was reduced to zero when the <b>putty</b> had been precooled in the fridge (P < 0. 001) and reduced further following precooling in the freezer (P < 0. 001). Significance. The use of a polyvinyl matrix allows higher pulp temperature rises to occur due to the exotherm from provisional resins. Lower temperatures were recorded when <b>putty</b> was used. The temperature rise could be eliminated when the <b>putty</b> was cooled at 4 C prior to reinsertion...|$|R

50|$|Commonly sold {{in retail}} outlets with school {{supplies}} and home improvement products, this soft, malleable <b>putty</b> appears in many colors and under numerous brand names. Intended to adhere posters and prints to walls without damaging the underlying wall surface, poster <b>putty</b> works {{much the same}} as traditional kneaded erasers, but with a greater tack and in some circumstances, lifting strength. Poster <b>putty</b> does not erase so much as lighten by directly pulling particles of graphite, charcoal or pastel from a drawing. In this regard, poster <b>putty</b> does not smudge or damage work in the process. Repeatedly touching the <b>putty</b> to a drawing pulls ever more medium free, gradually lightening the work in a controlled fashion. Poster <b>putty</b> can be shaped into fine points or knife edges, making it ideal for detailed or small areas of work. It can be rolled across a surface to create visual textures. Poster <b>putty</b> loses its efficacy with use, becoming less tacky as the material grows polluted with debris and oils from the user's skin.|$|R

40|$|Bioactive glass (BAG) S 53 P 4 {{granules}} {{represent a}} bone augmentation biomaterial for the surgical treatment of bony defects, even in challenging {{conditions such as}} osteomyelitis. The aim of this eight-week rabbit implantation study was to evaluate the biocompatibility and bone regeneration performance of a BAG S 53 P 4 <b>putty</b> formulation following its implantation into the proximal tibia bone of twenty-eight New Zealand white rabbits. BAG S 53 P 4 <b>putty</b> was compared to BAG S 53 P 4 granules (0. 5 - 0. 8 mm) to evaluate whether the synthetic <b>putty</b> binder influences the bone regeneration of the osteostimulative granules. The <b>putty</b> formulation facilitates clinical use because of its mouldability, injectability and ease of mixing with autograft. Implantation of <b>putty</b> and granules into proximal tibia defects resulted in good osseointegration of the two groups. Both biomaterials were biocompatible, showed high new bone formation, high vascularization and periosteal growth. No signs of disturbed bone formation were observed due to the PEG-glycerol binder in the BAG S 53 P 4 <b>putty.</b> Instead, intramedullary ossification and stromal cell reaction were more advanced in the <b>putty</b> group compared to the control group (p = 0. 001 and p < 0. 001).
