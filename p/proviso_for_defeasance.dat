The authors empirical tests provide compelling evidence of bondholder gains, but no support for shareholder losses when a firm defeases debt. They speculate that the insignificance of the loss to shareholders is primarily due to the size disparity between the value of defeased debt and {{the market value of}} outstanding equity, since the suggested economic merits of defeasance appear unfounded. Although they cannot prove an agency motivation <b>for</b> <b>defeasance,</b> they find a very high correlation between compensation tied to earnings and defeasing debt at book gain.

Our methods of analysis are descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The regression analysis is performed by joining our data with Mergent’s Fixed Income Securities Database (FISD). Our major findings are: (1) 0. 56 % of defeasible bonds have this option exercised; (2) defeasance and repurchase are linked together as firms often repurchase as many bonds as possible while any hold outs are removed via defeasance; (3) no evidence that defeasance exercise is clustered in industries with higher uncertainty (4) bonds with a higher number of restrictive covenants {{are more likely to}} exercise their defeasance option; (5) {{there is no indication that}} callable bonds substitute <b>for</b> <b>defeasance</b> exercise; (6) the defeasance exercises are often linked to major corporate actions, such as acquisitions, mergers or refinancing. nhhma...|$|R

40|$|Partial Order Reduction (POR) is a well-known, {{successful}} {{technique for}} on-the-fly state space reduction in model checking, {{as evidenced by}} the prestigious CAV 2014 award for its pioneers. The combination of POR with LTL model checking is long known to cause the so-called ignoring problem, i. e. relevant behavior is continuously ignored and never selected for exploration. This problem has been solved with increasing sophistication over the years, using various ignoring provisos, which include all necessary actions along cycles in the state space. However, parallel model checking algorithms still suffer from a lack of an efficient solution; the best known ones causing severe decrease in reductions. We present a new parallel ignoring <b>proviso</b> <b>for</b> POR, which solves this issue by exploiting parallel DFS-based algorithms. Its similarity to the sequential solutions allows the combination with sophisticated earlier methods solving the ignoring problem.
