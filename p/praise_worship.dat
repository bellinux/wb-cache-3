25|$|Churches in Australian Christian Churches {{are known}} for their Pentecostal style {{services}} that involve contemporary <b>praise</b> and <b>worship,</b> speaking in tongues, lifting of hands in worship and preaching. While Australian Christian Churches use a wide range of worship styles, generally churches use contemporary <b>praise</b> and <b>worship</b> music for services. From using Hymns in the 1930s to 1950s, music from the Jesus movement in the 1960s and 1970s and the contemporary <b>praise</b> and <b>worship</b> of the 1980s to today, AOG churches have continually adapted to new styles of <b>praise</b> and <b>worship.</b> In recent decades, churches affiliated with Australian Christian Churches have revolutionised church <b>praise</b> and <b>worship.</b> The largest driving force for this change is the popularity of Hillsong Music of Hillsong Church. Other influences are Shirelive Church, Planetshakers, Hillsong United, Youth Alive and Influencers Church. Many ACC churches have released albums containing songs written in the church.|$|R
