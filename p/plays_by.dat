5|$|Ripken's power, {{which led}} to records such as most home runs by a shortstop and 13th place in career doubles, had consequences.

In 1999, Ripken passed Hank Aaron as the player who had grounded into the most double plays in his career. Ripken is third on the fielding side for double <b>plays</b> <b>by</b> a shortstop (1565, behind Omar Vizquel's 1734 and Ozzie Smith's 1590).|$|E
