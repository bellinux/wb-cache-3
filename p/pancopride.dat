After <b>pancopride</b> 10 mg, the LOESP was higher than placebo and 5 mg <b>pancopride</b> {{but there were no}} differences among the three treatments (P = 0. 42). The areas under the curve were similar without differences, neither with absolute measurements (P = 0. 53) nor after a baseline correction (P = 0. 16).
