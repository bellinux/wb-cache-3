2500|$|The ocean can {{be divided}} into three density zones: the surface zone, the <b>pycnocline,</b> and the deep zone. The surface zone, also called the mixed layer, refers to the {{uppermost}} density zone of the ocean. Temperature and salinity are relatively constant with depth in this zone due to currents and wave action. The surface zone contains ocean water that is in contact with the atmosphere and within the photic zone. The surface zone has the ocean's least dense water and represents approximately 2% of the total volume of ocean water. The surface zone usually ranges between depths of [...] to [...] below ocean surface, but this can vary a great deal. In some cases, the surface zone can be entirely non-existent. The surface zone is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude. The transition to colder, denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes. The <b>pycnocline</b> refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature. The <b>pycnocline</b> effectively separates the lower-density surface zone above from the higher-density deep zone below. The <b>pycnocline</b> represents approximately 18% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone refers to the lowermost density zone of the ocean. The deep zone usually begins at depths below [...] in mid-latitudes. The deep zone undergoes negligible changes in water density with depth. The deep zone represents approximately 80% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone contains relatively colder and stable water.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pycnocline</b> is the cline or layer {{where the}} density {{gradient}} (...) is greatest within {{a body of}} water. An ocean current is generated by the forces such as breaking waves, temperature and salinity differences, wind, Coriolis effect, and tides caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun. In addition, the physical properties in a <b>pycnocline</b> driven by density gradients also affect the flows and vertical profiles in the ocean. These changes can {{be connected to the}} transport of heat, salt, and nutrients through the ocean, and the <b>pycnocline</b> diffusion controls upwelling.|$|E
30|$|Wang et al. (2010; {{see also}} Wright et al., 1986) {{suggested}} internal waves {{but did not}} provide empirical evidence for internal waves {{at the mouth of}} the Yellow River (Fig. 4 d). Internal waves are a complicated oceanographic phenomenon (Shanmugam 2013). For example, internal waves occur only along <b>pycnoclines</b> (Shanmugam 2013), but there is no evidence of <b>pycnoclines</b> at shallow depths where hyperpycnal plumes develop in front of the Yellow River.|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms play pivotal {{functions}} in the trophic dynamics and biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems. Their concentrations and activities often peak at localized hotspots, an important example of which are <b>pycnoclines,</b> where water density increases sharply with depth due to gradients in temperature or salinity. At <b>pycnoclines</b> organisms are exposed to different environmental conditions compared to the bulk water column, including reduced turbulence, slow mass transfer, and high particle and predator concentrations. Here we show that, at an even more fundamental level, the density stratification itself can affect microbial ecology at <b>pycnoclines,</b> by quenching the flow signature, increasing the energetic expenditure, and stifling the nutrient uptake of motile organisms. We demonstrate this through numerical simulations of an archetypal low-Reynolds-number swimmer, the “squirmer. ” We identify the Richardson number—the ratio of buoyancy forces to viscous forces—as the fundamental parameter that quantifies the effects of stratification. These results demonstrate an unexpected effect of buoyancy on low-Reynolds-number swimming, potentially affecting {{a broad range of}} abundant organisms living at <b>pycnoclines</b> in oceans and lakes.

50|$|Below {{the mixed}} layer, a stable density {{gradient}} (or <b>pycnocline)</b> separates {{the upper and}} lower water, hindering vertical transport. This separation has important biological effects on the ocean and the marine living organisms. However, vertical mixing across a <b>pycnocline</b> is a regular phenomenon in oceans, and occurs through shear-produced turbulence.

Nutrient fluxes through the <b>pycnocline</b> are lower than at other surface layers.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} behavioural features of plankton is a vertical migration that occurs with a 24-hour periodicity. This has often {{been referred to as}} diurnal or diel vertical migration. The vertical distance travelled over 24 hours varies, generally being greater among larger species and better swimmers. But even small copepods may migrate several hundred meters twice in a 24-hour period, and stronger swimmers like euphausiids and pelagic shrimp may travel 800 m or more. The depth range of migration may be inhibited by the presence of a thermocline or <b>pycnocline.</b> However, phytoplankton and zooplankton capable of diel vertical migration are often concentrated in the <b>pycnocline.</b> Furthermore, those marine organisms with swimming skills through thermocline or <b>pycnocline</b> may experience strong temperature and density gradients, as well as considerable pressure changes during the migration.|$|E

It can occur in 10-80% of the water column. For example, in a 10-meter water column, it can reach up to 2 meters below the surface. In a 20-meter water column, it can extend up to 8 meters below the surface.|$|R

Anoxygenic photosynthesis, or photosynthesis that doesn’t produce oxygen and is common with photosynthetic bacteria and certain cyanobacteria, uses electron donors other than water to reduce CO2 for incorporation into biomass. This mechanism of photoautotrophy usually uses hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an electron donor and a single photosystem as a catalyst, oxidizing sulfide to sulfur and sulfate to support the growth of phototrophs in anoxic sulfidic environments exposed to light, such as laminated microbial mats and <b>pycnoclines</b> of stratified lakes.|$|R
40|$|A linear internal-tide {{generation}} model {{is applied to}} the Faeroe–Shetland Channel, using observed profiles of stratification. Several degrees of simplification are considered: 1) uniform, i. e. constant N; 2) vertically varying N (z); 3) the full N(x, z) and associated geostrophic background flows. It is shown that clearly identifiable internal tidal beams and internal-wave attractors occur in the first case, but not in the other cases where the pattern is patchy due to internal reflections from the strong inhomogeneities in the medium. Given the general occurrence of <b>pycnoclines</b> and geostrophic background flows in the ocean, it is argued that this internal scattering can be expected to be a widespread phenomenon...|$|R

50|$|Waves on the <b>pycnocline,</b> called {{internal}} waves, are {{ubiquitous in}} Pelorus Sound. They propagate at 1 m/s and involve vertical displacements of the <b>pycnocline</b> through 5 m.

The natural environment in the sea and lakes is usually also stratified during most of the year, although thermoclines or <b>pycnoclines</b> are seldom part of a mesocosm-based ecological study. In this paper, we describe a unique mesocosm facility where the physical characteristics can be controlled and manipulated and give some examples of biological consequences of different physical conditions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{sensitivity}} of the thermal struct•re of the equatorial Pacific and Indian Ocean <b>pycnoclines</b> to a model's representation of the Indonesian Straits connecting the two basins is investigated. Two inte-grations are performed using the global HOPE ocean model. The initial conditions and surface forcing for both cases are identical; {{the only difference between}} the runs is that one has an opening for the Indonesian Straits which spans the equator on the Pacific side, and the other has an opening which lies fully north of the equator. The resulting sensitivity throughout much of the upper ocean is greater than 0. 5 øC for both the equa-torial Indian and Pacific. A realistic sinrelation of net Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) transport (measured in Sverdrups) is not sufficient for an adequate simulation of equatorial watermasses. The ITF must also contain a realistic admixture of northern and southern Pacific source water...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of in situ measurements and radiative transfer modelling {{were used to}} study optical conditions in the inner basin of Loch Etive, a Scottish fjord, in March and April 2000. The basin was strongly stratified with three layers separated by marked <b>pycnoclines.</b> The surface layer averaged 5 m in depth and was heavily stained with coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) which reduced the euphotic depth to between 7 and 10 m. Approximately 20 % of the photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) {{in the water column}} was absorbed by phytoplankton, 44 % by CDOM and 36 % by sea water. Detectable concentrations of the major inorganic nutrients (nitrate, phosphate and silicate) occurred at all depths, but significant phytoplankton populations (averaging 6 mg chlorophyll a m- 3) were found only in the reduced-salinity surface layer. The freshwater input therefore acted both as a source of buoyancy which promoted phytoplankton growth near the surface and as an attenuator of visible light which inhibited growth deeper in the water column...|$|R
50|$|Internal waves {{can form}} at the {{boundary}} between water layers of different densities. These sub-surface waves are called internal waves. As {{is the case with}} ocean waves at the air-ocean interface, internal waves possess troughs, crests, wavelength, and period. Internal waves move very slowly because the density difference between the joined media is very small. Internal waves occur in the ocean {{at the base of the}} <b>pycnocline,</b> especially at the bottom edge of a steep thermocline. The wave height of internal waves may be greater than 30 m, causing the <b>pycnocline</b> to undulate slowly through a considerable depth. Their wavelength often exceeds 0.8 km and their periods are typically 5 to 8 minutes. Internal waves are generated by wind energy, tidal energy, and ocean currents. Surface manifestations of internal waves have been photographed from space.|$|E
50|$|Below the <b>pycnocline</b> is the Deep Water mass, where {{salinity}} {{increases to}} 22.3 psu and temperatures rise to around 8.9 °C.

Weak geothermal heating and long residence time create a very thick convective bottom layer.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{stratification}} {{occurs when}} water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (<b>pycnocline),</b> temperature (thermocline) - form layers {{that act as}} barriers to water mixing {{which could lead to}} anoxia or euxinia. [...] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.|$|E
40|$|The {{utility of}} {{individual}} based models (IBMs) is that properties of ecological {{systems can be}} derived by considering the properties of individuals constituting them. Individual differences may be physiological, behavioral or may arise from interactions among individuals. The differences result in unique life histories, which when considered as a whole give rise to growth and size distributions that provide {{a measure of the}} state of the population. Early IBMs generally did not consider the effect of a spatially variable physical environment. Recent advances in ocean circulation models that include realistic temporal and spatial variation of currents, turbulence, light, prey, etc., have enabled IBMs to be embedded in model flow fields and for unique, sometimes behaviorally modified, Lagrangian trajectories to be computed. The explicit consideration of realistic spatial heterogeneity provides an additional factor that contributes to the differentiation among individuals, to variances in population structure, and ultimately to our understanding of the recruitment process. This is particularly important in marine environments where fronts, boundary layers, <b>pycnoclines,</b> gyres and other smaller spatia...|$|R
30|$|The static case of such {{a problem}} was studied by Rosencrans et al. [1 – 4] and Li [5] for the heat {{equation}} on a coated body under different boundary conditions. In fluid mechanics, Miksis and Davis [6] studied a Navier-Stokes fluid flows over another one over rough and coated surfaces. Jäger and Mikelic [7] considered the boundary conditions on the contact interface between a porous medium and a free fluid. Kohn and Vogelius [8, 9] studied the effective models in a thin plate with rapidly varying thickness, he found that those models are different according to the different scaling. Braides et al. [10] got the effective results on inhomogeneous thin layers in 2 D and 3 D. Ansini and Braides [11] applied their effective results on oscillating boundary to thin films. Other important work on the domain coarsening in thin layers was done by Niethammer and Otto [12]. Moreover, {{the effect of the}} strong interaction of two-dimensional, long, internal gravity waves propagating on neighboring <b>pycnoclines</b> in a stratified fluid was recently studied in [13]. For other work, we refer the interested reader to [14 – 16] and the references therein.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{satellite}} observations of Rossby waves and chlorophyll anomalies propagating in subtropical gyres {{have suggested that}} wave-induced upwelling could stimulate photosynthesis. Instead, we show that chlorophyll maxima are located in abnormally warm water, in Rossby wave-induced convergences. This excludes inputs of nutrients from deeper water. We argue that the sea color anomalies are not caused by chlorophyll but by floating particles evolved from the ecosystem, and accumulated by Rossby waves, acting as “marine hay rakes”, in convergence zones. Such processes may be determinant for the distribution of living organisms in oligotrophic areas. Subtropical anticyclonic gyres represent about 40 % of the world ocean and have very low nutrient and chlorophyll levels, and permanently deep <b>pycnoclines</b> and nutriclines. In these oligotrophic areas, respiration balances, and sometimes exceeds photosynthesis (1). Primary production is mostly supported by the regeneration of nutrients by the microbial loop while export production remains low all the year round. Yet, export production estimates based on seasonal geochemical budgets, while low, is not entirely {{accounted for by the}} mean upwelling of nutrients to the photic layer (2, 3).

40|$|Sea lochs (small Scottish fjords) are Case 2 waters whose {{distinctive}} features include high surface gelbstoff concentrations, strong <b>pycnoclines,</b> high phytoplankton densities and low concentrations of non-biogenic particles. Measurements of the remote sensing reflectance spectra of these waters were made using a floating spectroradiometer {{during the spring}} diatom bloom in 1998. Calculations of radiative transfer were then carried out using the Hydrolight software package. The water column was modelled using gelbstoff and chlorophyll a profiles derived from in situ measurements of salinity and fluorescence, calibrated by the analysis of water bottle samples. Solar-stimulated chlorophyll fluorescence was described by a Gaussian peak centered on 685 nm with an apparent quantum yield of 1 - 2 %. Appropriate levels of particle backscattering could be generated by incorporating a Henyey-Greenstein phase function in the model provided that the asymmetry parameter g was allowed to vary systematically with chlorophyll concentration. Since optical depths at 550 nm (the wavelength of maximum penetration) were {{in the range of}} 2 - 8 m for all stations the reflectance spectra were mainly determined by the inherent optical properties of reduced-salinity surface layers...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we compare}} four {{turbulence}} models usually used to parameterize the oceanic boundary layer. These four models {{depend on the}} bulk Richardson number, which is coherent with the studied region, the West Pacific Warm Pool, {{because of the large}} mean shear associated with the equatorial undercurrent. Two of these models, called R 224 and R 22, are new and the others are Pacanowski and Philander’s model (R 213 model) and Gent’s model (R 23 model). The numerical implementation is based on a non-conservative numerical scheme. The following (three criteria) are used to compare the models: the surface current intensity, the <b>pycnocline’s</b> form and the mixed layer depth. We initialize the code with realistic velocity and density profiles thanks the TOGA-TAO array (McPhaden, 1995, [21]). In case of static instability zone on the initial density profile, only the R 224 model gives realistic results. Afterwards, we study a mixed layer induced by the wind stress. In this case, the R 224 results and the Pacanowski and Philander’s results are similar. Furthermore, we simulate a long time case. We obtain a linear solution for all models that is in agreement with Bennis and al [1]. Summary 0. 1 Keywords: vertical mixing, Richardson number, mixed layer. ...|$|R
40|$|Satellite data {{reveal a}} 20 % decline in sea ice extent in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas {{in the two}} decades {{following}} 1973. This change is negatively correlated with surface air temperatures {{on the west side}} of the Antarctic Peninsula, which have increased - 0. 5 C / decade- since the mid- 1940 s, The recession was strongest during summer, when monthly average minima in 1991 - 92 removed much of the incipient multiyear ice over the continental shelf. This would have lowered the regional-mean ice thickness, impacting snow ice formation, brine production, and vertical heat flux. The northern ice edge contracted by 1 deg of latitude in all seasons from 1973 - 79 to 1987 - 93, returning toward mean conditions in 1993 - 95. The decline included multiyear cycles of several years in length, superimposed on high interannual variability. A review of atmospheric forcing shows winds consistent with mean and extreme ice extents, and suggests links to larger-scale circulation changes in the South Pacific. Historical ocean measurements are sparse in this sector, but mixed-layer depths and upper <b>pycnoclines</b> beneath the sea ice resemble those in the Weddell Sea.
