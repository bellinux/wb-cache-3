Thus, the greatest amount of rainfall is expected at mid-altitudes and can support deciduous forest development. Above a certain elevation the rising air becomes too dry and cold, and thus discourages tree growth. Although rainfall may not be a significant factors for some mountains, atmospheric humidity or aridity can be more important climatic stresses that affect altitudinal zones.

500|$|Mean annual {{precipitation}} ranges from [...] {{in the eastern}} parts of Formosa Province {{to a low of}} [...] in the west and southwest. Most of the precipitation is concentrated in the summer and decreases from east to west. Summer rains are intense, and torrential rain is common, occasionally causing floods and soil erosion. During the winter months, precipitation is sparse. Eastern areas receive more precipitation than western areas since they are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This penetrates the eastern areas more than the west, bringing it more precipitation. As a result, the vegetation differs with eastern areas being covered by forests, savannas, marshes, and subtropical wet forest, while western areas are dominated by medium and low forests of mesophytic and xerophytic trees, and a dense understory of shrubs and grasses. The western part has a pronounced dry winter season while the eastern parts have a slightly drier season. In all parts of the region, precipitation is highly variable from year to year. The eastern part of the region receives just enough precipitation to have a positive water balance. By contrast, the western parts of the region have a negative water balance (the <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> exceeds the precipitation) owing to lower precipitation.|$|E

This paper examines the irrigation issues that constrain sustainable coffee production in Vietnam. The period from January to April is a crucial time {{in the growth of}} the coffee crop. It requires irrigation, because rainfall only provides 25 % of the <b>potential</b> crop <b>evapotranspiration</b> demand. According to crop phenology, this period also requires induced water stress, because it coincides with breaking the dormancy of flower buds and initiation of cherry development, which is crucial for achieving high yield. This paper proposes an irrigation supply of 120 or 150 mm between January and April in a year preceded by good or average rainfall respectively, in November and December. This is equivalent to 364 or 456 liters/plant/round in 3 rounds/year, which is only 70 % of the locally recommended level by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Synchronizing this irrigation supply with the management of other inputs could increase average yield up to 4000 kg/ha, from the present level of 2400 kg/ ha making coffee production both sustainable and economically viable.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The hump-shaped {{relationship}} that predicts highest species richness (species/unit area) at intermediate levels of productivity was examined for woody plants across the Pacific and Inland Northwest of the U. S. Many {{studies have examined}} this relationship at regional scales, but commonly use species range maps and surrogate measures of productivity (e. g. evapotranspiration.) In this study, productivity {{during the growing season}} was modeled over the entire study area at a monthly time step with a physiologically-based process model using climate data extrapolated for terrain effects. The productivity information was validated in Oregon by converting it to site index and comparing it with field data; reasonable agreement was found. The productivity-species richness relationship was then examined with two datasets of tree species richness, one of shrub species richness and one dataset of woody plant species richness in the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The relationship between predicted productivity and species richness was analyzed at multiple grain sizes by spatial aggregation at 1, 100, and 1000 km². After taking into account the effect of area, improvements in the hump-shaped relationship emerged at progressively larger spatial units of aggregation for all datasets. In every case, a hump-backed curve was found with different degrees of fit. One tree species dataset was examined in detail in the states of Oregon and Washington at the scale of 100 km² in a comparison among productivity and surrogates measures (i. e. <b>potential</b> and actual <b>evapotranspiration).</b> Modeled productivity best accounted for patterns in tree species richness and the statistical model was validated with independent field data and performed well. In conclusion, where climate data are available to model productivity spatially, the common surrogates of productivity such as <b>potential</b> or actual <b>evapotranspiration</b> are better avoided as productivity substitutes.
