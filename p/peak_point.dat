5|$|The {{story begins}} when Specter, a white-haired monkey who is {{well-known}} {{at his home}} in a monkey-themed amusement park, puts on an experimental <b>Peak</b> <b>Point</b> Helmet created by a Professor, which increases his intelligence beyond that of a regular monkey, but also twists his mind, turning him evil. Imbued with this new power, Specter gives Pipo Helmets to all the monkeys in the park and sets them loose, having them take over the local laboratory where the Professor and his assistant Natalie (Katie/Natsumi) are currently building a time machine. As Spike (Kakeru) and his best friend Jake (Buzz/Hiroki) arrive at the laboratory, they find themselves transported by Specter, along with all the other monkeys, to the various reaches of time. Realizing that leaving the monkeys to their own devices could rewrite history in disastrous ways, the Professor tasks Spike with finding all of the monkeys scattered across time and sending them back to the present.|$|E

According to Benazir Bhutto who calculated her rival's level of political popularity after ordering the tests asserted, that these tests had erased the existed doubts and fear from the minds of people of Pakistan who questioned Pakistan's deterrence capability after 1971 collapse. Even as of today, Sharif and his party takes all the credit for authorising these tests, and annually held celebrating public functions in all over the country. Without any doubts, Sharif posed to become Pakistan's most favourable and strongest Prime minister since 1974, and the political prestige of Nawaz Sharif was at its <b>peak</b> <b>point</b> at the time when the country had gone nuclear.|$|E

After a lengthy series of captures and battles in segments of history ranging from the roam of the dinosaurs, medieval times and present day, Spike is eventually able to capture all of the apes. Spike chases Specter to his deranged theme park, where he is holding a recently captured Professor, Natalie, and his friend Jake. Spike frees Jake of his mind control, and releases both the professor and Natalie, {{and goes on to}} find Specter in an alternative universe he calls the [...] "Peak Point Matrix". Spike defeats Specter after a final battle, and he is captured and sent back to the zoo.|$|E

To increase the efficiency of PV panels, it must operate around the <b>peak</b> power <b>point</b> which is influenced by cell temperature and sun irradiation. A controller therefore is needed to find the <b>peak</b> power <b>point</b> and control PV output voltage according to <b>peak</b> power <b>point</b> voltage.
