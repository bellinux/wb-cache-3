40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, I am tracing back the {{evolution}} of contemporary masculinity studies as an academic field and scrutinize one of its main concepts, ‘hegemonic masculinity’. Pointing to the weaknesses of this concept leads to more general critique towards the field, namely the marginalization of men’s individual subjectivities {{and the use of}} essentialist notions of masculinity, predominantly the idea that masculinity necessarily relies on the male body. By taking queer theorists’ critiques of these notions into account, I am advocating the, so far only rudimentary present, implementation of poststructural theory and interdisciplinary approaches for masculinity studies’ further development. In order to demonstrate the utility of these approches for masculinity studies, I extract three tools of Judith Butler’s writings on performativity, namely the <b>performative</b> <b>notion</b> of gender, the heterosexual matrix and the historical specificity of gender, and engage them in a twisted reading of David Fincher’s movie Fight Club. This exercise shows how the rather sociologically oriented masculinity studies could benefit from this kind of analysis and deconstructs the ‘masculinity in crisis’ discourse at the same time...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses a diagnostic framework to identify institutional {{processes in the}} creation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for agricultural innovation. The diagnostic framework proposed here combines a conceptualisation of institutions with a conceptualisation of technology. We argue that a <b>performative</b> <b>notion</b> of institutions provides a better tool for institutional diagnostics than the common understanding of institutions as 'rules of the game'. The paper furthermore proposes to conceptualise technology as affordance, in contrast to a more common understanding of technology as an input. We explore the value of our diagnostic framework by analysing the literature on PPPs for agricultural innovation and unpublished data from a PPP initiative for smallholder sorghum production, based on an agreement between Uganda's National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) and Nile Breweries Limited (NBL). In the discussion and conclusion section we evaluate the benefits of our diagnostic framework and discuss how the empirical issues it brings forward create important lessons for analysis of innovation for African smallholder farming and institutional diagnostics more generally. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{development}} of the notion of performativity. This exploration is used to develop and apply a diffractive methodology to media texts in order to assess the usefulness of the diffractive method in its application to Media Studies. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a review of literature on various interpretations of the <b>performative</b> <b>notion</b> is conducted. In the second part of this thesis, elements of these interpretations are brought together to construct a diffractive methdological framework. This diffractive methodology is then tested on the work of two authors of media texts, the magazine Adbusters and the street artist Banksy, in order to guage its effectiveness when applied to texts which incorporate elements of diffraction. In the third part of this thesis, the dffractive methodology is applied to news media outlets’ interpretations of the media event The Moment of Truth, a press conference aimed at revealing the truth to the public about government mass surveillance in New Zealand. The fourth part of this thesis assesses how effective the diffractive methodology was in this application, and the questions that arise from the use of this method. Whilst there are some concerns about the responsible use of the method by researchers, the application of a diffractive methodology to these media texts was successful in creating new readings and insights, and provides an alternative to traditional methods within media studies...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a {{reflection}} about how the so-called "gender trouble" {{can contribute to the}} researches in the Brazilian Physical Education. To accomplish such a task, there was introduced a dialogue among epistemological definitions that permeate this field of study. In conclusion, the essay shows {{that it is possible to}} work with <b>performative</b> <b>notions</b> and also to use the binomial sex / gender, especially when working with certain objects of research in the area of Physical Education...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} some key areas that {{contribute}} to an extended vocabulary for ceramics {{with regards to the}} employment of clay and in particular its juxtaposition with the <b>performative</b> ‘other’. The <b>notion</b> of the <b>performative</b> ‘other’ references the developing spectacle of ‘non-ceramic’ medium employed by artists working within the ceramics field and one that is often evidenced, although not exclusively, through video, photography, digital-media and performance. These mediums and methods will be discussed through examples and theories aligned to art practice within the ceramics discourse...|$|R
40|$|Amidst {{the trends}} of confessional {{narratives}} and theories of gender performativity that took {{root in the}} 90 s, the feminist maxim "the personal is political" is no longer sufficient {{to account for the}} complexities of women's lives transformed into life-stories and live performances. Given the push to recover silenced women, and the more complex discourse that governs both feminist art and criticism, {{it is not surprising that}} feminist life-writing has found many of its richest realizations in performance. On the feminist stage, history, narrative, bodies, voice, identity and community all converge in three related dramatic forms that we can group under the heading of "life-writing": autobiographical performance, biographical plays and staged oral histories. 	In this study, I take a look at these forms and argue that each one offers both theoretical obstacles and political possibilities to the feminist playwrights and performers who use them. By placing narratives of real lives within the context of performance, these artists point out the degree to which gender, identity, and history are socially constructed performances and are subject to the manipulations of power. And by highlighting the gender biases embedded in these <b>performative</b> <b>notions,</b> they are then able to revise and reconstruct them within a new framework, one that resists hegemonic power and acknowledges difference. 	In three chapters, I examine how feminist playwrights and performers use body, voice, community and history to create potent rhetoric out of women's life narratives. In the chapter on autobiographical performance, I argue that narratives of the self in performance deconstruct notions of selfhood as a way of avoiding essentialism and establishing female agency. At the same time, however, these narratives rely on historical referentiality and an essentialism of the self to reinforce their efficacy. The chapter on biographical drama asserts that feminist playwrights respond to the imperative to reclaim lost feminist lives, but must do so in ways that subvert the objectifying impulses of life writing. Finally, the oral history chapter shows that the communal subjectivity established in these plays generates feminist notions of community in its performance, even as it advocates for such community among its audiences...|$|R
40|$|What {{interested}} me most during the production [of Electric Dress] {{was an unusual}} beauty created by the light bulbs arranged on the dresses when the blinking device was set in rotation, powered by a motor. It was a beauty {{that could not be}} made by human hands. ” Atsuko Tanaka, 1957 Hommage à Atsuko Tanaka is a talk by art historian and independent curator Silvia Eiblmayr (Vienna) on the work of the seminal Japanese artist Atsuko Tanaka (1932 – 2005). The presentation with discussion traces Tanaka’s personality and life {{as one of the most}} influential artists of the avant-garde group Gutai Art Association, commonly known as “Gutai” (which means concrete). Hommage particularly focuses on the subject of a conceptual, space related, <b>performative</b> <b>notion</b> of painting based on the inclusion of everyday materials, and further traces the multi-facetted gaze, clothing and the stage, embedded in the artist’s work. In 2002 Eiblmayr organised Atsuko Tanaka, Works from the Gutai-Period at Galerie im Taxispalais Innsbruck, the first solo exhibition of the artist in a public institution outside Japan. On this occasion Eiblmayr travelled to Japan to meet Tanaka in her studio in the province of Nara. The gathered material — photographs and oral histories — form one part of the talk illuminating the continuing significance and scale of the artist’s work, and by doing so, suggesting Tanaka as a central, yet in the Western context marginally received figure. References to the publication ‘Atsuko Tanaka’ (2002) with essays by Eiblmayr and Mizuho Kato accompany these excursions...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{will focus}} on the phenomenological notion of sense which Husserl calls in Ideen I noematic sense. My reading of Ideen I is based on the {{interpretation}} of noema as “object as it is intended”. This notion is developed from “filling sense” in LU. Similar to the Russellian “knowledge by acquaintance”, Husserl means by this notion the direct intuitive acquaintance with an intentional object. However, unlike Russell, Husserl doesn’t restrict this notion to sense data, but extend it to the acquaintance with the perspective way of appearance of an intentional object (Erscheinungsweise, Abschattungen). This is because, unlike Frege, Husserl includes not only intension (Materie), but also illocutionary force (Aktqualität) into his notion of sense (LU, 6. Untersuchung, p. 617). This <b>performative</b> <b>notion</b> of sense requires him to take account of the acquaintance with the background of speech acts as a constitutive part of the broadest notion of sense (Ideen I, p. 233 f., 322). If a conjecture e. g. about the back side of a cube: “the back side must be a square”, changes through a perception into a claim about it: “this side is indeed a square”, the change of the illocutionary forces, that is, the “filling sense” of the perception is expressed not by intentional materials (side, square etc.), but by indexicals, modal verbs or tenses, which are understood in a direct acquaintance with the perspective appearance of the cube. Thus, “the changing noematic way of appearance of the whole object as sense” (Husserliana vol. XI, p. 333) is the background or horizon, in implicit acquaintance with which illocutionary forces (Aktqualität in LU, noetischer Charakter in Ideen I) of propositional attitudes towards perceptual objects can be understood...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with two central issues: analysis of theory-practice gaps in aesthetic theories applied to avant-garde musics, and problems of visibility and respect in theorizing across cultures. In the first chapter, I examine a case study, John Coltrane's successive improvisations on "My Favorite Things," under two different theories {{in order to show}} how theories shape our view of the practices we are trying to explain. In the second chapter, I take up Coltrane's practices and their relations to theories once again but, in a reversal of the previous chapter's focus, I show how examining theories through practices can reveal these theory-practice gaps and problematic assumptions. I move, from there, to an analysis, informed by feminist standpoint epistemology, {{of the extent to which}} political values influence our theory choices and thus help construct our metaphysical views. Out of this discussion, my third chapter argues that attempts to universalize a culturally-situated notion of 'the musical work' (one drawn from Western classical music) do violence to works and artists situated in other cultural traditions. Thus I construct an alternative view of the musical work that I call 'contextualized nominalism' which has the merit of being sensitive to these issues of cultural situation. The fourth chapter explores connections between avant-garde jazz practices and oppositional politics which can be made visible when performances of works are accorded priority over composition. Here I construct a <b>performative</b> <b>notion</b> of community which, in addition to making the most sense of improvisational musical practices, can also be the ground of an 'ethos of improvisation' extendable into other social contexts. Finally I turn to the need for a pluralistic framework in aesthetic evaluation of polycultural artistic processes and products, through a critical examination of universal notions of aesthetic value. I argue, from this and all of the preceding chapters, that where we cross cultures, or mix them, in aesthetic evaluations, we must do so as respectful pluralists and within a pluralist framework...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to reflect {{critically}} on qualitative research education in doctoral management programs. The central idea is to offer a qualitative research education model supported by the concept of <b>performative</b> judgment. The <b>notion</b> of <b>performative</b> judgment draws upon Aristotle’s virtues of thought via Strati’s idea of sensible knowledge. The proposal focuses on a theoretical understanding of qualitative research education rather than prescribing pedagogical techniques or steps. The performative judgment education model is therefore open-ended and flexible and may fit in different doctoral program settings. It also helps to reveal {{the differences between the}} notions of training and education, showing how they can work together in the educational process...|$|R
40|$|As a {{national}} pageant, Miss Samoa {{operates as a}} <b>performative</b> space where <b>notions</b> of gender, politics, and culture are negotiated and transformed. In this thesis, I examine how these concepts operate on an individual, local, and transnational level. Plus, the shifting landscape of Samoa—particularly the growth of tourism and transnational migration— heightens the stakes {{that are involved in}} the pageant. I explore these issues by drawing upon a synthesis of primary and secondary research data. During my fieldwork in Samoa, I conducted a series of twelve interviews and two small surveys. I primarily selected my responses through snowball sampling and conducted my research between September and November of 2012. Drawing upon my data collection and existing sociological theory, this thesis explores the intersections and complexities that are inherent within the pageant. Although my analysis focuses primarily on historical and contemporary frameworks, I also argue {{that there needs to be}} a consideration for the future. Ultimately, my research can potentially be used to contribute to the development of the Miss Samoa pageant to ensure its potential efficacy...|$|R
40|$|This {{exposition}} documents {{several years}} of process-driven practice-as-research. The work explores themes of womanhood, embodiment, and autobiography. Throughout the exposition I argue that the embodiment of process is key to understanding practice-as-research. I propose that practice-as-research projects should not be driven with a ‘final output’ in mind. Instead, the practice of practice-as-research should be reconsidered throughout its development; it should use its potential for liminality. It is the demonstration of a ‘living process’; living in process. This exposition explores {{ways in which we}} live in process through a presentation of text, visual essays, and short film and video pieces. The work develops from creative artefacts and critical text into a piece of responsive writing, 'A Play of Characters'. This playtext reconsiders some of the influences in the work and explores the imagery of the whole project in a <b>performative</b> context. The <b>notion</b> of embodiment and a 'living body of work' is developed further through the use of metaphor, in particular the metaphor of the mollusc. I use this to consider how practice evolves alongside process, 'housing' both the work and the process in both material form (the shell) and trace (the snail trail). Different combinations of this work have been presented as performance installations, both at the University of Portsmouth, as part of my PhD examination in 2010, and at the University of Lincoln, as part of the Gnarlfest in 2014. However, by the very nature of 'living in process' this is a work that continues to evolve and 'live' in different forms. The purpose of this exposition is to explore the work in an accessible online form – one that offers alternative platforms and sequences, creating different possibilities and readings of the practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{takes its}} cue from Stronach and MacLure (1997) {{and hopes to}} be more problem-generating than problem-solving. We {{do not want to}} set down a ‘how to do {{collaborative}} research’, but instead explore the methodological and political complexities of doing collaborative research with industry partners. In doing this we want {{to draw attention to the}} uncertainties and messy ‘business’ of collaborative research. We are particularly interested in exploring the political tensions around the co-production of knowledge and we ask ‘how might we use research methodologies that incorporate uncertainty and disruption while at the same time remaining credible and legitimate to our research partners and academics?’ We recognise that a ‘methodology of disappointment’, where the ‘comforts of certainty’ are abandoned (Stronach & MacLure, 1997), may not have the same appeal to our industry partners as it does within our research team. And not always do academics enjoy uncertainty! We explore these themes and questions by taking a reflexive look at our own research practice in a collaborative research project that is currently underway in Australia. Government views on the relationship between research and economic activity are driving changes in research funding arrangements in Australia (Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson MP, 2002). The increase in collaborative research partnerships between universities and industry, as well as an increasing pressure on universities to view their work in commercial terms are evidence of these changes. In these performative times we are told we need to be ‘entrepreneurs’ (Gallagher, 2000) and the commodification of education requires that researchers learn how to play a new game. But does playing the game mean we need to automatically ‘tow the corporate line’ in collaborative partnerships with industry? Stronach and MacLure (1997) suggest that ‘it may be possible to envisage new concepts and practices of research that do not simply surrender to…the general demands of performativity’ (Stronach & MacLure, 1997, p. 100). Luke (1995) writes about a ‘pragmatic politics of the postmodern’ and recommends that it is time to start ‘getting our hands dirty’. Scheeres & Solomon (2000) point out that one way of doing this is to recognise the research methodology as ‘a site of contention’ where a number of different positions can be taken up by researchers. We are interested in this paper in exploring the ways knowledge is being co-produced in the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project and the contested nature of this knowledge production. We adopt an understanding of power, where we are more interested in the way power relations have been negotiated in the project and the spaces this has opened up, rather than assuming that industry is all-powerful. But before exploring the ‘sites of struggle’ of the project and the spaces that have been opened up, we take a closer look at collaborations in the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project. The ‘Uncovering Learning’ project involves many layers of collaborative partnerships. The project is a three-year Australian Research Council funded project which is part of the strategic partnerships with industry – research and training (SPIRT) program. The project involves a research partnership between the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) and the Department of Education and Training (DET), a state government department. DET and UTS are working collaboratively to explore the significance of everyday learning at work. The workplace being studied is TAFE NSW, the state government provider of vocational education and training in NSW. But rather than focusing on TAFE as an educational institution our interest in this project is on TAFE as a workplace. TAFE is a large organisation and employs approximately 35, 000 people in NSW. As well as the partnership between UTS and DET, the research team present as another layer of collaboration. The research team could be described as a ‘cross-boundary’ group, as members come from both inside and outside of TAFE, as well as across various disciplines including adult education, applied linguistics, psychology and organisational behaviour. The team is made up of two senior researchers from UTS, a DET representative who works in the Professional Development Network at TAFE, a research associate and a doctoral student. The research interests of the team members vary and this has contributed to the opening up of project questions and connections beyond the focus of just one discipline. In this sense, we (the research team) could be thought of as the embodiment of the theoretical and knowledge worlds we are studying in the project. The research team is working collaboratively with four workgroups in TAFE and this illustrates yet another layer of collaboration. The four workgroups that we are working with in the project come from diverse occupational areas and diverse hierarchical levels across two institutes in TAFE. One group are senior level managers in an institute, another are trade teachers, another group works in a human resources unit performing mainly administrative functions and the final group provide business related training in the workplace. While these are the most obvious collaborations, there are many other layers of collaboration connected with the project. For example collaborations between the research team and: the Faculty of Education at UTS; the Research Office; and the Australian Research Council. There are also layers within layers of collaboration, for example the two senior researchers in the project are the academic supervisors of the PhD student. The contemporary research context and the interrelated layering and multiplicities associated with collaborative partnerships begin to ‘flag’ the political complexities of doing collaborative research. These are foregrounded when we ask: What’s in it for UTS? What’s in it for TAFE? What are the interests of each of the members of the research team? What do the Professional Development Network want from this? What are the interests of each of the workgroup members who are collaborating on the project? The ‘political’ refers to both the macro politics of government policy and the local politics of research teams and workgroups and the alignments between these. We will explore the political complexities of collaborative partnerships further by focusing on some of the ‘sites of struggle’ in the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project. There is pressure on researchers to produce output-driven knowledge in the contemporary research context (Usher, 2000). The research contract between UTS and DET provides an example of the type of output-driven knowledge that is required in partnership arrangements. For example, the contract states that UTS will provide their industry partner with the following research outcomes: •	Improved recognition of the learning to be found in the organisation, to the benefit of both the organisation and individual employees. •	Improved understanding by key personnel in the organisations of the ways in which organisational culture and procedures encourage or inhibit learning, and the issues which need to be resolved in developing the learning organisation. •	Improved learning systems and learning strategies in the organisation that will more effectively facilitate learning embedded in practice. But rather than providing just a straight ‘outcomes’ focus for the project we have attempted to reconcile the performative contractual obligations with our own research interests and desires. In this sense, the methodology of the project becomes a ‘site of struggle’. Various ‘openings’ have been created in the project to move it beyond a performative focus. One way we have done this is by disrupting conventional educational discourses of learning. Stronach and MacLure suggest that rather than providing certainty through educational research that a better strategy might be ‘…to see how far it can get by failing to deliver simple truths’ (1997, p. 6). While they are referring to commissioned research for the development of educational policy by government, we can see that this is also a useful way for approaching industry contracted research in the field of workplace learning. While contemporary adult learning discourses such as lifelong learning and situated learning have contributed to breaking down the old binaries between work and learning, these discourses do not challenge <b>performative</b> <b>notions</b> of what counts as learning in organisations. We are interested in mobilising the meanings of ‘learning’ and opening up different ways of thinking about learning at work. The above discussion suggests a unified purpose within the research team, however, the cross-boundary nature of the research team has meant a multiplicity of interests and desires. We have different ideas on what the project should be doing and what we want out of the project. But rather than adopting a research methodology based on consensus, with unified research goals and objectives, we have tried to open-up space in the project for a multiplicity of voices, identities, meanings and narratives (Rooney, Boud, Harman, Leontios, & Solomon, 2003). Having said this, we have still followed the established model of research where researchers: enter the workplace, collect data, analyse the data, and report the findings to our research partner, academic communities and other relevant agencies. But within this structure we have disrupted and made space for different voices. For example there have been different ways of analysing and making sense of the data we have collected. One version adopted an interpretive approach and examined the ‘who we learn from at work’ (Boud & Middleton). Another focused on the discourses of learning and explored the ‘naming of learning at work’ (Boud & Solomon, 2003). Still others used a communities of practice framework (Leontios, Boud, Harman, & Rooney, 2003). There are many examples from the project of the contested nature of co-produced knowledge. Some of these are referred to in other papers from the project (Rooney et al., 2003; Solomon, Boud, Leontios, & Staron, 2001) while many just do not get written up. Some project stories remain unwritten and only circulate in oral accounts. This is yet another instance of negotiating the political, where some things just can’t be written. While wanting to disrupt and challenge, there is also the recognition that the members of the research team have ‘business’ interests. For example, the academics are in the business of research where there is a need for ongoing contracts with industry partners, and this is less likely when you are using a ‘methodology of disappointment’! The tensions around ‘disrupting’, ‘contesting’ and ‘resisting closure’ in the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project were foregrounded in the project during feedback sessions with the workgroups. After conducting initial interviews with members from each of the workgroups, feedback sessions were organised to move the project into its second stage, where we would be working with each of the workgroups on a ‘learning’ project. A document was prepared which we presented to the workgroups, not as a document of ‘facts’, but more as a trigger for conversations about their learning. In this sense it was a document that raised questions rather than provide simple truths. It was around this time that dissatisfaction was expressed by some of the workgroups about the project. They felt it was vague and lacked direction. The hybridity and looseness of the project needed to be ‘tightened up’ for us to establish legitimacy with the workgroups. We made a strategic decision to present a coherent story to each of the workgroups in an effort to seduce. It is important to recognise that when we talk about collaborative partnerships as sites of struggle it is not as simple as drawing an academy/industry divide. Further complexity is added when we take into consideration that one of the ‘we’ writing this paper is also an employee of the partner organisation and representative of the industry partner on the research team. There are struggles around managing the outcomes focus required by your employer while not wanting to restrict the ‘intellectual freedom’ of project team members. Overall, our reflexive tales point to the political nature of collaborative research. Collaborative partnerships connect multiple stakeholders with different accountabilities. The ‘multiplicities’ within collaborative research produce messiness and uncertainty, but with this ‘messiness’ there is also regulation. This account of the project draws our attention to the tensions around ‘messiness’, hybrid methodologies and regulation, and these tensions provide yet another layer of political complexity. While the messy research of our collaborative partnership may produce discomfort, for both industry partners and academics, we suggest they are productive. Our hybrid methodology/s have enabled the opening-up of spaces in the research project and the production of knowledge about learning, and researching learning at work. Our reflexivity has enabled us to explore the tensions around co-producing knowledge. We have found these practices ‘useful’ in our performative research context...|$|R
