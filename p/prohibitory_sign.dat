5000|$|Sometimes {{when there}} are five kernel panics within three minutes of the first one, the Mac will display a <b>prohibitory</b> <b>sign</b> for 30 seconds, and then shut down (this {{is known as a}} [...] "recurring kernel panic").|$|E
50|$|Direction signs {{can also}} be used in {{conjunction}} with other types of sign: for example, in the United Kingdom, if a warning or <b>prohibitory</b> <b>sign</b> appears on a direction sign, it means that the route indicated by the sign contains the hazard or prohibition sign posted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> are {{round with}} white {{backgrounds}} and red borders.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> {{regulate}} {{the use of}} the road based on movement, classes of vehicles, or other restrictions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> in Indonesia are {{circular}} {{and have}} a red border with diagonal bars except for stop, yield, and level crossing signs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> are {{circular}} {{with white}} backgrounds and red borders, except the no parking and no standing signs {{which have a}} blue background instead of white.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> (e.g. [...] "No left turn") {{take the}} form of a black-on-white symbol inside a red-bordered circle, {{sometimes}} with the addition of a red slash through the symbol.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used}} to {{prohibit}} certain types of manoeuvres or some types of traffic. The No symbol surrounding a pictogram is used to indicate {{something that is not}} permitted.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> use a red {{circle with}} a slash. Restrictive signs {{typically}} use a red circle, as in Europe. Some may be {{seated on a}} rectangular white background.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> are {{round with}} yellow {{backgrounds}} and red borders, except the international standard stop sign {{that is an}} octagon with red background and white border and the no parking and no standing signs that have a blue background instead of yellow.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> (e.g. [...] "No left turn") {{take the}} form of a black-on-white symbol inside a red-bordered circle, {{sometimes}} with the addition of a red slash through the symbol.Mandatory signs (e.g. [...] "Turn right only") bear a white symbol on a blue disk.|$|R
5000|$|Some Latin American {{countries}} use red-bordered circular signs, in {{the same}} style as regulatory signs. These are [...] "Type B Mandatory Signs" [...] as prescribed by the Vienna Convention. In cases relating to particular types of vehicle traffic (e.g. buses), these signs are identical to some European <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mandatory {{signs are}} road signs {{which are used}} to set the {{obligations}} of all traffic which use a specific area of road. Unlike <b>prohibitory</b> or restrictive <b>signs,</b> mandatory signs tell traffic what it must do, rather than must not do. Most mandatory road signs are circular, may use white symbols on a blue background with white border or black symbols on a white background with a red border, although the latter is also associated with <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Austrian {{warning and}} <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> have a white {{background}} framed by red edges {{like most of}} the European road signs.However Austria has a different No through road (dead end) - sign as most of the European countries. The sign seems to be a white inverted T and has no red stripe.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prohibitory</b> <b>signs,</b> which {{generally}} tell drivers {{what they must}} not do, are mostly circular and have a red border. The red ring indicates the prohibition; diagonal bars are used only on signs which prohibit a specific manoeuvre, i.e. banned left or right turns and U-turns, or a certain class of vehicle, i.e. lorries.|$|R

50|$|Around 1930 some warning <b>signs</b> and <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> {{looking like}} today's signs with yellow {{background}} were introduced. The direction indication signs were however yellow with black text. Around 1965, {{there was a}} reform where the colour of those were changed to dark blue with white text. Around 1980, Sweden followed the Vienna convention rule that motorways should have a different colour, so green was introduced for them, and medium blue for ordinary roads.|$|R

As driving over the speed limit is often the major cause of accidents, detecting this group of <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> may reduce this danger. This paper presents an approach to detecting speed limit signs at night mode which is based on Multi-Scale Retinex Color Restoration and Hough Transform. Experiment to check the strength of this approach shows that approximately 96. 6 % of the <b>prohibitory</b> traffic <b>signs</b> invoked for this test were successfully detected. This test was carried out at dark mode images from different country...|$|R
50|$|The {{traffic sign}} {{are divided into}} three classes; circles gives orders, triangles warns of {{possible}} dangers and rectangles gives information. Different colours are use within these shapes; blue circles are mandatory signs, it give positive instructions, while red circles are <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs,</b> it give negative instructions. Blue rectangles give general information while green rectangles are use for direction sign on main roads. However, there are two exception for these shapes and colour rules; that is the octagonal Stop sign and the inverted red triangle Give way sign.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} cascade method for fast and {{accurate}} traffic sign detection. The main {{feature of the}} method is that mid-level saliency test is used to efficiently and reliably eliminate background windows. Fast feature extraction is adopted in the subsequent stages for rejecting more negatives. Combining with neighbor scales awareness in window search, the proposed method runs at 3 ~ 5 fps for high resolution (1360 x 800) images, 2 ~ 7 {{times as fast as}} most state-of-the-art methods. Compared with them, the proposed method yields competitive performance on <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> while sacrifices performance moderately on danger and mandatory signs. © 2015 IEEE...|$|R

60|$|A fitting and {{interesting}} finish to {{an examination of}} the tedious and laborious and costly processes whereby the diamonds are gotten out of the deeps of the earth and freed from the base stuffs which imprison them is the visit to the De Beers offices in the town of Kimberley, where the result of each day's mining is brought every day, and, weighed, assorted, valued, and deposited in safes against shipping-day. An unknown and unaccredited person cannot get into that place; and it seemed apparent from the generous supply of warning and protective and <b>prohibitory</b> <b>signs</b> that were posted all about, that not even the known and accredited can steal diamonds there without inconvenience.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} MUTCD <b>prohibitory</b> and restrictive <b>signs</b> were text-only (i.e. NO LEFT TURN). Some {{of these}} signs {{continue to be}} used in the US.|$|R
50|$|Mandatory {{signs are}} used to set the {{obligations}} of all traffic which use a specific area of road. Unlike <b>prohibitory</b> or restrictive <b>signs,</b> mandatory signs tell traffic what it must do, rather than must not do.|$|R
5000|$|Signs {{are posted}} showing which {{direction}} the vehicles can move in: commonly an upward arrow, or on a T junction where {{the main road}} is one-way, an arrow {{to the left or}} right. At {{the end of the street}} through which vehicles may not enter, a <b>prohibitory</b> traffic <b>sign</b> [...] "Do Not Enter", [...] "Wrong Way", or [...] "No Entry" [...] sign is posted, e.g. with that text, or a round red sign with a white horizontal bar. Sometimes one portion of a street is one-way, another portion two-way. An advantage of one-way streets is that drivers do not have to watch for vehicles coming in the opposite direction on this type of street.|$|R
50|$|Like many South American countries, {{the road}} signs in Brazil are {{strongly}} {{based on the}} US MUTCD standard, but with text in Portuguese. The regulatory, <b>prohibitory</b> and mandatory <b>signs</b> are all of them white circular with red borders, {{with the exception of}} the stop and the yield sign. The warning signs are yellow diamonds (or orange when used on road works). Units are expressed in compliance with the International System of Units.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a pre-detection algorithm dedicated to French danger-warning and <b>prohibitory</b> road <b>signs.</b> The proposed method combines color, shape, location and symmetry features to select among large image databases, a small subset of pictures that probably contain road signs. We report {{the results of}} a systematic experimental assessment that we performed on five image databases, comprised of more than 26, 000 images, covering 176 km and containing 371 traffic signs, among which a non-negligible amount (about 5 % in average) is damaged. The experiments show that about 10 % images of the sequences are selected and more than 87 % traffic signs are detected. The missed objects always correspond to dirty, worn-out or badly oriented signs that would be difficult to detect even for a human operator...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to outline the issue of paternalistic legal {{regulations}} being expressed through means of visual communication of law, such as often used in legal realm “optical signs, which are not expressions of ethnic written language”, that is, through traffic signs. Main focus is placed on one particular <b>prohibitory</b> traffic <b>sign,</b> “no entry” sign, which often is placed at the exit ends of one-way streets to determine traffic direction. On the one hand, this analysis can be treated as a specific attempt to supplement the debate on legal paternalism. Namely, it stresses the issue of characteristic features of danger, risk of harm justifying given legal regulation, which restricts its addressees’ liberty, whether to “protect ( [...] .) from self-inflicted harm or ( [...] .) to guide them ( [...] .) toward their own good”. It is proposed to distinguish two kinds of danger underlying paternalistic regulations: so-called “natural” danger and so-called “conventionally-made” danger. Apart from this, the problem of visual communication through traffic signs is outlined...|$|R

This system is based on extracting the speed limit sign from the traffic scene by Circular Hough Transform (CHT) with the aid of colour and non-colour information of the traffic sign. The digits of the speed limit sign are then extracted and classified using SVM classifier which is trained for this purpose. In general, the system detects the <b>prohibitory</b> traffic <b>sign</b> in the first place, specifies whether the detected sign is a speed limit sign, and then determines the allowed speed in case the detected sign is a speed limit sign. The SVM classifier was trained with 270 images which were collected in different light conditions. To check the robustness of this system, it was tested against 210 images which contain 213 speed limit traffic sign and 288 Non- Speed limit signs. It was found that the accuracy of recognition was 98 % which indicates clearly the high robustness targeted by this system. Publishe...|$|R
40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} in the International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision, ICIEV 2014; Dhaka; Bangladesh; 23 May 2014 through 24 May 2014 [© 2014 IEEE] The conference paper's definite version is available at: [URL] proper identification of the traffic signs can ensure driving safety and can play {{a very important role}} in reducing the number of road accidents significantly. This paper represents a uniform way to detect the speed limit traffic signs and to confirm it by recognizing the sign's speed number. In this system, firstly the red color objects are segmented from an image using LVQ. Secondly, detected circular part is extracted from the color segmented image using bounding box and then Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG) is used to collect the feature of the extracted part of circular object and finally SVM classifier is applied to train the HOG features of each speed no. into their corresponding classes. In general, the system detects the <b>prohibitory</b> traffic <b>sign</b> in the first place, specifies whether the detected sign is a speed limit sign, and then determines the allowed speed in case the detected sign is a speed limit sign. The SVM classifier was trained with 200 images which were collected in different light conditions. To check the robustness of this system, it was tested against 381 images which contain 361 Speed Limit traffic sign and 30 Non- Speed Limit signs. It was found that the accuracy of recognition was 92. 75 % which indicates clearly the high robustness targeted by this system. Publishe...|$|R
