The downside of lack of elevator control is a tendency for the airplane to phugoid. To damp the <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation</b> naturally, the planes are designed with high drag which reduces flight performance and flying time.

40|$|Computer and manned flight {{simulator}} {{studies of the}} effect of thunderstorm wind shear on the excitation of <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillations</b> of commercial-type aircraft are reported. Previous studies have suggested that the characteristic scale of thunderstorm wind shear drives commercial-type aircraft at the critical phugoid frequency. To further investigate this phenomenon, aircraft performance in a hypothetical sinusoidal wind shear was investigated. Sinusoidal winds at the phugoid frequency and with frequencies above and below this value were studied both analytically and in manned {{flight simulator}}s. Results indicate that excessive oscillations in flight path amplitude predicted by computer analyses were not fully collaborated by the manned flight simulator studies. Some resolution of this problem is given and additional research necessary to further identify the discrepancies between the flight simulator and the computer analysis is outlined...|$|R
5000|$|The pilot, Captain Dennis [...] "Bud" [...] Traynor, and copilot, Captain Tilford Harp, {{attempted}} {{to regain control}} of the airplane, and to perform a 180 degree turn in order to return to Tan Son Nhut. The aircraft began to exhibit <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillations,</b> but the crew countered them and maintained a controlled descent of about 250 to 260 kn. They were able to bring the plane to 4000 ft and begin the approach to Tan Son Nhut's runway 25L. While turning on final approach, the plane's descent rate suddenly began to increase rapidly. The crew increased power to the engines in an attempt to arrest the descent, but despite their efforts, the plane touched down at 4:45 p.m. in a rice paddy, and skidded for {{a quarter of a mile}} (400 m), became airborne again for another half-mile (800 m), crossing the Saigon River, then hit a dike and broke up into four pieces. The fuel caught fire and some of the wreckage was set ablaze.|$|R
5000|$|The {{longer period}} mode, called the [...] "phugoid mode" [...] {{is the one}} {{in which there is a}} large-amplitude {{variation}} of air-speed, pitch angle, and altitude, but almost no angle-of-attack variation. The <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation</b> is really a slow interchange of kinetic energy (velocity) and potential energy (height) about some equilibrium energy level as the aircraft attempts to re-establish the equilibrium level-flight condition from which it had been disturbed. The motion is so slow that the effects of inertia forces and damping forces are very low. Although the damping is very weak, the period is so long that the pilot usually corrects for this motion without being aware that the oscillation even exists. Typically the period is 20-60 seconds. This oscillation can generally be controlled by the pilot.|$|E
50|$|The seed or samara of {{this species}} is unusual in having two flat bracts {{extending}} {{either side of the}} seed to form a wing-like shape with the seed embedded along one long edge and the wings angled slightly back from it. As the seed ripens the wings dry and the long edge furthest from the seed curls slightly upwards. When ripe, the seed drops off and its aerodynamic form allows it to glide away from the tree. The wing spans some 13 cm and can glide for great distances. The seed moves through the air like a butterfly in flight - it gains height, stalls, dips and accelerates, once again producing lift, a process termed <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation.</b> In the past it was often found on the decks of ships at sea.|$|E
50|$|Bryan {{showed that}} the {{stability}} characteristics of airplanes could be separated into longitudinal and lateral groups with the corresponding motions called modes of motion. These modes of motion were either aperiodic, {{which means that the}} airplane steadily approaches or diverges from a trimmed condition, or oscillatory, which means that the airplane oscillates about the trim condition. The longitudinal modes of a statically stable airplane following a disturbance were shown to consist of a long-period oscillation called the <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation,</b> usually with a period in seconds about one-quarter of the airspeed in miles per hour and a short-period oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The lateral motion had three modes of motion: an aperiodic mode called the spiral mode that could be a divergence or subsidence, a heavily damped aperiodic mode called the roll subsidence, and a short-period oscillation, usually poorly damped, called the Dutch roll mode.|$|E
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with the YF- 12 airplane to examine the airplane's longitudinal characteristics at a Mach number of approximately 2. 9. <b>Phugoid</b> <b>oscillations</b> as well as short period pulses were analyzed with the variable geometry engine inlets in the fixed and the automatic configurations. Stability and control derivatives for the velocity and altitude degrees of freedom and the standard short period derivatives were obtained. Inlet bypass door position was successfully used to represent the total inlet system, {{and the effect of}} the inlets on the velocity and altitude derivatives was determined. The phugoid mode of the basic airplane (fixed inlet configuration) had neutral damping, and the height mode was stable. With the addition of the inlets in the automatic configuration, the phugoid mode was slightly divergent and the height mode was divergent with a time to double amplitude of about 114 seconds. The results of the derivative estimation indicated that the change in the height mode characteristics was primarily the result of the change in the longitudinal force derivative with respect to velocity...|$|R
40|$|When {{one or more}} {{main engines}} fail during ascent, the flight crew of the Space Shuttle must make several {{critical}} decisions and accurately perform a series of abort procedures. One {{of the most important}} decisions for many aborts is the selection ofa landing site. Several factors influence the ability to reach a landing site, including the spacecraft point of atmospheric entry, the energy state at atmospheric entry, the vehicle glide capability from that energy state, and whether one or more suitable landing sites are within the glide capability. Energy assessment is further {{complicated by the fact that}} <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillations</b> in total energy influence glide capability. Once the glide capability is known, the crew must select the "best" site option based upon glide capability and landing site conditions and facilities. Since most of these factors cannot currently be assessed by the crew in flight, extensive planning is required prior to each mission to script a variety of procedures based upon spacecraft velocity at the point of engine failure (or failures). The results of this preflight planning are expressed in tables and diagrams on mission-specific cockpit checklists. Crew checklist procedures involve leafing through several pages of instructions and navigating a decision tree for site selection and flight procedures - all during a time critical abort situation. With the advent of the Cockpit Avionics Upgrade (CAU), the Shuttle will have increased on-board computational power to help alleviate crew workload during aborts and provide valuable situational awareness during nominal operations. One application baselined for the CAU computers is Shuttle Abort Flight Management (SAFM), whose requirements have been designed and prototyped. The SAFM application includes powered and glided flight algorithms. This paper describes the glided flight algorithm which is dispatched by SAFM to determine the vehicle glide capability and make recommendations to the crew for site selection as well as to monitor glide capability while in route to the selected site. Background is provided on Shuttle entry guidance as well as the various types of Shuttle aborts. SAFM entry requirements and cockpit disp lays are discussed briefly to provide background for Glided Flight algorithm design considerations. The central principal of the Glided Flight algorithm is the use of energy-over-weight (EOW) curves to determine range and crossrange boundaries. The major challenges of this technique are exo-atmospheric flight, and <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillations</b> in energy. During exo-atmospheric flight, energy is constant, so vehicle EOW is not sufficient to determine glide capability. The paper describes how the exo-atmospheric problem is solved by propagating the vehicle state to an "atmospheric pullout" state defined by Shuttle guidance parameters...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{radio-controlled}} aircraft, {{especially the}} toy class models, {{are designed to}} be flown with no movable control surfaces at all. Some model planes are designed this way because it is often cheaper and lighter to control the speed of a motor than it is to provide a moving control surface. Instead, [...] "rudder" [...] control (control over sideslip angle) is provided by differing thrust on two motors, one on each wing. Total power is controlled by increasing or decreasing the power on each motor equally. Usually, the planes only have only these two control channels (total throttle and differential throttle) with no elevator control. Turning a model with differential thrust is equivalent to and just as effective as turning a model with rudder. Lack of elevator control is sometimes problematic if the <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation</b> isn't well-damped leading to unmanageable [...] "porpoising". See [...] "Toy class RC" [...] section.|$|E
50|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} models in general require additional longitudinal and directional stability, resisting sudden changes in pitch and yaw. While it may be possible for a pilot to respond quickly enough to control an unstable aircraft (such as a Wright Flyer), a radio control scale model of the same aircraft would only be flyable with design adjustments such as increased tail surfaces and wing dihedral for stability, or with avionics providing artificial stability. Free flight models need to have both static and dynamic stability. Static stability is the resistance to sudden changes in pitch and yaw already described, and is typically provided by the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces respectively, and by a forward center of gravity. Dynamic stability is the ability to return to straight and level flight without any control input. The three dynamic instability modes are pitch (<b>phugoid)</b> <b>oscillation,</b> spiral and Dutch roll. An aircraft with too large a horizontal tail on a fuselage that is too short may have a phugoid instability with increasing climbs and dives. With free flight models, this usually results in a stall or loop {{at the end of the}} initial climb. Insufficient dihedral and sweep back will generally lead to increasing spiral turn. Too much dihedral or sweepback generally causes Dutch roll. These all depend on the scale, as well as details of the shape and weight distribution. For example, the paper glider shown here is a contest winner when made of a small sheet of paper but will go from side to side in Dutch roll when scaled up even slightly.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the lateral stability of an automatically controlled glide bomb led also to the attempt of clarifying {{the influence of a}} <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation</b> or of any general longitudinal oscillation on the lateral stability of a glide bomb. Under the assumption that its period of oscillation considerably exceeds the rolling and yawing oscillation and that c(sub a) is, at least in sections, practically constant, the result of this test is quite simple. It becomes clear that the influence of the <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation</b> may be replaced by suitable variation of the rolling-yawing moment on a rectilinear flight path instead of the <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation.</b> If the flying weight of the glide bomb of unchanged dimensions is increased, an increase of the flight velocity will be more favorable than an increase of the lift coefficient. The arrangement of the control permits lateral stability to be achieved in every case; a minimum rolling moment due to sideslip proves of great help...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Phugoid mode is a lowly damped, low-frequency oscillatory motion {{representing}} {{vertical translation}} usually related to kinetic and potential energy interchange. MIL-F- 8785 C standard has ruled out qualitative specification requirements on measurement of flying and handling qualities of piloted aircraft. For phugoid mode, these requirements {{lie in the}} value of its damping ratio. Small aircraft is sensitive to atmospheric conditions and poor phugoid mode performance is observed in many unmanned aircraft. This paper discusses the effect of airspeed and altitude to phugoid mode of small, unmanned blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft named Baseline-II E- 2. Baseline-II is a low subsonic, remotely-piloted UAV used to study the behaviour of a BWB-type aircraft. The case presented here is an E- 2 version in which a specifically-designed canard is incorporated as its longitudinal control surface. Five Category B flight cases (airspeeds) per altitude-case, and three altitude cases (low, medium and high) are studied. Model-N dynamic model is introduced here to become the basis of flight simulation. The model is compared to models derived by other authors and approximation equations. The mean of simulating phugoid behaviour is using state-space representation of the aircraft using Matlab SIMULINK. The computations show that Baseline-II E- 2 undamped natural frequency of phugoid mode is inversely-proportional to airspeed and reduces as altitude increases. These have adverse effect on its damping ratio that increases near parabolically when the aircraft flies faster, and reduces when it climbs up. The cause of these trends is looked into in detail and issues concerning Baseline-II E- 2 ’s unsatisfactory and unstable <b>phugoid</b> mode <b>oscillation</b> at low speed are addressed...|$|R

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{relates the}} important {{history of the}} Propulsion Controlled Aircraft project at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center. Spurred {{by a number of}} airplane crashes caused by the loss of hydraulic flight controls, a NASA-industry team lead by Frank W. Burcham and C. Gordon Fullerton developed a way to land an aircraft safely using only engine thrust to control the airplane. In spite of initial skepticism, the team discovered that, by manually manipulating an airplane's thrust, there was adequate control for extended up-and-away flight. However, there was not adequate control precision for safe runway landings because of the small control forces, slow response, and difficulty in damping the airplane phugoid and Dutch roll oscillations. The team therefore conceived, developed, and tested the first computerized Propulsion Controlled Aircraft (PCA) system. The PCA system takes pilot commands, uses feedback from airplane measurements, and computes commands for the thrust of each engine, yielding much more precise control. Pitch rate and velocity feedback damp the <b>phugoid</b> <b>oscillation,</b> while yaw rate feedback damps the Dutch roll motion. The team tested the PCA system in simulators and conducted flight research in F- 15 and MD- 11 airplanes. Later, they developed less sophisticated variants of PCA called PCA Lite and PCA Ultralite to make the system cheaper and therefore more attractive to industry. This monograph tells the PCA story in a non- technical way with emphasis on the human aspects of the engineering and flic,ht-research effort. It thereby supplements the extensive technical literature on PCA and makes the development of this technology accessible to a wide audience...|$|E

The pilots were able to rotate the airplane, with satisfactory precision, to the 15 deg. angle of attack required for lift-off when using either an angle-of-attack instrument or the instrument which combined total-pressure-rate with angle of attack. At least 4 to 6 second-S appeared to be required for rotation to prevent overshoot, particularly with the latter instrument. The flight paths resulting from take-offs with simulated engine failures were relatively smooth and repeatable within a reasonably narrow band when the combined angle-of-attack and total-pressure-rate instrument presentation was used. Some of the flight paths resulting from take-offs with the same engine-failure conditions were very oscillatory when conventional instruments and an angle-of-attack instrument were used.
