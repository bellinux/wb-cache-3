5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the <b>players</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the {{war effort}} had a devastating effect on many rosters. The Red Wings lost nine <b>players</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Maple Leafs lost six to the military. The Rangers lost ten players {{and had to be}} persuaded by the other teams not to suspend operations. In contrast, the Canadiens lost only one key player in Ken Reardon. Young phenom Maurice Richard tried to enlist, but was turned down due to his medical history. Canadiens General Manager Tommy Gorman {{reportedly}} ensured his players obtained jobs in key wartime industries to avoid conscription.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, the 2013–14 {{season was}} plagued by injuries, {{suspensions}} and a high turnover of <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Panthers fell to fourth in the final league table. They once again reached the Challenge Cup final, but were considered outsiders against a Belfast Giants team that comfortably won the league championship and finished 32 points ahead of Nottingham. The Panthers lost the first leg 5–2, a result that left the Giants as strong favourites to lift the cup. However, the Panthers won the second leg 4–1 to level the tie and force overtime. When that finished goalless, goaltender Craig Kowalski saved all three Belfast penalty shots and Petr Kalus scored to give Panthers a 7–6 aggregate victory and a fifth consecutive Challenge Cup.|$|E

5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of <b>players</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> use of artificial turf.|$|E
5|$|During the war it {{had become}} clear that private {{patronage}} {{was no longer a}} practical means of sustaining Britain's musical life; a state body, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – the forerunner of the Arts Council – was established, and given a modest budget for public subsidy. The council made it a condition of sponsoring the LSO that the profit-sharing principle should be abandoned and the players made salaried employees. This renunciation of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by the <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> offered subsidy was declined.|$|E

5|$|In {{a replay}} of the 2007 World Cup final, the German team drew 0–0 with Brazil in the opening game at the 2008 Summer Olympics. They then beat both Nigeria and North Korea {{to advance to the}} quarter-final, where they {{defeated}} Sweden 2–0 after extra time. In the semi-final, Germany again met Brazil. Birgit Prinz scored in the 10th minute, but the German team lost 1–4 after conceding three goals to Brazilian counter-attacks in the second half. They beat Japan 2–0 for the bronze medal, with Fatmire Bajramaj scoring both goals. The third consecutive semi-final loss at the Olympics was seen as a disappointment by both the <b>players</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> German press. The team's overall performance and head coach Silvia Neid were harshly criticised in the media.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the <b>players</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E

The college is actively involved in the development of assistive technology, including student participation in the Tech Novice Cafe, run for members of the public who are not confident in computer use. Two notable devices were developed at RNC; the Mountbatten Brailler, an electronic braille writer, and the T3, a talking tactile device that helped with the reading of maps and diagrams.|$|E

Further differences include the inclusion of Luigi as a playable character and a toned down difficulty. In the United States, Super Mario Advance 2 sold 2.5 million copies and earned $74 million in revenue by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it became the second highest-selling portable game in that country. It received positive reviews from critics upon its release.|$|E
