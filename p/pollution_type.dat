We instead consider consumption related—“tailpipe”—pollution and show that this can reverse a number of core results. For example, we show that the impact of regulation on trade patterns depends on the type of pollution being regulated: while strict smokestack regulation dampens exports of pollution intensive goods, tailpipe regulation may promote these exports. Similarly, we show that <b>pollution</b> <b>type</b> may fundamentally alter the impact of openness on political opposition to environmental regulation: while openness may make dirty industry oppose smokestack regulation more vociferously, it can make industry a less ardent enemy of tailpipe regulation. ...|$|E

40|$|Mass spectrometric {{measurements}} commonly {{yield data}} {{on hundreds of}} variables over thousands of points in time. Refining and synthesizing this raw data into chemical information necessitates the use of advanced, statisticsbased data analytical techniques. In the field of analytical aerosol chemistry, statistical, dimensionality reductive methods have become widespread in the last decade, yet comparable advanced chemometric techniques for data classification and identification remain marginal. Here we present an example of combining data dimensionality reduction (factorization) with exploratory classification (clustering), and show that the results cannot only reproduce and corroborate earlier findings, but also complement and broaden our current perspectives on aerosol chemical classification. We find that applying positive matrix factorization to extract spectral characteristics of the organic component of air pollution plumes, together with an unsupervised clustering algorithm, k -means C C, for classification, reproduces classical organic aerosol speciation schemes. Applying appropriately chosen metrics for spectral dissimilarity along with optimized data weighting, the source-specific pollution characteristics can be statistically resolved even for spectrally very similar aerosol types, such as different combustion-related anthropogenic aerosol species and atmospheric aerosols with similar degree of oxidation. In addition to the typical oxidation level and source-driven aerosol classification, we were also able to classify and characterize outlier groups that would likely be disregarded in a more conventional analysis. Evaluating solution quality for the classification also provides means to assess the performance of mass spectral simi-larity metrics and optimize weighting for mass spectral variables. This facilitates algorithm-based evaluation of aerosol spectra, which may prove invaluable for future development of automatic methods for spectra identification and classification. Robust, statistics-based results and data visualizations also provide important clues to a human analyst on the existence and chemical interpretation of data structures. Applying these methods to a test set of data, aerosol mass spectrometric data of organic aerosol from a boreal forest site, yielded five to seven different recurring <b>pollution</b> <b>types</b> from various sources, including traffic, cooking, biomass burning and nearby sawmills. Additionally, three distinct, minor <b>pollution</b> <b>types</b> were discovered and identified as amine-dominated aerosols...|$|R

However, the size and complexity of upstream basins makes the planning and implementation of watershed-scale pollution management a challenge. In this study, we established an evaluation system based on 17 factors, representing the potential point and non-point source pollutants and the environmental carrying capacity which are likely to affect the water quality in the Dahuofang Reservoir and watershed in northeastern China. We used entropy methods to rank 118 subwatersheds by their potential pollution threat and clustered subwatersheds according to the potential <b>pollution</b> <b>type.</b> Combining ranking and clustering analyses allowed us to suggest specific areas for prioritized watershed management (in particular, two subwatersheds with the greatest pollution potential) and to recommend the conservation of current practices in other less vulnerable locations (91 small watersheds with low pollution potential).

40|$|Heavy metal (HM) {{pollution}} {{is a global}} environmental problem that threatens ecosystem and human health. Cadmium (Cd) {{pollution is}} the most prominent HM <b>pollution</b> <b>type</b> because of its high toxicity, strong migration, and the large polluted area globally. Phytoremediation of contaminated soil is frequently practiced because of its cost-effectiveness and operability and because it has no associated secondary pollution. High-accumulation plants, including those identified as hyperaccumulators, {{play an important role}} in phytoremediation. Therefore, screening of plants to identify hyperaccumulators is important for continued phytoremediation. In the present study, we investigated the Cd tolerance and accumulation capabilities of 18 turnip landraces from China under a soil experiment with known Cd level. The results indicated that turnip has a high capacity for Cd accumulation. Furthermore, significant differences in Cd tolerance and accumulation characteristics were found among different landraces when they grew at 50 mg kg− 1 (dry weight) Cd concentration. Among the studied landraces, five turnip landraces met the requirements of Cd hyperaccumulators and three landraces were identified as potential candidates. However, the total Cd content accumulated by individual plant of different turnip landraces was dependent on both the Cd accumulation capacity and plant biomass. Compared with some reported Cd hyperaccumulators, turnip not only shows a high Cd-accumulation capacity but also has rapid growth and a wide distribution area. These advantages indicate that turnip may have considerable potential for phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soil. Furthermore, the study also indicates that it is not advisable to consume turnip cultivated in an environment that exceeds safe Cd levels...|$|E

The {{results showed that the}} vertical O 3 distributions are controlled by metrological conditions and the characteristics of O 3 profiles are related to those of wet bulb potential temperature and wind field. O 3 below 2 km showed that the strongest variability and enhanced O 3 mixing ratios were associated with easterly winds that blow pollutants from the upwind source region of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Vertical O 3 profiles below 5 km can be grouped into 5 categories: (1) peak mixing ratio type, (2) well-mixed type, (3) layered-structure type, (4) episodic <b>pollution</b> <b>type</b> and (5) altitudinal increasing type. Vertical distributions of O 3 affected by regional transport of polluted air masses were investigated. Transport of polluted air from high latitudes of northern China, accompanying subsiding motion of air and stagnant atmospheric conditions are important factors that lead to high mixing ratios of O 3 at Lin'an. The stagnant atmospheric conditions associated with a continental high pressure system and pollution plume transported from the YRD and central-eastern China also lead to regional accumulation of O 3 and high O 3 mixing ratio at Lin'an. Long-range transport of O 3 and pollutants from the Pearl River Delta in South China and in-situ O 3 formation also resulted in elevated O 3 mixing ratios at around 1 km altitudes and layered O 3 distribution in the lower troposphere.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the issue of {{pollutant}} transport in soils: An overview of the problem is first presented before considering pollutant transport in saturated soils, pollutant transport in unsaturated soils and finally two examples. Causes of <b>pollution,</b> <b>types</b> of pollutants, commonly used remediation techniques, the importance of risk assessment and waste disposal facilities are discussed. Pollutant transport in the saturated zone is briefly covered, via the derivation of the governing differential equations, together with a discussion of available software. Pollutant transport in the unsaturated zone is considered in much greater detail. The formulation developed by the authors is presented, together with the numerical solution scheme achieved (COMPASS). An application of COMPASS to an isothermal problem is then considered involving both advection-diffusion of 2 chemical species, including geochemical reactions with the soil particles. The coupled flow and geochemical model is then compared with the transport model alone, to demonstrate the effect of the coupled model on the attenuation of chemicals due to the geochemical interactions with the soil particles. In the second application results of research on the modelling of lead transport in partly saturated soil are presented. Comparisons of numerical results with experimental observations are given, for a range of soil leaching experiments, covering a variety of conditions. Good agreement was achieved in this case, lending confidence in the approach proposed. It is however acknowledged that considerable further work is required to fully explore and develop the model's capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Since 1999 Cairo and the Nile delta {{region have}} {{suffered}} from air pollution episodes called the "black cloud" during the fall season. These {{have been attributed to}} either burning of agriculture waste or long-range transport of desert dust. Here we present a detailed analysis of the optical and microphysical aerosol properties, based on satellite data. Monthly mean values of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm were examined for the 10 yr 2000 – 2009. Significant monthly variability is observed with maxima in April or May (~ 0. 5) and October (~ 0. 45), and a minimum in December and January (~ 0. 2). Monthly mean values of UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) retrieved by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for 4 yr (2005 – 2008) exhibit the same AOD pattern. The carbonaceous aerosols during the black cloud periods are confined to the planetary boundary layer (PBL), while dust aerosols exist over a wider range of altitudes, as shown by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) aerosol profiles. The monthly climatology of Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data show that the aerosols during the black cloud periods are spherical with a higher percentage of small and medium size particles, whereas the spring aerosols are mostly large non-spherical particles.
