25|$|LEDs are {{increasingly}} being adopted for signal functions such as <b>parking</b> <b>lamps,</b> brake lamps and turn signals as well as daytime running lamps, as in those applications they offer significant advantages over filament bulbs with fewer engineering challenges than headlamps pose.|$|E
25|$|Typically, bulbs of 21 to 27watts, {{producing}} 280 to 570 lumens (22 to 45 mean spherical candlepower) {{are used}} for stop, turn, reversing and rear fog lamps, while bulbs of 4 to 10W, producing 40 to 130lm (3 to 10 mscp) {{are used for}} tail lamps, <b>parking</b> <b>lamps,</b> side marker lamps and side turn signal repeaters.|$|E
25|$|These first {{cars were}} Winton Sixes {{purchased}} {{from a car}} manufacturer in Seattle. The BC Express Company purchased two cars {{at a cost of}} $1,500 each and then added a variety of options such as tops at $150, Klaxon horns, $50 and kerosene <b>parking</b> <b>lamps,</b> $75. The Winton Company also provided two drivers, who were also mechanics, as there were few people who knew how to operate and fix a vehicle.|$|E

25|$|For 1976, {{the final}} year of this generation, all Olds 88s {{received}} revised grille work, rectangular headlamps and <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> directly below instead of in the bumper, with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments. It was also {{the final year}} for the Holiday hardtop coupes and sedans, along with the 455 Rocket V8 and the optional airbag system that would generally become universal on production cars and trucks some 15 years later. A one-year only option on Delta 88 Royale Holiday coupes was the Royale Crown Landau package that included a stainless steel roof bar, padded rear quarter vinyl roof, special hood ornament and color-keyed wheelcovers.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal <b>parking</b> <b>lamps.</b> Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E
2500|$|The dim-dip {{systems were}} not {{intended}} for daytime use as DRLs. Rather, they operated if {{the engine was}} running and the driver switched on the <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> (called [...] "sidelights" [...] in the UK). Dim-dip was intended to provide a nighttime [...] "town beam" [...] with intensity between that of the <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> commonly used at the time by British drivers in city traffic after dark, and dipped (low) beams; the former were considered insufficiently intense to provide improved conspicuity in conditions requiring it, while the latter were considered too glaring for safe use in built-up areas. The UK was the only country to require such dim-dip systems, though vehicles so equipped were sold in other Commonwealth countries with left-hand traffic.|$|E
50|$|Changes to Jeep Wrangler {{include a}} new Trail Kit (two D-rings, a tow strap, gloves {{and a bag}} to store the items), clear <b>park</b> <b>lamps</b> and turn signal {{indicators}} replace the amber units, 6 new body colors (Ampâ€™d, Anvil, Copperhead, Flame Red, Granite Crystal and Hydro Blue (Freedom Edition only)) for total of 10.|$|R

25|$|Front, side, {{and rear}} {{position}} lamps are permitted, required or forbidden to illuminate in combination with daytime running lamps, depending on the jurisdiction and the DRL implementation. Likewise, according to jurisdictional regulations, DRLs mounted within a certain distance of turn signals are permitted or required to extinguish or dim down to <b>parking</b> <b>lamp</b> intensity individually when the adjacent turn signal is operating.|$|R
2500|$|Separate grille {{designs were}} still {{maintained}} for Torino and Gran Torino models; they mimicked the 1972s in design. The Gran Torino {{now had a}} more rectangular grill with the <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> horizontally placed in the grille, but the quad headlights were still surrounded with a chrome bezel. Base Torino models had a wider full width grill that surrounded the headlamps; however, the <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> were located on {{the outer edge of}} the fascia. [...] Although it was the [...] "cheap" [...] model, the base Torino grille was styled to mimic the big Ford Custom 500. [...] The leading edge of the hood was now squared off to follow the fascia's lines, and all models shared the same hood. The 1973 Torino maintained the rear bumper of the 1972 Torino, and incorporated minor changes to meet the [...] mandate. Rear bumpers now featured an impact strip and bumper guards.|$|E
2500|$|Streamliners {{used the}} larger B-body and, {{except for the}} station wagons, used {{fastback}} styling. The 1941 Super models with folding center armrest were known as Chieftains in 1942. All Pontiacs looked lower, heavier and wider. Extension caps on the front doors lengthened the forward fender lines. The hood extended {{back to the front}} doors, eliminating the cowl. The grille, bumper and hood were widened and headlamps were further apart. Long horizontal <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> sat just above the vertical side grilles. The horseshoe shaped center grille had horizontal bars and a circular emblem {{in the middle of the}} upper main surround molding. The word Pontiac appeared on the hood side molding of six-cylinder models, while the moldings of the eight-cylinder cars said Pontiac Eight. After December 15, 1941, wartime [...] "blackout" [...] trim was used. All parts previously chrome plated were finished in Duco Gun Metal Grey.|$|E
2500|$|The first postwar Pontiac {{available}} (September 13, 1945) was the Streamliner coupe, which {{remained the}} sole product for a time. The Chieftain trim level of 1942 was renamed the Deluxe trim level in 1946. Styling highlights of Pontiacs were wraparound bumpers, a massive 14 blade grille, new nameplates and concealed safe-light <b>parking</b> <b>lamps.</b> Streamliners {{could be identified}} by straight back Indian moldings on the rear hood ornament chrome beltline moldings and bright moldings on the [...] "speedline" [...] fender ribs. They also had longer front fender crown moldings and were generally larger in size. Lettering on hood emblems and badges placed forward of the [...] "speedlines" [...] identified Eights. Interior trim on passenger cars were in gray striped cloth. Station wagons had three seats in standard trim, two seats in Deluxe trim and used imitation leather upholstery and passenger car style interior hardware. Ranging in price from $1942 for a standard Six to $2047 for a Deluxe Eight, Streamliner station wagons continued {{to be the most}} expensive Pontiac model. A total of 92,731 Streamliners were sold in 1946, accounting for over two thirds of all Pontiacs.|$|E

50|$|The {{facelift}} third-generation Prelude {{was revealed}} in Japan on November 21, 1989. The {{front and rear}} bumpers were revised on the new Prelude The rear front bumper and rear tail lamps featured clear indicators and a revised <b>parking</b> <b>lamp</b> design. Many of the interior parts were also revised, including the dash bezel, the door handle and window switches. The Japanese version of the Si with the B20A was rated 140 PS with the JDM engine and was rated for 37 MPG.|$|R
2500|$|The Astre {{features}} Pontiac's trademark split grill, emblems {{and steering}} wheel with an upgraded interior trim to help differentiate {{itself from the}} Chevrolet Vega. Other styling differences compared to the Vega include [...] 1973 model Astres have a black-finish grill and clear <b>parking</b> <b>lamp</b> lenses on all models, and chrome headlight bezels on non-GTs. Taillight lenses (same as the Vega) have a chrome trim piece surround. The 1974-1977 models have first generation Firebird-styled taillights (also shared with the 1973/74 Ventura) on the notchback and hatchback.|$|R
2500|$|Ford {{planned to}} {{introduce}} another limited edition Torino {{to once again}} dominate at NASCAR. The result was the 1970 Ford Torino King Cobra. Like the Talladega, the King Cobra was modified with aerodynamics specifically in mind and looked very different from a typical 1970 Torino. It had a sloped front end with dual headlamps located in sugar scoop shaped cut-outs on the front fenders, similar in appearance to the Datsun 240Z. The King Cobra's grille was a large opening below the front bumper, much like the bottom breather design now used in some modern cars. <b>Parking</b> <b>lamps</b> were located between the headlamps, molded into the front fascia. The hoods had a blacked-out center portion, and a side stripe similar to 1968-69 Torino GTs ran from the front fender to quarter panel. Ford planned to offer covers for the headlight cutouts to NASCAR teams to improve aerodynamics even further. [...] In actuality it is said the front end created too much down force. [...] In addition to no rear down force creation this caused the car to become very loose in turns as per Musclecar Review.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950 Oldsmobile 98 {{repeated}} its 1948 precedent of previewing some of next years styling cues for the 88. The 98 was restyled {{after only}} two years. It {{was the first}} totally slab sided Oldsmobile and the first sedan with wraparound rear windows. A 4-door 98 fastback appeared for one year only in 1950 and was called the Town Sedan, selling only 1,778 units. Standard equipment included bumper guards, dual horns, <b>parking</b> <b>lamps,</b> dome light, rubber floor mats, aluminum sill plates, foam rubber seat cushions, chrome interior trim, lined luggage compartment and counterbalanced trunk lid. Deluxe 98 equipment included rear seat armrest, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel and horn button, special door trim and stainless steel wheel trim rings. Upholstery choices spanned nylon fabric, striped broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] In 1950, Oldsmobile stopped naming the 98 series and so from then through 1996, {{with the exception of}} 1957 when it was called the Starfire 98, and in 1961 when it was called the Classic 98, it was simply known as the Oldsmobile 98. Sales of the 98 Holiday nearly tripled to 8263, approaching the 11,989 sold of the Club coupe. Given the rapidly growing popularity of the 2-door Holiday hardtop, 1950 was the last year for the pillared Club coupe. Total sales set yet another record of 106,220.|$|E
2500|$|A {{complete}} re-working of {{the front}} header and bumper highlighted the 1977 Grand Prix, which was the final year for the 1973-vintage bodyshell that was set {{to be replaced by}} a downsized GP for 1978. [...] The <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> were now positioned between the quad headlamps, and the previous year's 'waterfall' grille was replaced by a narrower one that extended into the lower portion of the bumper. [...] Behind the bumper were new reinforcements (mounting panels) made from aluminum rather than steel to reduce weight. [...] In back the taillights were simplified to eliminate the weighty pot metal bezels that created the horizontal stripe effect in 1976. [...] The same three models (J, LJ and SJ) were carried over with engine revisions. The base Model J got Pontiac's new [...] V8 as standard equipment, which was much too small and underpowered to propel a 4,000-pound car. Optional engines included a [...] V8 or [...] those two engines standard on the LJ and SJ models, respectively. [...] The original thinking on the 301 CID engine was that the weight savings from using a significantly lighter engine would cancel out the horsepower loss from the smaller displacement. [...] This turned out to be a major miscalculation and 301 equipped cars became much less desirable among Grand Prix enthusiasts and collectors in later years. [...] The 301 also had a knocking (pre-ignition) problem that was later determined to be caused by the shape of the combustion chamber.|$|E
5000|$|Visually, the {{differences}} {{from the regular}} Taurus are subtle. The 2010-2012 models were even more subtle, sporting a chrome wide-toothed grill, SHO C-Pillar logo and 5-spoked wheels. The 2013-current model employs a black grille with small honeycomb-shaped/mesh-like look, 19" [...] or optional 20" [...] "flower" [...] design wheels with other 20" [...] designs in later years, and SHO fender badges replaced the C-pillar logo. They all have a decklid spoiler, dual polished stainless steel exhaust tips, new <b>parking</b> <b>lamp</b> bezels, a SHO EcoBoost rear logo.|$|R

2500|$|The Torino model line-up was {{the same}} as 1973, with two exceptions. The Gran Torino Sport no longer was {{available}} with the [...] "Sportsroof" [...] fastback roofline, and the new [...] "Gran Torino Elite" [...] was introduced. The Gran Torino Elite was developed by Ford to help respond to Chevrolet's ever popular Monte Carlo. The Elite, was designed as an entry level [...] "personal luxury" [...] vehicle, for those who couldn't afford a Thunderbird, and was in the same price range as the Monte Carlo. The Elite was described by Ford as [...] " [...] A totally new 2-door hardtop[...].with Thunderbird-inspired styling, solid engineering and personal luxury[...].plus mid-size economy." [...] The Elite wasn't totally new, as Ford described, but it did have a number of unique features. The Elite had unique front sheet metal, with styling that was indeed inspired by the Thunderbird. It had twin headlamps surrounded by chrome bezels and <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> on the outer edges of the pointed front fenders. Its grille was large and rectangular arching across the front. The quarter panels and doors were shared with the Mercury Montego and Mercury Cougar and did not have the sweeping body line like other Torinos. The tail light panel also featured larger tail lights that ran the full width of the car; the centre portion being non-functional. The Elite came standard with a 351-2V V8 engine, automatic transmission, and radial tires. It also featured standard luxury items such as a vinyl roof, opera windows, split bench seat, [...] "Westminster" [...] cloth upholstery, woodgrain trim, and complete instrumentation.|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{had quite}} a variety of engine options for its {{intermediate}} line. All models other than the Torino GT came standard with a [...] six-cylinder engine. [...] Torino GT models came standard with a -2V [...] small block V8 and {{this was also the}} base V8 engine optional on other models. [...] Other available engines included a -2V FE engine, -4V FE engine and a -4V FE engine. [...] About one month within the beginning of the 1968 model year production, a six-week UAW strike against Ford occurred. [...] This resulted in a cost cutting measure of making a -2V small block V8 the base V8 engine and the standard engine on the Torino GT. Ford did not change any of its factory sales literature to reflect this change. [...] While the -4V FE engine was initially listed as an engine option for 1968 in factory literature, no Fairlanes or Torinos were actually produced with this engine during 1968. Introduced on April 1, 1968, the -4V CJ (Cobra-Jet) FE engine became available as an engine option, but due to its mid-year introduction these engines are very rare. The 428-4V Cobra-Jet was by far the most potent engine available for 1968, but was said to be under-rated at [...] [...] The cars equipped with the 428 Cobra Jets had emblems borrowed from the full-sized Fords (a red-and-chrome badge reading [...] "428") mounted on the fenders behind the <b>parking</b> <b>lamps.</b> All models came standard with a three-speed manual transmission, while the Cruise-O-Matic automatic and four-speed manual transmissions were options.|$|E
2500|$|... 1974 Chevelles {{featured}} new grilles, new taillights and [...] rear bumpers (in {{addition to}} the [...] front bumper added in '73). The Laguna name had debuted on the 1973 Chevelle as the top-line series in all body-styles, but the 1974 Laguna Type S-3 came only as a coupe, which combined Laguna luxury with the superior road manners of the SS which it replaced. Handling was further enhanced {{with the addition of}} new GR70-15 radial-ply tires. The new Laguna S-3 sported the urethane front end with a revised grill and new <b>parking</b> <b>lamps,</b> augmented at the rear by new taillights. A federally mandated [...] chrome rear bumper replaced the body-colored steel [...] version from '73. Standard equipment included a console, a vinyl roof, opera-type vertical rear quarter windows which could be covered with horizontal ribs for a few dollars extra; body side striping, Laguna S3 badging, rally wheels, 4 spoke steering wheel as well as firmer shocks/springs, a front stabilizer bar, and fat HR70x15 tires on Rally wheels. Front occupants rode in swivel bucket seats, and the driver faced a six-dial instrument cluster. Production totaled 15,792 cars, with prices starting at $3,723 - but with plenty of options to send the bottom line past $5,000. Engine offerings included a standard 145 horsepower (108kW) 350 two-barrel V8, with optional powerplants including a 150-horsepower (110kW) 400 two-barrel V8, 180 horsepower (130kW) 400 four-barrel V8 and 230 horsepower (170kW) 454 four-barrel V8, except in California where a 155-horsepower (116kW) 350 four-barrel V8 was standard and the 400 and 454 engines were optional. The 454 was available with the Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic 400 or Muncie 4 speed manual transmissions. 3-point seat belts with integrated shoulder belts were introduced as on all Chevrolet models.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{development}} and improvement of solid state lighting (SSL) technology is accelerating to enhance its light output. Today, solid state lighting sources {{can be found in}} many applications that requiring colored (monochromatic) light, such as exit signs, traffic signals, and automobile brake lights. In the recent past, technological breakthroughs have started to establish SSL sources of white light. As investment leads to technology improvements as well as reductions in manufacturing costs, SSL may start to compete for market share with conventional light sources, such as incandescent, fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps. This paper presents the potential of LED luminaries for outdoor lighting and focusing for parking lot application. A prototype model of <b>parking</b> lot LED <b>lamp</b> is constructed complete with the LED driver and the main objective is to achieve 20 percent energy saving compared the conventional <b>parking</b> lot <b>lamp.</b> The comparison is made between 100 Watt High Pressure Sodium Vapor (HPSV) <b>parking</b> lot <b>lamp</b> and the proposed LED lamp.

5000|$|The car {{was again}} updated in 1956 when {{the engine was}} {{increased}} in capacity to [...] The two-piece split windscreen was replaced with a curved one-piece one and the rear window was enlarged. In 1961 the semaphore-style trafficators were replaced by the flashing direction indicators, these were US-style red at the rear (using the same bulb filament as the brake lamp) and white at the front (using a second brighter filament in the <b>parking</b> <b>lamp</b> bulb) which was legal in the UK and many export markets at the time (such as New Zealand). An upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger BMC B-Series engine was sold as the Riley One-Point-Five/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by BMC Australia as the Morris Major and the Austin Lancer.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, the Seville got a {{new fuel}} {{injection}} system which brought the horsepower up to 180. Front <b>park</b> <b>lamps</b> were no longer mounted in the fender on any models, and the Seville STS underwent some major changes. These included new side and rear body color fascias which gave the car a sportier, more aggressive look. Also added was dual exhaust with bright stainless outlets, a larger STS trunk script, standard Teves anti-lock braking system with rear discs, and 16-inch machine finished alloy wheels on Goodyear Eagle GT+4 tires. A driver's side airbag was also added to Seville and STS. While the engine {{was the same as}} used in regular Seville models, the transmission had a special final drive ratio of 3:33:1 for better acceleration. The 1990 STS also received its own body designation of 6KY69, and prices started at $36,320. 1990 STS limited production totaled 2,811 vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972â€“73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler neck moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972â€“73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} the tail light panel just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much finer mesh pattern with vertical <b>parking</b> <b>lamps</b> in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width red lens across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|E

A new [...] 267 CID V8 became optional and the [...] 305 CID V8 continued as an option but was joined by a 160 hp 235 lbfft Nm version with a four-barrel carburetor. The same transmissions were carried over from 1978, including a standard three-speed manual and optional four-speed manual, or an optional three-speed Turbo Hydramatic automatic.

Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running lamps. Optional on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams along with the position (<b>parking)</b> <b>lamp</b> and front turn signal are all realised with LEDs.
