40|$|Abstract We review two generic {{mechanisms}} of dis-persion of carbon nanotubes in a low-viscosity sol-vent or high-viscosity polymer, {{focusing on the}} neat nanotubes not surface-functionalized in any way. We give estimates of the van der Waals energies involved in nanotube aggregates and examine two main tech-niques: ultrasonication and shear mixing. For ultrasonic dispersion methods, the local mechanical energy ap-plied to individual tubes is high and bundle separa-tion is assured in the cavitation regime. We analyze and estimate the tube scission during ultrasonic cav-itation and predict the characteristic nanotube length Llim below which scission does not occur. For shear-mixing, our analysis suggests that dispersion is pos-sible in non-parallel bundled nanotube aggregates, in high-viscosity polymers, once a critical mixing time t ∗ is reached. We then examine characteristic fea-tures of nanotube-polymer composite rheology and its aging/stability against re-aggregation. We show that at nanotube loading above overlap concentration the tubes form an elastic network in the matrix. <b>Physical</b> <b>junctions</b> of this network are strong and stable enough to provide a rubber-like elastic response with very slow relaxation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in life sciences suggest that human and rodent cell responses to stimuli might differ significantly. In this context, the results achieved in neurotoxicology and biomedical research practices using neural networks obtained from mouse or rat primary culture of neurons would {{benefit of the}} parallel evaluation of the same parameters using fully differentiated neurons with a human genetic background, thus emphasizing the current need of neuronal cells with human origin. In this work, we developed a human functionally active neural network derived by human neuroblastoma cancer cells genetically engineered to overexpress NDM 29, a non-coding RNA whose increased synthesis causes the differentiation toward a neuronal phenotype. These cells are here analyzed accurately showing functional and morphological traits of neurons such as the expression of neuron-specific proteins and the possibility to generate the expected neuronal current traces and action potentials. Their morphometrical analysis is carried out by quantitative phase microscopy showing soma and axon sizes compatible with those of functional neurons. The ability of these cells to connect autonomously forming <b>physical</b> <b>junctions</b> recapitulates that of hippocampal neurons, as resulting by connect-ability test. Lastly, these cells self-organize in neural networks able to produce spontaneous firing, in which spikes can be clustered in bursts. Altogether, these {{results show that the}} neural network obtained by NDM 29 -dependent differentiation of neuroblastoma cells is a suitable tool for biomedical research practices...|$|R

40|$|Artificial protein hydrogels {{made from}} a triblock protein (designated AC 10 A, where A is an acidic zipper domain and C 10 {{comprises}} 10 repeats of the nonapeptide sequence exhibit normalized plateau storage moduli (G/nkT) less than 0. 13 at all concentrations, pH values, and ionic strengths examined. These gels are surprisingly soft due to loop formation {{at the expense of}} bridges between <b>physical</b> <b>junctions.</b> Molecular-level evidence of loop formation is provided by strong fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) between distinct chromophores placed at the C- and N-termini of labelled chains diluted in an excess of unlabelled chains. The tendency to form loops originates from the compact size of the random coil midblock (mean RH(C 10) 20 Å, determined from quasi-elastic light scattering of C 10), and is facilitated by the ability of the leucine zipper domains to form antiparallel aggregates. Although the aggregation number of the leucine zipper domains is small (tetrameric, determined from multi-angle static light scattering of AC 10 diblock), the average center-to-center distance between aggregates is roughly 1. 5 times the average end-to-end distance of the C 10 domain in a 7 % w/v network. To avoid stretching the C 10 domain, the chains tend to form loops. Changes in pH or ionic strength that expand the polyelectrolyte midblock favor bridging, leading to greater G as long as leucine zipper endblocks do not dissociate. Understanding of the network structure provided successful design strategies to increase the rigidity of these hydrogels. In contrast to intuitive design concepts for rubber and gel materials, it was shown that increasing either the length or the charge density of the midblock increases rigidity, because fewer chains are wasted in loop formation...|$|R

Each AGD was prepared with a 5 % concentration of deacetylated glucomannan (GM) at pH = 11 {{for use in}} the preparation of restructured fish products. The control (0 MPa) AGD (C 0) exhibited a partially crystalline GM network with a glass transition temperature (T) of ~ 75 °C. C 0 gels at 25 °C were rigid, with high breaking force (BF), fracture constant (K) and complex modulus (G*) and low tanδ values due to the large number of <b>physical</b> <b>junctions</b> produced by complete deacetylation of the GM chains. This structural response was reflected in high water binding capacity (WBC) and colour (L*) and low cooking loss (CL). Specifically, 200 MPa reduced close packing ability in the crystalline regions, evidenced in the lower T~ 65 °C and resulting in lower gel strength (S), K, G* and a higher viscous component (high tanδ), thus reducing the L* value. Conversely, 600 MPa increased the degree of cross-linking in C 600, reinforcing the number and extent of crystalline regions, resulting in the broadening of the O-H stretching band in the FT-IR spectrum and producing a thermoset physical network with no glass transition region. Thus, C 600 gel was firmer (higher G*) with greater S, and less flexible (lower strain amplitude-γ). Consequently, depending on the textural properties desired in the final restructured fish product, the most appropriate pressure would be 200 MPa for softer final gels and 600 MPa for firmer and less deformable gels.

Probably in 1865 the two stations changed their names to Manuel (Low Level) and Manuel (High Level). There is considerable contradiction among sources over dates and names; Butt gives the High Level station opening, as Bo'ness Junction, in 1842; this was nine years before Bo'ness got its railway; and that the station was renamed Manuel (High Level)in 1866. He gives Manuel (on the S&BR line) as opening on 10 June 1856, later renamed Manuel (Low Level) on an unspecified date. Cobb gives Bo'ness Junction opening on the E&GR in 1851, but this may be confusion with the geographical junction rather than a passenger station; he gives Manuel Low Level as opening in 1856.

A new injectable hydrogel material, developed from recombinant telechelic proteins expressed in E. coli, demonstrates shear thinning by 3 orders of magnitude at large strains. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear illustrates that shear thinning is due to yielding within {{the bulk of the}} gel, and the rheological response and flow profiles are consistent with a shear-banding mechanism for yielding. The sharp yielding transition and large magnitude of the apparent shear thinning allow gels to be injected through narrow gauge needles with only gentle hand pressure. After injection the gels reset to full elastic strength in seconds due to rapid re-formation of the <b>physical</b> network <b>junctions,</b> allowing self-supporting structures to be formed.

In normal conditions, these genes are believed to be responsible for the cells ability to degrade mitochondria that has been rendered nonfunctional in a process known as mitophagy. However, mutations in the Parkin and pink1 genes have been associated with the cells becoming incapable of degrading faulty mitochondria. The proteins alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) and DJ-1 have been shown to promote MAM function interaction between the ER and the mitochondria. The wild-type gene that codes for α-Syn promotes the <b>physical</b> <b>junction</b> between ER and mitochondria by binding to the lipid raft regions of the MAM.

Further research on PD association with alterations in MAM is still being developed.|$|E

Upon this cooling into a supercooled state, TPE-PP undergoes a gradual liquid-solid transition as the stereoregular sequences crystallize and hence form <b>physical</b> network <b>junctions.</b> At the gel point of this physical gelation process, the TPE-PP exhibits the typical scaling behavior expressed in power law relaxation, G(t) = St- " with a prefactor S of about 2. 0 MPa s " and a relaxation exponent n close to 0. 13.
