40|$|AbstractKiwicha has {{significant}} nutritional characteristics. It {{is commonly used}} as a <b>puffed</b> <b>product,</b> {{but there is little}} research on the lamination process. In this paper, the physical, functional properties, chemical composition and acceptability of the precooked kiwicha grains were studied. Puffed (PK) and laminated kiwicha (LK) were made. Puffed amaranth (CPA) was used as a commercial reference standard. The raw grain (RG) showed a higher bulk density (0. 85 g/ml) than in PK (0. 18 g/ml) and LK (0. 38 g/ml). Both products had a good expansion. The yellow index decreased in PK (50. 92) and LK (45. 87) respect to RG (65. 64). The largest was CPA (58. 54). In all the products, the precooking increased the index of absorption, solubility and swelling power. Also, they showed major pasting temperature, low peak viscosity and breakdown viscosity. In both formulated products, the content of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre decreased during the precooking process. The content of protein was optimal (between 14. 57 - 14. 59 g/ 100 g). PK had high acceptability (5. 84), preference (84. 48 %), purchase (38. 79 %) and consumption (43. 96 %) intention. The lowest was CPA. This work demonstrates that it&# 8217;s feasible to make precooked products with good quality characteristics, chemical composition and acceptability for the development of new products...|$|E
40|$|The Rice Krispies™ process {{consists}} essentially of {{the cooking}} of short or medium rice grains, followed by a mechanical compression between two rolls (bumping), a tempering step and a toasting operation (puffing) which expands the grains into the finished product. The objectives of this project were to clarify which molecular phenomena take place inside the rice grains during the process and to facilitate the improvement and optimisation of the process parameters. The composition and gelatinisation behaviour of seven different raw rice varieties used either in the United States or the United Kingdom were studied. The glass transition of the cooked rice material was determined by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), which allowed {{each step of the}} process to be mapped onto a temperature / moisture content state diagram. The bumping step of the process and its effect on the various molecular entities present in the cooked rice were studied in details. Amylose was found to form complexes with the lipids present in the material during cooking, and these reinforced the cooked rice grain structure. One of the roles of the bumping could be to partially dislocate these amylose-lipid complexes to enable the rice grains expansion at the puffing step of the process. The bumping also reduced the molecular weight of amylopectin, which is thought to weaken the rice grains structure and improve the puffed grains expansion. The mill gap between the bumping rolls was the key factor determining the quality of the <b>puffed</b> <b>product.</b> The temperature at which the rice grains are bumped had a secondary influence {{on the quality of the}} puffed rice, within the range 26 °C to 57 °C. The RVA provided a very effective method to categorise post-bumped samples and could be a useful diagnostic tool in case of production problems. Evidence of physical ageing and moisture content equilibration during the tempering step was found. Physical ageing did not have a detectable effect on the expansion of the rice grains, while it was important that moisture content was equilibrated inside the grains to ensure a proper puffing. Finally, correlations were found between the puffed rice grains expansion and the post-bumped grains height recovery, which made it possible to predict the quality of the expanded grains from the characterisation of the post-bumped rice. Overall, the project is a good example of the application of general starch science concepts to the study of a specific industrial process.

40|$|Dietary fiber has {{a number}} of health benefits. However, its {{incorporation}} into extrusion <b>puffed</b> <b>products</b> limits their <b>puffing</b> ability and reduces their crispness and bowl life. A number of factors were found to determine the effect of dietary fiber on extrusion puffing. ^ Reduction in particle size of insoluble fibers, such as cellulose and corn bran, improved extrusion expansion, but only to a limited extent. Reduction in particle size of cellulose to less than 60 μm did not improve sectional expansion index. The supramolecular structure of cellulose, i. e. degree of crystallinity and the extent of ferulic acid cross-linkages of corn bran, had a significant effect on extrusion expansion of high fiber extrudates. Using model systems, the degree of crystallinity of cellulose had an inversely proportional relationship to extrusion expansion. Modification of the supramolecular structure of corn bran using alkali treatment significantly enhanced sectional expansion index of extrudates containing 26 % total dietary fiber. Incorporation of 26 % hemicellulose B from corn bran of suitable molecular weight in cornmeal also facilitated significant cross-sectional expansion of extrudates, such that their degree of expansion was similar to a control containing no added fiber. ^ The molecular weight of soluble fibers {{played a significant role in}} determining the degree of extrusion expansion of extrudates; this was shown using corn fiber gum, arabinogalactan and CMC. An optimum number average molecular weight of 2. 1 – 2. 5 x 105 significantly improved the sectional expansion index of extrudates containing 30 % CMC. A branched polymer versus linear polymers was also found to better facilitate increased extrusion expansion in high fiber <b>puffed</b> <b>products.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{different}} levels of moisture content of maize grits (10, 13, 16 and 19 %) as an attribute of physicochemical properties of extruder-derived <b>puffed</b> <b>products,</b> was investigated. The results showed that with increasing maize grits' moisture content, water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI) were decreased. Moreover, with changing in feed moisture content from 10 to 16 %, the volume and sectional expansion index (SEI) increased but further increase of moisture content to 19 % caused a reduction in these parameters. The textural tests also revealed that with increase in moisture content, the compression energy (Nmm), maximum force (N) and time to achieve the first major peak (s) were increased {{but the number of}} peaks was decreased. With increase in the moisture content, specific mechanical energy (SME) was decreased, due probably to the reduction in the viscosity of melt. With increase in the moisture content the L and b values were increased but the value of the samples were decreased due to the reduction of Maillard reaction rate. Our data confirms that the moisture content of maize grits may {{play an important role in}} the quality of produced extruded snacks and a high quality product can be achieved by optimizing this parameter.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of recrystallization and large ice areas after storage of frozen food products makes {{the use of}} ice-structuring proteins (ISPs) in food products meaningful. Food products are frozen to extend shelf-life during long storage periods while preservation of the overall sensoric quality.

We present a study on the influence of ice-structuring proteins, isolated from the sea-ice microalgae Fragilariopsis cylindrus (fcISP), on frozen whipped cream. The individual phases of the frozen cream foam have been detected by cryo-Raman spectroscopy and visualized. The advantage of the unique cryo-Raman spectroscopy system available at the AWI is that the individual components can be detected not only qualitatively, but also localized in the frozen sample. We show that the fat and ice structure in frozen cream, and their temperature-induced changes, are well detectable by cryo-Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the effect of fcISPs on the microstructure shows an inhibition of ice recrystallization, leading to smaller grain aggregates and a finer fat distribution than without fcISPs. We therefore suggest that fcISPs are an effective mean in controlling recrystallization processes in frozen goods...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{cigarettes}} (ECs) {{have emerged}} in the marketplace {{in recent years and}} are gaining popularity, but with relatively little understanding of their health impact to consumers. To remedy the gap in knowledge about ECs and their emissions, we have developed a technique to measure their nicotine content, emission efficiency, and nicotine delivery using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Figures of merit for the GC-MS analytical method were determined. In addition to the analytical method development, we also studied the nicotine characteristics of disposable and re-fillable ECs (both in e-liquids and emissions) using our method. For the disposable ECs, prior to <b>puffing,</b> <b>products</b> were dissected; the nicotine containing solution was extracted with methanol and analyzed gravimetrically and by GC-MS to determine the contents of un-puffed devices. The aerosolized emissions of ECs were collected on filter pads using our in-house puffing machine, the contents of the filters were extracted, and subsequently analyzed gravimetrically and by GC-MS. Five popular brands of disposable ECs were studied and showed varying emission efficiencies under our puffing regime that corresponded to differing levels of nicotine delivery. Our results also show that there are discrepancies between the nicotine concentrations reported on disposable EC packaging by manufacturers and our analytical results. Three refillable EC devices were also tested for nicotine delivery using a variety of machine puffing parameters. Our results revealed the puffing parameters (puff duration, puff volume, and puff flow rate) play roles in the nicotine delivery of re-fillable ECs. In whole, this work contributes toward developing reliable analytical methods that will hopefully work toward {{a better understanding of the}} health impact of relatively new ECs on consumers and also to those in the indoor air environment that may passively consume EC emissions...|$|R

40|$|Twelve fat blends {{based on}} palm {{fractions}}, shea fractions and fully hardened soybean oil were combined with high oleic sunflower oil and studied for potential use as puff pastry shortenings. The fat blends {{had a lower}} saturated fatty acid content (28. 3 - 32. 0 %) compared to a commercial puff pastry shortening (49. 4 %) and butter (65. 9 %). The saturated fat contained in the blends was formed by different triacylglycerol (TAG) structures containing mainly stearic acid, palmitic acid {{or a combination of}} both so that the fat blends contained different TAG composition and it was possible to assess the effect ofthe different TAG composition on their performance as puff pastry shortenings. The fat sources of the main TAGs were: Palm Stearin (POs), which contained tripalmitoyl glycerol (PPP) Palm Mid-fraction (PM F), which contained 1, 3 -dipalmitoyl- 2 - 0 Ieyl glycerol (POP) Interesterified Palm Mid-fraction (inPMF), which contained PPP, POP, 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl- 3 - 0 Ieyl glycerol (PPO) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2, 3 -dioleylglycerol (POO) Fully Hardened Soybean Oil (fhBO), which contained tristearoylglycerol (SSS) Shea Stearin (SHs), which contained 1, 3 -distearoyl- 2 -oelyl glycerol (SOS) Interesterified Shea Stearin (inSHs), which contained SSS, SOS and 1 -stearoyl- 2, 3 - dioleylglycerol (SOO) and 1, 2 -distearoyl- 3 - 0 Ieyl glycerol (SSO) High Oleic Sunflower Oil (HOSF), which contained trioleyl glycerol (000) The blends were formulated to systematically vary the ratio of trisatures (either PPP or SSS); 1, 2 - disaturates (either PPO or SSO) and 1, 3 -disaturates (either POP or SOS). The blends were processed on a pilot plant scale and their properties were studied The physical properties of the fat blends and their functionality as shortenings for puff pastry were assessed by their Solid Fat Content (SFC), polymorphism, melting and crystallisation profile, texture and production of a baked <b>puff</b> pastry <b>product.</b> The solid fat content showed that blends containing stearic acid had the highest SFC between 20 and 30 °C (25. 3 - 33. 3 % at 20 °C and 19. 8 - 24. 2 % at 30 °C) compared to samples containing palmitic acid (18 - 23 % at 20 °C and 1. 2 - 21. 2 % at 30 °C). Above 30 °C all samples commenced a decline in their SFC, the most affected being those containing disaturated TAGs and palmitic acid. The melting profile showed that higher melting TAGs were present in blends B 1 -B 4 compared to blends containing mainly palmitic acid (A 1 -A 4), where less energy was required for melting and crystallising the TAGs present. The main polymorph found was f 3 in blends containing SOS, POP or a combination of both as their main TAG (blends A 4, B 4 and C 4). Polymorph P' was also detected in the blends combined with B. Blends A 3 and C 3 which contained POO as their main TAGs crystallised mainly in the W polymorph. Puff pastry prepared with blend A 1 (POs:HOSF 29 : 71), A 4 (PMF:HOSF 41 : 59), B 3 (inSHs:HOSF 38 : 62) and C 3 (inPMF:inSHs:HOSF 19 : 20 : 61) was very hard. Blends A 2 (POs:PMF:HOSF 13 : 19 : 68), B 4 (SHs:HOSF 40 : 60), C 2 (POs:PMF:fhBO:SHs: HOSF (9 : 12 : 4 : 12 : 63) and C 4 (PMF:SHs:HOSF 20 : 21 : 59) were most similar to butter in the compressibility of the baked product and specific volume. It was found that puff pastry prepared from blends that contained SOS as the main saturates (blends B 4, Cl, C 2 and C 4) presented properties closer to butter than the other blends as they were similar to butter in compressibility of the baked product and had high specific volume. Blend C 2 prepared with POs, PMF, fhBO, SHs and HOSF (9 : 12 : 4 : 12 : 63) produced a <b>puff</b> pastry <b>product</b> with better qualities {{than the rest of the}} fat blends and its textural properties such as specific volume (3. 5 cm 3 /g), height (22. 6 mm) and compression (138 g) were comparable to those obtained with butter. For this reason, it was selected to be optimised for use as a puff pastry shortening by increasing its saturated concentration from 33 % to 34. 6 % and 37. 6 % and compared to a commercial puff pastry shortening with 49. 4 % total saturates. The main TAGs were PPP:SSS (2. 5 : 1) and POP:SOS (1. 1 : 1). Physical properties such as SFC, melting and crystallisation profile and yield stress were affected by the increasing levels in saturated fatty acid content. Microscopyand rheological analysis showed minor differences at the microstructural level and this was reflected in their performance in the <b>puff</b> pastry <b>products.</b> The blends compared well with commercial puff pastry and butter. It was concluded that a high SFC and melting point, indicative of good plasticity, are required in the making of <b>puff</b> pastry <b>products</b> and that the level of microstructure provided by disaturated TAGs with the configuration saturated-unsaturated-saturated is desirable as they promote crystallisation in the ~ polymorph, a good lift and specific volume, favouring the production of <b>puff</b> pastry <b>products</b> with comparable characteristics to those obtained with butter and the commercial puff pastry shortening.

40|$|The {{differences}} between conventionally processed and extruded puffed rice were examined, {{with a view}} to determining the reasons for their different storage behaviour in confectionery. Differences between the two forms of puffed rice have been identified, both in their performance and their properties. Under certain viewing conditions, the starch granules in conventionally processed and extruded rice appear to be different. The starch granules in conventionally puffed Rice remain intact, but with no crystalline structure (i. e. no Maltese crosses are visible, though starch ghosts are abundant.) Cell walls of conventionally processed rice appear to be a layer of these gelatinised intact granules. The ghostlike granules have not undergone notable swelling, remaining slightly greater than 10 μm in diameter, similar to the size of unprocessed granules. In contrast, the starch granules in extruded puffed rice are rarely visible, in either their birefringent Maltese cross form, or as gelatinised but intact ghosts. By altering the extrusion conditions, the microscopic appearance of the product and its behaviour in water or water vapour becomes similar to that of conventionally processed rice. The extrusion parameters required for this similarity to conventionally processed rice fall within a window that is relatively narrow when compared to the ranges of variables available. Under more severe processing conditions the granules lose their integrity because shear and heat disrupt them. Under less severe conditions, the granules form clusters that do not gelatinise. The conditions at which this product is made cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from samples made under other conditions. However, at these extrusion parameters, the extrudate does not expand. It is necessary to expand the extrudate separately from the extrusion process.

40|$|The rise of {{unhealthy}} {{lifestyles and}} diets among Americans {{is leading to}} an influx of health-conscious consumers on the search for more nutritious, health-promoting food options that match their taste preferences. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine consumer preferences and specific attributes of whole grain and high fiber products that drive acceptability through descriptive analysis and preference mapping on whole wheat breads and an extruded pinto bean and brown rice flour snack puff. Commercial whole wheat breads, characterized by 26 appearance, aroma, flavor, and texture attributes, were separated into two distinct groups. The first group consisted of attributes similar to white bread: sweet, moist, and sticky. While the second group, had attributes associated with traditional wheat breads: wheaty, earthy, bitter. Consumers were clustered into three groups for clearer understanding of market segmentation. The first cluster liked all breads equally, while the second liked the breads associated with white bread attributes and the third cluster liked the classic wheat breads more. This was confirmed through partial least squares (PLS) regression, which showed if each attribute positively or negatively affected overall liking for each respective cluster. In the second study, composite flours were extruded with varying pinto bean flour levels and feed moisture conditions to produce an acceptable <b>puffed</b> snack <b>product.</b> The level of bean flour affected the majority of the fifteen descriptive attributes, while feed moisture only affected texture and appearance attributes. Consumers found the extruded puffs with up to 15 % bean flour to be the most acceptable. Preference mapping and PLS regression showed higher overall liking scores for samples characterized by rice flavor and larger diameter and lower scores for extrudates with higher bean flavor and grittier textures. Overall, these studies were successful in determining descriptive attributes as well as their relationship to consumer acceptability through preference mapping. These data may be helpful for future researchers when developing new whole grain and high fiber products. Advisor: Devin J. Ros...|$|R

40|$|This project {{aimed to}} develop a puffed "functional food" cereal {{ingredient}} that could subsequently be used in muesli bar products and potentially be on sold to breakfast cereal manufacturers. This ingredient was to contain nutrients that provided heart health benefits and also to possess good textural properties and to have an acceptable taste. Extrusion processing was used to produce the ingredient; extrusion processing transformed the raw materials used into a more palatable and texturally acceptable form and changed the nutritional quality. The decision as to which nutrients {{to include in the}} ingredient required consideration of efficacy, regulatory and consumer and market factors. A literature review was undertaken to identify potential nutrients that would have heart health efficacy, meet regulatory guidelines and still be acceptable to consumers. A qualitative consumer study was conducted to gauge consumer awareness of the nutrients investigated and the desirability for these ingredients to be included in a bar benefiting heart health. The main heart health nutrient selected for use in the puffed muesli ingredient, {{based on the results of}} screening, was soluble fibre. The source of soluble fibre selected was oat. The total, soluble and β-glucan (a particular form of soluble fibre) dietary fibre contents and the physical properties were of interest due to their influence on heart health benefits, product claims and sensory characteristics. The effect of formulation (starch level, starch type), enzyme treatment and extruder processing settings on the fibre content and physical properties of the puffed ingredient was investigated. It was found that soluble fibre increased during the extrusion process, partially at the expense of insoluble dietary fibre. However, β-glucan was found to decrease during processing. The level of starch in the formulation was found to have the most significant effect on both the physical and nutritional properties. Increasing the level of starch had a positive effect on the physical properties, but decreased dietary fibre levels. The <b>puffed</b> extrusion <b>product</b> contained a low level of β-glucan and a moderate level of total and soluble dietary fibre.

The total phenolic contents (TP) of the extruded products varied from 2088 to 3766 μg of gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight sample and retained 73 % to 83 % of the TP from the raw formulations after extrusion. The total anthocyanins contents (TA) in the extrudates were 0. 116 to 0. 228 mg of malvidin- 3 -glucosides/g dry weight sample. Compared with their raw formulations, significant losses (60 % to 70 %) of the TA in the extruded products occurred due to extrusion cooking. Browning indices and color attributes such as brightness, chroma, and hue angle agreed with degradation of anthocyanins in the extruded products. However, extrusion cooking retained antioxidant capacities of the raw formulations in the extruded products either in their natural forms or degraded products with radical scavenging activity. This study demonstrated {{the potential for the}} production of <b>puffed</b> extruded food <b>products</b> with the improved antioxidant content from colored potatoes and pulse formulations...|$|R
40|$|The larval {{salivary gland}} {{secretion}} genes (Sgs- 3, Sgs- 7 and Sgs- 8) at chromosome position 68 C in Drosophila melanogaster, are developmentally regulated and coordinately expressed. Each gene codes for {{a component of}} the mucoprotein glue which is synthesized in the third instar salivary glands. Expression of these three genes is associated with the 68 C intermolt puff present in the polytene chromosomes of the salivary gland secretory cells. Expression occurs only in the salivary glands of third instar larvae, and requires the steroid hormone ecdysterone. We show that synthesis of the 68 C glue gene RNAs is prevented in larvae carrying trans-acting mutations within the Broad-Complex (BR-C), while a puff persists at 68 C in these mutant larvae. We use the l(1) su(f) [superscript ts 67 g] mutation (which has reduced ecdysterone levels and also prevents 68 C glue gene expression) and a mutation in the BR-C (nprl[superscript 3]) to study the cis-acting elements responsible for interaction with trans-acting factors by analyzing the protein:DNA contacts which occur upstream of the Sgs- 3 glue gene during active synthesis, using in vivo DMS-footprinting. The proximal promoter can direct tissue- and stage-specific expression and is shown to possess three protein-binding domains. Comparison of contacts at these three domains between expressing and non-expressing tissues (including salivary glands from (l) su(f) [superscript ts 67 g] and nprl[superscript 3] mutant larvae) identifies a single binding domain responsible for controlling developmental expression of Sgs- 3. We also analyze the cis-acting sequences required for the chromosomal puffing associated with 68 C glue gene expression. Examination of various fragments of 68 C DNA reintroduced into the Drosophila chromosomes by P-element transformation identifies a region of 152 basepairs between Sgs- 7 and Sgs- 8 which is necessary, but not sufficient, to promote puffing. Only when this region is accompanied by an adjacent promoter element is there a puff. The insertion sites containing these reintroduced fragments fail to puff in mutant larvae; therefore, formation of the 68 C intermolt <b>puff</b> requires the <b>products</b> of the su(f) and BR-C loci, and the puff at 68 C in mutant larvae is not the same puff as that associated with expression of Sgs- 3, Sgs- 7 and Sgs- 8...|$|R
40|$|Third {{generation}} (3 G) is a {{term that}} refers to the levels of processing used to produce a finished product. A 3 G snack product starts with a starch based recipe that is extrusion cooked, formed into a dense shaped pellet and then dried. At this point, it {{is referred to as}} semi or half product because it needs to be further puffed to develop its texture and flavour. The objective of this project was to develop an unflavoured cereal-based 3 G snack formulation with ancient grains. The snack must be unique in shape and suitable for hot air-puffing. Two 3 G wholegrain base formulations were developed. One formulation was made from coarse rice flour, wholemeal wheat flour, potato starch, ancient grain blend (one third amaranth, one third quinoa and one third millet), wheat fibre 600 and salt. The second formulation was maize based by replacing coarse rice flour with maize polenta. These two base formulations contained ancient grains and nutrients that provide health benefits and were suitable for air-puffing. A lab-scale model Clextral BC 21 twin screw co-rotating extruder was used for this study. Pasting properties of samples were evaluated using the Rapid Visco Analyser. It was found that ingredient selection and extrusion processing affected extruded pellets’ paste viscosities, the die swell and product expansion. Pasting properties of raw ingredient blend were affected by amylose and lipid content, and particle size of the cereal flour. The more even the raw material particle size was, the more even was the hydration of the material in the extruder. The results showed that inclusion of dietary fibre (wheat fibre 600, Beneo GR or Hi-MaizeTM 1043) in the 3 G formulations decreased raw ingredients’ and extruded pellets’ paste viscosities, which resulted in reduced pellet expansion. It was found that wheat fibre 600 at 4 % was the best fibre choice to produce a 3 G snack, because it accelerated extruded pellet drying, helped in ‘pellet checking’ control and producing more uniform cell sized expanded products. Hi-MaizeTM ingredients were found to lead to the deterioration of viscosity and snack pellet expansion, and therefore not recommended to be used for 3 G snack base formulation. Increasing the water injection rate to the extruder (from 1. 0 to 1. 7 L/h) decreased the extruder apparent torque, thrust pressure, die pressure and SME. The degree of starch degradation was also reduced, but the product expansion was increased. Pellet expansion was found closely correlated to the pasting properties of the raw ingredient blend. Pellet expansion increased with the increase of peak viscosity (PV) and final viscosity (FV) of the raw ingredient blend. A suitable laboratory drying method was developed for 3 G snacks. It was found that drying and holding at 1 h ± 5 min intervals including a pre-drying step had minimal pellets defects. Humidity control (60 %) was required throughout this drying process. After <b>puffing,</b> the <b>product</b> sectional expansion index (SEI) increased with the increase in salt concentration from 0. 5 % to 1. 0 % and increase in moisture content from 9. 5 % to 12. 1 %. The extruded pellets moisture was found to have the most significant effect on the finished product expansion, and maximum expansion due to puffing was found at 10. 6 % pellet moisture. A shear-compression analysis of the 3 G product prototypes and competitor products showed that most of low moisture commercial snack products available in the market have low bulk density and were brittle. The products produced from the proposed 3 G formulations were much harder than the commercial products. Qualitative consumer focus group studies were conducted to gain insights into consumers’ attitudes towards extruded snacks, desirable texture and product claims {{to be included in the}} product. The results showed that five themes typically associated with snack consumption (nostalgia, special social occasions, distraction, convenient treat and hunger). Taste and price were the most important to the participants, and the health benefits were only an extra bonus. Participants were not tempted by an ancient grain claim. Product prototypes did not receive very positive feedback due to the taste and the product size. Product texture was found acceptable by most participants. This study produced initial formulations for a 3 G snack, provided a good starting point for understanding of the 3 G extruded snack process and provided valuable information for further development work. Further work is required to scale up the recipe, to increase the snack size, to further improve of the 3 G snack flavour without significantly increasing the salt content and to carry out a consumer acceptance study on the scaled up 3 G snack products...|$|R
