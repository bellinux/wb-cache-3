Stampfer chose to publish his invention {{in the shape of}} a disc.|$|E

50|$|In {{animation}} {{the effect}} was created long before the invention of film. A <b>phenakistiscope</b> designed by its inventor Joseph Plateau and/or painter Jean-Baptiste Madou was printed around 1835 and shows {{the head of a}} woman changing into a witch and then into a monster.|$|E
50|$|Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau (14 October 1801 - 15 September 1883) was a Belgian physicist. He {{was one of}} {{the first}} persons to {{demonstrate}} the illusion of a moving image. To do this he used counter rotating disks with repeating drawn images in small increments of motion on one and regularly spaced slits in the other. He called this device of 1832 the <b>phenakistiscope.</b>|$|E
50|$|The phénakisticope (better {{known as}} 'phenakistiscope' or the later {{misspelling}} 'phenakistoscope') {{was the first}} widespread animation device that created a fluent illusion of motion. The <b>phenakistiscope</b> is {{regarded as one of}} the first forms of moving media entertainment that paved the way for the future motion picture and film industry. It is sometimes compared to GIF animation since both show a short continuous loop.|$|E
50|$|He {{invented a}} motion picture {{projector}} in 1853, developing {{it over the}} years from 1845 from the device then called stroboscope (Simon von Stampfer) and <b>phenakistiscope</b> (Joseph Plateau). This was the first example of projected animation, demonstrated in 1853; it is also described as {{the combination of the}} zoetrope with the magic lantern. It was called the kinetoscope, a term later used by Thomas Edison (see kinetoscope). He applied it to lecture on ballistics.|$|E

5000|$|Humans have {{probably}} attempted to depict motion {{as far back}} as the paleolithic period. While there were several predecessors, the 17th century invention of the magic lantern provided the first apparatus with which convincing moving images have been created. However, the movement of these images were the result of moving parts rather than a rapid succession of sequential images. The introduction of the <b>phenakistiscope</b> in 1833 marks the start of true animation, although it could only show loops of a limited number of [...] "frames".|$|E
5000|$|The {{spelling}} 'phenakistiscope' {{was possibly}} introduced by lithographers Forrester & Nichol {{in collaboration with}} optician John Dunn; they used the title [...] "The <b>Phenakistiscope,</b> or, Magic Disc" [...] for their box sets, as advertised in September 1833. The corrupted part of the word, 'scope', was understood {{to be derived from}} Greek 'skopos', meaning [...] "aim", [...] "target", [...] "object of attention" [...] or [...] "watcher", [...] "one who watches" [...] and was quite common in the naming of optical devices (e.g. Telescope, Microscope, Kaleidoscope, Fantascope, Bioscope).|$|E
5000|$|Precursors of film {{are often}} {{referred}} to as pre-cinema, or 'precinema'. This term is disliked by several historians, partly because it seems to devalue the individual qualities of these media by presenting them as a small step {{in the development of a}} later invention. For instance: the flip book, zoetrope and <b>phenakistiscope</b> are very tactile devices that allow study and play by manipulating the motion by hand, while the projected image in cinema is untangible. [...] The study of precursors of film is also part of a wider and less teleological approach called media archaeology.|$|E
5000|$|It has {{sometimes}} been assumed that the relatively simple flip book {{has been around since}} long before the invention of the more complicated 19th century animation devices like the <b>phenakistiscope</b> (1832) and the zoetrope (1866), but no conclusive evidence has been found. There are some medieval illuminated books with sequential images, such as Sigenot (circa 1470). The illustrations in Sigenot are consistently framed and have short intervals between different phases of action, but the images can not produce the illusion of a fluent motion. The necessary notion of instances smaller than a second would not really develop before the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|The <b>phenakistiscope,</b> zoetrope, praxinoscope {{and flip}} book a.o. are {{often seen as}} {{precursors}} of film, leading to the invention of cinema {{at the end of}} the 19th century. In the 21st century this narrow teleological vision was questioned and the individual qualities of these media gained renewed attention of researchers in the fields of the history of film, science, technology and art. The new digital media raised questions about our knowledge of media history. The tactile qualities of optical toys that allow the viewer to study and play with the moving image in his own hands, seem more attractive in a time when digitalisation makes the moving image less tangible.|$|E
50|$|On 9 December 1824, Roget {{presented}} a paper entitled Explanation of an optical deception in {{the appearance of}} the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures. This article is often incorrectly referenced as either On the Persistence of Vision with Regard to Human Motion or Persistence of Vision with regard to Moving Objects, likely due to erroneous citations by film historians Terry Ramsaye and Arthur Knight (see Anderson and Anderson below). While Roget's explanation of the illusion was probably wrong, his consideration of the illusion of motion is seen as an important point in the history of film, and possibly influenced the development of the Thaumatrope, the <b>Phenakistiscope</b> and the Zoetrope.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>phenakistiscope</b> was {{the first}} {{animation}} device using rapid successive substitution of sequential pictures. The pictures are evenly spaced radially around the disk, with small rectangular apertures at {{the rim of the}} disc. The device would be placed {{in front of a mirror}} and spun. It was invented in November or December 1832, simultaneously by the Belgian Joseph Plateau and the Austrian Simon von Stampfer and first published about by Plateau in January 1833. It was very successful as a novelty toy and within a year very many sets of phénakisticopes were published across Europe, with almost as many different names for the device - including Fantascope (Plateau), The Stroboscope (Stampfer) and Phénakisticope (publisher Giroux & Cie).|$|E
40|$|This thesis reads {{selected}} {{works of}} fiction by three mid-Victorian writers (Charlotte Brontë, Charles Dickens, and George Eliot) alongside contemporaneous innovations and developments in moving-image technologies, or what have been referred to by historians of film as ‘pre-cinematic devices’. It looks specifically at the moving panorama, diorama, dissolving magic lantern slides, the kaleidoscope, and persistence of vision devices such as the <b>phenakistiscope</b> and zoetrope, and ranges across scientific writing, journalism, letters, and paintings to demonstrate the scope and popularity of visual motion devices. By exploring this history of optical technologies I show how their display, mechanism, and manual operation contributed to a broader cultural and literary interest in the phenomenological experience of animation, decades before the establishment of cinematography as an industry, technology, and viewing practice. Through a close reading {{of a range of}} mid-Victorian novels, this thesis identifies and analyses the literary use of language closely associated with moving-image technologies to argue that the Victorian literary imagination reflected upon, drew from, and incorporated reference to visual and technological animation many decades earlier than critics, focusing usually on early twentieth-century cinema and modernist literature, have allowed. It develops current scholarship on Victorian visual culture and optical technologies by a close reading of the language of moving-image devices—found in advertisements, reviews, and descriptions of their physiological operation and spectacle—alongside the choices Victorian authors made to describe precisely how their characters perceived, how they imagined, remembered, and mentally relived particular scenes and images, and how the readers of their texts were encouraged to imaginatively ‘see’ the animated unfolding of the plot and the material dimensionality of its world through a shared understanding of this language of moving images. ...|$|E
