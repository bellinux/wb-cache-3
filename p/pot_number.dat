60|$|The {{average height}} of the thirty-one crossed plants is 73.23 inches, {{and that of the}} thirty-one self-fertilised plants 77.41 inches; or as 100 to 106. Looking to each pair, it may be seen that only {{thirteen}} of the crossed plants, whilst eighteen of the self-fertilised plants exceed their opponents. A record was kept with respect to the plant which flowered first in each pot; and only two of the crossed flowered before one of the self-fertilised in the same pot; whilst eight of the self-fertilised flowered first. It thus appears that the crossed plants are slightly inferior in height and in earliness of flowering to the self-fertilised. But the inferiority in height is so small, namely as 100 to 106, that I should have felt very doubtful on this head, had I not cut down all the plants (except those in the crowded <b>pot</b> <b>Number</b> 10) close to the ground and weighed them. The twenty-seven crossed plants weighed 16 1/2 ounces, and the twenty-seven self-fertilised plants 20 1/2 ounces; and this gives a ratio of 100 to 124.|$|E

The seedlings thus raised formed the tenth intercrossed generation, and I will call them the [...] "INTERCROSSED PLANTS." [...] Several other {{flowers on the}} same crossed plants of the ninth generation were fertilised (not having been castrated) with pollen taken from plants of the same variety, but belonging to a distinct family, which had been grown in a distant garden at Colchester, and therefore under somewhat different conditions. The capsules produced by this cross contained, to my surprise, fewer and lighter seeds than did the capsules of the intercrossed plants; but this, I think, must have been accidental. The seedlings raised from them I will call the [...] "COLCHESTER-CROSSED."

60|$|In all the {{foregoing}} experiments, seedlings from flowers crossed by pollen from a distinct plant (though {{in the later}} generations more or less closely related) were put into competition with, and almost invariably proved markedly superior in height to the offspring from self-fertilised flowers. I wished, therefore, to ascertain whether a cross between two flowers on the same plant would give to the offspring any superiority over the offspring from flowers fertilised with their own pollen. I procured some fresh seed and raised two plants, which were covered with a net; and several of their flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct flower on the same plant. Twenty-nine capsules thus produced contained on an average 4.86 seeds per capsule; and 100 of these seeds weighed 36.77 grains. Several other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen, and twenty-six capsules thus produced contained on an average 4.42 seeds per capsule; 100 of which weighed 42.61 grains. So that a cross of this kind appears to have increased slightly the number of seeds per capsule, in the ratio of 100 to 91; but these crossed seeds were lighter than the self-fertilised in the ratio of 86 to 100. I doubt, however, from other observations, whether these results are fully trustworthy. The two lots of seeds, after germinating on sand, were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of nine pots, and were treated in every respect like the plants in the previous experiments. The remaining seeds, some {{in a state of}} germination and some not so, were sown on the opposite sides of a large <b>pot</b> (<b>Number</b> 10); and the four tallest plants on each side of this pot were measured.

6000|$|It follows {{also from}} the {{foregoing}} facts that the several varieties of the sweet-pea must have propagated themselves in England by self-fertilisation for very many generations, since the time when each new variety first appeared. From the analogy of the plants of Mimulus and Ipomoea, which had been self-fertilised for several generations, and from trials previously made with the common pea, which is in nearly the same state as the sweet-pea, it appeared to me very improbable that a cross between the individuals of the same variety would benefit the offspring. A cross of this kind was therefore not tried, which I now regret. But some flowers of the Painted Lady, castrated at an early age, were fertilised with pollen from the Purple sweet-pea; {{and it should be}} remembered that these varieties differ in nothing except in the colour of their flowers. The cross was manifestly effectual (though only two seeds were obtained), as was shown by the two seedlings, when they flowered, closely resembling their father, the Purple pea, excepting that they were a little lighter coloured, with their keels slightly streaked with pale purple. Seeds from flowers spontaneously self-fertilised under a net were at the same time saved from the same mother-plant, the Painted Lady. These seeds unfortunately did not germinate on sand at the same time with the crossed seeds, so that they could not be planted simultaneously. One of the two crossed seeds in a state of germination was planted in a <b>pot</b> (<b>Number</b> 1) in which a self-fertilised seed in the same state had been planted four days before, so that this latter seedling had a great advantage over the crossed one. In Pot 2 the other crossed seed was planted two days before a self-fertilised one; so that here the crossed seedling had a considerable advantage over the self-fertilised one. But this crossed seedling had its summit gnawed off by a slug, and was in consequence for a time quite beaten by the self-fertilised plant. Nevertheless I allowed it to remain, and so great was its constitutional vigour that it ultimately beat its uninjured self-fertilised rival.

40|$|Australia has a {{wide range}} of spiny (rock) lobster species but this review {{concentrates}} on the four largest commercial and recreational fisheries and their management. Jasus edwardsii supports significant commercial fisheries in South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and southern Western Australia, with an insignificant amount taken in southern New South Wales. Most of the southern rock lobster commercial fisheries in Australia operate under quota management with annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs) set for the fisheries; the exception to this is in Western Australia where the small J. edwardsii fishery currently operates as an input-controlled fishery. Although the New South Wales eastern rock lobster (Sagmariasus verreauxi) catch is small it forms the basis of an important cultural fishery. There has been an artisanal fishery on the tropical lobster (Panulirus ornatus) in the Torres Strait and the east coast of Papua New Guinea for hundreds of years. Commercial fishing is restricted to the indigenous Torres Strait Islanders a small number of non-indigenous Australians. It is managed under treaty arrangements with Papua New Guinea (PNG). The western rock lobster fishery for Panulirus cygnus is Australia’s largest commercial rock lobster fishery.

40|$|Although it is {{regarded}} as an important focus of brown crab Cancer pagurus landings, the fishery in south east Ireland is poorly documented and the official statistics are believed to under-record the species {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3. This appraisal of the south east Ireland brown crab fishery is based on > 22, 000 records of sales transactions from the 1990 s and a comparison of the biological characteristics of landings in the late 1960 s with thirty years later, in the context of increasing fishing effort. The three buyers who gave access to their books inwards for periods of the 1990 s, purchase from the same fishing community and they compete for product but they occupy slightly different market niches: a vivier truck operator exports to Spain, a processor concentrates on autumn purchases of female crab for vacuum packing while the third buys crab claws for human consumption and crab bodies which are used as bait for whelk Buccinum undatum. Only the first sales of crab from 55 km of coastline are considered. In this area fishing effort doubled between 1972 and 1988 but expansion accelerated in the following decade by at least 128 %; a single operator increased his effort by 80 % between 1988 and 1998. In the 30 years after 1968, the number of pots per km of coastline rose by 241 %. The sale of brown crab is recorded in consignments which are raised to live weights in the analysis. Consignment size fell steeply in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s after which it stabilised; adjusting the figures to allow for increasing effort accentuated the trend; at the same time consignment number rose. Allowing that a decline in consignment size was accompanied by an increase in <b>pot</b> <b>number,</b> consignment number should have risen by 310 % to maintain landings at the level recorded in 1990; the largest recorded increase in consignment number was by 230 % and while it is accepted that all sales transactions have not been obtained, it is likely that LPUE has been declining over the 1990 s in real terms in this fishery. Increasing fishing effort during that time is seen as a product of better technology, stimulated by a desire to compensate for falling LPUE. Comparison of size and sex composition of the landings recorded in the late 1960 s and the late 1990 s are inconclusive. Depth of water and type of substratum are likely to influence the composition of inshore landings. An argument is presented that the south east inshore crab fishery is fully or over-exploited. It is likely to have an offshore component and such occasional data as are available on brown crab further south suggest that the offshore is an under-exploited fishery.

Con ventional propagation alone does not provide clean and adequate planting material demanded in Ethiopia.

On the A factor the lettuce types (summer crisp and butterhead) were allocated and, on B, the densities of ryegrass (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 plants per <b>pot).</b> The <b>number</b> of leaves, chlorophyll content, leaf area, green mass and dry mass of the lettuce types and ryegrass were evaluated, and the diameter of the culture stem and the tiller number of the weed were determined. Differences in competitive ability between the lettuce types in competition with ryegrass were found, and butterhead was the most competitive when compared with summer crisp for all variables studied. There was an average loss of leaf area in lettuce types of up to 80 % when it competed with ryegrass in the populations involved. Ryegrass is a very competitive weed to infect lettuce, and its handling is necessary, even at low densities to avoid productivity losses. The butterhead type of lettuce supports longer competition with ryegrass compared to summer crisp...|$|R
40|$|Heavy {{metals content}} of Fe, Mn and Cu in soil and Nepenthes sp. {{in a former}} iron and tin mining land at Lombong Pelepah Kanan, Kota Tinggi, Johor were {{determined}}. Heavy metal content were determined in four plant component namely roots, stems, leaves and <b>pots.</b> A <b>number</b> of 15 Nepenthes sp. plants and their corresponding substrate samples were collected for analysis. The composition of heavy metals in soil were extracted using mixture of nitric acid and perchloric acid. Heavy metals content in plants sample were extracted by wet digestion method. Heavy metal content in solution extract of soil and plant component were determined with Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS). The BAC (Biological Absorption Coefficient) was calculated as ratio of the heavy metal concentration in plant to that of its substrate. The analyses of soil showed that the former mining area was dominated by sand and acidic. It also has a low content of organic matter and low reading of soil electrical conductivity. The soil contain higher concentration of Fe followed by Mn and Cu. Based on BAC value Nepenthes sp {{can be used as}} a bio-indicator for Fe...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of applying petrographic analysis to ceramics was first fully realised by Anna Shepard in her seminal studies on prehistoric pottery from Mesoamerica and the Southwest United States in the 1930 s (Shepard 1956). She demonstrated how effectively petrography {{could be used}} to answer archaeological questions concerning provenance and technology. Ceramic petrography applied to Old World pottery really took off with the work of David Peacock in England during the 1960 s (Peacock 1970). From these beginnings the technique of ceramic petrography developed, and its use in the study of archaeological ceramics grew, nowhere quite so rapidly as in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The theme for this section of Internet Archaeology was suggested to me by Alan Vince after a particularly popular joint meeting of the Ceramic Petrology Group and Near Eastern Ceramic Research Association at the British Museum in November 1998, on the theme of cooking <b>pots.</b> A <b>number</b> of the papers presented at that meeting, together with papers from other workers in the field of ceramic petrography, have formed the basis for this section on the application of ceramic petrography to pottery from the Eastern Mediterranean. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} sesame {{leachate}} on the sprouting, growth and biochemical parameters of purple nutsedge was studied. The photosynthetic pigments, protein, sugar, lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase were considered as indicator for {{the estimation of}} effects of various concentration of leachate {{on the health of}} purple nutsedge plant. Allelochemicals present in sesame leachate inhibited sprouting of tubers of the nutsedge. In the <b>pot</b> culture <b>numbers</b> of leaves, plant height, dry weight, the photosynthetic pigments Chl a, Chl b and carotenoids and protein decreased with the increase in the concentration of sesame leaf leachate. Amount of malondialdehyde recorded maximum value in 100 % concentration of the leachate. The activity of superoxide dismutase decreased in the highest concentration of leachate which indicated the failure of antioxidant defense. The leachate of sesame influenced biophysical and biochemical parameters. The decrease in growth, photosynthetic pigment, activity of antioxidant reflects that sesame leachate may help control growth of obnoxious weed, Cyperus rotundus L. It contributed to the development of new cropping system based on use of sesame as bioherbicide to control weeds. It may help reduce the use of weedicides and pesticides for the sustainable agriculture...|$|R
5000|$|The Kerameikos was the potters' {{quarter of}} Athens. It {{contained}} {{a variety of}} small workshops, and probably a few larger ones. In 1852, during building activity in Ermou Street, the workshop of the Jena Painter was discovered. The artefacts from it are now {{on display in the}} University collection of the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena. [...] According to modern research, the workshops were owned by the potters. The names of about 40 Attic vase painters are known, from vase inscriptions, usually accompanied by the words [...] (égrapsen, has painted). In contrast, the signature of the potter, [...] (epoíesen, has made) has survived on more than twice as many, namely about 100, <b>pots</b> (both <b>numbers</b> refer to the totality of Attic figural vase painting). Although signatures had been known since c. 580 BC (first known signature by the potter Sophilos), their use increased to an apex around the Pioneering Phase. A changing, apparently increasingly negative, attitude to artisans led to a reduction of signatures, starting during the Classical period at the latest. Overall, signatures are quite rare. The fact that they are mostly found on especially good pieces indicates that they expressed the pride of potter and/or painter.|$|R
40|$|Australia’s western rock lobster {{fishery is}} its most {{valuable}} and hence from a biological perspective most tightly managed major commercial fishery, {{yet it has}} been beset by problems of miniscule recruitment over the past 3 years. This coming year 2010 - 11 is little better. It was the joint first Marine Stewardship Council certified fishery - first in April 2001, recertified in 2006 and again in Jan 2010. Despite this, it has suffered all the well known problems of first, an open access fishery, and even in its current management mode of a total effort controlled fishery – based on total number of pots- is subject to ever shortening seasons and only moderate prices {{as a result of}} “the race to fish”. The paper first presents the results of a bio-economic model on the comparative costs and benefits of an ITQ versus ITE system for this fishery. The results were derived from a purpose built bioeconomic model with three separate bio-geographic zones in the fishery using non linear optimization to produce ten year steady state solutions for alternative management options. Management options included the current pot control system, and several versions of an individual transferable catch quota system. Key outputs for each scenario include: net economic benefits, breeder biomass index, annual catch, annual <b>pot</b> lifts, <b>number</b> of <b>pots</b> and vessel <b>numbers.</b> The results indicate significant potential net economic gains from moving away from the current input control regime. The range of scenarios modeled illustrated some of the tradeoffs between maximizing net economic returns and minimizing biological risks, as well as quantifying the impact of changes such as an extended fishing season. The paper highlights the issues faced by most fisheries during their lifespan - from a progressive concentration of fishing and processing effort with business diversification and monopoly-like behaviour attempting to reduce/diversify risk by its most successful participants – to an industry in crisis simply fighting for its survival. The paper illustrates why undiversified fishing in such a situation as ITEs is too risky even for vertically integrated fishing and marketing companies. The current situation is forcing a major rethink by the industry’s leaders with ITQs again on the agenda to replace the current failed individual total effort (ITE) limit policy...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the primary root {{development}} of {{the one of the}} most important grass weeds - large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop). The primary, secondary and tertiary root development was studied in laboratory (thermostat), and in pots in 1994, 1995 and 1997. Each year we sowed the seeds 1 cm deep in the <b>pots</b> separately. The <b>number</b> of days required for the change of the early root system from the sowing 17 - 24 days. The average leaf number in the root change period was 4 and varied in between 3 to 5. We also observed that the date of sowing during the summer months (June, July and August) did not influence the change of the early root system...|$|R
