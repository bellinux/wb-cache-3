Combustion instabilities near the lean limit can be addressed by partially stratifying the in-cylinder charge.

An experimental premixing apparatus was devised to investigate the effect of changing the stoichiometry of the micro-direct-injected charge.

50|$|The {{fuel tank}} {{must first be}} {{pressurized}} by using the small hand-pump {{on the side of}} the stove. After pumping, the control valve is opened just slightly, allowing a mix of fuel (drawn from the bottom of the tank) and pressurized air (drawn from the top of the tank) to reach the burner head. There, the mixture is ignited using a match or lighter. Once the flame burns steadily for 2 to 3 minutes and the burner head is sufficiently heated up, the control valve is opened as far as possible. This cuts off the air from the tank, changing the mix to <b>pure</b> <b>fuel.</b> The heat of the burner head is then sufficient to vaporize the <b>pure</b> <b>fuel</b> prior to combustion.

BDF {{is one of the}} hydrocarbon fuels. Palm oil Biodiesel is free from sulfur and produced by esterification and transesterification reaction of vegetable oil with low molecular weight alcohol, such as ethanol or methanol. The objective of this research is to introduce the mixing injector fuel and water-fuel emulsion for open burner and analyze the behavior of mixture spray formation during fuel-air premixing. Premix injector use for external combustion especially open burner system. The disadvantages of BDF are high toxic emissions such as NOx, CO and particular matter (PM) and but it can reduced the performance of burner system. High toxic emission can be solved by using a new concept injector with mixing fuel-water emulsion and air. The additional water for combustion process can reduce the NOx emissions, soot, and the flame temperature. This research focuses the Spray angle, penetration, and flame length with secondary and without secondary air. CPO biodiesel has longer penetration length and spray area than diesel, but the spray angle is smaller than diesel.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the modelling of heating and evaporation of dual-fuel droplets with a specific application to blends of biodiesel (represented by the widely used soybean methyl ester, SME) and Diesel fuels in conditions representative of internal combustion engines. The original compositions, with up to 105 components of Diesel and biodiesel fuels, are replaced with a smaller number of components and quasi-components using the recently introduced multi-dimensional quasi-discrete (MDQD) model. Transient diffusion of these components and quasi-components in the liquid phase and temperature gradient and recirculation inside droplets are taken into account. The results are compared with the predictions of the case when blended biodiesel/Diesel fuel droplets are represented by <b>pure</b> biodiesel <b>fuel</b> or <b>pure</b> Diesel <b>fuel</b> droplets. It is shown that droplet evaporation time and surface temperature predicted for 100 % SME, representing <b>pure</b> biodiesel <b>fuel,</b> are close to those predicted for <b>pure</b> Diesel <b>fuel.</b> Also, it is shown that the approximations of the actual compositions of B 5 (5 % SME and 95 % Diesel) and B 50 (50 % SME and 50 % Diesel) dual-fuels by 17 quasi-components/components, using the MDQD model, lead to under-predictions in droplet lifetimes by up to 9 % and 4 %, respectively, under the same engine conditions. The application of the latter model has resulted in above 83 % reduction in CPU time compared to the case when all 105 components are taken into account using the discrete component model...|$|R
