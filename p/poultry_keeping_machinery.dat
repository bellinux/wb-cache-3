That potential notwithstanding, the sub sector is facing several production constraints that have limited its potentials for contributing to poverty alleviation. The constraints include low management capacity, low genetic potentials, diseases and poor marketing strategies. Diseases are the major constraint, and in particular New Castle Disease (NCD), which causes high mortality of up to 100 % of the stock. Despite the mentioned constraints local chicken are birds found almost in all farmer households in the rural areas. That situation {{is an indication that}} local chicken is an economic opportunity of which farmers can learn easily the entrepreneurial skills required for making local <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> a reliable source for income generation and household food security. Thus, through capacity building farmers can develop the necessary attitude, knowledge and skills for <b>keeping</b> local <b>poultry</b> as an economic enterprise. Guided by the possibilities for developing enterprising local poultry keepers, the study focused on designing and implementing process for improving capacity of members of local <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> group. Through capacity building to the members the expected outcome is productivity improvement and enhancement of income from the sales of chicken products. The members involved in the local <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> are 36 of which women are 24 and 12 men. The group is located in Kisesa village in Magu district. The overall objective for establishing the project is to put in place a reliable source of income to members through productivity improvement of the local poultry.

Prior to project intervention, the CNA exercise was conducted which came up with the community needs and challenges. The main challenge unveiled with CNA exercise which faces rural women in Chessa Village was income poverty. Rural women were socially oppressed, legally ignored, politically exploited and technologically deprived and subordinated as a production unit for bearing and rearing children. Therefore, Chessa rural women can be considered as underprivileged and less developed. It is expected that the participation of women in IGAs can contribute to enabling households to cope with income shocks, to ensure food security, to avoid an increase in poverty or to prevent vulnerable households from falling below the poverty line. Women’s income is important for achieving economic growth and sustainable development in Chessa Village and thus, their economic contributions should be given importance in policy design. From this study now, the researcher helped rural women to form a group (Upendo group) and came up with the conclusion that in order to eliminate the distressed condition of rural women and bring them to the main stream of development for achieving a sustainable livelihood, Upendo group need to be involved in income generating activities much more actively.

The birds are kept free to forage and are produced with human domestic food residues and local grains. In such type of <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping,</b> production was too low, because of poor management inadequate nutrition and poor genetic constitution of the local birds. The cost of production is negligible. Recently the poultry industry in the Sudan began to develop, but facing many problems. The feeding of poultry represents about 70 % of total cost of production, for provision of balanced rations contains all nutrient requirements of birds in adequate quantities, and proper ratios. Protein {{is an important component}} in poultry rations, and is derived from different sources such as cakes (groundnut cake nut and sesame), which are used as the main plant protein sources. Incorporation of plant protein sources in poultry ration, would not meet the requirements of certain essential amino acids, which consequently, necessitates the use of animal protein supplements such as fish meal and blood or meat meal. Furthermore, excessive heat treatment during the processing of soybeans meal results in binding and destruction of certain amino acidity, which make them unavailable, Thus adding to the problem associated with the utilization of plant protein in poultry feeding. The inclusion of synthetic amino acids may become a reasonable solution in this respect.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries village <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> is regarded an important livelihood {{opportunity for the}} poor. To improve poultry systems, {{it is necessary to}} keep in mind a large number of local complexities. This study aimed to integrate participatory-, survey- and model-based approaches to socio-technical analysis and mutual farmer-researcher learning about constraints to and opportunities for village poultry development in Ethiopia. The study applied a combined technography and systems approach as an input in analyzing possibilities for poultry development in terms of context-mechanism-outcome. To this end it used as data collection methods individual and open-group interviews, a cross-sectional stratified random survey, farm-recording, a market survey, and village-poultry modelling. Feed-back workshops were organised to share between farmers and researchers the data collected through farm-recording and to learn about outcomes of simulation scenarios for identifying improvement options of village poultry systems. Village poultry significantly contributed to the livelihoods of poor households: economically as starter capital, as a means to recover from disasters, as an accessible protein source and for income and exchange purposes, and socio-culturally for mystical functions, hospitality and exchange of gifts to strengthen social relationships. Poor households used sharing arrangements to have access to poultry. Distance to markets influenced flock sizes and poultry marketing organization. Religious festival days were associated with increased poultry consumption and sales, and fasting periods with decreased consumption. Farm-recording was as a first entry point to learn about how farmers participate in research. It transpired that researchers needed to understand the religious and customary norms of the community and adjust the data collection tools and procedures to fit these norms. As a second entry point, farm recording information was presented back to farmers to validate the data and to discuss with farmers the reasons of variation between households. A third entry point for sharing between researchers and farmers was modelling and simulation. Information from literature was used for development of a village-poultry model. The study documented experiences of how the modelling process was used to engage farmers and researchers in joint learning about village <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping.</b> The present study has indicated that through the combination of multiple approaches and methods researchers can arrive at better understanding of constraints affecting farmers’ reality. This implies more relevant problem definition and therefore a potentially more effective technology development process.
