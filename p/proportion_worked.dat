40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} a profile of the oral hygienists in South Africa, their views on the profession, work-place, and the practice of their career, which aspects of the work they enjoy and which are not enjoyable, their opinions on expanding duties for hygienists and which duties should be included, and their perceptions about the status and importance of oral hygienists vis-à-vis other health providers. A questionnaire was sent to every third registered oral hygienist and 47 per cent responded. The majority who responded were in the age group 20 to 39 years, had been in practice for less than 15 years, were married, qualified at the Universities of Pretoria and Stellenbosch, and were employed in traditional practice. The larger <b>proportion</b> <b>worked</b> individually and practised from six to eight hours per day. They were happy with the training they received, believed their job was worthwhile, were satisfied with their careers and enjoyed a cordial relationship with dentists. Motivating, educating, assisting patients and communicating with people were the most enjoyable aspects of practice while procedures associated with the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis and the poor response of patients to treatment were the least enjoyable. The majority preferred expanded duties for hygienists which should include elementary dentistry, local anaesthesia, minor extractions and emergency treatment and they also desired greater independence. Seventy-eight per cent felt that the public does not know what oral hygiene is. The status and importance of the profession were rated comparable to that of physiotherapists, qualified nurses, radiographers and dental therapists but significantly higher than dental assistants.

40|$|Introduction: Migrants {{comprise}} a growing {{proportion of the}} dental workforce in Australia. To date, research on migrant dentists is limited, raising policy questions regarding the motivations for migration, demographic proﬁles and work patterns. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to present ﬁndings from the ﬁrst national survey of migrant dentists in Australia. Methods: All dentists with a primary dental qualiﬁcation from an overseas institution and registered with the Australian Dental Association (n = 1, 872) or enrolled as a graduate student in any of the nine dental schools in Australia (n = 105) were surveyed between January and May 2013. Results: A total of 1, 022 participants (response rate = 54. 5 %) were classiﬁable into three migrant dentist groups: direct recognition (n = 491); Australian Dental Council (ADC) (n = 411); and alternative pathway (n = 120). Overall, 41. 8 % of migrant dentists were female. More than half of the ADC group (54. 1 %) were from lower middle income countries. The most frequent motivation for migration according to the direct recognition group (21. 1 %) was ‘adventure’, whereas other groups migrated for ‘better opportunity’. The majority of ADC respondents (65 %) were under 45 years of age, and a larger <b>proportion</b> <b>worked</b> in the most disadvantaged areas (12. 4 %), compared with other groups. Gender, marital status, years since arrival in Australia and having children varied between the groups (chi square; P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Dentist groups migrate to Australia for different reasons. The large proportion of the migrant dentist workforce sourced from lower middle income countries points towards deﬁciencies in oral health systems both for these countries and for Australia. The feminisation of the migrant dentist proﬁle could in future affect dentist-practice activity patterns in Australia. Further research, especially on the settlement experiences of these dentists, can provide better insights into issues faced by these dentists, the nature of support that migrant dentists receive in Australia, the probable future patterns of work and potential impact on the dental work- force and dental service provision.
