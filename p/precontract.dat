40|$|Background and purpose: Recent {{studies on}} blood vessels have {{provided}} evidence that testosterone may exert direct effects on smooth muscle. However, an acute effect on airway reactivity {{has not been}} shown yet. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the direct effect of testosterone on the responsiveness of male adult rabbit airway smooth muscle (ASM), <b>precontracted</b> with 10 mu M acetylcholine, 10 mu M carbachol or 80 mM KCl. Experimental approach: Contractility studies of rabbit tracheal smooth muscle were performed. Key results: Testosterone at concentrations of or above 1 nM had a significant relaxant effect on ASM <b>precontracted</b> with acetylcholine or carbachol, but did not affect ASM <b>precontracted</b> with KCl. The mechanical removal of airway epithelium as well as the inhibition of NO synthetase (by 100 mu M L-NAME) reduced the relaxation caused by testosterone. The effect of testosterone was not altered by impairing prostanoid synthesis (by 10 mM indomethacin). The nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside, had the same relaxant effect on ASM <b>precontracted</b> with either carbachol or KCl. Inhibitors of androgen receptors (10 mM flutamide) or DNA transcription (100 mM actinomycin D) did not alter the effect of testosterone. Prolonged incubation of ASM with 100 nM or 100 mM testosterone for 24 or 48 h did not alter their responsiveness to acetylcholine. BSAtestosterone (1 pM to 100 nM) relaxed significantly ASM <b>precontracted</b> with carbachol. The mechanical removal of airway epithelium abolished the relaxant effect of BSA-testosterone. Conclusions and implications: Testosterone relaxes <b>precontracted</b> ASM via an epithelium and NO-mediated way. This effect is mediated via a non-genomic pathway...|$|R

The act also contained charges of witchcraft against Elizabeth, but gave no details and had no further repercussions. As a consequence, the Duke of Gloucester and Lord Protector was offered the throne and became King Richard III.

40|$|Bitter tastants can induce {{relaxation}} in <b>precontracted</b> airway {{smooth muscle}} by activating big-conductance potassium channels (BKs) or by inactivating voltage-dependent L-type Ca 2 + channels (VDLCCs). In this study, a new pathway for bitter tastant-induced relaxation was defined and investigated. We found nifedipine-insensitive and bitter tastant chloroquine-sensitive relaxation in epithelium-denuded mouse tracheal rings (TRs) <b>precontracted</b> with acetylcholine (ACH). In {{the presence of}} nifedipine (10 µM), ACH induced cytosolic Ca 2 + elevation and cell shortening in single airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), and these changes were inhibited by chloroquine. In TRs, ACH triggered a transient contraction under Ca 2 +-free conditions, and, following a restoration of Ca 2 +, a strong contraction occurred, which was inhibited by chloroquine. Moreover, the ACH-activated whole-cell and single channel currents of non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) were blocked by chloroquine. Pyrazole 3 (Pyr 3), an inhibitor of transient receptor potential C 3 (TRPC 3) channels, partially inhibited ACH-induced contraction, intracellular Ca 2 + elevation, and NSCC currents.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of aging on endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxation of rabbit thoracic aorta from New Zealand white rabbits aged 4 - 6 and 7 - 12 months. The contractile response to noradrenaline (NA) decreased with increasing age, but NA [EC 50] did not vary significantly.

The relaxation induced by ATP of aortic rings, <b>precontracted</b> with NA [EC 50], was significantly greater in young than in adult rabbits. This difference between young and adult animals became more evident in aortic rings deprived of endothelium: in adult animals, the ATP-induced relaxation of aortic rings with endothelium was significantly greater than in the rings without endothelium. The endothelium-independent relaxation by sodium nitrite (NaNO 2) at lower concentrations was significantly greater in young than in adult rabbit aortic rings <b>precontracted</b> with NA [EC 50].

The betrothal cannot be documented beyond the account rehearsed in Titulus Regius, and Richard never attempted to have the <b>precontract</b> authenticated by a church court, the proper venue for such a case". Anne Crawford takes the view that any actual <b>precontract</b> with Eleanor Talbot is unlikely. If it had occurred before her marriage to Thomas Butler {{it would have been}} invalidated by the marriage. She suggests that the story may have originated with discussions between Edward's father Richard, Duke of York, and Elizabeth's father John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, of a possible marriage, while both men were serving in France. But even that [...] "seems hardly likely". Any valid <b>precontract</b> would most likely {{have been made in the}} early phase of Edward's reign, but the fact that Eleanor did not come forward when Edward married his queen militates against it. She also considers it odd that Eleanor's family did not support Richard's claims about the <b>precontract.</b> Since Edward was [...] "not stupid enough" [...] to have been unaware that any precontact would threaten his children's claim to the throne, if it had existed he could easily have applied to the Pope to free himself of it, which would have been the action of [...] "any prudent king and his advisors". Michael Alexander argues that a <b>precontract</b> of marriage to Eleanor Talbot would not have affected the legitimacy of Edward's sons, since they were born after she died, her death negating any marriage.|$|E
