The <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> that followed Wang Mang's usurpation {{led to another}} wave of Chinese migration. Han settlers and soldiers from the north were affected by diseases common in tropical regions, such as malaria and schistosomiasis.|$|E
5|$|Cimon, on {{the other}} hand, {{apparently}} believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles' reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E

50|$|Perlstein also {{presents}} a broader overview of The Sixties' cultural and <b>political</b> <b>turmoils,</b> including the 1968 Democratic Convention, but, {{as the book}} ends with Nixon's reelection in 1972, only peripherally covers Watergate.|$|R
50|$|Because of the <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> in Guatemala, in 2015, Ambassador Carrera {{requested}} {{publicly for}} {{the resignation of}} president Perez Molina. After manifesting it in an opinion editorial, he presented his resignation to his post at the UN on August 25, 2015.|$|R
5|$|During {{this time}} of <b>political</b> <b>turmoil,</b> Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna {{personally}} led an army to end the revolt. The Mexican expedition was initially successful. General José de Urrea defeated all the Texian resistance along the coast culminating in the Goliad massacre. Santa Anna's forces, after a thirteen-day siege, overwhelmed Texian defenders at the Battle of the Alamo. News of the defeats sparked panic amongst Texas settlers.|$|E
5|$|Fleeing {{religious}} persecution and <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> in Britain, the Priestleys {{emigrated to the}} United States in 1794 seeking a peaceful life. Hoping to avoid the political troubles that had plagued them in Britain and the problems of urban life they saw in the United States, the Priestleys built a house in rural Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, political disputes and family troubles dogged Priestley during {{the last ten years}} of his life.|$|E
5|$|Luperón would {{eventually}} arrive in Paris as a named ambassador, but Betances' {{connections in the}} city proved to be key to whatever success Luperón had as a diplomat in France. They would assume this role until <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> in the Dominican Republic forced Luperón to return and lead yet another revolt, which had another Puerto Plata native, Ulises Heureaux, installed as president. Betances sought support for Luperón's efforts, and gave him tactical and financial assistance from France.|$|E

25|$|Poetry {{certainly}} {{occurred during}} Western Jin (265–316). Some {{of it is}} haunted by the social and <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> involved with the various changes of the times.

The {{final years of}} his life were devoted to educational and social work.|$|R
5|$|Pierce and his {{administration}} used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency. The <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the Know Nothings, and the founding of the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to attend}} school in Buenos Aires due to the <b>political</b> <b>turmoil,</b> Sarmiento chose to fight against Quiroga.

He is later released, only to join the forces of General Paz, a key unitarian figure.|$|E
5|$|After Blake's funeral, Manhattan {{is accused}} on {{national}} television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As Manhattan {{is one of the}} United States' greatest military powers, his departure throws humanity into <b>political</b> <b>turmoil,</b> with the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness. Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain, and imprisoned.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other Red Cross and Red Crescent {{societies}} worldwide, {{which are}} notable for their humanitarian effort, Hong Kong Red Cross {{is better known}} for blood transfusion in Hong Kong. This {{may be due to}} a few disasters threatening and <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> in the territory, also its long history of service from 1952. The blood transfusion service runs under the Hospital Authority.|$|R
40|$|A {{middle class}} in modern {{societies}} often causes political ferment and spearheads mass movements against the status quo. The <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> that swept Brazil, Bulgaria and Turkey in 2013 provide recent examples. The demonstrations in Turkey grew from a protest against plans for a construction project; an increase in public transport prices triggered the protests in Brazil; and the government corruption and cronyism set off the protests in Bulgaria...|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} Oresteia, set in modern Greece, is {{presented}} in 1975 film The Travelling Players by Theo Angelopoulos. Chrysothemis is an important figure here apart from Clytemnestra, Aegisthus, Agamemnon and Pylades. She was invented by Sophocles as Electra's sister and {{does not appear in}} Aeschylus where Iphigeneia is sacrificed. Angelopoulos represents through this tragedy the history of 20th-century Greece, the <b>political</b> <b>turmoils,</b> widespread <b>political</b> violence, fratricide through civil war and foreign intervention.|$|R
5|$|Although Rome {{at first}} rejoiced at {{the demise of}} Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more {{extensive}} trials, as Tiberius persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath. Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro. The <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> continued until the death of Tiberius in AD 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.|$|E
5|$|At her new job, Goldman met {{a fellow}} worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared {{her love for}} books, dancing, and traveling, {{as well as her}} {{frustration}} with the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} minded man, {{lived in a}} period of <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> in France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.|$|E
2500|$|This {{situation}} changed due to {{an external}} shock [...] the crisis and Dissolution of the Soviet Union [...] and an internal one [...] the Tangentopoli corruption scandal and operation Mani pulite (Italian for [...] "Clean Hands"). These international and national <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> led to the reform of the electoral system (from almost perfect proportional to uninominal/multi-seat circumscriptions) and radical restructuring of the Italian political system, including the dissolution of most traditional political parties, including Christian Democracy and Communist Party.|$|R
50|$|The {{subsequent}} Sino-Soviet split {{ended the}} promising future; from July 28 to September 1, 1960, the Soviet Union had quickly withdrawn {{all of its}} advisers from China. Compounding the problem were domestic <b>political</b> <b>turmoils,</b> such as the Great Leap Forward. The 7th Academy consequently ordered the 705th Research Institute to lead a team consisting of No. 724 Factory, Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) in Houma, Shanxi, and East Wind Instrumentation Factory (东风仪表厂) in Xi'an to indigenously manufacture Soviet-designed compressed-oxygen-powered torpedoes.|$|R
50|$|During <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> {{and lack}} of {{security}} in {{the final years of}} Qajar dynasty that led to establishment of Pahlavi dynasty, Kadkhodas were the only point of authority in the face of increasing lawlessness. There are stories about Mashadi Mirza Alian, an elder from Haj Mohammad Rahim clan, who was the Kadkhoda of the time, ruled with occasional harsh penalties for robberies and adultery. On the other hands there are tales of generosity and helping of poor during the famine of those years.|$|R
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained {{a source of inspiration}} throughout her life.|$|E
5|$|Kubah was {{inspired}} by Indonesian history, beginning in the 1940s and continuing until the 1980s. Following the national revolution from 1945 to 1949, the country was set {{in a state of}} <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> and abject poverty which became increasingly severe {{towards the end of the}} 1950s. By the early 1960s the PKI and other leftist parties had the support of President Sukarno, giving them greater power; PKI membership grew quickly in this period, aided by a hyperinflation and widespread poverty.|$|E
5|$|<b>Political</b> <b>turmoil</b> in Ireland {{continued}} as the Nationalists fought for independence; George expressed his horror at government-sanctioned killings and reprisals to Prime Minister David Lloyd George. At the opening {{session of the}} Parliament of Northern Ireland on 22 June 1921, the King appealed for conciliation in a speech part drafted by General Jan Smuts and approved by Lloyd George. A few weeks later, a truce was agreed. Negotiations between Britain and the Irish secessionists led to {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Irish Treaty. By the end of 1922, Ireland was partitioned, the Irish Free State was established, and Lloyd George was out of office.|$|E

Pasteur gave him an appointment at the Pasteur Institute, where he remained {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|R
60|$|These views, so {{just and}} so spirited, {{advanced}} with high-bred earnestness by one rarely met in <b>political</b> <b>turmoils,</b> and enforced with a freshness and an affable simplicity which were very winning, wonderfully encouraged {{those to whom}} they were addressed. All seemed touched by the flame which burned in the breast of that man, so lofty in his thoughts but so humble in his ambition, who counselled ever the highest deeds, and was himself ever prepared to undertake the humblest duties.|$|R
5000|$|Legend of Tianyun Mountain (...) is a 1980 Chinese {{film about}} Chinese people's sufferings from the {{long-term}} political campaigns from [...] "Anti-rightists" [...] in 1950s {{until the fall}} of Gang of Four. It depicted the individuals' hardship in the <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> and critically reflected the impact of that special history after {{the formation of the}} People's Republic of China. The film was based on the novel written by Lu Yanzhou, and was directed by Xie Jin, starring Wang Fuli, Shi Weijian, Zhong Xinghuo and Shi Jianlan.|$|R
5|$|This {{ambiguity}} of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, {{and as he}} grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing. Indeed, {{by the age of}} eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the <b>political</b> <b>turmoil</b> of the 60s, culminating with the civil war of 69, which brought his family to power.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1990, after the first {{democratic}} elections in Croatia, the municipal government finally approved the project. An architectural competition was planned for January 1991. <b>Political</b> <b>turmoil</b> in the country, followed by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995), caused the project {{to be put on}} hold again. In 1994 President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman said to Jakov Bienenfeld, Council member of the Zagreb Jewish community, that they should build the new synagogue {{at the site of the}} former synagogue, which will be funded by the Croatian government. Bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when 1800 Catholic churches are left destroyed at the time, during Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's role in {{politics}} was diminishing when on 16 October 1551 Seymour {{was arrested on}} charges of treason. In December he was put on trial and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of felony and put to death on 22 January 1552. This {{was the beginning of}} the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency. However, even throughout this <b>political</b> <b>turmoil,</b> Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of canon law, the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.|$|E

Set in Bertolucci's ancestral region of Emilia, {{the film is}} a praise of communism and chronicles the lives of two men during the <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> {{that took place in}} Italy {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.|$|R
25|$|After World War I and the {{dissolution}} of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the Supreme Court by law became the court of last resort for civil and criminal proceedings in the territory of German Austria, and the highest court according to the 1920 Constitution of the First Austrian Republic. The <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> during the inter-war period culminated in the Vienna Palace of Justice fire (Wiener Justizpalastbrand) on 15 July 1927, whereby large parts of the building were devastated. During the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1945, the OGH's jurisdictions were transferred to the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court) in Leipzig.|$|R
2500|$|The walled {{city was}} at the {{forefront}} of the <b>political</b> <b>turmoils</b> during the Reconquista, transited by armies and sacked by enemies. Chaves was built, destroyed, and rebuilt several times by either faction (Christian and Muslim), when they occupied the castle (it is likely that for some periods the town was completely abandoned). In 1253, Afonso III supported the reconstruction of the castle. By 1258, Chaves was granted the status of a vila (or town). [...] While the walls were eventually rebuilt, the advent of artillery would make the castle's fortifications obsolete, and its importance waned, while the historical battlements fell into ruins.|$|R
