For instance, the spark power-up lets Kirby break through otherwise indestructible blocks, and the needle lets Kirby hit spikes once without losing a life. The game has a themed frame and uses a wide <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> colors in-game when played with the Super Game Boy.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E

50|$|During the 1st Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, {{cemetery}} plots {{dating from}} the reign of Pharaoh Den were built. This resulted {{in one of the}} ceremonial cosmetic <b>palettes</b> <b>of</b> predynastic times being interred. The cosmetic <b>palette</b> is one <b>of</b> the more ornate examples, the Manshiyat Ezzat Palette. It contains the twin lion serpopards, as found on the famous Narmer Palette, the cosmetic eyepaint mixing circle, and some mammals endemic to Egypt. Many <b>of</b> the cosmetic <b>palettes</b> <b>of</b> Ancient Egypt were found in the Saqqara area cemeteries to the south.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, running {{independently}} {{from the}} pioneering FWD night, an event called Filthy Dub, co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, NType, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Michael Naify and William Nasser {{turned to}} Pflueger {{again for a}} new {{neighborhood}} theater design based on the Alhambra in Grenada, Spain. The Alhambra Theatre opened on November 5, 1926 with a grand facade flanked by twin minarets that glowed red at night. Pflueger's vision stayed firmly planted in the Moorish Revival style, complete to the iron scrollwork and amber shade redesign of two municipal streetlamps standing outside of the theater. Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> color most prominently displayed in a geometric floral pattern on the main ceiling. The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996.|$|E
5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the connection with}} Love's Last Shift and capitalise on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda was not a problem, since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling {{the rest of the}} large Relapse cast presented a varied <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.|$|E
40|$|Graph {{coloring}} is {{a well-known}} and well-studied area of graph theory that has many applications. In this dissertation, we look at two generalizations of graph coloring known as list-coloring and sum-list-coloring. In both {{of these types of}} colorings, one seeks to first assign <b>palettes</b> <b>of</b> colors to vertices and then choose a color from the corresponding palette for each vertex so that a proper coloring is obtained. A celebrated result of Thomassen states that every planar graph can be properly colored from any arbitrarily assigned <b>palettes</b> <b>of</b> five colors. This result is known as 5 -list-colorability of planar graphs. Albertson asked whether Thomassen 2 ̆ 7 s theorem can be extended by precoloring some vertices which are at a large enough distance apart. Hutchinson asked whether Thomassen 2 ̆ 7 s theorem can be extended by allowing certain vertices to have <b>palettes</b> <b>of</b> size less than five assigned to them. In this dissertation, we explore both of these questions and answer them in the affirmative for various classes of graphs. We also provide a catalog of small configurations with <b>palettes</b> <b>of</b> different prescribed sizes and determine whether or not they can always be colored from <b>palettes</b> <b>of</b> such sizes. These small configurations can be useful in reducing certain planar graphs to obtain more information about their structure. Additionally, we look at the newer notion of sum-list-coloring where the sum choice number is the parameter of interest. In sum-list-coloring, we seek to minimize the sum of varying sizes <b>of</b> <b>palettes</b> <b>of</b> colors assigned the vertices of a graph. We compute the sum choice number for all graphs on at most five vertices, present some general results about sum-list-coloring, and determine the sum choice number for certain graphs made up of cycles...|$|R

5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E
5|$|Although a real ninja wears {{black to}} be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange {{jumpsuit}} {{to fit the}} shōnen genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to him, a pre-existing design {{would not have made}} Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because they were too time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices was the color <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are complementary. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.|$|E
5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E

5|$|The first project {{proposed}} {{and worked on}} was a period film to be called Dora-Heita, but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to Dodesukaden, an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing {{on the creation of}} a bold, almost surreal <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of antbirds is {{soft and}} not brightly coloured, {{although}} it is occasionally striking. The colour <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. Sexual dimorphism – differences in plumage colour and pattern {{between males and females}} – is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male dot-winged antwren is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts. In some genera, such as Myrmotherula, species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male. Many species of antbirds have a contrasting 'patch' of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in bluish-slate antshrikes and white-flanked antwrens the white patch is on the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man X was {{developed}} by a team at Capcom which had worked on the long-running Mega Man series for the NES. Lead artist Keiji Inafune (credited as a planner as Inemuryar) recounted {{that the development of}} Mega Man X required a lot of brainstorming for its storyline and content where the team's goal was to branch out from original Mega Man games while still maintaining their fundamentals. In the original Mega Man series, Inafune typically designed the protagonist while his protégé Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters. However, their roles were reversed for Mega Man X. Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X, but had a difficult time with the initial design. He was presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed with the SNES's larger <b>palette</b> <b>of</b> colors when compared to the NES. Inafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on the various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that Mega Man had always represented a classic action game formula in which the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept.|$|E
