Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|R

They are described some procedures and coordination of granting <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> then how <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control fits into the framework of European competition policy before we comment extensively on the more economic approach to <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control, as implemented by the European Commission, and the <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> action <b>plan.</b> Control of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> is of increasing importance {{in the context of}} European competition policy in order to maintain a fair level of activity of all enterprises participating in the European markets, regardless of the Member State in which they reside. The theoretical fundamentals of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> are important to be studied and applied. Were distinguished and described the main approaches in the evolution of economic theories in the field of <b>State</b> <b>aid.</b> Criteria were established to determine the government's actions as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and intervention methods analyzed. It is important to think about the implications of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> at an early stage. Doing so allows assistance to be designed and given more quickly and effectively and avoids potential problems later. A program of assistance that does not follow the rules could be forced to close. Giving <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> illegally could result in the money having to be clawed back with possibly very serious consequences for the recipient. The European Commission monitors and controls <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in the EU by requiring member states to notify the Commission in advance of proposed <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in order to ensure compliance. If a European company believes that a competitor is receiving illegal aid then they should complain directly to the Commission on the complaints form.

Where markets fail to deliver efficient outcomes, Government intervention, including the provision of <b>State</b> <b>aid,</b> can improve welfare.

40|$|European <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{control is}} {{currently}} at a turning point. The European Union and its member states are increasingly recognizing {{the need to}} rethink the balance between the various objectives of state intervention.

The economics of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control is related to several areas of economics: first, to public economics, since <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{is a form of}} public intervention in the economy; second, to the economics of com-petition, as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> confers an advantage to some firms and thus has the potential to af-fect the competitive process; and third, to international trade theory, as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> can a¤ect trading conditions.

The thesis is composed of three chapters. Chapter One is an introduction to the topic.

Chapter Two examines article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of taxation. The chapter consists of nine parts.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> {{constitutes}} one of {{the instruments}} o f the state policy in the economic market. The <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> means winning financial benefits from the state resources in the way which might distort competition. Depending on the object it is earmarked, the <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> can be distinguished as horizontal, sectoral, regional. The Agenda in respect o f <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> assumes phasing out this aid for enterprises, let alone aid distorting competition, and its closer scrutiny. In the period 2000 - 2005 {{the total value of}} <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> in Poland amounted to € 14. 8 billion (79 billion PLN), which gives an average at the level o f € 2. 5 billion (13. 2 billion PLN) per annum. The value ol <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> granted for rescue and restructuring in the period 2000 - 2005 in Poland accounted for € 35. 8 billion PLN which means 45. 3 % of the total value of <b>State</b> <b>aid.</b> <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> for rescue and restructuring achieved the annual average level o f 5. 9 billion PLN, which means € 670 million.
