5|$|Although {{advocates and}} <b>practitioners</b> <b>of</b> {{scientific}} jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

5|$|Siddiqui's first {{breakthrough}} in research {{came when he}} successfully isolated an antiarrhythmic agent in 1931 from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina.

Many of these are still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders and cardiovascular ailments, especially as antiarrhythmic agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E
