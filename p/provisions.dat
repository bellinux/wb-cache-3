5|$|By 1264, {{the reign}} of Henry III was deeply troubled by {{disputes}} between the king and his nobility. The conflict was caused by several factors: the influence of foreigners at court, a wasteful war over the crown of Sicily, and a personal dispute between King Henry and Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. In 1258, Henry was forced to accept the so-called <b>Provisions</b> of Oxford, whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates. In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the <b>Provisions</b> of Westminster. The <b>provisions</b> remained in effect for three years; {{it was not until}} 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition. Receiving the papal annulment of the <b>provisions</b> his emissaries had campaigned for, he re-assumed control of government. Over the next two years, however, discontent re-emerged over Henry's style of government. He failed to be reconciled with Montfort, and he also alienated Gloucester's son and heir Gilbert. In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France, and reignited the reform movement. On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London, and once more forced to accept the conditions of the <b>provisions.</b> Prince Edwardthe later King Edward I – now took control of the situation. In October Edward took Windsor Castle, and the baronial alliance started to break up.|$|E

40|$|In {{this short}} paper I adopt the public choice school {{paradigm}} of modeling {{a government in}} order to compare its performance {{with that of the}} market in the standard model of the <b>provision</b> of public goods. Private <b>provision</b> is represented by the Cournot-Nash equilibrium in individual contributions. Public <b>provision</b> incorporates rent seeking, whereby some of the aspects of the allocation are determined indirectly by influence activities of the interested parties. Thus, both allocation procedures yield inefficiency, and the question is which procedure results in a greater amount of inefficiency: private <b>provision</b> with its free riding incentives, or public <b>provision</b> with its rent seeking incentives. The results indicate that public <b>provision</b> may well be preferred to private <b>provision</b> of public goods. Thus, superiority of private <b>provision</b> is not guaranteed even {{in the case of a}} non-benevolent government. Copyright 1993 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R

He arrived in Santiago de Guatemala early in 1537, where he purchased more <b>provisions,</b> arms, and livestock, and recruited more soldiers. The new <b>provisions</b> included cattle, sheep and pigs, crossbows, arquebuses, and gunpowder. He now had between 80 and 100 Spanish soldiers, including veterans of Yucatán. He arrived in Gracias a Dios towards the end of March 1537, while Cáceres was still in the Comayagua valley. The seaborne detachment fared less well; after resupplying in Cuba, it was plundered by pirates with little loss of life, but most of the <b>provisions</b> were taken. With what could be salvaged, they put into Puerto de Caballos in the spring of 1537, where there were met by Montejo. The strong combined Spanish force now in Honduras-Higueras placed Montejo in a solid position, both militarily and politically. Montejo was installed as governor without opposition on 24 March at Gracias a Dios. He released the imprisoned members of the former town council, and sought their support for continued conquest.|$|E
5|$|One {{contentious}} {{point in}} Denholm-Young's article was his assertion {{that there was}} no mention of the <b>Provisions</b> of Oxford in the Mise of Lewes. This was an idea that John Maddicott strongly contested in an 1983 article. According to Maddicott, the <b>provisions</b> had been at the centre of Montfort's opposition over the last six years, and it was unlikely that he would give them up so easily. Nevertheless, Montfort showed willingness to negotiate the terms of the <b>provisions.</b> As such, the Mise of Lewes was a moderate document; Montfort wanted to avoid a repetition of the situation after the Mise of Amiens. Rather it was external circumstances outside of Montfort's control that led to the eventual failure of the negotiations between the royalists and the barons.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a path {{computation}} element (PCE) - based <b>provisioning</b> framework for carrier-grade multi-protocol label switching-transport profile (MPLS-TP) networks. In the proposed framework, a centralized PCE integrates the service function {{as well as the}} path <b>provisioning</b> function into a unified <b>provisioning</b> controller. The service function allows the <b>provisioning</b> manager to initiate the establishment of a label-switched path (LSP). The <b>provisioning</b> function computes an optimal path, sets up and maintains the LSP in a unified way while directly configuring the LSP over the switches. The management function, as a separation from the <b>provisioning</b> function, can fully utilize the MPLS-TP switch to keep monitoring the performance of the <b>provisioned</b> LSP tunnels in a distributed way. The balanced partitioning of service <b>provisioning</b> and management functions reduces traffic load on the controller and improves the scalability. The software-defined <b>provisioning</b> control using an extended PCE communication protocol enables the cooperation between them to monitor and customize the LSPs flexibly and efficiently. We implement and show that the proposed framework not only simplifies the <b>provisioning</b> procedure with a single instance, but reduces the <b>provisioning</b> time in a MPLS-TP test bed.
