5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> lets him win the contest.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of <b>Pity,</b> <b>and</b> a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E

5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an Ã©lite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
5|$|According to oral history, Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on a {{day of the week}} {{traditionally}} viewed as inauspicious for births. Custom in much of Madagascar dictated that such unlucky children had to be subjected to a trial by ordeal, such as prolonged exposure to the elements, since it was believed the misfortune of their day of birth would ensure a short and cursed life for the child and its family. But rather than leave the child to die, Rainilaiarivony's father reportedly followed the advice of an ombiasy (astrologer) and instead amputated a joint from two fingers on his infant son's left hand to dispel the ill omen. The infant was nonetheless kept outside the house to avert the possibility that evil might still befall the family if the child remained under their roof. Relatives took <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> adopted Rainilaiarivony to raise him within their own home. Meanwhile, Rainilaiarivony's older brother Rainivoninahitriniony enjoyed the double privilege of his status as elder son and freedom from a predestined evil fate. Rainiharo selected and groomed his elder son to follow in his footsteps as Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, while Rainilaiarivony was left to make his way in the world by his own merits.|$|E

Krystle in turn cons Frank, running off with his money. Despite his past actions, Peggy takes <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> gives Frank money but turns down the opportunity of resuming a relationship with him.|$|E

25|$|The play is {{composed}} {{almost entirely of}} speeches and contains little action since its protagonist is chained and immobile throughout. At the beginning, Kratos (Authority), Bia (violence), and the smith-god Hephaestus chain the Titan Prometheus to a mountain in the Caucasus, with Hephaestus alone expressing reluctance and <b>pity,</b> <b>and</b> then departing. According to the author, Prometheus is being punished not only for stealing fire, but also for thwarting Zeus's plan to obliterate the human race. This punishment is especially galling since Prometheus was instrumental in Zeus's victory in the Titanomachy.|$|E
25|$|In 47, Crispus died, {{and at his}} funeral, {{the rumor}} spread around that Agrippina {{poisoned}} Crispus to gain his estate. After being widowed a second time, Agrippina was left very wealthy. Later that year at the Secular Games, at {{the performance of the}} Troy Pageant, Messalina attended the event with her son Britannicus. Agrippina was also present with Lucius. Agrippina and Lucius received greater applause from the audience than Messalina and Britannicus did. Many people began to show <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> sympathy to Agrippina, due to the unfortunate circumstances in her life. Agrippina wrote a memoir that recorded the misfortunes of her family (casus suorum) and wrote an account of her mother's life.|$|E
25|$|In The Return of the King, Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from Cirith Ungol and, {{dressed in}} {{scavenged}} Orc-armour, the two {{began to make}} their way across the plateau of Gorgoroth. They finally arrived, against all odds, at Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring could be destroyed. However, Gollum had secretly followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life out of <b>pity,</b> <b>and</b> turned his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature and followed Frodo.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{believed}} that Aristotle's Poetics comprised two books â one on comedy and one on tragedy â only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.|$|E
25|$|In late 17th-century England, a {{homeless}} boy named Gwynplaine rescues an infant girl during a snowstorm, her mother having frozen to death whilst feeding her. They meet an itinerant carnival vendor {{who calls himself}} Ursus, and his pet wolf, Homo. Gwynplaine's mouth has been mutilated into a perpetual grin; Ursus is initially horrified, then moved to <b>pity,</b> <b>and</b> he takes them in. Fifteen years later, Gwynplaine {{has grown into a}} strong young man, attractive except for his distorted visage. The girl, now named Dea, is blind, and has grown into a beautiful and innocent young woman. By touching his face, Dea concludes that Gwynplaine is perpetually happy. They fall in love. Ursus and his surrogate children earn a meagre living in the fairs of southern England. Gwynplaine keeps the lower half of his face concealed. In each town, Gwynplaine gives a stage performance in which the crowds are provoked to laughter when Gwynplaine reveals his grotesque face.|$|E

500|$|Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times {{believed}} [...] "Exit" [...] " [...] {{the evil}} that can result from moral self-righteousness." [...] Music journalist Bill Graham wrote [...] "For the first time, [...] was owning up {{to the dangers of}} the dualism implicit in Christianity", comparing the song's spiritual and musical tone to that of the Virgin Prunes. David Werther, a faculty associate in Philosophy at the University of WisconsinâMadison, compared [...] "Exit" [...] with U2's 1991 song [...] "Until the End of the World" [...] in an examination of the role music can play in catharsis. He noted that both were powerful songs, but that while [...] "Until the End of the World" [...] allowed the possibility of purification, which he described as the cleansing of the soul [...] "through <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> fear", by placing the listener in the position of Judas Iscariot, [...] "Exit" [...] was an example of purgation, a freeing from excess <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> fear. Werther noted [...] "'Exit' evokes feelings of fear, fear of losing control, giving into one's dark side, perhaps even taking one's life", contrasting it to the [...] "waves of regret" [...] experienced by Judas.|$|E

[...] When reviewing the final scene, Marsi commended the appearance of the positive pregnancy test to the audience, calling the it [...] "Quite the cliffhanger to leave us with after a finale that was already pretty darn entertaining.

But [...] earns serious kudos for his amazing last inning transformation of Connor from brat to tragic figure worthy of <b>pity</b> <b>and</b> understanding in Peace Out and Home. That Vincent was able to redeem Connor {{in such a short time}} is a true feat in itself and it was singularly responsible for making the finale as heartbreaking and haunting as it ended up being." ...|$|E
