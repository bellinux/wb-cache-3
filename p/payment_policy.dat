40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} factors that {{underlie}} large variation in Medic-aid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) policies among states. Both eli-gibility and provider <b>payment</b> <b>policies</b> are examined for low-income children and parents. I find that state variation {{in the cost of}} providing health care, due to variation in the intensity of health care use, is a key determinant of eligibility policies, and I also find tentative evidence of an effect for <b>payment</b> <b>policies.</b> Because rising health care spending increases the cost of providing health insurance coverage, state policy mak-ers in high-spending states enact less generous Medicaid and CHIP policies. Results also indicate that the political environments of states are very important in determining their eligibility policies, but fewer political variables influence <b>payment</b> <b>policies.</b> In addition to including variables not yet examined in the context of Medicaid policy, this study uses an innovative measure of state-level health care spending and carefully con-structed dependent variables that lend credibility to causal interpretations of relationships...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Racial/ethnic {{disparities in}} nursing homes (NHs) are {{associated}} with lower quality of care, and state Medicaid <b>payment</b> <b>policies</b> may influence NH quality. However, no studies analyzing disparities in NH quality of life (QoL) exist. Therefore, this study aims to estimate associations at the NH level between average number of QoL deficiencies and concentrations of racial/ethnic minority residents, and to identify effects of state Medicaid <b>payment</b> <b>policies</b> on racial/ethnic disparities. Method: Multivariable Poisson regression with NH random effects {{was used to determine}} the association between NH minority concentration in 2000 to 2010 and average number of QoL deficiencies in 2001 to 2011 at the NH level, and the effect of state NH <b>payment</b> <b>policies</b> on QoL deficiencies and racial/ethnic disparities in QoL deficiencies across NH minority concentrations. Results: Racial/ethnic disparities in QoL between high and low minority concentration NHs decrease over time, but are not eliminated. Case mix payment was associated with an increased disparity between high and low minority concentration NHs in QoL deficiencies. Discussion: NH managers and policy makers should consider initiatives targeting minority residents or low-performing NHs with higher minority concentrations for improvement to reduce disparities and address QoL deficiencies...|$|R

50|$|In 1989, Congress {{created the}} Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) program, which {{established}} a preferential <b>payment</b> <b>policy</b> for health centers by requiring “cost-based” reimbursement for both Medicaid and Medicare. The policy designated FQHC {{services as a}} mandatory Medicaid service that all states must cover and reimburse on a cost-related basis, using the Medicaid prospective payment system. The aim of these payment changes was to prevent health centers from using Section 330 and other grants (intended for the uninsured) to subsidize low Medicaid payment rates. The resulting payment structure reimbursed health centers {{on the basis of}} their actual costs for providing care, not by a rate negotiated with the state Medicaid agency or set by Medicare.|$|E

50|$|The {{multiple}} tributaries of {{evidence-based medicine}} share {{an emphasis on}} the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions. However they differ {{on the extent to which}} they require good evidence of effectiveness before promulgating a guideline or <b>payment</b> <b>policy,</b> and they differ on the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily 'hybridise' with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises. The most effective 'knowledge leaders' (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence. Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for governmentality in health care and consequently play a central role in the distant governance of contemporary health care systems.|$|E
50|$|To reduce HAIs, {{the state}} of Maryland {{implemented}} the Maryland Hospital-Acquired Conditions Program that provides financial rewards and penalties for individual hospitals based {{on their ability to}} avoid HAIs. An adaptation of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services <b>payment</b> <b>policy</b> causes poor-performing hospitals to lose up to 3% of their inpatient revenues, whereas hospitals that are able to avoid HAIs can earn up to 3% in rewards. During the program’s first 2 years, complication rates fell by 15.26 percent across all hospital-acquired conditions tracked by the state (including those not covered by the program), from a risk-adjusted complication rate of 2.38 per 1,000 people in 2009 to a rate of 2.02 in 2011. The 15.26-percent decline translates into more than $100 million in cost savings for the health care system in Maryland, with the largest savings coming from avoidance of urinary tract infections, septicemia and other severe infections, and pneumonia and other lung infections. If similar results could be achieved nationwide, the Medicare program would save an estimated $1.3 billion over 2 years, while the health care system as a whole would save $5.3 billion.|$|E
40|$|Gains in life {{expectancy}} {{around the world}} have increasingly placed pressure on governments to ensure that the elderly receive assistance with activities of daily living. This research examines the impact of government oversight of Medicaid <b>payment</b> <b>policies</b> on access to nursing home care services in the United States. Variation in price levels induced by a federal policy shift in 1997 is used to identify the effect of Medicaid reimbursements on the number of nursing homes and beds available. Court rulings prior to the policy change are used to categorically define a range of oversight treatments at the state level. Difference-in-differences estimates indicate a significant decline in access to nursing home care services for individuals living in states in which courts consistently ruled that Medicaid reimbursements did not meet the minimum standard implied by federal law. The findings suggest that nursing home care services were made more accessible through a combination of legislative and judicial oversight of Medicaid <b>payment</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
