5|$|On 8 September, {{working with}} Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.'s Manhattan Project, Tibbets {{selected}} Wendover for his training base over Great Bend Army Air Field, Kansas, and Mountain Home Army Airfield, Idaho, {{because of its}} remoteness. On 14 September 1944, the 393d Bombardment Squadron arrived at Wendover from its former base at Fairmont Army Air Base, Nebraska, {{where it had been}} in operational training (OTU) with the 504th Bombardment Group since 12 March. When its <b>parent</b> <b>group</b> deployed to the Marianas in early November 1944, the squadron was assigned directly to the Second Air Force until creation of the 509th Composite Group. Originally consisting of twenty-one crews, fifteen were selected to continue training, and were organized into three flights of five crews, lettered A, B, and C. The 393d Bombardment Squadron was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas J. Classen, who like Tibbets had combat experience in heavy bombers, commanding a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress with the 11th Bombardment Group.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} which skills are valued {{by parents who}} are enrolled in either a positively oriented behavioral <b>parenting</b> <b>group</b> or a consensus <b>parenting</b> <b>group</b> that emphasized communication and negotiation skills. Data were collected by telephone interviews 9 to 18 months after parents had completed the <b>parenting</b> <b>groups.</b> Results indicated that concept of positive reinforcement and means for increasing it with their children was the most valued technique for the behaviorally oriented <b>parenting</b> <b>group.</b> Time-out was the second most valued technique, although it had been deemphasized. For the consensus group, negotiation was the most valued technique and time-out was the second most valued, even though this technique had not been taught in this group. Implicationsfor the uses and teaching of time-out in <b>parenting</b> <b>groups</b> are discussed. Behavioral procedures frequently have been suggested to par-ents to modify behavior problems in their children. However, {{the long-term effects of}} <b>group</b> <b>parent</b> training and the general-ization of training have not been thoroughly researched and re-ported in many studies. Although most behavioral parenting approaches emphasize positive change techniques, it is impor-tant to note that most also include some punishment techniques such as time-out, response cost, or overcorrection. This possible overuse or misuse of punishment techniques by parents is an im-portant question for many behavior therapists. The possible overuse of punishment techniques by parents is possibly due to the rapid behavior change they produce in con-trast to the slower, positive techniques. The misuse of punish-ment can lead to negative side effects that include imitation of the person delivering the punishment (Bandura, 1962), aggres...|$|R
25|$|The current {{building}} that houses Wheaton Warrenville South was opened in 1973, and operated as Wheaton-Warrenville High School from 1973—83. By 1982, {{it was clear}} that the high school population in the district was shrinking, and there would be a need to close either the older, tradition rich Wheaton Central, or the newer, but smaller Wheaton-Warrenville. In June 1982, the school board voted 6–1 to close Wheaton-Warrenville High School, effective at the end of the 1982—83 school year. In response, there was a request for a mass transfer of all students from Wheaton-Warrenville High to either of the two other schools, and forcing more changes at the other schools. When the request for the mass transfer was not granted by the board, a group of Warrenville parents began threatening to secede from the district. In January 1983, the <b>parent</b> <b>group</b> presented a petition signed by over 75% of the registered voters of Warrenville to approve detaching from the district. The movement to split from the district eventually moved to the courts. Without even hearing the school board's argument, the judge ruled against the parents group. The issue finally came to an end when the DuPage Valley Regional Board of School Trustees voted 5–2 to reject the secession bid.|$|E
500|$|A fission-fusion {{society is}} a society that changes {{frequently}} in its size and composition, making up a permanent social group called the [...] "parent group". Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment. In a fission–fusion society, the main <b>parent</b> <b>group</b> can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities. Many mammals exhibit this, such as primates (for example orangutans and spider monkeys), elephants, spotted hyenas, lions, and dolphins.|$|E
500|$|The total {{population}} was estimated in 2009 {{to be at}} around 595,000 adult birds, in 46 known colonies spread around the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic; around 35% of the known population lives north of the Antarctic Circle. Major breeding colonies were located at Cape Washington, Coulman Island in Victoria Land, Halley, Cape Colbeck, and Dibble Glacier. Colonies are known to fluctuate over time, often breaking into [...] "suburbs" [...] which move apart from the <b>parent</b> <b>group,</b> and some {{have been known to}} disappear entirely. The Cape Crozier colony on the Ross Sea dropped drastically in size between the first visits by the Discovery Expedition in 1902–03 and the later visits by the Terra Nova Expedition in 1910–11; it was reduced to a few hundred birds, and may have come close to extinction due to changes in the position of the ice shelf. By the 1960s it had rebounded dramatically, but by 2009 was again reduced to a small population of around 300.|$|E

As part of the formation of the 509th, about 800 people stationed at the field, were transferred to the new group. To make the 509th Composite Group as self-contained as possible, other units were assigned, including the 390th Air Service Group, with the 603d Air Engineering and 1027th Materiel Squadrons; the 320th Troop Carrier Squadron, known as the [...] "Green Hornet Airlines"; the 1395th Military Police Company, and later the 1st Ordnance Squadron.

500|$|The UK {{economy was}} {{contracting}} {{by the early}} 1970s, and engineering businesses were rationalising their operations on a scale which raised many comments in Parliament and elsewhere. The ratio of unemployment to vacancies in engineering and the allied trades at June 1970 {{was more or less}} 1:1, but by September 1971 it was 5:1, i.e.: five people unemployed in the sector for every job available. In 1972 the Churchill factory in Altrincham was closed, despite industrial action there and at Alfred Herbert's Coventry factory to stop this happening. There were representations against the closure from Altrincham council to the government, including a meeting in February 1972 when the council and its delegation of industry experts met the Minister for Trade and Industry and said [...] It was said in Parliament that 1,000 people were made redundant and that in Manchester 500 machine tool fitters were now chasing 10 jobs. Production moved to Coventry as the <b>parent</b> <b>group,</b> Herbert, faced losses of £4M, although Churchill had an order book of £2.25M that could provide sufficient work to keep its 1,100 workforce in jobs through to 1974.
