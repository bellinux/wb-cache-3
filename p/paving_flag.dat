50|$|As {{early as}} 1907, Engelhardt {{published}} his contribution on the kilometer stone {{which was to}} replace the milestone, suggesting the use of curbstones which were being replaced by <b>paving</b> <b>flags.</b> The smooth side could be engraved with red-painted Roman figures, marking each kilometer. While still at the Academy, he designed new tramcars for Københavns Sporvogne (Copenhagen Tramways), replacing the usual rectangular profiles with rounded contours both inside and out so as {{to provide a more}} human look for passengers.|$|R
25|$|By 1885 {{the streets}} of the town were <b>paved</b> and <b>flagged</b> and lit with gas {{supplied}} by a company incorporated in 1822. Between 1870-1885 improvements were made {{on the north side of}} town around St John's Church now a conservation area.|$|R
50|$|Various of the {{sandstone}} beds of the Millstone Grit have been quarried for building stone, <b>paving</b> <b>flags</b> and roofing material. Its {{use in the}} construction of dry stone walls across the areas where it outcrops is considerable. In neighbouring limestone areas, gritstone has often been preferred in the past for use as gateposts and lintels. The very name of the rock derives from its widespread use within cornmills where it proved suitable for grinding stones. It also found agricultural use as drinking troughs for animals. The majority of the quarrying for such use took place along the eastern edges of the Peak District. Millstone Edge was a significant source whilst abandoned millstones can be seen below the edges at Stanage, Froggatt and Baslow.|$|R

"I will see, Mr. Utterson," [...] said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, {{comfortable}} hall <b>paved</b> with <b>flags,</b> warmed (after {{the fashion}} of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. [...] "Will you wait here by the fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?" ...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{observation}} platforms {{were constructed}} along a trail {{next to the}} falls, while {{at the base of}} the falls, a terraced observation area <b>paved</b> with native <b>flag</b> stones was created to allow access to a calm water wading pool.|$|R
50|$|Up to 1837 Wakefield {{relied on}} wells and springs for its water supply; {{water from the}} River Calder was polluted, and various water supply schemes were {{unsuccessful}} until reservoirs on the Rishworth Moors and a service reservoir at Ardsley were built providing clean water from 1888.By 1885 {{the streets of the}} town were <b>paved</b> and <b>flagged</b> and lit with gas supplied by a company incorporated in 1822.

60|$|Audley Court {{was not an}} {{attractive}} locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle <b>paved</b> with <b>flags</b> and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry {{we found that the}} constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.|$|R
50|$|The South Pole Traverse (McMurdo-South Pole highway) is {{approximately}} 1400 km long and links the United States' McMurdo Station {{on the coast}} to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. It was constructed by leveling snow and filling in crevasses, but is not <b>paved.</b> There are <b>flags</b> to mark the route.|$|R
5000|$|James Finegan was a Contractor {{and had a}} flag stone yard on {{the corner}} of Olive and Fulton streets {{opposite}} the Oswego Canal Bridge. The company was established in 1874. He was a dealer in [...] "Hammond and Medina Red Sand Stone" [...] for <b>flagging,</b> <b>paving,</b> steps, hitching posts, horseblocks and coping.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} lain shallow {{underground}} {{and is a}} single-vault design with a rounded ceiling. The ceiling is covered with 6,200 triangular, cement structures, each having a weight of about 100 kilograms. The lighting in the station comes from lamps hanging from the cement structures. The partitions the tracks have been held with is made of black natural stone and the floor has been <b>paved</b> with <b>flags</b> of polished red granite, into which zigzag patterns, made from light coloured stone, have been introduced {{near the end of}} the platform. Also, small black slates of marble from Uzbekistan line the railings of the stairs which lead into the station vestibule.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the back}} is the outer wall raised {{by two or}} three steps from [...] the ground. From {{the top of the}} wall, {{projects}} a shallow roof of [...] yellow tiles supported by wooden pillars painted red, shabby and [...] rather weather-worn, and this roof is raised {{in the middle of the}} [...] wall, where there is a huge wooden gateway. When this is opened the [...] street is seen and on the other side of it a high, blank, white [...] wall. The courtyard is <b>paved</b> with great <b>flags.</b> On each side of it [...] are living rooms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} lain shallow {{underground}} {{and is a}} pillar-trispan, with square columns. The station itself was designed by V.A Spivachyk and P.G. Chechelnitskiy; engineered by P.A. Bochikashvili and V.S. Kotov; and decorated by A.F. Pronin and G.V. Tischenko. For the most part, blank marble was used, although grey granite was also used for {{the background of the}} station's name, which is seen in large aluminum letters. The lighting comes from groups of lamps placed in between the [...] "ribs" [...] (bars) of the ceiling. The floor has been <b>paved</b> with polished <b>flags</b> of grey and black granite.|$|R
25|$|The chancels {{of many of}} Wren’s city churches had {{chequered}} marble {{floors and}} the chancel of St Magnus is an example, the parish agreeing after some debate to place the communion table on a marble ascent with steps and to commission altar rails of Sussex wrought iron. The nave and aisles are <b>paved</b> with freestone <b>flags.</b> A steeple, closely modelled on one built between 1614 and 1624 by François d'Aguilon and Pieter Huyssens for the church of St Carolus Borromeus in Antwerp, was added between 1703 and 1706. London's skyline was transformed by Wren's tall steeples and that of St Magnus {{is considered to be}} one of his finest.|$|R
6000|$|They {{pronounce}} it Pom-pay-e. I {{always had an}} idea that you went down into Pompeii with torches, by the way of damp, dark stairways, just as you do in silver mines, and traversed gloomy tunnels with lava overhead and something on either hand like dilapidated prisons gouged out of the solid earth, that faintly resembled houses. But you do nothing the kind. Fully one-half of the buried city, perhaps, is completely exhumed and thrown open freely to the light of day; and there stand the long rows of solidly-built brick houses (roofless) just as they stood eighteen hundred years ago, hot with the flaming sun; and there lie their floors, clean-swept, and not a bright fragment tarnished or waiting of the labored mosaics that pictured them with the beasts, and birds, and flowers which we copy in perishable carpets to-day; and here are the Venuses, and Bacchuses, and Adonises, making love and getting drunk in many-hued frescoes {{on the walls of}} saloon and bed-chamber; and there are the narrow streets and narrower sidewalks, <b>paved</b> with <b>flags</b> of good hard lava, the one deeply rutted with the chariot-wheels, and the other with the passing feet of the Pompeiians of by-gone centuries; and there are the bake-shops, the temples, the halls of justice, the baths, the theatres--all clean-scraped and neat, and suggesting nothing of the nature of a silver mine away down {{in the bowels of the}} earth. The broken pillars lying about, the doorless doorways and the crumbled tops of the wilderness of walls, were wonderfully suggestive of the [...] "burnt district" [...] in one of our cities, and if there had been any charred timbers, shattered windows, heaps of debris, and general blackness and smokiness about the place, the resemblance would have been perfect. But no--the sun shines as brightly down on old Pompeii to-day as it did when Christ was born in Bethlehem, and its streets are cleaner a hundred times than ever Pompeiian saw them in her prime. I know whereof I speak--for in the great, chief thoroughfares (Merchant street and the Street of Fortune) have I not seen with my own eyes how for two hundred years at least the pavements were not repaired!--how ruts five and even ten inches deep were worn into the thick flagstones by the chariot-wheels of generations of swindled tax-payers? And do I not know by these signs that Street Commissioners of Pompeii never attended to their business, and that if they never mended the pavements they never cleaned them? And, besides, is it not the inborn nature of Street Commissioners to avoid their duty whenever they get a chance? I wish I knew the name of the last one that held office in Pompeii so that I could give him a blast. I speak with feeling on this subject, because I caught my foot in one of those ruts, and the sadness that came over me when I saw the first poor skeleton, with ashes and lava sticking to it, was tempered by the reflection that may be that party was the Street Commissioner.|$|R
60|$|Dumbiedikes {{was what}} is called in Scotland a single house; that is, having only one room occupying its whole depth from back to front, each of which single apartments was {{illuminated}} by six or eight cross lights, whose diminutive panes and heavy frames permitted scarce so much light to enter as shines through one well-constructed modern window. This inartificial edifice, exactly such as a child would build with cards, had a steep roof flagged with coarse grey stones instead of slates; a half-circular turret, battlemented, or, to use the appropriate phrase, bartizan'd on the top, served as a case for a narrow turnpike stair, by which an ascent was gained from storey to storey; and {{at the bottom of}} the said turret was a door studded with large-headed nails. There was no lobby {{at the bottom of the}} tower, and scarce a landing-place opposite to the doors which gave access to the apartments. One or two low and dilapidated outhouses, connected by a courtyard wall equally ruinous, surrounded the mansion. The court had been <b>paved,</b> but the <b>flags</b> being partly displaced and partly renewed, a gallant crop of docks and thistles sprung up between them, and the small garden, which opened by a postern through the wall, seemed not to be in a much more orderly condition. Over the low-arched gateway which led into the yard there was a carved stone, exhibiting some attempt at armorial bearings; and above the inner entrance hung, and had hung, for many years, the mouldering hatchment, which announced that umquhile Laurence Dumbie of Dumbiedikes had been gathered to his fathers in Newbattle kirkyard. The approach to this palace of pleasure was by a road formed by the rude fragments of stone gathered from the fields, and it was surrounded by ploughed, but unenclosed land. Upon a baulk, that is, an unploughed ridge of land interposed among the corn, the Laird's trusty palfrey was tethered by the head, and picking a meal of grass. The whole argued neglect and discomfort; the consequence, however, of idleness and indifference, not of poverty.|$|R
