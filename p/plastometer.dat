40|$|Plastic coals are {{important}} feedstocks in coke manufacture, coal liquefaction, gasification, and combustion. During these processes, the thermoplastic behavior of these coals {{is also important}} since it may contribute to desirable or undesirable characteristics. For example, during liquefaction, the plastic behavior is desired since it leads to liquid-liquid reactions which are faster than solid-liquid reactions. During gasification, the elastic behavior is undesired since it leads to caking and agglomeration of coal particles which result in bed bogging in fixed or fluidized bed gasifiers. The plastic behavior of different coals was studied using a fast-response <b>plastometer.</b> A modified <b>plastometer</b> {{was used to measure}} the torque required to turn at constant angular speed a cone-shaped disk embedded in a thin layer of coal. The coal particles were packed between two metal plates which are heated electrically. Heating rates, final temperatures, pressures, and durations of experiment ranged from 200 [...] 800 K/s, 700 [...] 1300 K, vacuum- 50 atm helium, and 0 [...] 40 s, respectively. The apparent viscosity of the molten coal was calculated from the measured torque using the governing equation of the cone-and-plate viscometer. Using a concentrated suspension model, the molten coal`s apparent viscosity was related to the quantity of the liquid metaplast present during pyrolysis. Seven coals from Argonne National Laboratory Premium Coal Sample Bank were studied. Five bituminous coals, from high-volatile to low-volatile bituminous, were found to have very good plastic behavior. Coal type strongly affects the magnitude and duration of plasticity. Hvb coals were most plastic. Mvb and lvb coals, though the maximum plasticity and plastic period were less.

30|$|Heating {{a packed}} bed of coal {{particles}} to high temperatures {{can result in}} surface softening and subsequent deformation. Quantitative appraisal of coal rheological properties requires measurement of several empirical parameters {{and the effect of}} experimental conditions on these parameters. The swelling index and dilatometry are important measurements of the swelling/contraction whereas plastometry measures the fluidity. Testing with a constant-torque <b>plastometer</b> (ASTM D- 2639) gives a semi-quantitative measurement of apparent softening of coal when heated under the prescribed conditions. When bituminous coal is thus heated in the absence of air over the range of 300 – 550  °C, volatile materials are released and a powder of solid coal particles becomes a plastic-like, transiently softer mass that swells and eventually re-solidifies. Coal that produces 0 – 30 wt% volatile matter will have a softening point on the order of 340 – 445  °C (Maloney et al. 1980; Nandi and Montgomery 1971; Speight 2015). The plastic range spans between the softening and the re-solidification temperature.|$|E
