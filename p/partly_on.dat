5|$|The word diet {{derives from}} Latin {{and was a}} common name for an {{assembly}} in medieval Germany. The Meiji constitution was largely based on the form of constitutional monarchy found in nineteenth century Prussia and the new Diet was modeled <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the German Reichstag and <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the British Westminster system. Unlike the post-war constitution, the Meiji constitution granted a real political role to the Emperor, although in practice the Emperor's powers were largely directed {{by a group of}} oligarchs called the genrō or elder statesmen.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the basis of these structures and <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with epilepsy, depending <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects {{three to five times}} more children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism.|$|E

5|$|Drugs {{derived from}} plants {{including}} opiates, cocaine and cannabis have both medical and recreational uses. Different countries have {{at various times}} made some uses of drugs illegal, <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> {{the basis of the}} risks involved in taking psychoactive drugs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, republicanism in the United Kingdom grew, <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> {{account of}} {{negative}} publicity {{associated with the}} Royal Family (for instance, immediately {{following the death of}} Diana, Princess of Wales). However, polls from 2002 to 2007 showed that around 70–80% of the British public supported the continuation of the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Linus Pauling is {{credited}} with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding, an idea first put forth by William Astbury in 1933. Later work by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation, based <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> previous studies by Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang, contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions.|$|E

5|$|Opportunistic infections may {{be caused}} by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that are {{normally}} controlled by the immune system. Which infections occur depends <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> what organisms are common in the person's environment. These infections may affect nearly every organ system.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the specific anatomical features of the airway, and <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
5|$|Ueshiba's senior {{students}} have {{different approaches to}} aikido, depending <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> when they studied with him. Today aikido is found {{all over the world}} in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduation}} {{the four}} go their separate ways, but they remain in contact through letters and regular visits, although their letters are {{read by the}} Securitate. They take menial jobs: Kurt works in a slaughterhouse as a supervisor, for instance; and the narrator translates German manuals in a factory. A fifth member, Tereza, befriends the narrator even as {{it becomes clear that}} she is acting <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> Pjele's orders.|$|E
5|$|Chase {{had been}} fascinated by {{organized}} crime and the mafia from an early age, witnessing such people growing up. He also was raised on classic gangster films, such as The Public Enemy, and the crime series The Untouchables. The series is partly inspired by the Boiardo family, a prominent New Jersey organized crime family when Chase was growing up, and <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> New Jersey's DeCavalcante family. He has mentioned American playwrights Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as influences on the show's writing, and Italian director Federico Fellini as an important influence on the show's cinematic style.|$|E
5|$|Doremus based the storyline of {{the film}} <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> his own long-distance {{relationship}} with a woman living in London while he lived in Los Angeles. Rather than writing a traditional screenplay, he and Ben York Jones compiled a 50-page outline {{of the film}} from which the actors improvised {{almost all of the}} dialogue. Filming took place over four weeks in Los Angeles and London with a budget of $250,000.|$|E

5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|From facial {{measurements}} and still {{photographs of the}} human templates, sculpting supervisor John Brown constructed Cliff Richard, while Brian Bennett was entrusted to Christine Glanville, Hank Marvin to Terry Curtis, John Rostill to Mary Turner and Bruce Welch to Tim Cooksey. Curtis went on to sculpt Zero-X crewmembers Captain Paul Travers and Co-Pilot Greg Martin, modelling the first on 1960s James Bond actor, Sean Connery and the latter <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> himself, {{in addition to the}} Glenn Field Controller, Commander Casey.|$|E
5|$|Many years later, {{the abbey}} is visited by Monsignors Aguerra (God's Advocate) and Flaught (the Devil's Advocate), the Church's {{investigators}} {{in the case}} for Leibowitz's sainthood. Leibowitz is eventually canonized as Saint Leibowitz – based <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the evidence Francis discovered in the shelter – and Brother Francis is sent to New Rome to represent the Order at the canonization Mass. He takes the documents found in the shelter, and an illumination {{of one of the}} documents on which he has spent years working, as a gift to the Pope.|$|E

5|$|Other {{means are}} also used to garner prey. Some species such as the red-naped sapsucker sally into the air to catch flying insects, and many species probe into crevices and under bark, or glean prey from leaves and twigs. The rufous {{woodpecker}} specialises in attacking the nests of arboreal ants and the buff-spotted woodpecker feeds on and nests in termite mounds. Other species such as the wrynecks and the Andean flicker feed wholly or <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the ground.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett's {{first two}} adult novels, The Dark Side of the Sun (1976) and Strata (1981), were both science-fiction, the latter taking place <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> a {{disc-shaped}} world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children, with two exceptions: Good Omens (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which {{was nominated for}} both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and Nation (2008), a book for young adults.|$|E
5|$|Seven other Democratic {{candidates}} for lieutenant governor entered the race, {{the most formidable}} being sitting attorney general John B. Breckinridge. While Combs lost to Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for lieutenant governor, <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> {{the strength of the}} Eastern Kentucky votes he gained from his association with Combs. Carroll went on to defeat Republican Jim Host in the general election for lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the Legislative Research Commission and the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.|$|E
