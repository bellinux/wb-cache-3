This paper studies the impact of social networks on technology adoption through social learning. In addition to geographic networks, intentional relationships are considered. The differential impacts by network type, technology, and asset poverty status are explored. We find evidence that although social learning occurs, it is more consistent for households not in poverty traps than for those that are persistently asset poor. Social learning among rural households is stronger for more complex technologies and is associated with intentional relationships rather than with geographic <b>networks.</b> asset <b>poverty,</b> geographic <b>networks,</b> households, <b>Poverty</b> traps, Social <b>networks,</b> Technology adoption,...|$|R

40|$|While {{universities}} provide quality education, {{they also}} offer a range of social, economic, and cultural activities to their host communities. In Ghana, University Community Engagements {{are part of the}} government’s initiatives aimed at the redistribution of prevelege nationality, educational inequalities and eradicating poverty. However, not many studies have been carried out on community engagement {{in this part of the}} world, as most studies have concentrated on faculty and students. This is a seven week ethnographic study of a village in Northern Ghana focussing on stakeholders understanding, participants concerns and power relations in an engagement programme. The study aims at understanding the shift in dispositions that enabled students to advocate eradication of <b>poverty,</b> <b>network</b> with colleagues and future leaders from different disciplines, to research and present prioritized proposals by the villagers. Seven weeks were spent following eleven students and four subsequent weeks in the community. Participant observations, interviews and documentary evidence were employed. Semi structured interviews were later conducted with nine university leaders and two District Assembly staff representimg the Assembly as a stakeholder located outside the village. Key arguments engaged regarding participation include providing empowering strategies to community to give voice, eradicate poverty and power relationships that challenged and support emancipation. The key findings of the study from a thematic analysis indicated varying degrees of understanding amongst stakeholders and asymmetric power relations that affects the entire programme. Based on these findings, and consistent with the wider literature, recommendations are that the engagement should be based on equal partnership among all stakeholders to encourage full cooperation and effective participation. It is hoped that the findings will contribute to increased participation and a greater stakeholder involvement. The research may also lead to programme restructuring and ultimately a review of the relationship between the university and other stakeholders. More importantly, it may influence policies to address the increasing disparities and poverty which affect community participation in the engagement process...|$|E
40|$|Collective {{action can}} help individuals, groups, and {{communities}} achieve common goals, thus contributing to poverty reduction. Drawing on longitudinal household and qualitative community data, the authors examine {{the impact of}} shocks on household living standards, study the correlates of participation in groups and formal and informal networks, and discuss the relationship of networks with access to other forms of capital. In this context, they assess how one form of collective action, iddir, or burial societies, help households attenuate the impact of illness. They find that iddir effectively deal with problems of asymmetric information by restricting membership geographically, imposing a membership fee, and conducting checks on how the funds were spent. The study also finds that while iddir help poor households cope with individual health shocks, but shows that the better-off households belong to more groups and have larger networks. In addition, where households have limited ability to develop spatial networks, collective action has limited ability to respond to covariate shocks. Therefore, realism is needed in terms of the ability of collective action to respond to shocks, and direct public action is more appropriate to deal with common shocks.

40|$|Notions of double-rootedness {{were deeply}} {{ingrained}} in Zimbabweâ€™s urban migrantsâ€™ lives. Double- ootedness implies {{holding on to}} the concept of â€˜homeâ€™ while simultaneously being located in a foreign setting. Home in the context of urban women migrants from Chinhoyi and Harare implies a connection with some village or rural place. When applied from outside the country â€˜homeâ€™ refers to Zimbabwe. For the women urban migrants in the study double rootedness was adopted as a survival strategy {{in the face of a}} declining and collapsing national economy. For many urban migrants double-rootedness implied having a real or imagined connection with some rural place called â€˜homeâ€™. The paper builds on the experience gained by the author during 12 -months of an OSSREA funded research project conducted in 2002 in Chinhoyi the capital city of Mashonaland West Province and Harare, Zimbabweâ€™s capital. The methodology adopted for the study was mainly qualitative in nature. The research participants for this study displayed double-rootedness in their really or imagined life-worlds. For this group of women research participants, social networks played a critical role in enabling them access the much needed resources, information and social support. Thus, urban women migrants in this study demonstrate little support for the thesis that under conditions of scarcity and poverty there is little basis for reciprocity. Shared knowledge and information and the activation of social networks enabled many migrants to access accommodation, jobs and other resources thus, allowing many to continue to stay in town and to support their households. Not only did networks enrich peopleâ€™s lives, they acted as a resource that enabled many to hang on, cope and at times even propel some migrants to climb out of <b>poverty.</b> <b>Networks</b> generally involved kin, friends and neighbours. The study showed that nonkin networks became more pronounced under conditions of <b>poverty.</b> Social <b>networks</b> had become a key organisational principle among urban residents. An interesting observation noted amongst many urban residents was their shared perceptions that the rural area was still their home. This view persisted even amongst urban migrants with minimum contact with their rural homes...|$|R

Environmental income accounts for 28 % of total household income, 77 % of which comes from natural forests. Environmental income shares are higher for low-income households, but differences across income quintiles are less pronounced than previously thought.

In absolute terms environmental income is approximately five times higher in the highest income quintile, compared to the two lowest quintiles...|$|R
