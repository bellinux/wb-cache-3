5|$|St Andrew's was {{the venue}} {{for the first}} use of a penalty shootout to {{determine}} the winner of an FA Cup match. For five seasons, between 1970 and 1974, the losing FA Cup semifinalists were obliged to <b>play</b> <b>off</b> for third and fourth place; Birmingham City {{finished third in the}} 1971–72 FA Cup by beating Stoke City 4–3 on penalties following a goalless 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The club {{finished}} third in the 2011–12 Football League Championship with 86 points and took part in the play-offs. They beat Cardiff City in the <b>play</b> <b>off</b> semi-final 5–0 on aggregate to reach the final against Blackpool at Wembley on 19 May 2012. Carlton Cole opened the scoring, and although Blackpool equalised early in the second half, Ricardo Vaz Tê scored the winner for West Ham in the 87th minute.|$|E
5|$|He scored an {{important}} equaliser against Wigan Athletic in the <b>play</b> <b>off</b> semi final first leg (which {{was also the}} last ever goal to be scored at Springfield Park). The sixteenth goal was particularly crucial, a 15-yard, top corner injury time equaliser in {{the final of the}} promotion playoffs against Gillingham. Dickov's 95th-minute goal took the game to extra time, and the Manchester team ultimately won to earn promotion to the First Division. This goal, scored past Vince Bartram, the best man at Dickov's wedding, was voted City's Greatest Ever Goal in a 2005 poll conducted by Manchester City.|$|E
50|$|He took York to sixth place {{again with}} eleven wins and ten losses. Even {{though there were}} three {{promotion}} places available (two automatic, one via the <b>play</b> <b>offs),</b> the Knights failed to capitalise and lost in the <b>play</b> <b>offs</b> to Rochdale Hornets 12-28. Gateshead Thunder and Barrow Raiders went up automatically, Doncaster went up via the <b>play</b> <b>offs.</b>|$|R

5|$|In England, Chappell rewarded {{the faith}} of the {{selectors}} by scoring the most first-class runs on the tour (1,261 runs, including 202 not out against Warwickshire), leading the Australian Test aggregates with 348 runs (at 43.50). His top score was 81 in the fourth Test at Leeds. Wisden lauded his <b>play</b> <b>off</b> the back foot and judged him the most difficult Australian batsman to dismiss. In a summer severely affected by rain, Australia drew the series and retained The Ashes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} {{game of the}} season and the third of his career, McGary posted a game-high 9 rebounds in 17 minutes of <b>play</b> <b>off</b> the bench against Cleveland State on November 13. McGary also went 3-for-3 on his field goals. McGary reached double figures in scoring for the first time December 4 against Western Michigan (Michigan's eighth {{game of the season}}) when he scored 10 points on 5-for-5 {{shooting}} in 14 minutes of <b>play</b> <b>off</b> the bench. He had his first 10-rebound game on December 11 against the Binghamton Bearcats. On December 20, he posted his first double-double with a then career-high 11 rebounds and 10 points as well as a then career-high 3 steals in just 18 minute of play against Eastern Michigan. On December 24, he was recognized as Big Ten Freshman of the Week. On January 6, McGary tied then career high with 11 rebounds, tied a then career high 2 assists and set a career high with 3 blocked shots against Iowa. On January 28, Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes. It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the Fab Five 1992–93 team did so on December 5, 1992.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2005, Miller joined Leeds United on {{loan for}} three months, {{though this was}} later {{extended}} {{to the end of}} the 2005–06 season. He scored one goal during his time at Leeds, the winning goal in the 4–3 away win against Southampton on 19 November 2005 and helped Leeds to reach the Championship play-off final with a 3–1 on aggregate over Preston North End. Miller featured in the <b>play</b> <b>off</b> final. However, Leeds failed to overcome Watford; they were beaten 3–0 and so missed out on promotion to the Premier League. During his time at Elland Road, he had scored one goal in 28 games.|$|E
50|$|For {{the second}} stage, played from 3-10 October, the top teams in each pool were {{bracketed}} together {{to determine the}} pre-season competition winner. Semifinals and a consolation final and final were played to decide positions 1 to 4. The second-ranked teams in each pool <b>played</b> <b>off</b> for positions 5 to 8, the third-ranked teams <b>played</b> <b>off</b> for positions 9 to 12, and the bottom teams from each pool <b>played</b> <b>off</b> for positions 13 to 16.|$|R

5|$|The highest {{seasonal}} average at {{the stadium}} since it was opened was 46,790 in the 2000–01 season while Sunderland were playing in the Premier League. The lowest average attendance at the Stadium of Light was 27,119 in the 2003–04 season in Division One. The highest total seasonal attendance was recorded during the 1998–99 season when the aggregate was 890,660 in a season where Sunderland were First Division champions, and League Cup semi-finalists. The lowest seasonal aggregate at the Stadium of Light was 623,741 in the 2003–04 season, the same season that the club were FA Cup and <b>play</b> <b>off</b> semi-finalists.|$|E
5|$|Some {{continue}} to <b>play</b> <b>off</b> the homosexual interpretations of Batman. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics {{refused to allow}} permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. Another happened {{in the summer of}} 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.|$|E
5|$|When Royle became Ipswich manager, {{the club}} was {{struggling}} near the Division One relegation zone, but the change in management sparked a revival and Ipswich narrowly failed to reach the 2002–03 play-offs. The club came out of administration during the 2003–04 season, and continued to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League. Ipswich finished that season in fifth place, but were beaten in the play-off semi finals by West Ham United 2–1 on aggregate. Ipswich missed automatic promotion in the 2004–05 season, finishing third, only two points behind second-placed Wigan Athletic. Again, they lost to West Ham United in the <b>play</b> <b>off</b> semi-finals, this time by a 4–2 aggregate score. Although they had been pre-season promotion favourites for the 2005–06 season, Ipswich finished 15th, the club's lowest finish since 1966, and Joe Royle resigned on 11 May 2006.|$|E

5|$|The writers {{intended}} to <b>play</b> <b>off</b> {{the idea of}} a hidden character being able to hear conversations revealing secrets. An initial idea of Pemberton's was to have a large parcel on a table at the birthday party, but with Maggie—on whose birthday the episode would be set—absent. Other characters would repeatedly ask where Maggie was, until it was revealed that her head was in the parcel. This idea developed into the possibility of a hollow cake hiding a character, a device used in the final episode. For the writers, there is humour in characters spending time talking earnestly to a cake; they noted that the prop cake had features resembling a face. In the editing stage, the production team kept reintroducing the cake in order to remind viewers of its presence. The original script ended with a knife being plunged into a fake cake followed by the revelation, contrary to viewers' expectations, that no one was under it at the time; instead, the writers upped the drama in the story, making it possible that any of the characters injured. For the writers, the original plot was, in a sense, darker, as some characters got away with wrongdoing in a way they do not in the final version.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{weather in}} the {{following}} two years affected playing conditions, making the cricket pitches slow-paced and difficult to bat on. With little experience of such conditions, MacLaren had a succession of failures. His technique, based at the time on playing forward at the ball, was unsuited to wet pitches {{and it was only}} late in 1889 that he made the required technical adjustments and learned to <b>play</b> <b>off</b> the back foot (i.e. stepping backwards to play a shot). During 1890, his final year at Harrow, he captained the team and had his most successful season, scoring over 500 runs at an average of 42.54. In the match against Eton at Lord's, MacLaren once more succeeded when others struggled, and he scored 76 on a difficult pitch. In his four years at Harrow, MacLaren was twice awarded the prize for the school's best batsman, and received awards for his fielding. MacLaren also played football successfully: he captained his House team and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season. Unlike many of his fellow amateur cricketers in this period, MacLaren did not attend Oxford or Cambridge Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his father could not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank.|$|E
