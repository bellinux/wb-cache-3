While {{the government has}} the power to decide what measures to adopt, it cannot choose to do nothing {{in the face of the}} violation of Quebecers' right to security.

40|$|Purpose of the article: Organizations {{implementing}} {{economic activity}} in the Czech Republic are obliged to follow the binding written and unwritten legislation. Accounting entities are required to keep accounting records {{in accordance with the}} valid Czech accounting legislation while respecting a number of unwritten, but globally accepted standards. Among the important standards by which accounting is regulated we can count accounting policies and principles. This paper deals with the issue of valuation and correction mechanisms of valuation, which enable us to fulfill the accounting rules and principles, especially the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>prudence.</b> Methodology/methods: Contribution use general scientific methods, especially analysis, synthesis, comparison, induction and deduction. The research project was done by means of questionnaires. To evaluate the results specific statistical method was used, especially Kruskal-Wallis test. Scientific aim: Using specific examples, the paper describes different ways of application of selected tools aiming to fulfill the principle of valuation and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>prudence,</b> {{especially in the case of}} residual values of property and in the use of provisions. Different, but allowable possibilities of application of selected tools of the principle of valuation and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>prudence</b> affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, yields and economy results in the financial statements. Findings: For statistical evaluation Kruskall-Wallis test was used. Obtained values were first assigned to the order, row sums were made and test statistic Q [Q= 7. 94318] was calculated. The obtained value was compared with the value of tables of critical values of X 2 test [X 2 = 2, 17] and it was found that the distribution functions differ significantly from each other. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the attitude of various organizations in the application of the principle of valuation and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>prudence</b> is significantly different. The research pointed to the problems organizations have to face in connection with the constantly changing accounting legislation. Organizations have difficulties with capturing these changes and with rapid response to them.

For, besides this foolish <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> policy, which he gives {{as a reason for}} defying the orders of the Company, and for insulting the country, that had never before seen a woman in that situation, and his declaration to the Company, that their government cannot be supported by private justice, (a favorite maxim, which he holds upon all occasions,) besides these reasons which he gave for his politic injustice, he gives the following. The Company had ordered that 30,000l. should be given to the person appointed. He knew that the Company could never dream of giving this woman 30,000l. a year, and he makes use of that circumstance to justify him in putting her in that place: for he says, the Company, in the distressed state of its affairs, could never mean to give 30,000l. a year for the office which they order to be filled; and accordingly, upon <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> economy, as well as upon <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>prudence,</b> he sees there could be no occasion for giving this salary, and that it will be saved to the Company. But no sooner had he given her the appointment than that appointment became a ground for giving her that money. The moment he had appointed her, he overturns the very principle upon which he had appointed her, and gives the 30,000l. to her, and the officers under her, saving not one shilling to the Company by this infamous measure, which he justified only upon the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> economy. The 30,000l. was given, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> economy vanished, a shocking arrangement was made, and Bengal saw a dancing-girl administering its justice, presiding over all its remaining power, wealth, and influence, exhibiting to the natives of the country their miserable state of degradation, and the miserable dishonor of the English Company in Mr. Hastings's abandonment of all his own pretences.|$|R
