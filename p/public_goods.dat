5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Various {{experimental}} {{studies have examined}} the effects of tax parameters on tax compliance. While some studies neglect tax revenues, others consider the tax-funded <b>public</b> <b>good.</b> Here we consider not only the <b>public</b> <b>good</b> funded by taxes, but also the <b>public</b> <b>good</b> established through voluntary contributions. Our experimental evidence shows that a more preferable publicly provided <b>public</b> <b>good</b> will significantly improve tax compliance and induce more voluntary contributions. However, a more preferable privately provided <b>public</b> <b>good</b> has only the latter effect. This suggests that the privately provided <b>public</b> <b>good</b> is complementary to the publicly provided <b>public</b> <b>good,</b> but the inverse does not hold. We also find that the increase in the audit probability can curb tax evasion, and that changes in income and tax rates have no effect on either tax compliance or voluntary contributions...|$|R
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E
25|$|Common {{confusion}} is that <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> are goods {{provided by the}} public sector. Although it {{is often the case}} that government is involved in producing <b>public</b> <b>goods,</b> this is not necessarily the case. <b>Public</b> <b>goods</b> may be naturally available.

40|$|Play in {{standard}} laboratory <b>Public</b> <b>Good</b> games suggests that on average, humans are quite prone to cooperate. Yet cooperation is often absent {{in real world}} social dilemmas, including many environmental problems. We propose that this discrepancy arises because in the <b>Public</b> <b>Good</b> game, the worst freeriders {{can do is to}} not contribute to the public account, while in many real world environmental situations freeriders can even appropriate contributions made by others before the <b>public</b> <b>good</b> is produced. We introduce the Claim Game that modifies the <b>Public</b> <b>Good</b> game by allowing for appropriating the contributions of others before the <b>public</b> <b>good</b> is produced. The impact of such possible takings on <b>public</b> <b>good</b> production is dramatic. No <b>public</b> <b>good</b> is produced, not even in the initial stages of interaction, We link our findings to the relevance of common pool games for modeling environmental problems, and stress the need to experimentally test environmental institutions within harsher social dilemmas than the standard <b>Public</b> <b>Good</b> game.

40|$|We {{consider}} a <b>public</b> <b>good</b> provision game with voluntary participation.

We examine how the equilibrium <b>public</b> <b>good</b> provision level is affected by enlarging the population of an economy. We introduce a condition for an allocation rule, the asymptotic uniform continuity in replication (AUCR), which requires that small changes in the population must yield only small changes in the <b>public</b> <b>good</b> provision and which is satisfied by many mechanisms.

Our bargaining model is built on simultaneous bilateral bargaining and the bargaining power of the supplier is a key factor for the analysis. We show that under some mild conditions, the supplier produces the <b>public</b> <b>good</b> at a Pareto-efficient level in equilibrium if and only if his/her bargaining power is sufficiently weak. In addition, under some reasonable parametric functions, we show that the equilibrium likelihood of the efficient provision of the <b>public</b> <b>good</b> diminishes as the number of beneficiaries increases.

25|$|Common {{examples}} of <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> include: defence, public fireworks, lighthouses, {{clean air and}} other environmental goods, and information goods, such as official statistics, software development, authorship, and invention. Some goods, like orphan drugs, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but can't be classified as <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> since they don't fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.) Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as <b>public</b> <b>goods,</b> but they are technically classified in economic terms as quasi-public goods because excludability is possible, but they do still fit some {{of the characteristics of}} <b>public</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E

25|$|Stouten (2006) further {{generalized}} {{the principle}} of fairness {{to be applied to}} the provision of <b>public</b> <b>goods.</b> He and his colleagues ran three experiments to find how participants reacted when one member of their group violated the equality rule, which states that all group members will coordinate to equally and fairly contribute to the efficient provision of <b>public</b> <b>goods.</b> Their findings demonstrated that the participants believed that the equality rule should be applied to others and therefore when one person violated this rule punishment was used against this person, in terms of negative reactions. Therefore, the equality rule applied in real life situations should lead to the efficient provision of <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> if violations of the important coordination and fairness rules can be detected. However, often these violations cannot be detected which then leads to the free rider problem and an under-provision of <b>public</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the method}} of {{providing}} <b>public</b> <b>goods,</b> the efficient level of such provision is still being subjected to economic analysis.

25|$|Producers and producer-groups {{spend this}} social premium to support {{socioeconomic}} {{development in a}} variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in <b>public</b> <b>goods</b> that infrastructure and the government are lacking in.

At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in <b>public</b> <b>goods,</b> like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} empirically {{the findings of}} an analytical impure <b>public</b> <b>good</b> model. The impure <b>public</b> <b>good</b> model described in this study allows {{for the application of}} different technologies generating public and private characteristics.

Design/methodology/approach – After the illustration of the impure <b>public</b> <b>good</b> model, the analytical results are compared to the results of a numerical approach based on climate policy in Germany. Findings – The study shows that comparative static analyses do not always generate clear results. Therefore, the numerical approach is helpful to derive unambiguous results.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{provision of}} a differentiated <b>public</b> <b>good</b> within an organization. A moderate principal assigns a <b>public</b> <b>good</b> production {{to one of}} two extreme agents. A contributing agent then gets the opportunity to choose a <b>public</b> <b>good</b> variety he prefers but has to carry a cost of production. If a production cost is lower than a benefit from having their preferred <b>public</b> <b>good</b> variety implemented then the agents seek assignment. I show that in this case the principal makes the agents compete by committing to <b>public</b> <b>good</b> varieties they would provide if selected. The agents want to make themselves an attractive choice and so announce moderate (still divergent) varieties if production is costly, and the principal's preferred variety if production is not costly. However, if the production cost exceeds the benefit from having their preferred <b>public</b> <b>good</b> variety implemented then the agents want to avoid assignment. My results suggest that in this case the principal just assigns an unpopular <b>public</b> <b>good</b> production to a less extreme agent. ...|$|R
