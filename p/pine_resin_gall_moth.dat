40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>resin,</b> {{one type}} of non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFPs), is important for Indonesia.    In addition to its high economic value, <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> also has bright domestic and international market prospects.   Utilization of commercial <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> {{has been carried out}} in Indonesia, but the forest road network required for extracting <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> has not been specifically planned. To date, the planning and selection of forest road network  in  forest management in Indonesia are intended only for the extraction of  timber products and have not been integrated with the use of NTFPs; also,  they have not considered the economic, ecological, and social aspects a whole. Planning and selection of forest road network have focused more on economic aspects only. This study aimed at planning and assessing the forest road network for extracting <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> by considering the economic, ecological, and social criteria.   Decision- making method used  to select the best  forest road network was utility analysis.   Indicator used  included road length, road density, a correction factor for manual carrying of <b>pine</b> <b>resin,</b> <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> carrying distance, road construction cost, and productivity of carrying and extracting <b>pine</b> <b>resin.</b> The result of  the utility analysis indicates that an alternative of forest road network for extracting <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> has no the whole best indicators, but it has the highest utility value.   This study suggested that the use of the utility analysis help the decision makers to selects process for forest  road network alternative easily and rapidly.

The Chippewa also used <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> to successfully treat infections and even gangrenous wounds. This is because <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> apparently has a number of quite efficient antimicrobials. Generally a wet pulp from the inner bark, or pine tar mixed with beeswax or butter was applied to wounds and used as a salve to prevent infection.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify chemical composition of merkus <b>pine</b> <b>resin,</b> rosin and turpentine oil. Initially, <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> was separated into neutral and acidic fractions with an aqueous 4 % sodium hydroxide solution. After methylation, the fraction containing turpentine oil and rosin were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The neutral fraction of <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> and turpentine oil mainly consisted of a-pinene, D- 3 -carene and b-pinene. Based on mass spectral comparison, the major constituents of the acidic fraction and rosin were identified as sandaracopimaric acid, isopimaric acid, palustric acid, dehydroabietic acid, abietic acid, neoabietic acid, and merkusic acid. The major component of the acidic fractions was palustric acid, while that of rosin was abietic acid. Using TC (tough column) 1 and TC 5 columns, levopimaric acid could not be separated from rosin or acidic fraction of <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> of Indonesian Pinus merkusii...|$|R

50|$|Retsina (Ρετσίνα) is a Greek white (or rosé) resinated wine, {{which has}} been made for at least 2000 years.

Before the invention of impermeable glass bottles, oxygen caused many wines to spoil within the year. <b>Pine</b> <b>resin</b> helped keep air out, {{while at the same time}} infusing the wine with resin aroma.

50|$|Presently, India imports resin {{which is}} far {{superior}} in quality as well as cheaper than the indigenous one. Quality of resin depends on the pinene content. Imported resin contains 75-95% pinenes, whereas chir <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> contains only about 25% pinenes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} part of the 20th century, {{extensive}} commercial exploitation of wood, paper, and <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> began, and these industries became an important part of the regional economy. Many local people are still employed in forest-related pursuits, including forestry, sawmills, paper mills, woodcrafts like parquetry and joinery and furniture making, as well the fabrication of paper-based products like cardboard and fiberboard for construction. However, resin-collecting, which required hard labor, has almost completely disappeared because modern chemical processes for producing solvents and other useful chemicals often do not rely on <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> or <b>pine</b> tar as a precursor. DRT is the largest company in this region that uses the byproducts of pine exploitation.|$|R
