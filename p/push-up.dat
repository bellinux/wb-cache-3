5|$|In 1991, the <b>push-up</b> Wonderbra {{became a}} {{sensation}} in the UK, {{although it had}} been sold there since 1964 under license by the Gossard division of Courtaulds Textiles. Sara Lee Corporation did not renew Gossard's license and redesigned the <b>push-up</b> style for the reintroduction of the Wonderbra to the U.S. market in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1994 relaunch, the U.S. Wonderbra has {{expanded}} from the single <b>push-up</b> bra design {{to a broader}} lingerie line. The brand remains popular {{around the world as}} a product, and a part of the cultural lexicon.|$|E
5|$|In a March 2008 {{survey of}} 3,000 UK women, the Wonderbra was {{reported}} {{as the greatest}} fashion innovation in history. According to one magazine article, survey respondents were nearly unanimous in giving <b>push-up</b> bras the number one position.|$|E

Stroe managed 20 90-degree <b>push-ups,</b> beating his previous record of 12, live on Romanian TV. By 2011, Giuliano could do up to 40 90-degree <b>push-ups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{record for}} the most <b>push-ups</b> {{non-stop}} was 10,507, set by Minoru Yoshida of Japan in October 1980. Yoshida's record was the last for non-stop <b>push-ups</b> {{to be published by}} Guinness World Records. A new category, [...] "Most <b>Push-ups</b> in 24 Hours," [...] has since been introduced.|$|R
50|$|Giuliano {{has also}} broken world records {{every year since}} then. Those include: human flag (1 minute 32 seconds), human flag pullups (31), and muscle ups (41). He also has {{unofficial}} records like 20 <b>push-ups</b> on 4 glass bottles, 10, 90 degree <b>push-ups</b> on two rings, 40 handstand <b>push-ups,</b> a one-handed handstand for more than 20 seconds, an iron cross for more than 40 seconds, and one-handed 90-degree <b>push-ups</b> on a pommel support.|$|R
5|$|Since 1994, the Wonderbra has {{expanded}} from the single <b>push-up</b> design into a full-range lingerie fashion label {{in most of}} the world. In most countries, the brand emphasizes sex-appeal. In its native Canada, however, the brand promotes the functional qualities of its products—a departure from the strategy that made Wonderbra the top-seller in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Bikini tops come {{in several}} {{different}} styles and cuts, including a halter-style neck that offers more coverage and support, a strapless bandeau, a rectangular strip of fabric covering the breasts that minimizes large breasts, a top with cups similar to a <b>push-up</b> bra, and the more traditional triangle cups that lift and shape the breasts.|$|E
25|$|Many people regard bare female breasts to be aesthetically {{pleasing}} or erotic, {{and they}} can elicit heightened sexual desires in men in many cultures. In the ancient Indian work the Kama Sutra, light scratching of the breasts with nails and biting with teeth are considered erotic. Some people show a sexual interest in female breasts distinct {{from that of the}} person, which may be regarded as a breast fetish. A number of Western fashions include clothing which accentuate the breasts, {{such as the use of}} <b>push-up</b> bras and decollete (plunging neckline) gowns and blouses which show cleavage. While U.S. culture prefers breasts that are youthful and upright, some cultures venerate women with drooping breasts, indicating mothering and the wisdom of experience.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first record}} for <b>push-ups</b> was {{documented}} by Guinness World Records: 6,006 non-stop <b>push-ups</b> by Charles Linster in 1965, October 5.|$|R

25|$|Designer Anne Cole, {{described}} as a godmother of swimwear in the USA, was originator of this style. She scored what would be her biggest hit in 1998 when her label introduced the tankini. A two-piece suit with a top half that covered more of a woman's torso than a standard bikini top, the suit was an instant hit with customers. Variations of the tankini, made of spandex-and-cotton or Lycra-and-nylon, have been named camkini, with spaghetti straps instead of tank-shaped straps over a bikini bottom, and even bandeaukini, with a bandeau worn as the top. Tankinis {{come in a variety}} of styles, colors and shapes, some include features such as integrated <b>push-up</b> bras. It is particularly popular as children's beachwear, and athletic outfit good enough for a triathlon. According to Katherine Betts, Vogue's fashion-news director, this amphibious sportswear for sand or sea lets the user go rafting, playing volleyball and swimming without worrying about losing their top.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people in}} Western culture, {{both male and}} female, {{consider}} breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic and {{an important aspect of}} femininity and many women use décolletage that exposes cleavage as part of their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a <b>push-up</b> bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention. During adolescence, some girls become obsessed with breast shape and cleavage. In South Africa, Wonderbra sponsors a National Cleavage Day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage has been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical paraphilia.|$|E
500|$|The Wonderbra {{is a type}} of <b>push-up</b> underwire {{brassiere}} that gained worldwide {{prominence in}} the 1990s. Although the Wonderbra name was first trademarked in the U.S. in 1955, the brand was developed in Canada. Moses (Moe) Nadler, founder and majority owner of the Canadian Lady Corset Company, licensed the trademark for the Canadian market in 1939. By the 1960s the Canadian Lady brand had become known in Canada as [...] "Wonderbra, the company." [...] In 1961 the company introduced the Model 1300 plunge <b>push-up</b> bra. This bra became one of the best-selling Canadian styles and is virtually identical to today's Wonderbra.|$|E
5000|$|The current {{world record}} for most <b>push-ups</b> in 24 hours is by Charles Servizio (USA) who {{achieved}} 46,001 <b>push-ups</b> in just 21 hours, 6 minutes on 1993, April 24 to 25.|$|R
50|$|Paul Henry Allen Lynch was a {{multiple}} Guinness World Record holder through the 1980s, and 1990s. Paul {{was best known}} for his previous world records in <b>push-ups,</b> and most notably consecutive one-finger <b>push-ups.</b>|$|R

500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Moe Nadler started {{traveling}} to Europe {{to find new}} styles {{to bring to the}} Canadian market. In 1960, Wonderbra introduced a lacy, half <b>push-up</b> bra described in Europe as Pigeonnant (meaning [...] "pigeon-breasted" [...] in French). In 1961 Nadler directed Louise Poirier to develop a deeply plunged, laced <b>push-up</b> design, numbered the 1300. Canadian Lady licensed these models, among others, to Gossard in 1964. It was the Wonderbra [...] "Dream Lift" [...] Model 1300 design that became first a UK success in the early 1990s, a European sensation in 1993, and then the [...] "One and Only Wonderbra" [...] that was finally launched in the U.S. in 1994.|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s, Howard Hughes had an underwire <b>push-up</b> bra {{designed}} for Jane Russell to emphasize her breasts in The Outlaw. According to Russell, the [...] "ridiculous" [...] contraption was painful and she secretly wore her own bra during the movie. The brassiere {{is now in}} a Hollywood museum.|$|E
500|$|The Playtex Division of Sara Lee {{was given}} the {{responsibility}} of introducing [...] "The Wonderbra" [...] style to the United States. Although the model was already being manufactured in Montreal by Canadelle, Playtex executives {{decided to take a}} year to redesign the bra for the U.S. market. They scheduled a late 1994 national launch for the bra. During this period, Gossard introduced to Americans their Ultrabra, with a design similar to the <b>push-up</b> Wonderbra model. Other competitors quickly followed while Playtex retooled the design. Victoria's Secret launched television advertisements to maintain visibility for the Miracle Bra which the company launched in 1993.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, mascot Zach Mills {{began the}} {{tradition}} of doing a number <b>push-ups</b> after every score equal {{to the number of}} points Clemson had in the game. [...] Mills performed 287 <b>push-ups</b> in that game, a record that was later eclipsed by Ricky Capps, who performed 465 <b>push-ups</b> in an 82-24 victory over Wake Forest during the 1981 national championship season. [...] The tradition is now commonly emulated by other college mascots.|$|R
50|$|With <b>push-ups,</b> many {{possibilities}} for customization and increased intensity are possible. Some examples are: One hand {{can be set}} on a higher platform than the other or be {{farther away from the}} other to give more weight to the opposite arm/side of the body and also exercise many diverse muscles. One can perform <b>push-ups</b> by using only the tips of the fingers and thumb. For increased difficulty, <b>push-ups</b> can be performed on one arm or using weights.|$|R

500|$|The U.S. Wonderbra rollout {{included}} {{events with}} Eva Herzigová in New York's Times Square. The advertisements were toned down {{in comparison to}} the earlier UK campaign. The U.S. print and billboard advertising showed models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as [...] "who cares if it's a bad hair day" [...] and [...] "look me in the eyes and tell me that you love me." [...] The $25 Million campaign worked in conjunction to the ongoing media interest in the bra. Although Playtex promoted the authenticity of their [...] "One and Only Wonderbra", the rapid introduction of competitive products meant that the overall U.S. market benefited from a 43% increase in <b>push-up</b> bra sales by the end of 1994.|$|E
500|$|The {{precursor}} to the underwire bra {{can be traced back}} to at least 1893, when New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent [...] for a [...] "breast supporter". The breast supporter was described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern <b>push-up</b> bra designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard, or other stiff material, shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas, or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits, held in place and adjusted to a snug fit by shoulder straps that crossed the back, forming an X-shape. It was secured with hook-and-eye closures.|$|E
500|$|As the {{swimsuit}} was evolving, the underwear {{started to}} change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed {{the changes in}} underwear designs. In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the [...] "breast girdle". During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for {{both women and men}} were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties {{for the rest of the}} century. Warner standardized the concept of Cup size in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938. Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband. Howard Hughes designed a <b>push-up</b> bra to be worn by Jane Russell in The Outlaw in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the 'contraption'. In 1950 Maidenform introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{considerable}} {{differences of}} opinion as to who [...] "invented" [...] the modern brassière or bra. Patent dates indicate some of the landmark developments; {{a large number of}} patents for bra-like devices were granted in the 19th century. However, what is regarded as the world's oldest <b>push-up</b> bra was discovered in storage at the Science Museum in London. Designed to enhance cleavage, the bra is said to be from the early 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|In 2600 BCE, princess Nofret of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt was {{depicted}} in a V-neck gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage. In 1600 BCE, Snake Goddess figurines were sculpted in Minos with open dress-fronts, revealing entire breasts. Ancient Greek goddess Hera wore {{an early version}} of a <b>push-up</b> bra, described in the Iliad as festooned with [...] "brooches of gold" [...] and [...] "a hundred tassels", to increase her cleavage to divert Zeus from the Trojan War.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} types of bare-midriff bikini tops: the brassière, halter, bandeau, and vest.
