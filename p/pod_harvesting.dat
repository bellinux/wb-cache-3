40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{functional}} relations among plant traits and their modulation by growing conditions is imperative in designing selection strategies for breeding programs. This study assessed trait relationships among 196 common bean genotypes exposed to stresses for drought and field infestation of bean fly or bean stem maggot (BSM). The study {{was carried out}} at two locations and data was analyzed with linear correlation, path coefficient and genotype×trait biplot analyses. Multiple trait data related to mechanisms of drought and bean fly tolerance were collected on 196 genotypes grown under i) water deficit at mid-pod fill, or ii) unprotected against bean fly; iii) irrigated, well watered conditions, or iv) bean fly protection with chemicals. Seed yield exhibited positive and significant correlations with leaf chlorophyll content, vertical root pulling resistance, <b>pod</b> <b>harvest</b> index, <b>pods</b> per plant and seeds per pod at both phenotypic and genotypic levels under stress and non-stress conditions. Genotypic correlations of traits with seed yield were greater than their respective phenotypic correlations across environments indicating the greater contribution of genotypic factors to the trait correlation. Pods per plant and seeds per pod had high positive direct effects on seed yield both under stress and non-stress whereas pods per plant had the highest indirect effect on seed yield through <b>pod</b> <b>harvest</b> index under stress. In general, our results suggest that vertical root pulling resistance and <b>pod</b> <b>harvest</b> index are important selection objectives for improving seed yield in common beans under non-stress and stress conditions, and particularly useful for drought and BSM tolerance evaluation...|$|R

Identification of traits associated with drought resistance contributes to improving the process of generating bean genotypes adapted to these conditions. Field studies were conducted at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Palmira, Colombia, to determine the relationship between grain yield and different parameters such as effective use of water (EUW), canopy biomass and dry partitioning indices (<b>pod</b> partitioning index, <b>harvest</b> index and <b>pod</b> <b>harvest</b> index) in elite lines selected for drought resistance over the past decade. Carbon isotope discrimination (CID) was used for estimation of water use efficiency (WUE). The main objectives were: (i) to identify specific morpho-physiological traits that contribute to improved resistance to drought in lines developed over several cycles of breeding and that could be useful as selection criteria in breeding; and (ii) to identify genotypes with desirable traits that could serve as parents in the corresponding breeding programs. A set of 36 bean genotypes belonging to the Middle American gene pool were evaluated under field conditions with two levels of water supply (irrigated and drought) over two seasons. Eight bean lines (NCB 280, NCB 226, SEN 56, SCR 2, SCR 16, SMC 141, RCB 593 and BFS 67) were identified as resistant to drought stress. Resistance to terminal drought stress was positively associated with EUW combined with increased dry matter partitioned to pod and seed production and negatively associated with days to flowering and days to physiological maturity. Differences in genotypic response were observed between grain CID and grain yield under irrigated and drought stress. Based on phenotypic differences in CID, leaf stomatal conductance, canopy biomass and grain yield under drought stress, the lines tested were classified into two groups, water savers and water spenders. <b>Pod</b> <b>harvest</b> index could be a useful selection criterion in breeding programs to select for drought resistance in common bean...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION - Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is {{the main}} source of protein (20 to 25 %) for most people in the world; protein from soybean is higher but is {{primarily}} use for livestock. Dry bean yield is often lower than 1000 kg ha- 1 in most dry bean producing regions except the US. Besides drought, low soil fertility and ineffective nitrogen (N) management strategies are the most important yield-limiting factors for dry bean production worldwide (Fageria et al., 2013). Use of N-efficient dry bean genotypes, optimal timing of N application(s), and identifying a costeffective N rate are good strategies to optimize dry bean profitability. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate fifteen pinto bean cultivars grown in the greenhouse with two rates of nitrogen fertilizer for physiological/growth traits and their tolerance to low N. MATERIAL AND METHODS - Seed of (Bill Z, Centennial, CO 46348, COSD- 25, COSD- 35,Croissant, El Dorado, ISB 1231 - 1, La Paz, Lariat, Long’s Peak, ND 307, Othello, Poncho, and UIP- 40) were sown in 11. 3 L pots (8 kg of soil) in the greenhouse (four pots per cultivars) on 20 September 2016 in Laramie WY (2200 m elevation). Seed were inoculated with a commercial inoculant at planting. The soil mix was 33 % sand, 33 % soil amendment, and 33 % native soil. Seedlings were thinned to three per pot at two weeks. Aqueous fertilizer treatments (NH 4 NO 3) were applied at (25, 32, 39, and 46 days after planting, dap) in two rates (0 and 67 kg N ha- 1 seasonal equivalent). A randomized complete block design was used with two replicates. Leaf chlorophyll (CHYL) was measured on the third uppermost fully-expanded leaf by using a chlorophyll meter (SPAD- 502) at (26, 33, 40, 47, and 54 dap). The height, root mass, and stalk mass was determined at maturity. Seed yield, <b>pod</b> <b>harvest</b> index (PHI), and nitrogen susceptibility index (NSI) were also determined at maturity. <b>Pod</b> <b>harvest</b> index equaled seed weight divided by the sum of pod wall plus seed weight; NSI was calculated as the cultivar’s percentage reduction in yield due to zero N divided by the average yield reduction due to zero N...|$|R

Yield of green marketable <b>pods</b> (intermediate <b>harvest)</b> andmature <b>pods</b> (final <b>harvest)</b> was generally reduced in non-EDU-treated plants compared to EDU-treated plants and differences inyield reduction between harvests varied between years. The yield of mature pods was reduced in 1994 and 1996 while the yield ofgreen pods was reduced in 1995 by ozone only. Since yield reduction was not correlated with AOT 40, the EDU method was notvalid to determine an ozone exposure-yield reponse relationshipfor bean...|$|R
40|$|Seeds {{of three}} {{chickpea}} genotypes having different seed coat colours viz; Noor 91 (white), Punjab 91 (brown) and C 141 (black) were treated at 40, 50 and 60 Kr separately and with gibberellic acid (GA 3). Three genotypes responded differentially for path analysis and correlation coefficient studies for various traits. Plant height, number of {{primary and secondary}} branches had negative path coefficient in Noor 91 and Punjab 91 while, these were positive in C 141. Pods per plant were positively contributed in the three varieties while biological yield in Noor 91 and Punjab 91. 100 -seed weight and maturity days had positive direct effect on grain yield in Noor 91 and C 141 while, these were negative in Punjab 91. The genotypic correlations {{in most of the}} characters were higher than the corresponding phenotypic correlations. Pods per plant had positive and highly significant correlation with grain yield in three genotypes. Number of primary branches was positively and significantly associated with grain yield in Punjab 91 and C 141. Seeds per <b>pod,</b> <b>harvest</b> index were highly significantly correlated while; biological yield was significantly associated with grain yield in Noor 91 and Punjab 91. Plant height and 100 -seed weight had significant and positive correlation with grain yield in Punjab 91...|$|R
25|$|Cacao <b>pods</b> are <b>harvested</b> {{by cutting}} {{them from the}} tree using a machete, or by {{knocking}} them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.|$|R
30|$|The {{cultivated}} area of peanut in Iran is about 3218, 2718  ha {{of which is}} located in the Guilan Province. About 1980 – 3500  kg/ha <b>pods</b> is <b>harvested</b> and 89327.6 tons produced in Guilan. The average shell wastes of 1  kg yield is 35 – 40  %; therefore, about 3388 – 3873 tons of peanut shells wastes are annually produced in Iran (Agriculture Organization of Guilan Province 2010). As a result, it has been decided to evaluate the possibility of using this organic waste as a growth medium for Dracaena marginata as a test plant.|$|R
