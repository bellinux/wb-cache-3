40|$|Electroplating of WO 3 -Pt {{has been}} carried out using a {{suitable}} plating bath solution and optimum working conditions. X-ray and SEM studies of the deposit reveal a smooth and uniform distribution of microparticles on the surface. New phases of the <b>plated</b> <b>material</b> appear on heat treatment. The electrocatalytic activity of the WO 3 -Pt co-deposit is considerably higher than for platinum alone. WO 3 in the WO 3 -Pt co-deposit reduces the retardation effect of methanol oxidation by the reaction intermediate observed in the case of Pt alone. WO 3 -Pt co-deposits exhibit low overpotential for methanol oxidation in both acidic and alkaline media at low temperature and have good corrosion resistance in electrolytic media. The electrochemical parameters for methanol oxidation of these co-deposits depend on trace amounts of the platinum, heat treatment and the microstructure of the coating.

40|$|In {{this paper}} four {{different}} photopolymers are compared {{on the basis}} of their suitability for holographic data storage. The optical recording parameters of these photopolymers were directly determined using the zero spatial frequency limit. The behavior of cover plated and uncover <b>plated</b> <b>material</b> layers was analyzed. Once the main parameters were determined, we proposed a novel model to simulate the recording of relief diffractive elements onto the photopolymers without cover plating. Relief surface changes provide interesting possibilities for storing diffractive optical elements on photopolymers and are an important source of information for characterizing and understanding the material behaviour. In this paper we also present a 3 -dimensional model, based on direct parameter measurements, for predicting the relief structures generated on the material. This model was successfully applied to different photopolymers with different values of monomer diffusion.

In these analyses, two different <b>plating</b> <b>materials,</b> nickel and aluminum were considered for an aluminum and a beryllium mirror substrate.

Surface errors, individual aberration terms, such as piston, tilts, focus and other aberrations were obtained by the program PCFRINGE.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{described}} {{for the movement}} of melted metallic material through a ceramic porous debris bed. The model is designed {{for the analysis of}} severe accidents in LWRs, wherein melted core <b>plate</b> <b>material</b> may slump onto the top of a porous bed of relocated core material supported by the lower head. The permeation of the melted core <b>plate</b> <b>material</b> into the porous debris bed influences the heatup of the debris bed and the heatup of the lower head supporting the debris. A model for mass transport of melted metallic material is applied that includes terms for viscosity and turbulence but neglects inertial and capillary terms because of their small value relative to gravity and viscous terms in the momentum equation. The relative permeability and passability of the porous debris are calculated as functions of debris porosity, particle size, and effective saturation. An iterative numerical solution is used to solve the set of nonlinear equations for mass transport. The effective thermal conductivity of the debris is calculated as a function of porosity, particle size, and saturation. The model integrates the equations for mass transport with a model for the two-dimensional conduction of heat through porous debris. The integrated model has been implemented into the SCDAP/RELAP 5 code for the analysis of the integrity of LWR lower heads during severe accidents. The results of the model indicate that melted core <b>plate</b> <b>material</b> may permeate to near the bottom of a 1 m deep hot porous debris bed supported by the lower head. The presence of the relocated core <b>plate</b> <b>material</b> was calculated to cause a 12 % increase in the heat flux on the external surface of the lower head...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{function}} of the electrically conductive surface of electrical contacts is electrical conduction. The electrical conductivity of contact materials can be largely reduced by corrosion {{and in order to}} avoid corrosion, protective coatings must be used. Another phenomenon that leads to increasing contact resistance is fretting corrosion. Fretting corrosion is the degradation mechanism of surface material, which causes increasing contact resistance. Fretting corrosion occurs when there is a relative movement between electrical contacts with surfaces of ignoble metal. Avoiding fretting corrosion is therefore extremely challenging in electronic devices with pluggable electrical connections. Gold {{is one of the most}} commonly used noble <b>plating</b> <b>materials</b> for high performance electrical contacts because of its high corrosion resistance and its good and stable electrical behavior. The authors have investigated different ways to minimize the consumption of gold for electrical contacts and to improve the performance of gold <b>plating.</b> Other <b>plating</b> <b>materials</b> often used for corrosion protection of electrically conductive surfaces are tin, nickel, silver and palladium.
