50|$|Following {{the events}} of the Victoria Hall {{disaster}} in Sunderland, England in 1883 in which 183 children died because a door had been bolted {{at the bottom of a}} stairwell, the British government began legal moves to enforce minimum standards for building safety. This slowly led to the legal requirement that venues must have a minimum number of outward opening doors as well as locks which could be opened from the inside. Motivated by the Sunderland disaster, Robert Alexander Briggs (1868 - 1963) invented the <b>panic</b> <b>bolt</b> which was granted a UK patent on 13 August 1892.|$|E
5000|$|Gamelyn overcomes this {{challenge}} and accepts his winnings. A surprised Johan <b>panics,</b> <b>bolting</b> the castle doors and locking Gamelyn out. Gamelyn proceeds {{to knock the}} door down and tell the servants that he has an abundance of wine and will now {{be in charge of}} the castle. He enjoys this high rank for eight days, then Johan finally retaliates. He commands the servants to bind Gamelyn in chains and have him stand for two days without any food or drink; Gamelyn grows quite weak and sickly.|$|R
50|$|Poor {{husbandry}} skills including over {{penetration of}} the flight zone results in the following behaviours: stress, <b>panic,</b> aggression, <b>bolting,</b> prey behaviour, charging, fainting, sickness and self-inflicted damage. Rough handling, such as constant flight zone pressure, can raise the heart rate of an animal. These factors are all reflective of the General Adaptation Syndrome.|$|R
5000|$|Halters are {{designed}} to catch, hold, lead and tie animals, and nothing else. [...] However, some people ride horses using a halter instead of a bridle. In most cases, it is not safe to ride in an ordinary stable halter because it fits loosely and provides no leverage to the rider should a horse <b>panic</b> or <b>bolt.</b> It is particularly unsafe if the lead rope {{is used as a}} single rein, attached to the leading ring under the jaw.|$|R
5000|$|Carter {{escapes from}} Tangier and travels to a villa near L'Estartit on the Costa Brava where Russian agent Tasia Loften is seducing Alicia Todd. Carter discovers that Judas' men will raid the villa {{and attempt to}} kidnap Todd. Carter arrives at the villa {{just as it is}} besieged by Judas' men. Carter {{arranges}} a truce with the Russian spy in exchange for help in escaping the villa. Under the influence of narcotics, Todd <b>panics</b> and <b>bolts</b> and is captured by Judas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gingen {{then lost}} {{patience}} and attacked the place, but was repulsed, {{and the governor}} at once admitted the French within the fortress. The next day {{the main body of}} the French attacked us, the guns of the fortress opening fire upon us at the same time. Our men, a great portion of whom were recruits just joined from England, fell into a <b>panic</b> and <b>bolted,</b> abandoning their allies and leaving their guns, ammunition, and stores in the hands of the enemy.|$|R
25|$|Confederate {{reinforcements}} from Heth's and Mahone's divisions arrived {{while the}} Confederate artillery under Col. William Pegram softened up the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30p.m. by six brigades against Miles's position and it {{broke through the}} northwest corner of the Union fortifications; although the Union defensive fire was fierce enough to keep the Confederates at bay, suddenly two Union regiments <b>panicked</b> and <b>bolted</b> for the rear, opening a gap. Miles ordered his reserve brigade under Col. Horace Rugg to close the gap, but to his astonishment, Rugg's men fell prone and refused to open fire. Heth personally led the charge through the earthworks, tussling with Sgt. Thomas Minton of the 26th North Carolina about who would carry the colors forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did see them, Miss Kingston, {{and that}} was the reason I came. I was afraid they might try rough {{measures}} to learn from you where I was hidden. I arrived at the window just as the scoundrel was pointing his pistol toward you, and then {{there was no time to}} give myself up, and I had nothing to do for it but to put a bullet through his head in order to save you. Then I opened fire upon the rest, and my boy drove off their horses. They were seized with a <b>panic</b> and <b>bolted,</b> thinking they were surrounded. Of course I kept up my fire, and there are four of them in the next room besides their captain. And now, if you please, I will get you, in the first place, to bind my arm tightly across my chest, for one of their bullets hit me in the left shoulder, and has, I fancy, broken it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{had very}} small {{experience}} in ghosts, {{and can only}} recall a little fright I once had when a boy at college. I'd been out to a party, got home tired, couldn't find my matches, and retired in the dark. Toward morning I woke, and glancing up {{to see if the}} dim light was dawn or moonshine I was horrified to see a coffin standing at the bed's foot. I rubbed my eyes to be sure I was awake, and looked with all my might. There it was, a long black coffin, and I saw the white plate in the dusk, for the moon was setting and my curtain was not drawn. 'It's some trick of the fellows,' I thought; 'I'll not betray myself, but keep cool.' Easy to say but hard to do, for it suddenly flashed into my mind that I might be in the wrong room. I glanced about, but there were the familiar objects as usual, as far as the indistinct light allowed me to see, and I made sure by feeling on the wall at the bed's head for my watchcase. It was there, and mine beyond a doubt, being peculiar in shape and fabric. Had I been to a college wine party I could have accounted for the vision, but a quiet evening in a grave professor's well-conducted family could produce no ill effects. 'It's an optical illusion, or a prank of my mates; I'll sleep and forget it,' I said, and for a time endeavored to do so, but curiosity overcame my resolve, and soon I peeped again. Judge of my horror when I saw the sharp white outline of a dead face, which seemed to be peeping up from the coffin. It gave me a terrible shock for I was but a lad and had been ill. I hid my face and quaked like a nervous girl, still thinking it some joke and too proud to betray fear lest I should be laughed at. How long I lay there I don't know, but when I looked again the face was farther out and the whole figure seemed rising slowly. The moon was nearly down, I had no lamp, and to be left in the dark with that awesome thing was more than I could bear. Joke or earnest, I must end the <b>panic,</b> and <b>bolting</b> out of my room I roused my neighbor. He told me I was mad or drunk, but lit a lamp and returned with me, to find my horror only a heap of clothes thrown on the table in such a way that, as the moon's pale light shot it, it struck upon my black student's gown, with a white card lying on it, and produced the effect of a coffin and plate. The face was a crumpled handkerchief, and what seemed hair a brown muffler. As the moon sank, these outlines changed and, incredible as it may seem, grew like a face. My friend not having had the fright enjoyed the joke, and 'Coffins' was my sobriquet for a long while." ...|$|R
