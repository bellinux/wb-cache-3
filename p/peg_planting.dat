As basal medium in calli formation and plant regeneration the salts Murashige and Skoog were used (MS). In the first case, plant growth regulators as 2, 4 - Dichlorophenoxyacetic (2, 4 -D) and 6 - Bencilaminopurine (BAP) were added to culture mediun, meanwhile for the second, 6 - Bencilaminopurine and Kinetin (Kin). In both, different concentrations of stressing agent were used, (0, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 %), being determined their effect on osmotic potential, induction and growth of calli, as well as, plant regeneration. A differentiated behavior of varieties not only in calli formation and also in fresh and dry weight was evidenced in correspondance of its tolerance grade using 5 and 7. 5 % of PEG- 6 000.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to test germination and to determine morphological and physiological characteristics of Canavalia obtusifolia DC., Cratylia floribunda Benth. and Dioclea lasiophylla Mart., which allow them to cope with water stress. Germination studies were done using PEG, moist paper and three different soils, in a germinator. Establishment and early growth studies {{were conducted}} in a greenhouse, using two different soils. In PEG, maximum percentage germination were near 100 % for C. obtusifolia and D. lasiophylla and 75 % for C. floribunda. Respectively, the water potentials for maximum germination were from 0 to - 1 bar, from 0 to - 5 bars, and at - 5 bars. In moist paper, however, C. floribunda had near 100 % germination. In the three soils, the three species had near or equal to 100 % germination and their radicle grew more than in PEG. The rate of germination tended to be faster in soil than in PEG. However, it was affected by both soil and seed characteristics. So, germination was slower in Canelo, a pH 4, clay soil, {{as well as for}} the large-seeded C. obtusifolia, may be due to the reduction in the soil water conductivity at the seed-soil interface. It is suggested that leakage of solutes and spoilage of seeds as well as rapid water uptake at high water potentials, resulted in low germination of C. floribunda in <b>PEG.</b> <b>Plants</b> of C. floribunda and D. lasiophylla did not decrease their stomatal conductance or transpiration under high water stress, and their leaf water and osmotic potentials were sharply reduced. Plants of C. obtusifolia partially decreased their stomatal conductance and transpiration under stress. All three species were able to withstand elevated dehydration and to recover after being exposed to leaf water potentials lower than - 60 bars. C. obtusifolia maintained net CO₂ assimilation at a high dehydration level (- 46. 1 bars). After rewetting, this species rapidly recovered its leaf water potential and turgor; its photosynthetic capacity, however, was not totally recovered after being rewetted for six days...|$|R

40|$|High genetic {{variability}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{are important}} factors {{in the development of}} new crop varieties. In vitro techniques are applicable for development of crop variability that is not found in the gene pool. One of the in vitro techniques {{that can be used for}} this purpose is the somaclonal variation technique. Somaclonal variation may be derived from genetic variations in explants and genetic variations in tissue cultures. Variations in the explant may be obtained from cell mutations or polysomic mutations of a certain tissue. Genetic variations in tissue culture may be caused by ploidy of chromosomes (endomitosis fusion), changes of chromosom structures (crossings), as well as changes of genes and cytoplasms. Changes of genetic characters may be improved if anorganic compound was added into the medium. To improve the plant tolerances to biotic or abiotic factors, selection components may also be added to the medium. Research results showed that somaclonal variation in tissue culture can improve genetic variations in plants. The variation produced in tissue culture provide chances to develop new plant genotipes. Many selection components, such as Gamma-ray irradiation, Al contents and low pH, pure toxin or filtrate, polyethylene glycol (<b>PEG),</b> and <b>plant</b> growth regulators can be used to improve somaclonal variations in many plants to produce new genotipes...|$|R

This core collection was evaluated for 20 agronomic characteristics in the 2000 rainy season and for 21 characteristics in the 2000 / 2001 post-rainy season at two locations, Raichur and Kawadimatti, India, to estimate phenotypic diversity {{and determine the}} importance of different descriptor traits. All traits, except leaflet length and width, pod length and width, and seed length and width showed genotype × location interactions. All traits except leaflet width, number of primary branches, nodes on main stem, nodes on cotyledonary branches, total and mature pods, and length of primary and cotyledonary branches, pod length and width, and seed length and width showed genotype × season interaction. The fastigiata and hypogaea groups differed significantly for all traits except one trait each in the rainy season at Raichur and post-rainy season at Kawadimatti and five traits in the post-rainy season at Raichur. The hypogaea group took longer to flower, had more primary branches, longer primary and cotyledonary branches, more nodes on cotyledonary branches, more total pods, mature pods and <b>pegs</b> per <b>plant,</b> longer and wider pods and heavier seeds than the fastigiata group.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effects of seed priming with osmoticum Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 in improving tolerance of soybean to drought stress. Green house factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications was conducted. Treatments consisted of five levels of seed priming (dry seeds ??? untreated, PEG concentration: 0, 100, 200, 300 g L- 1 water, respectively) and three levels of drought stress treatments (100 % field capacity, 75 % field capacity and 50 % field capacity). Results showed that seedling growing from primed seeds differed significantly with respect to plant height increment, shoot/root ratio, chlorophyll content and protein content. However, seed priming with PEG {{had no effect on}} relative growth rate (RGR), number of stomata, 100 grains weight and grain yield. Among the various concentration of PEG used, priming with 300 g PEG L- 1 water significantly increased chlorophyll content and protein content. Drought stress treatment applied significantly affected plant height, shoot-root ratio, chlorophyll and protein content. Seed priming and drought stress treatments proved to be significant with respect to shoot-root ratio, 100 grains weight, protein and chlorophyll content. Seeds treated with 300 g PEG L- 1 water demonstrated to be superior to the non-primed and all other primed seeds when water stress increased (50 % field capacity).

Plants were also grown in soil and given different amounts of water which resulted in rates of decreasing leaf water potentials of - 0. 130 and - 0. 073 MPa day- 1. The rate of stress and the culture system influenced the accumulation of solutes in the cell, but not cell volume. A rapid stress (- 0. 123 and - 0. 130 MPa day- 1) to approximately - 1. 6 MPa leaf water potential resulted in 0. 75 and 0. 16 MPa of osmotic adjustment in the PEG and soil culture respectively.

40|$|Synthetic {{polymers}} such as water-soluble polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), water-insoluble {{polyvinyl polypyrrolidone}} (PVPP), and water-soluble polyethylene glycol (PEG) contain sufficient oxygen molecules {{in a chain}} to form strong hydrogen bonds with the phenolic and hydroxyl groups in tannins. This review deals with the practical uses of tannin-binding agents, particularly PEG, in tannins assays and for determining {{the negative effects of}} tannins on feed intake and digestion in ruminants. A gravimetric method to assay tannins by precipitation with PVPP is specific for tannins and does not require standards. The extractability of tannins from plant tissues can be reduced by drying samples at temperatures above 50 °C and is dependent on many other factors, such as content and types of plant proteins. Therefore, it is not feasible to recommend a single, optimal protocol for all plant samples. A method to assay tannins which is based on measuring the amount of binding of <b>PEG</b> to <b>plant</b> samples was shown to be simple and accurate. It can also overcome some of these extractability problems. The following biological effects of tannins were investigated in studies where tannin anti-nutritional effects were partially or completely neutralised by varying levels of PEG supplementation. (1) Effects on appetite: the negative effects of tannins on appetite can occur in the short-term (within 20 - 60 min) and the long-term (days and weeks), Astringency and adverse postingestive influences of tannins on the epithelium of the oral cavity and the foregut cause short-term effects on food intake. Long-term effects can be related to reduction in the concentration of ammonia and volatile fatty acids (VFA) in rumen fluids, which can in turn serve as metabolic cues for deficiency of nitrogen (ammonia), energy (VFA), or both. (2) Effects on digestion: increasing content of tannins in foliage can be associated with an increase in bound protein and with reduced degradation rate of the degradable matter in the rumen, but there is no corresponding increase of the non-degradable fraction. Consequently, organic matter, protein, and cell wall digestibility are inversely related to tannin concentrations. (3) Inducing digestive responses: if a significant amount of tannins reach the duodenum, they may markedly reduce the intestinal activity of pancreatic enzymes (trypsin and amylase) and amino acids absorption from the intestine. Condensed tannins can also reduce the content of fluid and particulate matter in the rumen, accelerate the passage of liquid from the abomasum, and delay the passage of digesta in the intestine. The overall effect is a delay in the passage of fluid and particulate matter throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract. It is hypothesised that these responses are largely the consequence of the interaction of tannins with digestive enzymes and the epithelium lining the digestive tract...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the role of {{salicylic}} acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) in osmotic stress tolerance of wheat seedlings. This was accomplished by determining the impact of the acids applied exogenously on seedlings grown under osmotic stress in hydroponics. The investigation was unique in its comprehensiveness, examining changes under osmotic stress and other conditions, and testing a number of parameters simultaneously. In both drought susceptible (SQ 1) and drought resistant (CS) wheat cultivars, significant physiological and biochemical changes were observed upon the addition of SA (0. 05 mM) or ABA (0. 1 μM) to solutions containing half-strength Hoagland medium and PEG 6000 (− 0. 75 MPa). The most noticeable result of supplementing SA or ABA to the medium (PEG + SA and PEG + ABA) was a decrease in the length of leaves and roots in both cultivars. While PEG treatment reduced gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll content in CS, and osmotic potential, and conversely, increased lipid peroxidation, soluble carbohydrates in SQ 1, proline content in both cultivars and total antioxidants activity in SQ 1, PEG + SA or PEG + ABA did not change the values of these parameters. Furthermore, PEG caused a two-fold increase of endogenous ABA content in SQ 1 and a four-fold increase in CS. PEG + ABA increased endogenous ABA only in SQ 1, whereas PEG + SA caused a greater increase of ABA content in both cultivars compared to <b>PEG.</b> In PEG-treated <b>plants</b> growing until the harvest, a greater decrease of yield components was observed in SQ 1 than in CS.
