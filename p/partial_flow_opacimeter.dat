40|$|The {{regulation}} of particle number {{has been introduced}} in the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle legislation, {{as a result of}} the light duty inter-laboratory exercise of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first from the full dilution tunnel and the second from the <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> system of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the full <b>flow</b> and the <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> system results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (full <b>flow,</b> <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from the full flow dilution tunnel. The results from two heavy duty diesel engines equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) show that full <b>flow</b> and <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> systems emissions have negligible differences (23 nm but depending on the engine, they are 70 - 500 % higher.

40|$|International audienceTraffic matrix {{estimation}} is well-studied, but {{in general}} has been treated simply as a statistical inference problem. In practice, however, network operators seeking traffic matrix information {{have a range of}} options available to them. Operators can measure traffic flows directly; they can perform <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> measurement, and infer missing data using models; or they can perform no flow measurement and infer traffic matrices directly from link counts. The advent of practical flow measurement makes the study of these tradeoffs more important. In particular, an important question is whether judicious modeling, combined with <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> measurement, can provide traffic matrix estimates that are signficantly better than previous methods at relatively low cost. In this paper we make a number of contributions toward answering this question. First, we provide a taxonomy of the kinds of models that may make use of <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> measurement, based {{on the nature of the}} measurements used and the spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal correlation exploited. We then evaluate estimation methods which use each kind of model. In the process we propose and evaluate new methods, and extensions to methods previously proposed. We show that, using such methods, small amounts of traffic flow measurements can have significant impacts on the accuracy of traffic matrix estimation, yielding results much better than previous approaches. We also show that different methods differ in their bias and variance properties, suggesting that different methods may be suited to different applications...|$|R

In the design procedure, parameters such as the angular velocity ratio and the repartition of the work performed by each rotors are to be chosen. In the present Article, three counter-rotating stages are {{designed to meet the}} same working point. These stages have different repartitions of load between the front and rear rotor, different angular velocity ratios or mean stagger angles of the blades of the front rotors. The stage global characteristics and the unsteady features of the flow between the counter-rotating rotors are measured and compared. The three systems all have satisfying overall performances at the design point. Strong differences are observed in the <b>flow</b> field at <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> rates, the rear rotor reducing the hub recirculation. The behaviour at <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> rates is thus triggered by the rear rotor characteristics.

40|$|Various {{cavitation}} instabilities such as rotating cavitation, cavitation surge and etc., {{have been}} serious problems in developing high-speed turbopump inducer. These instabilities {{should be avoided}} or settled for applying inducers widely in industrial fields. In the present study, the attempts to suppress the cavitation surge, which has been observed under <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> conditions in our helical inducers, are made by installing the obstacle plates just upstream of inducer. Two kinds of obstacle plates were used; One {{of which is a}} ring-shaped axi-symmetric plate with blockage of 39 % passage at the maximum near tip region to suppress the growth of inlet back <b>flow</b> under <b>partial</b> <b>flow</b> conditions.

Then, the onset regions of cavitation surge with/without the obstacle plates are presented with spectrum analyses of measured wall pressures upstream and downstream of the inducer. Finally, the suppression mechanisms of those plates are discussed utilizing the high-speed video observations as well as casing pressure measurements...|$|R
