40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of special additives such as chelators, zinc sulphate and cilicic acid on productivity parameters, carcass characteristics and meat quality of <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The test started with 40 days old fattening pigs (mongrel (mother) and Yorkshire (father)) and lasted up to 156 days of age. During the fattening period pigs were divided into 2 groups (control and experimental) after 4 replicates (total of 8 pens). Each group was followed by 16 fattening pigs. The pigs were fed for 16 weeks’ ad libitum with a standard wheat-barley-soybean meal compound (Control group) supplemented with chelators, zinc sulphate and silicic acid (dosage 2 kg/t of feed, Experimental group). Meat traits in live pigs were measured by ultrasonic equipment Piglog 105.

40|$|Selenium is a {{trace element}} that is {{essential}} for vertebrates and involved in series of vital metabolic functions. Considering {{the purity of the}} L-selenomethionine (L-SeMet) under application and the metabolic pathways of SeMet, the FEEDAP Panel considers the use of L-SeMet as safe for all animal species, provided that the maximum total selenium level authorised in feed is respected. The use of in animal nutrition is expected to result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from other sources of SeMet. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals fed L-SeMet, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that dietary selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. In the absence of specific data, the additive should be considered as an irritant to skin and eyes, as a skin sensitiser and as potentially harmful by inhalation. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use of L-SeMet in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared with other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded.

40|$|A {{total of}} 152 pig farms were {{randomly}} selected from the five provinces in South Korea. During the experiment, the average temperature and relative humidity was 24. 7 °C and 74 % in summer and 2. 4 °C and 53 % in winter, respectively. The correlation between floor space allowance (FSA) and productivity index was analyzed, including non-productive sow days (NPD), number of weaners (NOW), survival rate (SR), appearance rate of A-grade pork (ARA), and days at a slaughter weight of 110 kg (d-SW) at different growth stages. The objectives of the present study were i) to determine the effect of FSA on the pig productivity index and ii) to suggest the minimum FSA <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> based on scientific baseline data. For the pregnant sow, NPD could be decreased if pregnant sows were raised with a medium level (M) of FSA (3. 10 to 3. 67 m 2 /head) while also keeping the pig house clean which improves hygiene, and operating the ventilation system properly. For the farrowing sows, the NOW tended to decrease as the FSA increased. Similarly, a high level of FSA (H) is significantly negative with weaner SR of farrowing sows (p-value = 0. 017), indicating this FSA tends to depress SR. Therefore, a FSA of 2. 30 to 6. 40 m 2 /head (very low) could be appropriate for weaners because a limited space can provide a sense of security and protection from external interruptions. The opposite trend was observed that an increase in floor space (> 1. 12 m 2 /head) leads to increase the SR of growing <b>pigs.</b> <b>For</b> the <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs,</b> H level of FSA was negatively correlated with SR, but M level of FSA was positively correlated with SR, indicating that SR tended to increase with the FSA of 1. 10 to 1. 27 m 2 /head. In contrast, ARA of male fattening pigs showed opposite results. H level of FSA (1. 27 to 1. 47 m 2 /head) was suggested to increase productivity because ARA was most affected by H level of space allowance with positive correlation (R 2 = 0. 523).

It is presently authorised for use in diets for weaned piglets, minor weaned porcine species, chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and minor avian species <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The applicant is now seeking to reduce the minimum authorised dose from 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed to 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed when used with chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and all minor avian species (except laying birds) and to extend this authorisation to chickens reared for laying. The safety for the consumers, users of the product and the environment has been previously assessed by EFSA {{and found that it}} did not raise concerns. In a previous opinion the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is safe <b>for</b> chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> when used at the then recommended dose. The Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. This conclusion can be taken to apply to the revised dose for all of species under application. The data from three trials made with chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> confirmed the effectiveness of the additive when used at the currently authorised dose of 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed. Effects with the reduced dose of 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed were less clear and showed significantly positive results in only two of the five trials in which this dose was tested. However, a meta-analysis made by pooling results from the five trials showed significant gains in final body weight and improved feed conversion indicating that the additive had some potential to improve performance of chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at the lower dose. This conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying and extrapolated to minor avian species (other than those used for laying) ...|$|R

40|$|Probiotic LACTINA® is a feed {{additive}} consisting of six strains of lactic acid bacteria. In 2007 the European Food Safety Authority was requested {{to evaluate the}} safety and efficacy of the additive when used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: gut flora stabilisers) in diets for chickens for fattening, piglets and <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> At that time the FEEDAP Panel was able to conclude only on the safety for the environment. EFSA is now requested to assess the safety for the target animals and consumers, and {{the efficacy of the}} additive when added in diets for chickens for fattening at 5 x 108 - 9 x 109 CFU/kg feed and for piglets at 9 x 108 - 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The identity of the six strains was established. As no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected and as five of the strains qualify for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment, their use is presumed safe for target species and consumers. The Enterococcus faecium strain is not a recognised pathogen for animals and as the additive did not adversely affect growth of chickens or piglets, Probiotic LACTINA® is considered safe for the target species up to 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections. The metabolic pathways of E. faecium are well known. Since no other harmful metabolites are expected and the additive does not contain excipients of concern, it is considered safe for consumers. Probiotic LACTINA® showed a potential to increase the body weight of suckling piglets when used at approximately 5 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The Panel could not conclude on the efficacy of Probiotic LACTINA® when used in diets for chickens for fattening or weaned piglets...|$|E
40|$|Bonvital is a {{preparation}} of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium authorised for use in piglets and <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> in sows and in chickens for fattening. The applicant is seeking the further authorisation of Bonvital for use in {{chickens reared for laying}} and minor avian species. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. The safety of Bonvital in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens reared for laying, safety for this animal category can be presumed. As the same dose is proposed for minor avian species, this conclusion can be extrapolated to minor avian species to point of lay. The strain is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. Bonvital is not irritant to skin and eyes. In the absence of data, it should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of Bonvital under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. The efficacy in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens reared for laying, the conclusion on the major species can be extended to this category. As the same dose is proposed for minor avian species and as the mechanism of action of the additive can reasonably be assumed to be the same as in the major species, efficacy in minor avian species to point of lay can be presumed...|$|E
40|$|Cylactin® {{consists}} of dehydrated cells of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium. It is authorised for use in feeds for chickens, turkeys and <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and lambs for rearing and for fattening at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe for calves for fattening and for rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids for fattening and rearing. However, lambs for fattening are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves for fattening or rearing were considered. Use of the additive with calves for fattening significantly increased final body weight and/or daily gain in four of five trials when used at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/kg complete feed. An additional study with calves for rearing confirmed these results at the same dose. As the mechanism of action of the additive can be reasonably assumed to be same, the positive results seen in calves for fattening and rearing can be extrapolated to kids for rearing and fattening. Conclusions on {{the efficacy of the}} product for sheep would derive from results with lambs for fattening which were not made available...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{environmental}} impact of the straw-flow system <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> with the slatted-floor system by measuring pollutant gas emissions such as ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), manure nitrogen (N) content and emissions of water vapour (H 2 O). Three successive batches of 32 <b>pigs</b> were <b>fattened.</b> <b>For</b> each batch, <b>pigs</b> were allotted to two groups raised in separated rooms fitted either with a concrete totally slatted-floor system (0. 75 m(2) per pig) or with a straw-flow system (0. 79 m(2) per pig). With this last system, pigs were kept on a sloped floor, straw being provided daily at the top of the pen. Throughout the fattening period, about 34. 4 kg of straw were supplied per pig. The straw, mixed with dung, travelled down the slope by pig motion and went out of the pen to a scraped passage. The solid fraction was scraped every day, stored in a heap in the room and removed every month, 1 week before each period of gaseous emission measurement. The liquid fraction was automatically pumped from the scraped passage into a hermetic tank, which was emptied at the end of each fattening period. Rooms were ventilated mechanically in order to maintain a constant ambient temperature. Once a month, the emissions of NH 3, N 2 O, CH 4, CO 2 and H 2 O were measured hourly for 6 consecutive days via infrared photoacoustic detection. Mean daily emissions per pig fattened on the slatted floor or on the sloped floor were, respectively, 4. 98 and 13. 31 g NH 3, 0. 67 and 0. 68 g N 2 O, 15. 2 and 8. 88 g CH 4, 548 g and 406 g CO 2 equivalents, 1. 61 and 1. 77 kg CO 2 and 2. 33 and 2. 95 kg H 2 O. Except for N 2 O emissions, all the differences were statistically significant (P < 0. 001). From the slatted-floor system, the amount of slurry removed per fattening period was on average 256 kg per pig. From the straw-flow system, solid manure amounted on average to 209 kg per pig and liquid manure to 53 kg per pig. The total N-content of the manure was 2. 23 kg N per pig with the straw-flow system (solid and liquid manure) v. 3. 26 kg N per <b>pig</b> <b>for</b> slurry from the slatted-floor system. This reduction of 30 % observed with the sloped floor was mainly explained by the higher level of NH 3 -N emissions. Peer reviewe...|$|R
