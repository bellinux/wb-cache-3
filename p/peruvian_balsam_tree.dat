40|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate worsening of a cutaneous eruption following topical therapy from lack of response to the medication. A study to determine the origin of contact dermatitis secondary to topical therapy was conducted among 87 patients {{with this kind of}} contact dermatitis. Sixteen patch tests with chemical compounds known to be allergenic were done. The following eight chemical compounds were responsible for 86. 5 % of the positive reactions observed: neomycin, ethylenediamine, mercury, benzocaine, iodochlorhydroxyquin, <b>peruvian</b> <b>balsam,</b> nitrofurazone and cinchocaine. More than half of the reactions were to neomycin, ethylenediamine and mercury. It is easier to diagnose this condition if one knows the composition of the topical medications one prescribes and the allergenic potency of their ingredients...|$|R

50|$|Commiphora gileadensis, the Arabian <b>balsam</b> <b>tree</b> is a shrub {{species in}} the genus Commiphora growing in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, {{southern}} Oman, and in southeast Egypt where {{it may have been}} introduced. Other common names for the plant include balm of Gilead and Mecca myrrh, but this is due to historical confusion between several plants and the historically important expensive perfumes and drugs obtained from them. True balm of Gilead was very rare, and appears to have been produced from the unrelated tree Pistacia lentiscus.|$|R
50|$|Colophospermum mopane, {{commonly}} called mopane, mophane, mopani, <b>balsam</b> <b>tree,</b> butterfly tree, or turpentine tree, is {{a tree in}} the legume family (Fabaceae), that grows in hot, dry, low-lying areas, 200 to 1150 m in elevation, in the far northern parts of southern Africa. The tree only occurs in Africa {{and is the only}} species in genus Colophospermum. Its distinctive butterfly-shaped (bifoliate) leaf and thin seed pod make it easy to identify. In terms of human use it is, together with camel thorn and leadwood, one of the three regionally important firewood trees.|$|R

50|$|Many {{scholars}} cite Styrax officinalis as {{the biblical}} storax, however the yield of resin produced by S. officinalis, if any is produced at all, is extremely small. The {{large amounts of}} stacte needed for liturgical purposes, especially in the first temple period, {{would seem to have}} necessitated the import of a storax that could have met the demand. Styrax benzoin yields a much larger yield of resin and could fill this need quite adequately. As mentioned above, Styrax benzoin is a close relative of and of the same genus as Styrax officinalis.Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BC indicates that different kinds of storax were traded. Gamaliel said that stacte was nothing more than the sap that drips from the branches of the <b>balsam</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>Balsam</b> is a term that has been used for a variety of pleasantly scented vegetable gums that usually contain benzoic acid such as is contained in gum benzoin from the gum benzoin tree.|$|R
50|$|The <b>balsam</b> <b>tree</b> {{can become}} a highly {{invasive}} species when introduced into tropical countries where it is not native. In Sri Lanka, it has overgrown several hectares of the Udawatta Kele Sanctuary and is rapidly spreading there. In this Sri Lankan rain forest, Myroxylon seeds sprout in very high numbers due to tolerating more diverse light conditions than native species and due {{to the absence of}} natural enemies such as diseases and insects. This has given rise to dense stands of young trees where no other vegetation can grow, causing severe ecological disruption, i.e., the disappearance of local, native plant species and consequently of the animals and insects that feed on these.|$|R

5000|$|Opobalsamum (Commiphora opobalsamum L. Engl. Mecca myrrh) {{is a rare}} type of myrrh in {{the genus}} Commiphora. Some writers believe that stacte {{was derived from the}} <b>balsam</b> <b>tree,</b> Commiphora opobalsamum, known as kataf in the Talmud, which grows wild in Yemen and around Mecca. The Revised Standard Version places [...] "opobalsamum" [...] in the margin by Exodus 30:34. From the Commiphora genus, opobalsamum is a {{relative}} of the official myrrh known as Commiphora myrrha [...] and produces a myrrh resin known as Mecca myrrh. Irenaeus referred to “myrrh called opobalsumum.” The juice exudes spontaneously during the heat of summer, in resinous drops, but at other times the process is helped by making incisions in the bark. It historically has produced a very pleasant aromatic resin with many alleged medicinal properties. The resin has a strong fragrant smell, with something of the lemon or citron flavour, a scent of vanilla, and the bitter, astringent aroma of Commiphora myrrha.|$|R

40|$|Background. Application {{of various}} {{technological}} {{procedures for the}} manufacture of officinal preparation ointment against chilblains (Unguentum contra perniones) produce essential variations in the quality and stability of the final product. Changing the sequence of admixing active substances into the ointment base indicated the presence of incompatibility between the active substances, {{as well as between}} the active substances and the ointment base components. The aim was to examine the influence of various technological manufacturing procedures on quality and stability of the preparation. Methods. Changes in the samples of ointments and aqueous solutions of active substances were analyzed microscopically. Results. Microscopic analysis of hydrosoluble active substance solutions demonstrated destruction of ichthammol, induced by an acidic medium due to the dissolution of tannin and resorcinol, which is well known from the literature. It also demonstrated the destruction of tannin and resorcinol in aqueous solution, which had not been described in the literature. Application of the prescribed procedure for the manufacturing of ointment against chilblains, conceals the incompatibility reactions due to a slow dissolution of the tannin suspended in the officinal ointment base Unguentum cera lanae. Admixture of an ready-made aqueous solution of tannin caused an instant contact between ichthammol and the acidic medium, which caused the destruction or the complete absence of the formation of emulsion droplets. The problem of incompatibility reactions between lanolin alcohols in the ointment base and ichthammol and resorcinol, as well as the reaction between <b>Peruvian</b> <b>balsam</b> and sulfur from the ichthammol sulfate ion was observed. Numerous incompatibility reactions of ointment against chilblains, components indicated that it was necessary to introduce alterations in both the qualitative and quantitative composition of the preparation. Conclusion. Excipient preparation procedure, as well as the technological procedure for incorporation of active ingredients can cause the incompatibilities and therefore the formulation stability problems...|$|R

50|$|Three {{introduced}} species pose {{the biggest threat}} to the natural biodiversity of the Udawatta Kele forest: The highly invasive Peru <b>balsam</b> <b>tree</b> Myroxylon balsamum from South America is the first. Dense stands of thousands of young trees can be seen along the roads in the eastern and northern side of the forest. The pothos or devil's ivy, Epipremnum aureum, creeper from Solomon Islands is the second major threat. In the northwestern and western part of the reserve, around the royal pond and near the presidential palace and Temple of the Tooth, the creepers completely cover several hectares of the forest floor. They also climb high up tree trunks, with their large leaves blocking the light for other species underneath. The creepers are gradually spreading further to the east and south. Some years ago they were even planted on road banks elsewhere in the forest. Mahogany, Swietenia macrophylla, a timber tree from South America, is quite invasive and disrupts the forest's diverse ecology. Coffee shrubs (Coffea robusta or Coffea arabica) are invasive in parts of the forest, as they are in the nearby Gannoruwa Forest Reserve at Peradeniya. The glow vine, Saritaea magnifica, from Brazil is another invasive species, and covers several trees near the royal pond and near the Maitri cave. In some areas Aglaonema commutatum, Philippine evergreen, covers the forest floor and road banks.|$|R
