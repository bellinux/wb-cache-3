500|$|... "You do {{not need}} to ask {{permission}} from anyone to be a journalist," [...] explains the Periodical Publishers Association; [...] "however, it is sometimes useful to be able to identify yourself as a journalist when needed." [...] To this end, journalistic agencies issue <b>press</b> <b>cards</b> to their reporters, editorialists, writers, and photographers. [...] These do not have the legal merits of government-issued cards, and they will not replace event-specific passes; the card only serves as proof of its bearer's status as a legitimate newsperson according to the issuing organization. [...] As such, card-carriers may be better able to obtain interviews, acquire information from law-enforcement, or gain access to exclusive venues.|$|R
