5|$|From the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing {{processes in}} dynamic systems. From the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> chemistry, a spiral {{can be generated}} by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{branch of}} the central apparatus, from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> day-to-day operational diplomatic guidance, is the executive diplomatic division. The nature of activities engaged in by these divisions is determined by their territorial and functional characteristics.

5|$|From the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} {{is related to}} Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E

Additionally {{the domestic}} firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E

5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E
5|$|In that vein, {{infinite}} matrices {{can also}} be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence and continuity questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed. However, the explicit <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> matrices tends to obfuscate the matter, and the abstract and more powerful tools of functional analysis can be used instead.|$|E
