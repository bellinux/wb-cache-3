50|$|The grenade was a three-piece weapon, {{consisting}} of the plunger (or nostril), casing (body or orange shell, containing main charge), and tailpiece. The slightly convex metal plunger was removed to set the percussion cap on the nipple within the casing; the plunger was refitted through means of depressing by the striking of something hard and solid to drive it back. This proved to be difficult, especially in the fray of battle. The wood tailpiece was removed to place the powder charge inside the shell, and then set firmly back in to hold the powder within. Trajectory had to be an arc {{in order for the}} plunger to detonate the piece. A small <b>pressure</b> <b>spring</b> attached {{to the side of the}} plunger stem held the plunger in place during flight. The grenade was stabilized by four thin paper fins set into a wood tailpiece protruding from the rear of the projectile.|$|E

40|$|Star {{formation}} is usually accompanied by outflow phenomena. There is {{strong evidence that}} these outflows and jets are launched from the protostellar disk by magneto-rotational processes. Here, we report on our three dimensional, adaptive mesh, magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of collapsing, rotating, magnetized Bonnor-Ebert-Spheres whose properties are taken directly from observations. In contrast to the pure hydro case where no outflows are seen, our present simulations show an outflow from the protodisk surface at ~ 130 AU and a jet at ~ 0. 07 AU after a strong toroidal magnetic field build up. The large scale outflow, which extends up to ~ 600 AU {{at the end of}} our simulation, is driven by toroidal magnetic <b>pressure</b> (<b>spring),</b> whereas the jet is powered by magneto-centrifugal force (fling). At the final stage of our simulation these winds are still confined within two respective shock fronts. Furthermore, we find that the jet-wind and the disk-anchored magnetic field extracts a considerable amount of angular momentum from the protostellar disk. The initial spin of our cloud core was chosen high enough to produce a binary system. We indeed find a close binary system (separation ~ 3 solar radii) which results from the fragmentation of an earlier formed ring structure.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to optimize the performance of solenoid valve used in Variable Rate Application System (VRA) in term of time response. The overall time response is usually divided into four parts i. e., plunger opening time, pressure opening time, plunger closing time and pressure closing time. Approach: The performance and design of the a solenoid valve used in VRA was analyzed methematically and experimentally. Voltage, current, <b>pressure,</b> <b>spring</b> constant, flow rate and mass of the plunger were found to be the main parameters affecting the performance of solenoid valve. Based on the analyses, some modifications were introduced {{in the design of the}} solenoid valve to enhance its performance. The newly designed solenoid valve was tested by varying the main parameters and its performance was compared in terms of time response. Results: The time respnose of the modified valve showed improvement. The plunger closing time for the modified valve improved by 79 %. Depending on the types of nozzle, the pressure opening and closing time responses were reduced by 37 - 53 % and 55 - 73 % respectively. It was also observed time response was improved by 34 % when springs with lower spring constants are used. Conclusion: After thorough testing of both the original and proposed valves, it was observed that proposed valve average performance is faster than the original valve by 22 msec or 56 %. However, it was also found that it is mandatory to increase the operating voltage of propsed valve for the better performance...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. M. E. thesis. August 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 153 pages. The {{goal of this}} thesis {{is to develop a}} computationally inexpensive, accurate, and practical mathematical model of a hydraulic reed style check valve. While the modeling of disc style check valves is well represented in literature, reed valve modeling research has focused on applications in air compressors and internal combustion engines, where the working fluid has low density, viscosity, and bulk modulus. However, in a hydraulic system, the fluid – namely oil – is dense, viscous, and stiff, contributing additional physical effects that must be considered. Furthermore, the operating pressure in hydraulic systems is higher than in pneumatic systems, creating additional challenges from a structural perspective. In this thesis, a one degree of freedom hydraulic disc and reed style check valve model were developed using a hybrid analytical, computational, and experimental approach. The disc valve equation of motion was derived from Newton’s second law applied to the disc considering forces including <b>pressure,</b> <b>spring</b> reaction, and drag. Euler- Bernoulli beam theory was used to derive the reed valve equation of motion. In each case, the valve flow rate was modeled as quasi-steady orifice flow using an empirical discharge coefficient. A non-contact method of experimentally measuring check valve position during operation using a laser triangulation sensor (LTS) was developed. An acrylic viewing window was installed in the check valve manifold to allow optical access. To precisely measure position through air, acrylic, and oil, refraction of the laser light was accounted for using Snell’s law. Finally, the disc and reed valve models were validated {{in the context of a}} single cylinder hydraulic piston pump across a range of operating conditions. Pump delivery, which is a measure of volumetric efficiency, and check valve position were chosen as the validation metrics. Experimental results showed that both the disc and reed check valve model accurately predicted the timing of valve opening and closing. The disc valve model predicted pump delivery within 5 % of measured values for all cases while the reed valve model predicted pump delivery within 3 % of measured values for all cases...|$|E

40|$|Tactile {{perception}} {{is a remarkable}} ability that enables us to recognise objects and handle tools. Cortical processing during tactile and shape perception in humans is not fully understood. The perception of {{the shape of an}} object using touch can be divided into different submodalities such as the motion due to the indentation of the object-skin contact, the position of the exploring fingers, surface deviations and shape primitives (curvature and edges). Positron emission tomography (PET) was used in a series of experiments to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during discrimination of these different types of modalities. The experimental set-up included investigating neuronal populations engaged during discrimination of differences in brush stroke velocity (paper 1), sustained <b>pressure,</b> <b>spring</b> strengths during active compression, and the change in position of a limb (paper 11). Studies number III and IV were designed to investigate how the somatosensory cortex computes shape. Surface curvature changes are suggested to be a major determinant for the perception of shape, hence the objective of study 111 was to investigate whether objects differing only in the spectra of surface curvatures activated somatosensory areas differently. Study number IV was designed to investigate whether any cortical areas are specifically activated by discrimination of objects differing in shape as opposed to other mechanoreceptive stimuli. Finally, changes in rCBF in visual areas during discrimination of somatosensory stimuli were examined (paper V). Changes in rCBF were compared to post mortem brain representations of cytoarchitectonically defined areas in the postcentral gyrus (areas 3 a, 3 b, I and 2), the primary motor cortex, and the primary and secondary visual areas. The main findings of the experiments showed that cytoarchitecturally defined areas 3 b and I were activated by discrimination of all types of stimuli in all conditions tested, with no selectivity (paper I-IV). Area 3 a was only active in the conditions in which motor activity occurred (paper 11 and IV). Area 2 was activated by all mechanical stimuli tested, but showed statistical preference for surface curvature changes (study 111) and shape stimuli (study IV). Two regions were identified that responded specifically when discriminating object stimuli as opposed to brush velocity (study IV). One was located to the anterior part of the supramarginal gyrus (ASM) and the other was located to the cortex lining the intraparietal sulcus (IPA). These regions were only activated during discrimination of the shapes of objects and not when other mechanical stimuli were discriminated This could, in the context of shape processing, be in accordance with a hierarchical organisation. Areas 3 b and I activated by all types of stimuli at the first level, area 2 at a second level specifically activated by curvature changes and shape stimuli and IPA and ASM at yet a higher level, activated by shape discrimination only. A number of cortical motor areas were found activated in the absence of motor activity during somatosensory stimulation (paper 1, 11 and IV). This is in accordance with electrophysiological data showing activation in motor areas during processing of somatosensory stimuli. The anterior cerebellum was the only region found to distinguish active from passive touch (paper IV), Discriminations of somatosensory stimuli were accompanied by a general decrease in blood flow in primary and secondary visual cortices (paper V) ...|$|E
