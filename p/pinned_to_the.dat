5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or {{knots of}} colored ribbons <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hat, to denote the {{nationality}} of their military. In Poland, until 1831, {{there was no}} consensus {{as to what the}} colors of the national cockade should be. Polish soldiers wore white, white-and-red, blue-and-red or blue-white-red cockades.|$|E
5|$|The badge was <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> riband at {{the left}} hip. Made of gold, it {{depicted}} a shamrock bearing three crowns, {{on top of a}} cross of St Patrick and surrounded by a blue circle bearing the motto in majuscules, as well as the date of the Order's foundation in Roman numerals ("MDCCLXXXIII").|$|E
5|$|The {{star of the}} Order was an eight-pointed figure, {{with the}} four {{cardinal}} points longer than the intermediate points. Each point was shown as a cluster of rays. In the centre was the same motto, year and design that appeared on the badge. The star was worn <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left breast.|$|E

40|$|The neutron {{vortices}} thought <b>to</b> {{exist in}} <b>the</b> inner crust of {{a neutron star}} interact with nuclei and are expected <b>to</b> <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear lattice. Evidence for long-period precession in pulsars, however, requires that pinning be negligible. We estimate the strength of vortex pinning and show that hydrodynamic forces present in a precessing star are likely sufficient to unpin all of the vortices of the inner crust. In the absence of precession, however, vortices could <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lattice with sufficient strength <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> giant glitches observed in many radio pulsar...|$|R
30|$|The {{evaluation}} of a construction that allows the exchange of circular and unilateral external fixators on <b>the</b> same fixation <b>pins</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bone in outpatient circumstances during bone lengthening and alignment procedures.|$|R
5|$|Dean deduces John's {{message was}} {{coordinates}} {{to where he}} has headed. Sam still {{does not want to}} join the search, so Dean drops him off at his apartment. Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt to put out the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica.|$|E
5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act {{was seen as a}} way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earth to prevent rising.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 in Lawrence, Kansas, Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) investigates a sound {{coming from}} her infant son Sam's nursery. She sees a figure {{standing}} over his crib, and confronts him. Her husband, John (Morgan), is awoken by her screams and finds her <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She bursts into flames, and John is forced to evacuate the house with Sam and his older son, Dean, while the house erupts into flames.|$|E

50|$|A {{difference}} between the early S & W Army No 2 Model, serial range 1 to about 3000 and later revolvers, is the addition of third <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top strap <b>to</b> limit <b>the</b> travel upwards of the cylinder stop.|$|R
50|$|A livery badge for <b>pinning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest or a hat, in gilded copper high relief, with Richard III's {{emblem of}} a white boar, is very {{likely to have been}} worn by one of his household, when he was Duke of Gloucester.|$|R
5|$|Just {{before dawn}} on December 14, {{ammunition}} was issued and the 22nd moved forward slightly, {{to about the}} position on the open slope that they had occupied the day before. Here they spent another day <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, unable to advance or retire due to the constant fire of Confederate riflemen. Nightfall finally brought relief as another unit took their place {{on the field and}} the 22nd retired to the city of Fredericksburg.|$|E
5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E
5|$|Then a rule {{change is}} announced, {{allowing}} the tributes {{from the same}} district to win as a couple. Katniss finds and nurses a seriously wounded Peeta, while continuing to act {{the part of a}} girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers announce that what each contestant needs most will be provided at a feast, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground by Clove, who gloats about Rue while toying with the helpless Katniss. That talk costs Clove her life, however; Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, kills her, but spares Katniss - once - for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life.|$|E

40|$|Melt-out {{method of}} {{constructing}} strong, pressure-tight fluid coolant channels for chambers {{is accomplished by}} cementing <b>pins</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface and by depositing a melt-out material on the surface followed by two layers of epoxy-resin impregnated glass fibers. The structure is heated <b>to</b> melt out <b>the</b> low-melting alloy...|$|R
50|$|Creating a {{bump key}} does require the key being able <b>to</b> set <b>pins</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proper rotation, so one bump key could {{not work for}} all locks. The Security.org team has shown that a {{relatively}} small number of keys (see above) could be used to do this.|$|R
25|$|Windows RT 8.1 update KB3033055 adds {{a variant}} of the Windows 10 Start menu that is {{visually}} closer to the design used in early beta builds of Windows 10. It allows applications to be <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the left column, with recently used apps listed below (much like 7), and as with 10, allows tiles to be <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right column.|$|E

25|$|Kodagu style – this drape is {{confined}} to ladies hailing from the Kodagu district of Karnataka. In this style, the pleats are created in the rear, instead of the front. The loose end of the sari is draped back-to-front over the right shoulder, and is <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the sari.|$|E
40|$|Thermally {{insulated}} glove contains short, closely-spaced elastomeric pins that insulate without impairing flexibility. By confining <b>pins</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inter-joint {{areas of}} palm, fingers {{and back of}} the hand, joint mobility is retained. Glove thermal-insulation requirements dictate the relationships among pin length, pin diameter, and number of pins per unit surface length...|$|R
30|$|Sequential dissections of the cadaveric {{specimens}} {{were then}} performed and measurements made from each <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> important neurovascular structures utilising a digital Vernier calliper. All measurements were {{expressed as a}} mean distance from <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> object of interest at its closest point {{and the range of}} variation recorded. <b>The</b> relationship <b>to</b> <b>pin</b> penetration on <b>the</b> inner aspect of the pelvis and the intrapelvic structures was recorded. The pelvic specimens were then stripped of all soft tissue attachments, except for the hip joint capsule, and the positions of the pins recorded with reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acetabular margin and greater sciatic notch. The orientation between the pins was measured with a goniometer prior to transverse sectioning of the bony pelvis at each pin level. The tract of the pin was then photographed and measured <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> degree of pin purchase in bone.|$|R
50|$|Data Bus Inversion adds an {{additional}} active-low DBI# <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> address/command bus and each byte of data. If {{there are at}} least four 0 bits in the data byte, the byte is inverted and the DBI# signal transmitted low. In this way, the number of 0 bits across all 9 <b>pins</b> is limited <b>to</b> 4. This reduces power consumption and ground bounce.|$|R
25|$|On the December 6 {{episode of}} Raw, the World Heavyweight Championship was vacated when a triple threat match with Triple H, Edge, and Benoit {{ended in a}} double pin (Edge tapped out to Benoit's Crippler Crossface while he had Benoit <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground), and the title was to be decided in an Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution in early 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (also called Iron Cross with Golden Rays) {{was meant}} to be worn like the Iron Cross 1st Class (<b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> breast). Like the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross, this award was not {{intended}} to be bestowed for bravery. Rather, it was bestowed upon the most successful General officer at the conclusion of a war.|$|E
25|$|The last regular occupants, Tom Bell and {{his wife}} Frederica, spent thirty-six years on the island before the New Zealand {{government}} evacuated them in 1914. A landing party sent to investigate the island found out how hasty the evacuation of the Bells was – a 1914 calendar was still <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kitchen wall and the family's furniture, cutlery, and child's toys had remained in place.|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} {{dependence of}} Curie temperature, spin reorientation temperature and magnetic anisotropy field are investigated for Nd 2 (Fe 1 -xTx) 14 B (T = Nb, Mo and Ga) alloys. <b>The</b> contribution of <b>pinning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> magnetic hardening for NdFeNbB sintered magnets increases with the Nb addition.

40|$|A beam {{steering}} compact patch antenna with high gain application is invented. The proposed antenna is capable <b>to</b> steer <b>the</b> beam radiation <b>to</b> 45 °, 135 °, 225 ° and 315 °. This is {{realized in the}} unique form of single main radiator and four parasitic elements. The activation of the parasitic required a shorting <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground that indicates ON state condition and the deactivation of the parasitic means no shorting <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground that lead to OFF state configuration. Each of the shorting pins can be linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> RF <b>PIN</b> diode switch. It is discovered in CST simulation software, the specified location of the pins is really significant <b>to</b> ensure <b>the</b> parasitic perform either as a reflector or director. Moreover, the proposed antenna has small physical dimension of 130 mm square. The simulation and measurement results have successfully exhibited {{the idea of the}} proposed antenna for smart antenna and WiMAX application...|$|R
25|$|Notes, another {{transfer}} from iOS, is added. It is separate from Mail {{in its own}} application, with support for desktop notes added (syncs along with its iOS counterpart). Created notes are synced through all the user's Apple devices through the iCloud service. Notes can be arranged in folders, and <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> user's desktop. When the application is closed, the pinned note still remains.|$|E
25|$|Other {{minority}} practices include paper preparations, {{where the}} substance and dilution are written on {{pieces of paper}} and either <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patients' clothing, put in their pockets, or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients, {{and the use of}} radionics to manufacture preparations. Such practices have been strongly criticized by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.|$|E
25|$|The mourners {{traditionally}} make a tear (keriah קריעה) in {{an outer}} garment before {{or at the}} funeral. The tear {{should be on the}} left side (over the heart and clearly visible) for a parent, including foster parents, and on the right side for siblings (including half-brothers and half-sisters), children, and spouses (and {{does not need to be}} visible). Non-Orthodox Jews will often make the keriah in a small black ribbon that is <b>pinned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lapel rather than in the lapel per se.|$|E
50|$|Being {{exhausted}} with nervous prostration and {{in desperate}} need of total rest, Lundberg entrusted the task of revealing <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public <b>to</b> his brothers Carl and Mauritz.
