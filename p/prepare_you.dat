500|$|According to Paul Neurath, Ultima Underworld II and its {{predecessor}} together sold {{half a million}} units. Paul Presley of PC Review called the game [...] "huge" [...] and praised its atmosphere, increased variety and higher graphical detail. However, {{he found that the}} game, unlike {{its predecessor}}, does not feature [...] "anything that takes it to a higher plateau to wait for the others to catch up". He summarized Ultima Underworld II as [...] "magnificent", and he wrote, [...] "If someone were to hand me £40 and say buy either Underworld I or II, I'd take the sequel any time." [...] PC Zones David McCandless wrote, [...] "Nothing can completely <b>prepare</b> <b>you</b> for the freedom the game gives you ... It's about as close to Virtual Reality as you are ever likely to get from your mouse driver." [...] He praised the game's atmospheric sound and called its graphics [...] "stunning": on a high-end computer, he found that [...] "dungeons can move like a film". Partly because of the game's large size, he felt that Ultima Underworld II was looser and less involving than its predecessor, but he concluded that players would still [...] "sit there, dribble slightly, and say 'blimey' every eight to ten minutes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Interviewed by Tom Brokaw for {{his book}} The Greatest Generation, Howard {{professor}} Dr. Clifford Muse, Jr., described Dr. Putney's approach to teaching: [...] "She worked me to death.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Chad's introduction would cause {{trouble for the}} romantic pairing of Will Horton (Dylan Patton) and Mia McCormick (Taylor Spreitler). According to the actor, Chad is extremely sincere about getting custody of the baby from Nicole {{which is why he}} turns down her sexual advances. He refuses to let Mia [...] "whose been lying to him this whole time get in his way." [...] However, Deidrick commented that when Chad turns down Nicole, he is not [...] "acting [...] age." [...] Though he suspects Mia and Nicole are hiding something, Deidrick explained that Chad is completely blindsided when he finds the specifics. Of Chad's reaction to the baby reveal Deidrick said, [...] "There's nothing that can really <b>prepare</b> <b>you</b> for something like that." [...] However, what hurts the most is that Chad has spent so much time trying to win Mia back, and his love for her is actually [...] "sincere." [...] According to Deidrick, it is a [...] "slap in the face," [...] to learn that Mia has been lying about such a huge part of their lives. For Chad, the revelation allows him to see Mia's true colors. Deidrick stated that [...] "here's always going to be tension" [...] between Chad and Mia but Deidrick maintained that despite her lies, Chad feels sorry what Mia has gone through and tries to stay by her side. [...] "It's a very hard situation." [...] Of his character during the storyline, Deidrick described Chad as a [...] "kid who doesn't know what to do and he's a fighting all these feelings." [...] Deidrick previewed that the reveal about the baby switch would put everything [...] "into place." [...] The actor admitted that the baby storyline kept him very isolated due to the significant age differences between himself {{and the rest of his}} teenage costars. When asked about a future love interest, Deidrick mentioned Gabriela Rodriguez who had recently been introduced to the canvas as Gabi Hernandez (Gabriela Rodriguez) but didn't believe a romantic pairing would work due to the age difference.|$|E
