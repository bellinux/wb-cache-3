5|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system {{are represented by}} unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex <b>projective</b> <b>space.</b> The exact nature of this Hilbert space {{is dependent on the}} system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate.|$|E

25|$|It {{took the}} {{simultaneous}} 19th century developments of non-Euclidean geometry and Abelian integrals {{in order to}} bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical fold. The first of these new developments was seized up by Edmond Laguerre and Arthur Cayley, who attempted to ascertain the generalized metric properties of <b>projective</b> <b>space.</b> Cayley introduced the idea of homogeneous polynomial forms, and more specifically quadratic forms, on <b>projective</b> <b>space.</b> Subsequently, Felix Klein studied projective geometry (along with other types of geometry) from the viewpoint that the geometry on a space is encoded in a certain class of transformations on the space. By the end of the 19th century, projective geometers were studying more general kinds of transformations on figures in <b>projective</b> <b>space.</b> Rather than the projective linear transformations which were normally regarded as giving the fundamental Kleinian geometry on <b>projective</b> <b>space,</b> they concerned themselves also with the higher degree birational transformations. This weaker notion of congruence would later lead members of the 20th century Italian school of algebraic geometry to classify algebraic surfaces up to birational isomorphism.|$|E

50|$|In {{projective}} geometry, a homography is an isomorphism of <b>projective</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{induced by}} an isomorphism of the vector spaces {{from which the}} <b>projective</b> <b>spaces</b> derive. It is a bijection that maps lines to lines, and thus a collineation. In general, some collineations are not homographies, but the fundamental theorem of projective geometry asserts that is not so {{in the case of}} real <b>projective</b> <b>spaces</b> of dimension at least two. Synonyms include projectivity, projective transformation, and projective collineation.|$|R
50|$|If <b>projective</b> <b>spaces</b> {{are defined}} by means of axioms (synthetic geometry), the third part is simply a definition.

40|$|Kitchloo and Wilson {{have used}} the {{homotopy}} fixed points spectrum ER(2) of the classical complex-oriented Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(2) to deduce certain non-immmersion results for real <b>projective</b> <b>spaces.</b> ER(n) is a 2 ^n+ 2 (2 ^n- 1) -periodic spectrum.
