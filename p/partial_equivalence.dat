We give two substantial classes of language for which partial traces are adequate.

40|$|International audienceFull-spectrum {{dependent}} types {{promise to}} enable the development of correct-by-construction software. However, even certified software needs to interact with simply-typed or untyped programs, be it to perform system calls, or to use legacy libraries. Trading static guarantees for runtime checks, the dependent interoperability framework provides a mechanism by which simply-typed values can safely be coerced to dependent types and, conversely, dependently-typed programs can defensively be exported to a simply-typed application. In this paper, we give a semantic account of dependent interoperability. Our presentation relies on and is guided by a pervading notion of type equivalence, whose importance has been emphasized in recent work on homotopy type theory. Specifically, we develop the notion of <b>partial</b> type <b>equivalences</b> as a key foundation for dependent interoperability. Our framework is developed in Coq; it is thus constructive and verified in the strictest sense of the terms. Using our library, users can specify domain-specific <b>partial</b> <b>equivalences</b> between data structures. Our library then {{takes care of the}} (sometimes, heavy) lifting that leads to interoperable programs. It thus becomes possible, as we shall illustrate, to internalize and hand-tune the extraction of dependently-typed programs to interoperable OCaml programs within Coq itself...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel mathematical, {{physical}} and logical framework for describing an input {{image of the}} dynamics of physical fields, in particular the optic field dynamics. Our framework is required to be invariant under a particular gauge group, i. e., a group or set of transformations consistent with the symmetries of that physical field dynamics enveloping renormalisation groups. It has to yield a most concise field description in terms of a complete and irreducible set of equivalences or invariants. Furthermore, it should be robust to noise, i. e.,unresolvable perturbations (morphisms) of the physical field dynamics present below a specific dynamic scale,possibly not covered by the gauge group, do not affect Lyapunov or structural stability measures expressed inequivalences above that dynamic scale. The related dynamic scale symmetry encompasses then a gauge invariant similarity operator with which similarly prepared ensembles of physical field dynamics are probed and searched for <b>partial</b> <b>equivalences</b> coming about at higher scales...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{studies in}} some detail the recently developed concept of aspect at the architecture level. This concept introduces a novel kind of modularization and composition in software, and therefore it defines new structures which must be studied by Software Architecture, determining the architectural features of aspects. However the opposite strategy can also be considered; namely, a new conceptual model can be defined, including an architecture-level notion of aspect. This would provide a new abstraction to describe software structures, thus effectively providing an additional dimension in architecture description, and would enable {{the study of the}} specific compositional problems in this dimension. The document starts by addressing the relevance of this kind of study, and continues by discussing why the new notions are necessary. Then it continues by including a brief enumeration of the more relevant notions derived from this aspectual framework, with particular emphasis on their relationship with software components. Next the document explores the different forms in which these notions could be incorporated into the context of Software Architecture, revealing a rather extensive variety of approaches, and also the relationships and <b>partial</b> <b>equivalences</b> between them. The paper concludes by noting a number or open questions and futures areas of research within this context.

40|$|The {{first steps}} towards linearisation of <b>partial</b> orders and <b>equivalence</b> {{relations}} are described. The definitions of <b>partial</b> orders and <b>equivalence</b> relations (on sets) are formulated {{in a way}} that is standard in category theory and that makes the linearisation (almost) automatic. The linearisation is then achieved by replacing sets by coalgebras and the Cartesian product by the tensor product of vector spaces. As a result, definitions of orders and equivalence relations on coalgebras are proposed. These are illustrated by explicit examples that include relations on colagebras spanned by grouplike elements (or linearised sets), the diagonal relation, and an order on a three-dimensional non-cocommutative coalgebra. Although relations on coalgebras are defined for vector spaces, all the definitions are formulated {{in a way that}} is immediately applicable to other braided monoidal categories.
