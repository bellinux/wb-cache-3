In traditional Kenyah society the community was integrated within a self-subsistent economy. The longhouse was the hub of Kenyah socio-cultural life. The social organization in the longhouse expressed community relations as well as intra-familial relations within a room in the longhouse. All social rights and obligations were reinforced by Kenyah adet, a worldview encompassing the secular as well as the supernatural realm. The traditional socio-cultural system gradually disintegrated as the previously self-subsistent economy came under the impact of an individualized market system. This process was further aggravated with the conversion of the Kenyah to Christianity, which eroded the ideological basis of adet. The introduction of formal schooling and the opportunities for employment in the modern market economy further alienated the younger generation from the economic and cultural life of the traditional society.

Most of literatures on kinship and political economy in African societies have insisted on the transformation of a society from a lineage-based kinship and inheritance system into a new order based on filiation and elementary family due to modernization and <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> economy. However, practices of cocoa-farmers of land tenure and inheritance in Southern Ghana show unique variations and sophistication of indigenous kinship and inheritance systems. For example, among patrilineal societies, migrant farmers from Abiriw of the Akuapim ridge prefer the basic patrilineal inheritance system, which contributes to strengthen social network between distant kin people. While Krobo farmers who are migrants from the Eastern Region prefer fair division of land between male legitimate children of a deceased. Among matrilineal societies of migrant farmers from Akropong of the Akuapim ridge, both negotiation and tension exist between matrilineal and patrifiliational inheritance rule. While matrilineal Akyem farmers, who are natives and dominant landowners in Akyem Abuakwa, have strong preference of matrilineal inheritance system. Why are there such variations? They cannot be explained in terms of a unilineal development from a traditional to a modern form of kinship and inheritance. In this article, I analyze inheritance systems of patrilineal and matrilineal societies in order to clarify characteristic and logic of each system. Then I examine various inheritance rules practiced by farmers who belong to different societies, focusing on division of land, power relation between lineage members, and political and historical background in this area...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} a unique mode of slash-and-burn {{cultivation}} utilizing artifi cial forest of black wattle (Acacia mearnsii), which is formed on grass-covered hills in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Black wattle was introduced into this area from Australia {{for the purpose of}} tannin extraction in the mid- 20 th century. This fast-growing tree came to be grown by the native Bena people as fuel wood or as a marker plant of private land. With the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> economy since the 1980 s, the Bena have invented an agroforestry system, with forestry technologies integrated into their indigenous slash-and-burn cultivation system, in order to benefi t from the increasing economic value of black wattle. The new system enables sustainable use of the black wattle forest. Forest regeneration begins just after clearing and burning, as the fi re accelerates black wattle germination. Skillful forest management allows the intercropping of fi nger millet or maize between well-ordered trees for three years. Also, fuel wood and charcoal can be acquired once every ten years when the forest is cleared. Charcoal and local beer brewed from fi nger millet provides the Bena with cash income. The enormous biomass produced by black wattle, which fi xes nitrogen, enriches the soil fertility without the use of expensive chemical fertilizers. This innovation by the Bena was created through various attempts based on their experience and knowledge accumulated in the process of coping with the socioeconomic changes brought by globalization.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, medical {{malpractice}} has been framed {{as one of}} the most critical issues for healthcare providers and health policy, holding a central role on both the policy agenda and public debate. The Law and Economics literature has devoted much attention to medical malpractice and to the investigation of the impact of malpractice reforms. Nonetheless, some reforms have been much less empirically studied as in the case of schedules, and their effects remain highly debated. The present work seeks to contribute to the study of medical malpractice and of schedules of noneconomic damages in a civil law country with a public national health system, using Italy as case study. Besides considering schedules and exploiting a quasi-experimental setting, the novelty of our contribution consists in the inclusion of the performance of the judiciary (measured as courts’ civil backlog) in the empirical analysis. The empirical analysis is twofold. First, it investigates how limiting compensations for pain and suffering through schedules impacts on the malpractice insurance market in terms of presence of private insurers and of premiums applied. Second, it examines whether, and to what extent, healthcare providers react to the implementation of this policy in terms of both levels and composition of the medical treatments offered. Our findings show that the introduction of schedules increases the presence of insurers only in inefficient courts, while it does not produce significant effects on paid premiums. Judicial inefficiency is attractive to insurers for average values of schedules <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> with an increasing positive impact of inefficiency as the territorial coverage of schedules increases.

As a result, the robotic community tries to overcome limitations of robot’s accuracy by compensating path deflections during {{the execution of}} processes such as drilling or deburring. The use of additional sensor systems and the measuring of the pose offer one possibility to control the exact positioning. Conventional sensor systems in robotics hardly achieve a <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> because of missing number of measured degree of freedom, lacking accuracy or limited possibilities for integration in robot cells. The conveived measuring principle of this dissertation applies the projection of a material measure in the workspace of the robot as a contact-free reference for a designed sensor system. The main contribution {{of the work is}} the development of a formalism and an algorithm that interpret the measurements of the projected reference structure and compute the pose based on image processing operations. Furthermore, the work deals with the simulation of the sensor system and evaluation of influencing variables. Afterwards a real test bed is presented and the experimental validation of the sensor system based on movements along lines or circles in a cuboid are outlined. One essential result is the achieved accuracy of the developed sensor system compared to a monocular approach which is presented as reference measurement. In case of a 6 D pose determination, the sensor systems achieves an improvement about 83, 2 %. In fact, when evaluating parallel test paths the translational accuracy is 0, 087 mm with an uncertainity 0, 048 mm of a defined assessment criteria.

40|$|A {{spectrum}} of phenomena {{related to the}} reliability of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are investigated in this thesis using numerical simulations. The focus is on trap related phenomena that lead to decrease in the power output and failure of devices, i. e. the current collapse and the device degradation. The current collapse phenomenon has been largely suppressed using SiN passivation, but there are gaps {{in the understanding of}} the process leading to this effect. Device degradation, on the other side, is a pending problem of current devices and an obstacle to wide <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Calibration of I-V measurements of two devices is performed with high accuracy to provide a trustworthy starting point for modelling the phenomena of interest. Traditionally, in simulations of nitride based HEMTs, only direct piezoelectric effect is taken into account and the resulting interface charge is thence independent of the electric field. In this work, the impact of the electric field via the converse piezoelectric effect is taken into account {{and its impact on the}} bound charge and the drain current is studied, as a refinement of the simulation methodology. It is widely believed that the current collapse is caused by a virtual gate, i. e. electrons leaked to the surface of the device. We have found a charge distribution that reproduced the I-V measurement that shows current collapse, hence validating the concept of the virtual gate. While it was previously shown that the virtual gate has a similar impact on the I-V curve as is observed during the current collapse, we believe that this is for the first time that a wide range of gate and drain voltages was calibrated. High gate/drain voltage leading to permanent degradation was also investigated. The hypothesis that stress induced defects and dislocations might be responsible for the degradation was tested but not fully confirmed. Finally, the leakage of electrons thought to be responsible for formation of the virtual gate and the current collapse due to the Poole-Frenkel emission, is simulated in order to explain the surface charge distribution responsible for the current collapse and deduced in Chapter 5.

In addition, the study empirically examines the reasons for the emergence of petty business entrepreneurs in rural Bangladesh through an analysis {{of the relationship between the}} people involved in business and their economic necessities. The study ties in with social anthropology and sociology. Its nature is inductive with the life and work of petty business entrepreneurs and connects the experiences of the entrepreneurs with theory of inequality and entrepreneurship. The study primarily draws on detailed ethnographic evidence, from key informants´ interviews, group discussions and observations, which are supplemented by quantitative analyses of household surveys conducted in a village situated in northern Bangladesh. In rural Bangladesh the presence of business activities is not a new phenomenon. Nevertheless, in the past the necessity of business involvement was impractical to villagers because everybody could survive with what their land produced. Unfortunately, nowadays traditional livelihoods in rural Bangladesh have come under severe pressure and become more and more incapable of providing subsistence to inhabitants. In this situation, livelihoods through petty business entrepreneurship have taken an unprecedented turn. Businesses have been able to lift many households from the study village out of relative poverty, allowing many socially and economically disadvantaged households to gain economic success from working in petty business entrepreneurship. Involvement in business activities provides many households with the ability to survive adequately under prevailing conditions, where gaining a marginal level of livelihood was difficult for a large number of villagers. The impact of diversification into petty businesses has been analysed on an individual, household and societal level. The increase in business activities has several substantial implications, such as indicating growing <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and cash economy. The trend towards business also creates openness within cross-class relations, clearly changing gender identities and also affecting gains in social capital. Personal relations are important for the survival of petty business entrepreneurs. In fact, personal relations were found to be essential for business start-ups and strengthening business operations. Moreover, households were crucial for mobilising labour and other resources. The petty business entrepreneurs in this study did not have the opportunity to earn a living vertically within society.

Its application is expected to improve the exchange of information, to support the cooperation between the actors, to deepen the integration of transport chains and to avoid the high proportion of dead freight. The case of Electronic Trading Networks (ETN), which is analyzed in this study, reveals - despite these advantages - restrained acceptance and a low <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> The real development of diffusion {{does not meet the}} high expectations of the use of telecommunications. For this reason, we try to answer the key question: What are the critical factors, influencing the application, the adoption and the diffusion of value added services in the transportation sector? The analysis shows that ETN merely supports a part of the market process. Only under particular conditions, it will lead to falling costs and higher market transparency. Therefore, the effects on increasing productivity within the enterprises are reduced. The realization of rationalization potentials by value added services is confronted with problems concerning the user acceptance, the distribution of profits and the lacking familiarity with information and communication technologies. Further critical factors are the undesirable effects of increasing market transparence, the surplus of transport capacities, the anonymity of ETN and the decreasing demand of standardized transportation services. The current development within the transportation sector leads to a fundamental structural change, which will improve the market chances of ETN for certain forms of usage. The hypothesis that strategies of improving the efficiency within enterprises do not necessarily result in an increasing rationality of the transport sector and to the avoidance of traffic, has been confirmed. The 'problem solving character' of telecommunications is widely overestimated. The use of telecommunications can only be successful, if the prevailing conditions and the change of the organizational surroundings will prepare and support such effects.

And the other objective is increasing the convenience and diversity of commercial websites, through advantages which include: few limitations in the setting up of the web, the immediate response to users' demands, and the simple interface of product management. 台灣擁有一個網際網路發展完善的環境，每天有數以萬計的網頁伺服器為網路使用者提供服務，這些性能強大的伺服器日以繼夜不斷地耗費大量能源，只為了要穩定地滿足使用者的網路需求。而另一項普及率更高的可上網裝置：行動電話，普及率更是遠遠超過伺服器的數量。隨著行動電話功能以及性能的日益壯大，加上使用者需求的不斷增長，使行動電話上的應用層面越加廣泛。『智慧型手機』便是為了滿足使用者的需求，而開發出來的行動商務解決方案之一。隨著科技的粹煉，現今智慧型手機的無線網路除GSM語音通話外，已可存取GPRS、WCDMA、HSDPA甚至WiFi，在未來第四代行動電話的頻寬以及效能也將大幅提昇。雖然目前的智慧型手機與一般商業用伺服器相比，性能著實有很大的差距，但在綠能減碳議題逐漸發燒的今日，智慧型手機是否能夠利用本身可攜性，低成本以及低電耗的優勢之下，擔任伺服器的角色，即是本研究欲探討的主要目的。 本研究以 3 G及 3. 5 無線網路環境為研究模型，發展以智慧型手機為伺服器的網路架構，以及開發相對應的應用程式，預期可讓使用者擁有較低的網站架設門檻和即時回應使用者需求的優點，以及簡便的商品管理介面，進而提昇商務網站的多樣性及便利性。Contents [...] 	i Figure of contents [...] 	ii Table of contents [...] -	iv 摘要 [...] -	vi Abstract [...] 	vii Chapter 1 : Introduction [...] 	 1 1. 1 	Introduction [...] -	 1 1. 2 	Aim of the Thesis [...] -	 4 1. 3 	Merits of the Method [...] 	 4 1. 4 	Organization of the Thesis [...] -	 5 Chapter 2 : Development Environment [...] 	 6 2. 1 	Smartphone [...] 	 6 2. 2 	Mobile Web Server [...] -	 7 2. 3 	Wireless Network [...] -	 8 2. 4 	Grid-Computing [...] 	 9 2. 5 	Java Technology [...] 	 10 2. 6 	GPS (Global Positioning System) [...] -	 12 Chapter 3 : System Design [...] 	 13 3. 1 	System Architecture [...] -	 13 3. 1. 1 	 Server-Client (Front End) [...] 	 13 3. 1. 2 	 Server-Client (Back End) [...] -	 16 3. 1. 3 	 Peer-to-Peer [...] -	 19 Chapter 4 : Implementation and Results of the Experiment [...] -	 21 4. 1 Development / Operation Environment [...] 	 21 4. 2 Implementation [...] 	 21 4. 2. 1 Server-Client (Front End) [...] -	 21 4. 2. 2 Server-Client (Back end) [...] -	 28 4. 2. 3 Peer-to-Peer [...] -	 54 Chapter 5 : Results and Discussion of Performance [...] -	 56 5. 1 Experiment 1 [...] -	 60 5. 2 Experiment 2 [...] -	 61 5. 3 Experiment 3 [...] -	 62 Chapter 6 : Conclusion and Future Work [...] -	 65 Reference [...] -	 67 Appendix [...] -	 6...|$|E
40|$|The cloth-dyers of West Africa {{are known}} to produce indigo {{textiles}} which reputation needs no making. These various productions, often times centuries old, have been continuously exposed to the turmoil {{of a variety of}} external events which have often made them very fragile or, on the other hand, have brought about prosperity. Among those events, let us cite the caravan trade across the Sahara and the Sahel, the establishment of trading posts by the Europeans on the Atlantic Coast, the Senegal River and the Niger, the slave trade, the development of small indigo factories, colonization by the English, the French and the Portuguese, the chemical and industrial revolutions, local and regional politics, world conflicts, the 1929 economic crash, independences, climate changes, development programs and technical assistance, fashion globalization, terrorism, tourism, international fairs, etc. While, in some areas, indigo dyeing has simply vanished and {{is no more than a}} cherished memory which the elderly women talk about while preserving carefully old indigo wrappers for special occasions, in other areas indigo cloth-dyeing seems to be prospering since the late 1980 s, due to a renewed interest in the Western world for natural products (locally grown organic cotton, natural dyes, handmade crafts) and, an appeal for “ethnic” products which has prompted a revival of the “traditional” indigo dyeing craft in West Africa. Textile and fashion designers, NGOs and private businesses have been instrumental in promoting the all-natural process. They have diversified the indigo textile production to meet Western tastes and high level standards: the motifs and decors of indigo wrappers are now offered in a range of linen, upholstery fabrics, curtains, western style clothes, etc. The demand for this type of production has allowed the resurgence of a “tradition” in indigo cloth-dyeing, saving it from disappearance, and has created some employment. However, the overall impact, so far, remains limited to a few areas. At the same time, early this XXI century, two major series of events have had a negative impact on the production of indigo textiles in West Africa, i. e. the economic <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> of African textiles by China and, the wave of terror and insurgences led by Boko Haram in Northern Nigeria. The Chinese manufacture synthetic textiles reproducing a variety of traditional wrappers, including indigo wrappers. These counterfeit wrappers are put for sale in the region where they are usually produced, directly competing with the local cloth-dyers. Despite the low quality of these synthetic wrappers, many customers prefer to spend less than go for the more expensive locally produced cotton wrappers. As a result, indigo cloth-dyers have seen their sales decelerate and while some are struggling to stay in business, others have already given up. For the last few years, Northern Nigeria has been off limit to tourists and buyers who purchased the famous Hausa indigo cloth from Kano, a town re-known for centuries in all of West Africa for its indigo production. In addition, Nigeria’s government policies regarding import of textiles have put local production at a disadvantage. As a result, sales have gone way down and many Kano cloth-dyers have had to leave their ground pits and find another occupation. But, let us now focus on the productions of two specific types of women garments, the Fouta-Djallon wrapper and the melhafa from Mauritania and see how they have evolved since the XIX century. This paper draws upon research conducted in Guinea and Mauritania as well as on bibliographical research...|$|E
