40|$|A small {{device that}} can detect eyelid closure was {{designed}} using a Hall sensor and magnet. The {{ability of the}} sensor to differentiate blinks from saccadic motion is of vital interest in development of a device to alleviate complications of facial nerve paralysis. Twelve physicatly normal human subjects were used in this study. A smatl Hall sensor (3 x 2. 5 x 1. 1 mm), a device that detects magnetic fields, {{was attached to the}} lower eyelid near the lid margin, and an opposing small magnet (3 x 2 x 1 mm) was attached to the upper eyelid, also near the lid margin. Output potentials from the Hall sensor were monitored during eye blinks and saccadic eye movements to correlate sensor potentials with eye movements. Results indicate that the Hall sensor is effective at determining <b>palpebral</b> <b>closure</b> and discriminating eye closure from other eye movements. Therefore, we conclude that the Hall sensor is a reliable means for determining <b>palpebral</b> <b>closure</b> and is ideally suited for use in a facial prosthesis that uses the normal blink as a trigger to reanimate the contralateral paralyzed eyelid. (OJOMRYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG I 994; I I 0 : I 74 - 6.) The most problematic complication of facial nerve paralysis is loss of the blink reflex. The affected ey...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a common}} complication of tube thoracostomy. Though self-limiting, it should be treated when it causes <b>palpebral</b> <b>closure,</b> dyspnea, dysphagia or undue disfigurement resulting in anxiety and distress to the patient. Presentation of case: A 72  year old man who was a known case of COPD on bronchodilators developed a large pneumothorax and respiratory distress after a CT guided transthoracic lung biopsy done for a lung opacity (approx. 3  ×  3  cm) at the right hilar region on Chest X-ray. Within 24  h of an urgent tube thoracostomy, patient developed intractable subcutaneous emphysema with closure of palpebral fissure and dyspnea unresponsive to increasing suction on chest tube. A subcutaneous fenestrated drain was placed mid-way between the nipple and clavicle in the mid-clavicular line bilaterally. Continuous negative suction (- 150  mmHg) resulted in immediate, sustained relief and complete resolution within 5  days. Discussion: Extensive and debilitating SE (subcutaneous emphysema) has to be treated promptly to relieve patient discomfort, dysphagia or imminent respiratory compromise. A variety of treatment have been tried including infraclavicular blow-hole incisions, subcutaneous drains[*]+/− negative pressure suction, fenestrated angiocatheters, Vacuum assisted dressings and increasing suction on a pre-existing chest tube. We describe a high negative pressure subcutaneous suction drain which provides immediate and sustained relief in debilitating SE. Conclusion: Debilitating subcutaneous emphysema which causes distress, anxiety, <b>palpebral</b> <b>closure,</b> dyspnoea or dysphagia requires intervention. High negative pressure subcutaneous suction drain provides immediate and sustained relief in extensive and debilitating SE...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The seventh nerve palsy causes loss of {{function}} in the affected orbicularis oculi muscle. There is exposure and dessication of the corneal surface and obvious aesthetic changes in facial symmetry. METHOD: A surgical procedure {{has been used in}} 11 patients to substantially improve <b>palpebral</b> <b>closure.</b> The technique consists of a small upper lid tarsoconjunctival flap sutured into a nasal pretarsal pocket of the lower lid, achieving a medial tarsal suspension of the lower lid. RESULTS: This technique improves cosmesis, is reversible, and combinable with other procedures. The signs and symptoms of exposure keratitis are satisfactorily resolved. There have been no complications in an average follow up of 5 1 / 2 years after this surgical procedure. CONCLUSION: This technique could be considered an appropriate treatment for patients suffering temporary or permanent facial palsy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Direct {{closure of}} eyelid defects gives {{excellent}} functional results but is usually restricted to defects measuring {{less than a}} quarter of the eyelid length for fear of distorting the palpebral aperture and compromising lid function. The authors have used direct closure in larger defects. The aim of this study was to establish the effects of direct closure of full thickness eyelid margin defects under tension on the palpebral aperture dimensions.  METHODS—A consecutive series of patients who had undergone one eyelid, full thickness lid resection repaired by direct closure were identified and invited to have both eyes photographed. The palpebral apertures of both eyes were measured from the photographs by a masked observer. The amount of eyelid resected was recorded from the operation notes. The unoperated palpebral aperture was used as the control. The result were analysed using a paired samples t test.  RESULTS—The photographs of 18  patients were included in the analysis. The mean width of excised full thickness lid tissue was 15  mm (range 7 - 26 mm). The mean vertical palpebral aperture height was 9. 2  (SD 1. 4) mm in the operated eye as opposed to 9. 3  (SD 1. 2) mm in the non-operated eye. The mean horizontal palpebral aperture width was 26. 1  (SD 1. 9) mm in the operated eye as opposed to 26. 4  (SD 1. 8) mm in the non-operated eye. There was no statistically significant difference between the operated and unoperated horizontal and vertical <b>palpebral</b> measurements.  CONCLUSIONS—Direct <b>closure</b> of large full thickness eyelid defects is possible in selected patients with excellent functional and cosmetic results. Eyelid tissue expansion occurs spontaneously following direct eyelid defect closure under tension, restoring the palpebral aperture dimensions. ...|$|R
