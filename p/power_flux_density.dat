We present a fast and reliable tool to estimate the effect of finite ion Larmor radius on heat load deposition for complex 3 D elements. The two possible geometrical design options foreseen for WEST tungsten monoblocks are asymmetric chamfer shaping and no shaping on top of monoblocks. This paper presents an evaluation of peak <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> for a WEST ITER-like tungsten monoblock plasma facing component which is vertically misaligned {{with respect to the}} other components of a maximum expected value of + 0. 3 mm, for steady state convected plasma power with ion temperature ranging from 10 to 500 eV. With the + 0. 5 mm asymmetric chamfer, leading edges between plasma facing components are shadowed and there is {{no significant difference between the}} optical calculations and the full ion orbit model. For an unshaped and + 0. 3 mm misaligned monoblock, when considering the full ion orbit model, the heat load on the exposed edge is reduced by a factor of 3 - 5 compared to the geometric-optical projection. Energy is found to be deposited over several millimetres on top of the monoblock just after the leading edge which prevents the tungsten armor from melting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

This report presents field survey measurements data and provides information on the levels of RF radiation to which members of the public may be exposed from these base stations. The measured RF electromagnetic energy (EME) levels are compared with the maximum permitted limit for non-occupational exposure with respect to the Radiocommunications (Electromagnetic Radiation Human Exposure) Standard 1999 which specifies a maximum non-occupational exposure limit of 2) at relevant base station frequencies. Although the focus of the survey was on measuring the RF EME emission levels from the digital Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), the environmental RF EME measurement component of the project involved investigating the EME levels from other sources, including the analog Advance Mobile Phone Systems (AMPS), VHF TV, UHF TV, AM radio, FM radio and Paging.

40|$|This PhD study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether the environmental impact of renewable energy sources is related to the <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density.</b> The object was to examine whether there are some general rules concerning the environmental impact from renewable energy sources, and whether a common factor could be the <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> of unit kW/m 2 as an underlying principle. The background and nature of the study are described with definitions of key concepts. The role of energy in the environment, powering the natural world and having a set of functions, are explained. The need for a general theory and the rationale is considered for eight primary renewable energy sources. The literature on environmental impact from these sources is reviewed. The theory and the hypothesis are explained with questions raised. A test devised to explore the relevant interactions (sediment transport and land use) is outlined, using data from a selection of well known hydro electric power developments. The 'Stream Power' concept and a variety of parameters were used for identifying losses of energy and power to a river's natural processes, resulting from impoundment dams. The test was carried out on the reservoir reach and the river downstream. It is concluded from applying the hypothesis to hydro electric power, that the environmental impact may indeed be related to the <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> for the two main impact parameters investigated, land use and sediment transport, though this is not conclusively statistically confirmed due to the small sample size. The hypothesis is extended in the Appendix to the other water based renewable energy sources, tidal barrage, marine current, and wave power, and to the lower energy flux density sources such as wind, solar and biomass. It is concluded tentatively that there is a qualitative argument that the environmental impact of all renewable energy sources may be related to <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> in terms of both land use and some functions in nature of the energy flow.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the ITER design review {{activities}} the specifications for <b>power</b> and particle <b>fluxes</b> onto plasma facing components (PFCs) have been revisited. The revised specifications for steady-state fluxes are based on 2 -D/ 3 -D SOL modelling code predictions with input from experiments in tokamaks, as well as on simple models and empirical extrapolations and they are provided for all phases of the discharges and scenarios in ITER. In particular, it has been identified that <b>power</b> <b>fluxes</b> along the field can be present for field lines in the far-SOL of ITER (more than 4 - 6 cm from the separatrix at the outer midplane) with parallel <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>densities</b> of ∼ 5 MWm- 2. Evaluation of the expected characteristics of <b>power</b> <b>fluxes</b> to the divertor during ELMs in ITER and experimental measurements of plasma material erosion under such loads has shown that an acceptable divertor target lifetime can only be ensured for ELMs causing an energy loss of ∼ 1 MJ or less. This is a factor of 20 smaller than that expected under uncontrolled ELMs and has determined the new requirements for ELM control in ITER. The expected range of energy and <b>power</b> <b>fluxes</b> on main chambers plasma facing components for controlled and uncontrolled ELMs in ITER is described on the basis of present models and empirical scaling of experimental data from various divertor tokamaks. Analysis of the energy outflow from the plasma to PFCs during the thermal quench of disruptions has shown that there is a significant degradation of plasma confinement for resistive-MHD disruptions expected in ITER scenario 2 at full performance. For ITER scenario 4, {{it is more likely that}} disruptions will be caused by exceeding ideal-MHD limits. In this second case, and that of VDEs, the plasma thermal energy remains close to its maximum value up to the thermal quench. As a consequence of this and the large broadening of the edge <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> profile at the thermal quench, the parallel energy flux during disruptions (mapped to the midplane) is expected to be in the range of 50 - 200 MJm- 2 for scenario 2 and 200 - 400 MJm- 2 for scenario 4.

Integrating the <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> delivers the receiver input power, which is required for calculating the energy conversion efficiencies of both heliostat field and receiver. Furthermore, <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> measurement is valuable for supervision and control during operation of a <b>power</b> tower. <b>Flux</b> <b>density</b> at small-scale prototype receivers has mostly been measured by using a camera and a moving bar so far. The moving bar is a white diffusely reflecting target which is moved quickly through the radiation’s focus in front of the receiver surface. At the same time, a digital camera cap-tures the radiation reflected off the moving bar, which allows determining the incident <b>flux</b> <b>density.</b> At industrial-scale receivers though, the installation of a moving bar is hardly feasible due to difficult construction and high costs. Therefore, the development of a measurement method without any mov-ing parts is aspired. For this purpose, the radiation reflected off the absorber itself can be measured in order to calculate the incident <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> [1]. Preliminary work on this method is still immature and has not yet lead to a reliable and satisfying measuring accuracy under all conditions [2]; achieving this is a main aim of the presented thesis. The central challenge with measuring <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> by reflection off the absorber is the absorber’s non-diffusive reflectivity, which depends especially on the direction of the incident radiation {{as well as on the}} observation angle [1].

Surface modification was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microroughness measurements. For estimation of damages in the bulk of material, an electrical conductivity method was used. Investigations showed that irradiation of DFW with multiple plasma pulses generated a mesh of micro- and macrocracks due to high heat load. A comparison with single forged tungsten (W) and tungsten doped with 1 % lanthanum-oxide (WL 10) reveals the better crack-resistance of DFW.

A {{method for}} the {{uncertainty}} estimation of probe calibrations using the <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> (PFD) system of (18 ~ 26. 5) GHz recently {{developed at the}} National Institute of Metrology, China is presented. A measurement model is developed first, and then the sources of uncertainty and the corresponding evaluation procedures are explained. The method is used to estimate {{the uncertainty of the}} calibration factor of a FP 7050 probe at 18 GHz obtained by the PFD system. The good agreement between the calibration results from two PFD systems validates the method...|$|E

The heating mechanism discussed is resonant absorption of Alfven waves. For some assumed MHD perturbation incident from the tail lobes onto the plasma sheet, the local heating rate in the PSBL has {{the form of a}} resonance function of the one-fluid plasma temperature. Balancing the local heating by convective transport of the heated plasma toward the central plasma sheet, an 'equation of state" is found for the steady-state PSBL whose solution has the form of a mathematical catastrophe: at a critical value of a parameter containing the incident <b>power</b> <b>flux,</b> the local <b>density,</b> and the convection velocity, the equilibrium temperature jumps discontinuously. Associating this temperature increase with the abrupt onset of the substorm expansion phase, the catastrophe model indicates at least three ways in which the onset may be triggered. Several other consequences related to substorm dynamics are suggested by the simple catastrophe model...|$|R
