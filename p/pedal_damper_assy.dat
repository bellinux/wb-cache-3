5000|$|The <b>damper</b> <b>pedal,</b> {{sometimes}} called the sustaining pedal, is used more often than the other pedals, and is placed {{at the right of}} the array of pedals, most conveniently accessible to (mostly right-footed) players. The <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> raises all the dampers off the strings so that they keep vibrating after a key on the keyboard has been released. In effect, the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> makes every string on the piano a sympathetic string, creating a rich tonal quality; it is probably this effect that lies behind the common saying that the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> is [...] "the soul of the piano". The <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> has the secondary function of allowing the player to connect into a legato texture notes that otherwise could not thus be played.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{development}} of the use of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> during the Classical period, with emphasis on the great contributions made by Steibelt and Dussek. Pedaling by the Austrian composers Mozart, Haydn, Woelfl, Kozeluch, and Beethoven is also considered, looking at the connections among these composers and the possible influence on them of London School composers such as Steibelt and Dussek. On the whole, the effects that these composers intended by means of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> are clear and precise—different from modern pedaling in which the consistent use of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> is normal and special effects are achieved by not using the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b> This study hopes to have recognized the contribution of Steibelt and Dussek to {{the development of}} the use of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal,</b> and to have encouraged pianists of today to take into consideration the pedal indications of composers of this period...|$|R
50|$|Piano pedals are {{foot-operated}} levers at {{the base}} of a piano which change the instrument's sound in various ways. Modern pianos usually have three pedals, from left to right, the soft pedal (or una corda), the sostenuto pedal, and the sustaining <b>pedal</b> (or <b>damper</b> <b>pedal).</b> Some pianos omit the sostenuto pedal, or have a middle pedal with a different purpose such as a muting function also known as silent piano.|$|R
50|$|The Cimbalom has a sustain (or <b>damper)</b> <b>pedal</b> {{which allows}} its strings to ring or {{abruptly}} mutes them.|$|R
5000|$|The sustain <b>pedal</b> (or, <b>damper</b> <b>pedal)</b> {{is often}} simply called [...] "the pedal", {{since it is}} the most {{frequently}} used. It is placed as the rightmost pedal in the group. It lifts the dampers from all keys, sustaining all played notes. In addition, it alters the overall tone by allowing all strings, including those not directly played, to reverberate. When all of the other strings on the piano can vibrate, this allows sympathetic vibration of strings that are harmonically related to the sounded pitches. For example, if the pianist plays the 440 Hz [...] "A" [...] note, the higher octave [...] "A" [...] notes will also sound sympathetically.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the opening}} of the work, Beethoven {{included}} the following direction in Italian: [...] "Si deve suonare tutto questo pezzo delicatissimamente e senza sordino" [...] ("This whole piece ought to be played with the utmost delicacy and without dampers."). The way this is accomplished (both on today's pianos and on those of Beethoven's day) is to depress the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> throughout the movement - or at least {{to make use of the}} <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> throughout, but changing the pedal as the harmony changes.|$|R
5000|$|A sustain pedal or {{sustaining}} <b>pedal</b> (also called <b>damper</b> <b>pedal,</b> loud pedal, or open pedal) is {{the most}} commonly used pedal in a modern piano. It is typically the rightmost of two or three pedals. When pressed, the sustain pedal [...] "sustains" [...] all the damped strings on the piano by moving all the dampers away from the strings and allowing them to vibrate freely. All notes played will continue to sound until the vibration naturally ceases, or until the pedal is released.|$|R
5000|$|The player {{must pay}} close {{attention}} to the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> to play cleanly and avoid multiple notes ringing unintentionally at the same time. Because the notes ring for a significant fraction of a second when struck with the damper pad up, and ringing bars do not stop ringing immediately when contacted by the pad, players use a technique called after pedaling. [...] In this technique, the player presses the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> slightly after striking the bar—shortly enough so the recently struck note continues to ring, but long enough so that the previous note stops ringing.|$|R
50|$|One {{option is}} simply to change the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> {{periodically}} where necessary to avoid excessive dissonance. This is seen, for instance, in the editorially supplied pedal marks in the Ricordi edition of the sonata.|$|R
50|$|The cimbalom {{is played}} {{primarily}} with beaters. It {{is equipped with}} a heavy frame for more dynamic power and many added string courses for an extended range of sounds and a <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> to allow more dynamic control.|$|R
2500|$|Silbermann {{was also}} a central figure {{in the history of}} the piano. [...] He {{transmitted}} to later builders the crucial ideas of Bartolomeo Cristofori (the inventor of the piano), ensuring their survival, and also invented the forerunner of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coming to the , both Mercedes {{struggled}} {{to be at}} the forefront as the cars do not suit the track therefore performance and times slumped as a result. Hamilton and Rosberg could only qualify 5th and 6th respectively. In the race, Hamilton recorded his first retirement of the season and Rosberg finished 4th. At the 14th round of the season - , Mercedes was back on form during qualifying by locking out the 10th front-row of the season. In the race, Hamilton got the better start and forced Rosberg wide at turn 2 dropping him to fourth place {{at the end of the}} first lap. Hamilton dominated the race, leading every lap and setting the fastest lap whereas Rosberg recovered to second, 19s adrift of his teammate, securing Mercedes's 8th 1-2 finish of the season. During the , pole-sitter Rosberg was forced to retire in the early stages of the race owing to throttle <b>pedal</b> <b>damper</b> failure causing blockage on the throttle control. On the other hand, Hamilton qualified 2nd and eased to victory by 6 seconds, ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, in addition with a 2nd successive World Constructors' Champions.|$|R
50|$|A sonorous {{foundation}} for the melodic line {{is provided by the}} widely spaced notes in the accompaniment, connected by the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b> The waltz-like accompaniment gently emphasizes the 12/8 meter, 12 beats to the measure subdivided into four groups of 3 beats each.|$|R
50|$|For {{mechanical}} pianos it {{is possible}} to press down the sustain pedal only partially such that the dampers just touch the strings very slightly. This technique for the advanced pianist is called half pedaling and allows a fine variation of the sound. It can be observed that with half <b>pedaling</b> the <b>damping</b> is more effective for the higher tones. An example for a musical piece that is played with half pedaling by some pianists is Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Most recent digital pianos also support this effect.|$|R
50|$|The extra {{keys are}} added {{primarily}} for increased resonance from the associated strings; that is, they vibrate sympathetically with other strings whenever the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> is depressed and thus give a fuller tone. Only {{a very small}} number of works composed for piano actually use these notes.|$|R
50|$|During the Classical era, the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> was {{generally}} not used {{as it is in}} later music; that is, as a more or less constant amplification and modulation of the basic piano sound. Instead, pedaling was employed as a particular expressive effect, applied to certain individual musical passages.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} {{can have}} numerous stops to soften and sweeten the sound: una corda, moderator, harp. Also, {{it has a}} device which allows the performer to raise all the dampers (like the modern <b>damper</b> <b>pedal),</b> and another that will only raise the treble dampers (a typical feature on many early pianos). See Piano pedals.|$|R
5000|$|Rizzetta is {{particularly}} noted {{for a number}} of innovations in hammered dulcimer design. These include bridge markers (a standard feature of modern instruments), chromatic designs, extra bridges, <b>damper</b> <b>pedals,</b> and many more. Rizzetta has collaborated closely with the Dusty Strings Company of Seattle, Washington; they have produced a [...] "Rizzetta series" [...] of chromatic models for many years.|$|R
50|$|The Borgato workshop, in Sossano - Vicenza, Italy, has {{produced}} the Doppio Borgato, a very large double piano with pedal board, as on an organ. The bass piano, operated by the pedals, sits under the main piano, and the <b>damper</b> <b>pedals</b> of the two are coupled. This instrument permits {{the performance of a}} variety of works written by classical composers for pedal piano.|$|R
5000|$|... 3) Concert cimbaloms: {{originally}} developed in Hungary by József Schunda in the 1870s. These instruments stand on four legs, {{have many more}} strings, and a <b>damping</b> <b>pedal.</b> The concert cymbalom has replaced most of the smaller folk tsymbaly previously used in Ukrainian orchestras and in Academic Conservatory courses. These instruments are fully chromatic and {{have a range of}} over four octaves.|$|R
50|$|Silbermann {{invented a}} device {{by which the}} player could lift all of the dampers off the strings, {{permitting}} them to vibrate freely, either when struck or sympathetically when other notes were played. This is the function in later pianos of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b> Silbermann's device {{was different from the}} modern <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> in two respects. First, it was not actually controlled by a pedal, but rather was a hand stop, which required the player to cease playing on the keys for a moment in order to change the damper configuration. Thus, it was a device for imparting an unusual tonal color to whole passages, rather than a means of nuanced expression as the pedal is today. Second, Silbermann's device was bifurcated, permitting the dampers of the treble and bass sections to be lifted separately. This latter feature has recently been reintroduced to the piano, {{in the form of the}} fourth and fifth pedals of pianos made by the Borgato firm; see Innovations in the piano.|$|R

50|$|Performers often {{hesitate}} to follow Beethoven's direction, particularly when {{playing on a}} modern piano. This is because the modern piano has a much longer sustain time than the instruments of Beethoven's time, so that a steady application of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> creates a dissonant sound. In contrast, performers who employ a historically based instrument (either a restored old piano or a modern instrument built on historical principles) {{tend to be more}} willing to follow Beethoven's direction literally.|$|R
50|$|Stein {{may have}} been the first to produce a fully {{functional}} <b>damper</b> <b>pedal,</b> in which the player can lift all the dampers from the strings. Such a device had been devised by Stein's predecessor Gottfried Silbermann, but Silbermann's device required the use of the player's hands to work, and thus could only be deployed during pauses in the music. Stein's device was controlled by a knee lever, pushing upward on the lower surface of the instruments, permitting the full equivalent of modern piano pedaling.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the first}} few years of {{production}} the original Leedy Vibraphone did not include a mechanism for damping, or stopping, the sustaining tones. [...] In 1928 the J.C. Deagan company introduced a pedal mechanism that has not changed substantially since. A rigid bar beneath the center of the instrument is pressed upward by an adjustable spring, and engages a long felt pad against the sharps and the naturals. [...] A foot pedal lowers the bar and allows notes to ring freely; releasing the <b>pedal</b> engages the <b>damper</b> and stops any vibrating notes.|$|R

50|$|The scherzo begins softly, with {{a phrase}} in G minor, {{coloured}} by a chromatic A. This chromaticism recurs throughout the scherzo {{by the use}} of the Neapolitan sixth. It is very driving and obsessive, containing numerous fast arpeggios.The trio, marked un poco più largamente, is completely contrasting, containing huge, loud chords.The scherzo then returns, but in ppp, and containing an instruction to hold down the una corda and <b>damper</b> <b>pedals.</b> Controlling the huge energy and velocity of the scherzo poses a very difficult challenge to the pianist, and its difficulty is increased on modern pianos.|$|R
50|$|As {{was typical}} with the pianos of his day, Graf's {{instruments}} use rather little metal reinforcement. The only metal structural part was the gap spacer, which reinforced the structure at the gap where the strings cross over the action; otherwise, their construction was entirely of wood. The stringing was straight (that is, all strings parallel, {{instead of the}} bass strings crossing over the treble as in modern pianos). The range as C′-f′′′′ or g′′′′. There were from three to five pedals, which other than the standard <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> could also include the soft pedal, bassoon stop, piano and pianissimo moderators, and janissary stop).|$|R
5000|$|The concert cimbalom {{developed}} by József Schunda in 1874 in Budapest, Hungary was closer in its range of pitch, dynamic projection and {{weight to the}} proportions of a small piano than the various folk hammered dulcimers had been. The Schunda cimbalom was equipped with a heavier frame for more stability and dynamic power. It included many more string courses for extended range and incorporated a <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> which allowed for more dynamic control. Four detachable legs were added to support this much larger instrument. The concert cimbalom continues to be played primarily with beaters although other playing techniques are used.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{neglected}} resources in piano pedagogy, and one that plays {{a very important role}} in piano teaching, is the use of the <b>damper</b> <b>pedal.</b> In fact, we have found that at higher levels of study students not only fail achieve the requisite autonomy, but also use it incorrectly. This happens {{due to a lack of}} printed resources, theoretical as well as practical, that greatly hinder teaching of this aspect.

5000|$|A four-way {{joystick}} {{was provided}} to control low-frequency oscillation (LFO) modulation as well as pitch bending.

Around the back panel are jacks for headphones, stereo line out (to plug into a keyboard amplifier, PA system, mixing board, etc.), <b>pedal</b> inputs for <b>damper,</b> portamento and [...] "program up" [...] are provided.

5000|$|The celesta [...] or celeste [...] is a struck idiophone {{operated}} by a keyboard. It looks similar to an upright piano (four- or five-octave), albeit with smaller keys and a much smaller sized cabinet, or a large wooden music box (three-octave).

Four- or five-octave models usually have a <b>damper</b> <b>pedal</b> that sustains or damps the sound. The three-octave instruments {{do not have a}} pedal because of their small [...] "table-top" [...] design.
