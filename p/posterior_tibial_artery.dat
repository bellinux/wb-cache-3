In all 15 cadavers, the peroneal artery was the direct continuation of the popliteal artery and the arterior <b>tibial</b> and <b>posterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> branched off at varying angles from the popliteal. This provides an anatomic explanation for the occasional failure of transfemoral Fogarty catheter embolectomy of the leg.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out whether a compensatory increase in blood flow to the foot is observed after sacrifice of one of the <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries.</b> Eleven patients who had one of the <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> as the recipient artery of free tissue transfer to their lower extremities were included. The arterial diameter, cross-sectional area, maximum flow velocity, minimum flow velocity, and flow rate were measured by a Doppler ultrasound in the nonrecipient <b>tibial</b> <b>artery</b> and perforating peroneal artery in the operated limb. The same parameters were measured in the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> and the perforating peroneal artery in the contralateral limb. The arterial diameter, cross-sectional area, flow velocity, and flow rate were increased significantly in the nonrecipient <b>tibial</b> <b>artery</b> of the operated limb with respect to the same artery on the contralateral limb. The same changes were not demonstrated in the perforating branch of the peroneal artery. Total blood flow to the foot in the operated extremity was not different from that of the nonoperated foot.

40|$|Background - An ankle-brachial index (ABI; {{ratio of}} ankle and brachial {{systolic}} blood pressure) &# 60; 0. 9 indicates {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) and is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events.

Methods and Results - In 831 patients admitted with chest pain for diagnostic heart catheterization, blood pressure of both anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> was measured. ABI was calculated for each leg with the higher of the 2 ankle pressures (current definition of the American Heart Association) or with the lower of the 2 ankle pressures (modified definition) in relation to the higher of the left or right brachial systolic blood pressure. For each patient, the lower ABI from both legs was used for further evaluation. Fifteen patients (1. 8...|$|R
40|$|Background. The true aneurysms of the infrapopliteal arteries are {{an unusual}} {{pathology}} with low incidence {{in the general}} population. They appear in the literature only as isolated case reports. True aneurysms of the infrapopliteal arteries represent a surgical problem, especially when a bifurcation is involved and when the distal vessels are affected by occlusive disease. Case report. A 67 year old man with an aneurysm which involved the tibioperoneal trunk and the origin of peroneal and <b>posterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> was surgical treated. At three months follow up, a duplex ultrasonography (DUS) control showed the bypass patency and the total exclusion of the aneurismal sac. Discussion. Although the aneurysms of the infrapopliteal arteries are very uncommon and often asymptomatic, their associated vascular lesions and/or ischemic complications can lead to high risk of limb loss. When the aneurysm is large and/or symptomatic, the surgical treatment becomes mandatory. A conservative treatment and DUS follow up could be reserved to elderly patients and when the aneurysm is small and asymptomatic. KEY WORDS: Aneurysm - <b>Tibial</b> <b>artery</b> - Surgery...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report an}} {{angiographic}} investigation of midterm atherosclerotic disease progression in below-the-knee (BTK) arteries of claudicants. Methods: Angiograms were performed in 58 consecutive claudicants (35 men; mean age 68. 3 ± 8. 7 years) with endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal arteries in 58 limbs after a mean follow-up of 3. 6 ± 1. 2 years. Angiograms were reviewed in consensus by 2 experienced readers blinded to clinical data. Progression of atherosclerosis in 4 BTK arterial segments (tibioperoneal trunk, anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries,</b> and peroneal artery) was assessed {{according to the}} Bollinger score. The composite per calf Bollinger score represented {{the average of the}} 4 BTK arterial segment scores. The association of the Bollinger score with cardiovascular risk factors and gender was scrutinized. Results: A statistically significant increase in atherosclerotic burden was observed for the mean composite per calf Bollinger score (5. 7 ± 8. 3 increase, 95...|$|R

50|$|The pulse {{or heart}} rate is {{the rate at}} which the heart beats while pumping blood through the arteries. Its rate is usually {{measured}} either at the wrist or the ankle and is recorded as beats per minute. The pulse commonly taken is from the radial artery at the wrist. Sometimes the pulse cannot be taken at the wrist and is taken at the elbow (brachial artery), at the neck against the carotid artery (carotid pulse), behind the knee (popliteal artery), or in the foot dorsalis pedis or <b>posterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries.</b> The pulse rate can also be measured by listening directly to the heartbeat using a stethoscope. The pulse varies with age. A newborn or infant can have a heart rate of about 130-150 beats per minute. A toddler's heart will beat about 100-120 times per minute, an older child's heartbeat is around 60-100 beats per minute, adolescents around 80-100 beats per minute, and adults' pulse rate is anywhere between 50 and 80 beats per minute.|$|R
40|$|The {{preferred}} {{method to}} calculate the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) for the diagnosis of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is to measure by the Doppler method the systolic pressures of {{the left and right}} brachial arteries in addition to the dorsalispedis and <b>posterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> in each leg [1, 2]. For each leg, the higher of the dorsalispedis and <b>posterior</b> <b>tibial</b> pressures is divided by the higher brachial pressure, and the lower overall ABI of the 2 legs is used to diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} PAD. The cuff size should be appropriate with a width at least 40 % of the limb circumference [2]. The ankle cuff should be placed just above the malleoli with the straight wrapping method [2]. The cuff should not be placed over a distal bypass to avoid the risk of bypass thrombosis [2]. The patient should be at rest for 5 to 10 minutes in the supine position, relaxed, head and heels supported, in a room with a temperature between 66 ˚ to 72 ˚Farenheit. The patient should not smoke for at least 2 hours prior to measurement of the ABI [2]...|$|R
