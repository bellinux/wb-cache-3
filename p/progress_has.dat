5|$|Benzoquinone is {{actually}} not a necessary component for this reaction; its {{role is to}} regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while {{at a much higher}} cost. Since the reaction typically employs near-stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage, some <b>progress</b> <b>has</b> been made in the development of catalytic variants. Despite this shortcoming, the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild, late-stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules.|$|E

5|$|The F-FDTL {{is still}} in the process of {{rebuilding}} from the events of 2006. It remains under-strength and is yet to reform its training and discipline standards. Tensions within the F-FDTL also continue to threaten the stability of the force. However, the East Timorese government places a high priority on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little <b>progress</b> <b>has</b> been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} timescale {{of giant}} planets {{is also an}} important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much <b>progress</b> <b>has</b> been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. <b>Progress</b> <b>has</b> been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E

5|$|Much <b>progress</b> <b>has</b> {{been made}} in the power scaling lasers and {{amplifiers}} produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E
5|$|SOS Puffin is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and <b>progress</b> <b>has</b> been made in cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E
