2500|$|Following {{the lead}} {{set by the}} lamp {{manufacturers}} in standardising lamp bases, a conference of the plug and receptacle manufacturers, including Hubbell, was arranged {{with a view to}} agreeing a standard configuration. It was a time of great expansion in the use of electrical appliances such as fans, heaters, and cookers, as well as portable devices such as hair curlers and irons, and the public wanted interchangeability. Hubbell's <b>parallel</b> <b>pin</b> configuration was preferred, but Hubbell [...] "rebelled against standardization", and refused to agree, asserting that it had common law rights in the dimensions of its line. The other conference members pressed on regardless, and agreed to standardize on Hubbell's parallel flat pin configuration and dimensions. Hubbell's court action only served to confirm the legality of their activities, to the great benefit of the US public.|$|E
2500|$|The {{report of}} the court {{proceedings}} includes {{a comprehensive review of}} the development of the art in the US prior to 1919, based on evidence presented to the Court. Separable plugs had been available {{for more than a decade}} prior to Hubbell's 1904 design. [...] The earliest presented to the court was the [...] "Weston", (US patent 480,900 issued August 16, 1892, for which Hubbell had taken out a licence), another (unidentified) type following in 1897. Plugs per se with parallel flat pins, such as the [...] "Fort Wayne" [...] design were in common use by 1886, and flush receptacles, such as the [...] "Bryant Electrical Company" [...] design, by 1902. Hubbell had introduced its own parallel flat pin configuration in 1912. In 1915 there were [...] "...from 15 to 20 different types of blades and from 15 to 30 different types of receptacles. The line of each was not interchangeable with competing lines. ..." [...] The existence of both [...] "tandem" [...] and <b>parallel</b> <b>pin</b> configurations had led to the introduction in 1914 of some receptacles having both configurations of slots and others having [...] "T" [...] slots. By 1915, Hubbell had sold about 13 million receptacles and plug bases/caps with tandem slots/pins, and about 1.25 million with parallel slots/pins, most of which were then still in active use, meaning that Hubbell's configurations were by far the most widely used.|$|E

50|$|FASTBUS is a crate/module {{standard}} developed {{later than}} the other two for high-speed parallel data acquisition. Rather than individual components, FASTBUS modules tend to be data acquisition modules with many input connectors on the front, while the stored data is read out on the backplane. The connectors {{on the back of a}} FASTBUS module are two <b>parallel</b> <b>pin</b> sockets on the module and pins sticking out of the backplane. The main connector in a FASTBUS crate covers about the bottom 2/3 of the module. There is also an upper connector that consists of pass-through pins to the back side of the backplane; this allows custom modules to be plugged in there.|$|E
30|$|Alternative {{methods for}} {{intraoperative}} bone realignment have been reported. In one method, <b>parallel</b> <b>pin</b> pairs are {{inserted in the}} distal and proximal bone segment using a drill guide. After osteotomy, the pin pairs are inserted into a reduction guide to achieve reduction [10]. Other techniques use drilling and cutting guides to predrill holes for subsequent fixation using standard osteosynthesis material [11], or by using patient-specific fixation plates that provide accurate alignment of the bone segments [4, 12, 13]. All these approaches may reduce the surgical error but do not allow any deviation from the preoperative plan {{in cases where the}} planned rotation angle appears unfeasible during surgery.|$|E

The heat sink was fabricated from Aluminium and fitted with a polycarbonate plastic cover plate. The heat sink consist of staggered and inline arrangement of square pin fin of size 0. 5 mm X 0. 5 mm X 0. 5 mm. Water was employed as the working fluid subjected to heat flux 10 W/cm 2. The study was carried out for Reynolds number ranging 60 to 900. Later the performance of square pin fin heat sink was compared with <b>parallel</b> <b>pin</b> fin heat sink.

30|$|The optimal pin {{configuration}} {{is a subject}} of considerable debate in relation to ulnar nerve injury and biomechanical principles [3]. Randomized clinical trials have shown that lateral-entry pin fixation and crossed-{{pin configuration}} are equally effective {{in the treatment of}} displaced supracondylar fractures [21, 22]. However, the risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury following percutaneous fixation using a crossed-pin technique has been well documented [8, 9, 10]. Many authors have concluded that fixation with lateral pins is a safer and more effective method for displaced supracondylar fractures in children [11, 23, 24, 25]. Studies have also demonstrated that the site of pin insertion is less important for fracture stability than the site at which the pins cross the fracture [5, 26, 27]. Kallio et al. [28], who focused on optimal lateral pin placement technique, recommended divergent pin placement for maximum stability and avoidance of joint penetration. In a biomechanical comparison of all three configurations, Lee et al. [29] reported that divergent lateral pin configuration provided greater stability than <b>parallel</b> <b>pin</b> configuration, and demonstrated similar stability compared with crossed-pin configuration. This was confirmed by another biomechanical study showing that the best torsional, valgus, and extension resistance are associated with the most divergent configuration of the lateral pins, in which the diverging pin crosses the fracture site at the medial edge of the coronoid fossa [30]. Based on the results of our cadaveric study, parallel lateral pin configuration may increase the risk of intracapsular pin placement compared to divergent lateral pin configuration. Thus, of the three configurations, divergent lateral pin placement is most desirable, since it has less potential for nerve injury, ensures optimal fracture stability, and in addition reduces the risk of intracapsular pin placement.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Prolyl-isomerase- 1 (Pin 1) regulates {{function}} of protein substrates through isomerization of peptide bonds that link phosphoserine or phosphothreonine to proline. Pin 1 triggers {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) production and inflammation in human cancer. Whether Pin 1 is involved in cardiovascular disease remains largely unknown. This study investigates the role of Pin 1 in diabetes-related vascular dysfunction. Methods: Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were exposed to normal (NG, 5 mmol/L) or high glucose concentrations (HG, 25 mmol/L) in the presence or {{in the absence of}} Pin 1 pharmacological inhibitor Juglone or siRNA-mediated knockdown. Diabetes was induced in C 57 /B 6 male mice (aged 4 - 6 months) by streptozocin and animals were treated i. v. with Pin 1 siRNA or Juglone i. p for 30 days. Endothelial function was assessed by dose-response curve with acetylcoline. Protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting. Mitochondrial ROS were measured by ESR spectroscopy. Immunoprecipitation was performed to show the interaction of Pin 1 with phosphorylated p 66 Shc and NFkB subunit p 65. In <b>parallel,</b> <b>Pin</b> 1 gene expression was assessed in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) of 30 patients with type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) and 18 healthy age-matched controls and correlated with flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, urinary 8 -isoprostaglandinF 2 α (8 -isoPGF 2 α) as a marker of oxidative stress, and plasma adhesion molecules VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1 and MCP- 1. Results: Pin 1 expression markedly increased in HAECs exposed to HG (289 ± 22 % vs NG, p< 0. 01) and aortas of diabetic mice (216 ± 32 % vs controls, p< 0. 05). Immunoprecipitation showed that Pin 1 recognizes phosphoserine motifs of the pro-oxidant mitochondrial adaptor p 66 Shc as well as NFkB subunit p 65. Interestingly, Juglone or Pin 1 siRNA prevented p 66 Shc-induced ROS production and suppressed upregulation of adhesion molecules VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1 and MCP- 1 via inhibition of p 65 nuclear translocation. In vivo knockdown of Pin 1 or Juglone in diabetic mice protected against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction, ROS production and vascular inflammation. Of note, Pin 1 mRNA was significantly upregulated in PBM of T 2 DM patients as compared with healthy controls (370 ± 97 vs. 25 ± 28, p< 0. 01) and correlated with glycated haemoglobin (r= 0. 44, p< 0. 05), FMD (r=- 0. 36,p< 0. 01), urinary 8 -isoPGF 2 α (r= 0. 39, p< 0. 05), as well as VCAM- 1 (r= 0. 56, p< 0. 05) and ICAM- 1 (r= 0. 53, p< 0. 05). Conclusions: This study shows {{for the first time that}} Pin 1 may critically contribute to oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes...|$|E

30|$|Infection after {{percutaneous}} pinning of supracondylar fractures is a not {{an uncommon}} event, {{as evidenced by}} our study. Our overall incidence of 4.3  % is slightly higher compared to other reports in the literature, {{which may have been}} due to bundling of pin tract irritation, hypergranulation tissue, and pin loosening/migration in the pin tract infection group. Most of these infections were superficial and were treated with oral antibiotics and wound care. However, the procedure is not completely benign, as evident in six of our patients who developed deep infections requiring surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics. The recognition and prompt treatment of pin tract infection is of utmost importance. Despite the infections, patients reported excellent functional results at skeletal maturity at a mean 18  years after the index procedure. Five of six (83  %) patients with deep infection had <b>parallel</b> lateral <b>pins.</b> However, two deep infections presented late, and one was lost to follow-up.

40|$|Comfort {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of clothing, especially for next-to-skin garments such as shirts and trousers for summer. Sensorial comfort has a strong relationship with both the mechanical and surface properties of apparel fabric. A comfortable textile material should have properties of softness, smooth surface or texture, be pleasant to touch and very flexible. When assessing fabric handle subjectively, the assessor usually strokes the fabric surface with one or several fingers and squash the fabric gently in hand. Thus, the perception of such handle includes complex parameters of compression, tactile sensation and textural effect. In this work, we attempted to use a simple technique of objectively evaluating fabric softness related properties, by measuring the force required to pull a fabric strip through a series of <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> (the pulling force).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{primarily}} open versus primarily closed surgical treatment of Gartland type III extension supracondylar fractures in children. Also the outcomes of different pinning techniques in open surgery were evaluated retrospectively. Eighty displaced type III extension supracondylar fractures treated consecutively at two different centres were included. The treatment protocol of one institute was primarily closed reduction and percutaneous cross-pinning (n[*]=[*] 43). The treatment protocol of the other institute was primarily open reduction and internal fixation (n[*]=[*] 37) with two lateral <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> (n[*]=[*] 11), cross pins (n[*]=[*] 11) and two lateral and one medial pin (n[*]=[*] 15) according to the stability and configuration of the fracture.

30|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} variations of recommended pinning techniques. Swenson [3], Flynn et al. [4], and Nacht et al. [5], using two pins, inserted medially and laterally through the medial and lateral epicondyles. The risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is always a concern during insertion of the medial pin with a reported incidence of 2 – 8 % [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Arino et al. [11] recommended inserting the two wires through the lateral epicondyles to avoid ulnar nerve injury. Biomechanically, fixation provided by the two lateral pins is less secure, as it may allow rotation of the fracture, with the medial column rotating posteriorly. It {{was found that the}} torque required to produce 10 ° of rotation is 37 % less with the use of two lateral <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> than with the use of medial and lateral pins [4, 12]. It has been argued that insertion of two lateral cross-pins will provide a biomechanically stable fixation with avoiding the risk of ulnar nerve injury [13].

40|$|Purpose – To {{examine a}} simple testing method of {{measuring}} the force {{to pull a}} fabric {{through a series of}} <b>parallel</b> <b>pins</b> to determine the fabric softness property. Design/methodology/approach – A testing system was setup for fabric pulling force measurements and the testing parameters were experimentally determined. The specific pulling forces were compared with the fabric assurance by simple testing (FAST) parameters and subjective softness ranking. Their correlations were also statistically analyzed. Findings – The fabric pulling force reflects the physical and surface properties of the fabrics measured by the FAST instrument and its ability to rank fabric softness appears to be close to the human hand response on fabric softness. The pulling force method can also distinguish the difference of fabrics knitted with different wool fiber contents. Research limitations/implications – Only 21 woven and three knitted fabrics were used for this investigation. More fabrics with different structures and finishes may be evaluated before the testing method can be put in practice. Practical implications – The testing method could be used for objective assessment of fabric softness. Originality/value – The testing method reported in this paper is a new concept in fabric softness measurement. It can provide objective specifications for fabric softness, thus should be valuable to fabric community. <br /...|$|R
