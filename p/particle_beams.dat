5|$|The {{strength}} {{and range of}} the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities {{of positive and negative}} charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged <b>particle</b> <b>beams,</b> an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E
5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the <b>particle</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{collaboration}} with Burton Richter, O'Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> from the Stanford Linear Accelerator {{were collected in}} his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 MeV. At the time, this was the highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 attometers across. O'Neill considered his device {{to be capable of}} only seconds of storage, but, by creating an even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours. In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction. He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as professor emeritus until his death.|$|E

40|$|The co-propagation of {{an intense}} <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> with an {{ionizing}} laser beam in a working gas/plasma is considered. When the axes {{of the laser}} and <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> are not aligned, then asymmetric plasma lensing results in a net dipole "eld acting on the <b>particle</b> <b>beam.</b> The <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> can be steered or bent (as well as focused) by steering the laser. An analogy is made between the bending of the <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> by collective e!ects at a plasma boundary and the refraction or re#ection of light at an interface. This mechanism of particle steering may be of interest in applications for which permanent magnets are inconvenient or a fast turn on is required. 3 -D particle-in-cell simulations and relevance to a recent experiment are discussed.

Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium-235 was brought to Sverdlovsk-45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent. After the problems with the gaseous diffusion process were resolved in 1950, it was decided not to proceed with a full-scale electromagnetic plant. , it remains operational.

Particle detectors must be built to detect particles, their masses, momentum, energies, lifetime, charges, and nuclear spins. In order to identify all particles produced at the interaction point where the <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> collide, particle detectors are usually designed in layers like an onion.

As the energy of the particles produced by the accelerator increases, the detectors attached to it must grow to effectively measure and stop higher-energy particles.

2500|$|The {{gamma ray}} sky (see {{illustration}} at right) {{is dominated by}} the more common and longer-term production of gamma rays that emanate from pulsars within the Milky Way.

Pulsars are thought to be neutron stars with magnetic fields that produce focused beams of radiation, and are far less energetic, more common, and much nearer sources (typically seen only in our own galaxy) than are quasars or the rarer gamma-ray burst sources of gamma rays. Pulsars have relatively long-lived magnetic fields that produce focused beams of relativistic speed charged particles, which emit gamma rays (bremsstrahlung) when those strike gas or dust in their nearby medium, and are decelerated. This is a similar mechanism to the production of high energy photons in megavoltage radiation therapy machines (see bremsstrahlung). The [...] "inverse Compton effect", in which charged particles (usually electrons) impart energy to low-energy photons boosting them to higher energy photons. Such impacts of photons on relativistic charged <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> is another possible mechanism of gamma ray production.
