5|$|Above each stall, the occupant's heraldic {{devices are}} displayed. <b>Perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{pinnacle}} of a knight's stall is his helm, {{decorated with a}} mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; instead, the coronet appropriate to the dame's rank (if she is a peer or member of the Royal family) is used.|$|E
5|$|The art {{direction}} for the 1988 release was instead put {{in the hands of}} CBS Records' art director Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the picture on the front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E

5|$|The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji Seamount, <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} Aleutian Trench, formed 85 {{million years}} ago. At its current velocity, the {{seamount}} will be destroyed within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It {{is also possible that}} a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Mikhail Vorontsov's summer residence in Alupka so impressed Tsar Nicholas I {{that he decided}} to have his own family retreat built at neighbouring Oreanda. In September 1837, the Tsar and Tsarina visited the Crimea for the first time. The viceroy entertained them at his new residence in Alupka. Impressed with the palace and its setting, the Prussian-born Empress commissioned from Karl Friedrich Schinkel, a Berlin-based architect, a design for a new residence. His design called for a striking combination of Greek Revival and Egyptian Revival elements. The palace was to be <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> craggy shore in Oreanda. The court architect Andrei Stackenschneider offered a less expensive design, which was adopted. The Tsarina's palace was built between 1843 and 1853 under the supervision of William Hunt and Combioggio, an architect from Odessa. This edifice was destroyed by a 1882 conflagration, with only a marble rotunda remaining. The next emperor, Alexander II, had the royal residence moved to Livadia.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. <b>Perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E
5000|$|From the prewar 1940 (Showa 15) {{until the}} postwar 1949 (Showa 24), {{the name of}} Golden Bat was {{considered}} as a hostile word and changed into [...] "Kinshi" [...] meaning a golden kite. That was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mythology of Emperor Jimmu, {{who was the first}} emperor of Japan. The design was also changed along with it. At first a golden kite <b>perching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of a bow was designed, however, it was changed to without a bow due to indication that it can be irreverent if the package drawn a golden kite <b>perching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of a bow was thrown away and stepped <b>on.</b> In <b>the</b> mythology of Emperor Jimmu, a golden kite <b>perching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of a bow led to a victory.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Republic, under the KMT's {{political}} tutelage, the flag shared the same prominence as the KMT party flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left and the ROC flag <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center. For the summits held between the KMT and Communist Party during the Chinese Civil War, the ROC flag was displayed at an equal position to the flag of the Chinese Soviet Republic (Jiangxi Soviet). Later, the flag law specified a horizontal display of the flag with the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in a portion of the red field at the center position. This display can be found in numerous government offices in Taiwan and is that which the President and Vice President face to take the oath of office.|$|E

Many others began to emulate the young protester, and the waving and displaying of the Romanian flag with the Communist insignia cut out quickly became widespread.|$|E
25|$|According to {{traveler}} John Muir, on {{his visit}} to Diomede Islands in the 1880s they found the natives eager to trade away everything they had. The village was <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steep rocky slope of the mountain which drops at once sheer into deep water. The huts were mostly built of stone with skin roofs. They looked like mere stoneheaps, black dots on the snow at a distance, with whalebone posts set up and framed at the top to lay their canoes beyond the dogs that would otherwise eat them.|$|E
25|$|The photos, {{taken with}} a cheap Instamatic camera, show {{what appears to be}} a male ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trunks of two trees in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana. The bird's distinctive bill is not visible in either photo and the photos– taken from a distance– are very grainy. Lowery presented the photos at the 1971 annual meeting of the American Ornithologists Union. Skeptics dismissed the photos as frauds; seeing that the bird is in roughly the same position in both photos, they suggested they may have been of a mounted specimen.|$|E
