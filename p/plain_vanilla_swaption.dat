40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{empirical}} performance of ve di erent models for barrier op- tion valuation is investigated: the Black-Scholes model, the constant elasticity of variance model, the Heston stochastic volatility model, the Merton jump-di usion model, and the in nite activity Variance Gamma model. We use time-series {{data from the}} USD/EUR exchange rate market: standard put and call (<b>plain</b> <b>vanilla)</b> option prices and {{a unique set of}} observed market values of barrier options. The models are calibrated to <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> option prices, and prediction errors at dif- ferent horizons for <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> and barrier option values are investigated. For <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> options, the Heston and Merton models have similar and superior performance for prediction horizons up to one week. For barrier options, the continuous-path models (Black-Scholes, constant elasticity of variance, and Hes- ton) do almost equally well, while both models with jumps (Merton and Variance Gamma) perform markedly worse...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} static super-replicating strategies for European-type call options {{written on a}} weighted sum of asset prices. This class of exotic options includes Asian options and basket options among others. We assume that there exists a market where the <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> options on the different assets are traded and hence their prices {{can be observed in}} the market. Both the infinite market case (where prices of the <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> options are available for all strikes) and the finite market case (where only a finite number of <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> option prices are observed) are considered. We prove that the finite market case converges to the infinite market case when the number of observed <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> option prices tends to infinity. We show how to construct a portfolio consisting of the <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> options on the different assets, whose pay-off super-replicates the pay-off of the exotic option. As a consequence, the price of the super-replicating portfolio is an upper bound for the price of the exotic option. The super-hedging strategy is model-free {{in the sense that it}} is expressed in terms of the observed option prices on the individual assets, which can be e. g.  dividend paying stocks with no explicit dividend process known. This paper is a generalization of the work of Simon et al. [Simon, S. Goovaerts, M. Dhaene, J. 2000. An easy computable upper bound for the price of an arithmetic Asian option. Insurance Math. Econom. 26 (2 - 3), 175 - 184] who considered this problem for Asian options in the infinite market case. Laurence and Wang [Laurence, P. Wang, T. H. 2004. What's a basket worth? Risk Mag. 17, 73 - 77] and Hobson et al. [Hobson, D. Laurence, P. Wang, T. H. 2005. Static-arbitrage upper bounds for the prices of basket options. Quant.  Fin. 5 (4), 329 - 342] considered this problem for basket options, in the infinite as well as in the finite market case. As opposed to Hobson et al. [Hobson, D. Laurence, P. Wang, T. H. 2005. Static-arbitrage upper bounds for the prices of basket options. Quant. Fin. 5 (4), 329 - 342] who use Lagrange optimization techniques, the proofs in this paper are based on the theory of integral stochastic orders and on the theory of comonotonic risks. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Due to the sharpen {{regulation}} of the Swedish <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> warrant in 2006 and the recent increase in trade among private investors, this thesis examined the informa-tion efficiency of Swedish <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> warrants. This was done in three different ways. First the theoretical Black & Scholes (B&S) price was tested against the ac-tual market price. Secondly likelihood ratio test statistics was used to see whether information regarding past returns added any information to that already captured by the implied volatility (IV) generated from observed warrant market prices via the B&S model. The third method used was {{a comparison of the}} IV´s among com-parable warrants. As the {{regulation of}} the Swedish <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> warrant market states that only certified issuer are allowed short calls and puts, the self adjusting price mechanism found in the option market doesn’t exist on this market. As a con-sequence of this, investors on this market is reliant of accurate ask and bid prices from the issuers. Further, the information efficiency of a capital market is of es-sence for capital allocation, price discovery and risk management. The results from all three tests rejected the information efficiency hypothesis of the sample. Thus concluding that the included warrants in this thesis are none ideally for activities such as capital allocation, price discovery and risk management...|$|R
