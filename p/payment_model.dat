Randnet was launched with monthly payment plans for the service and hardware bundle: ¥2,500 (approximately [...] ) per month for the purchase plan and ¥3,300 (...) per month for rent-to-own for the first year and ¥1,500 per month for Randnet service thereafter. The service later eliminated the monthly <b>payment</b> <b>model</b> in favor of an annual prepaid model, at ¥30,000 (...) for one year for outright purchase and ¥39,600 (...) for the first year of rent-to-own. The 64DD and some later games eventually became available for purchase directly at retail.|$|E
2500|$|Doctors and {{hospitals}} are generally funded by payments from patients and insurance plans {{in return for}} services rendered (fee-for-service or FFS). In the FFS <b>payment</b> <b>model,</b> each service provided is billed as an individual item, which creates an incentive to provide more services (e.g., more tests, more expensive procedures, and more medicines). This {{is in contrast to}} bundled payments, in which the amount the insurer will pay to the service providers is bundled per episode (e.g., for a heart attack patient, a total amount will be paid to the network providing the care for say 180 days). Bundling on a per patient basis (rather than per-episode) was referred to in the 1990's as a [...] "capitated payment" [...] but is now described as an accountable care organization. Bundling provides an incentive to lower costs, which requires offsetting measures and incentives for quality of care. Several best-practice healthcare systems, such as the Kaiser and Mayo health systems, use bundled payments.|$|E

40|$|The Sustainable Growth Rate formula {{should be}} repealed. Fundamental {{changes in the}} {{fee-for-service}} system are {{necessary in order to}} control the growth of Medicare spending and to improve the way care is delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. Congress will have limited success in controlling Medicare spending and providing truly highquality care to Medicare beneficiaries if it merely uses quality-based pay-for-performance or shared savings programs built on top of the dysfunctional fee-for-service system. Fortunately, there are better ways of paying physicians that can enable them to make more significant improvements in patient care and achieve greater savings for Medicare. Accountable <b>payment</b> <b>models</b> need to be designed and implemented as quickly as possible in ways that will work for every specialty and every part of the country.

40|$|The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) {{resulted}} in providers {{and health care}} organizations conforming to new <b>payment</b> <b>models</b> that connect reimbursement to patient outcomes. Primary care providers (PCPs) are tasked to provide new quality provisions as chronic disease management is a key focus to improve outcomes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand the transition to new <b>payment</b> <b>models</b> and determine whether care is improved. The conceptual framework is grounded in health care access models geared towards the improvement of quality outcomes including the chronic care model (CCM). The research questions were designed to understand providers 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on new metrics to improve quality and the implications on practice workflows and patient outcomes. This phenomenological study consisted of interviews with 9 PCPs directly impacted by health care reform and the implementation of new quality metrics designed to improve patient outcomes.
