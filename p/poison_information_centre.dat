40|$|Objectives To {{review the}} {{characteristics}} of the consultation about the management of mercury exposure and identify the controversial issues on the clinical management of individuals with a history of mercury exposure. Design Descriptive case series. Setting Hong Kong <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre,</b> Hong Kong. Participants Persons consulting the Hong Kong <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> about individuals with possible or definitive mercury exposure. Main outcome measures Characteristics of the consultations, including: The demographics of affected individuals, source and reason for the consultation, tissue mercury levels, the source of mercury exposure, specific intervention if any, and clinical outcomes. Results Forty-one consultations were analysed. Most consultations were from the public sector. Reasons of the consultation were very variable. Individuals with abnormal tissue mercury levels were uncommon. There was only one case of acute mercury poisoning. The majority of identified individuals were not subjected to specific interventions. Chelation therapy was given to three patients, but in one of them it was considered to be contra-indicated. Conclusion The management of mercury exposure is highly variable. Recommendations were made on the approach to an individual with potential mercury exposure or poisoning. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the use of dimenhydrinate was associated with delay in the diagnosis and management of treatable illnesses or with direct adverse effects in children with vomiting presenting to an emergency department. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey and review of drug reaction and telephone inquiry records. SETTING: The emergency department of a tertiary care children's hospital and a provincial <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centre.</b> PATIENTS: The parents of 148 children who presented with vomiting completed the questionnaire. The database at the <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centre</b> included 474 reports of adverse drug reactions over an 8 -year period and 105 reports of telephone inquiries over a 4 -year period. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one (14 %) of 148 children had received dimenhydrinate before arrival at the emergency department. The patients who had received dimenhydrinate {{were more likely than}} the others to present more than 12 hours after the onset of vomiting (14 [67 %] of 21 v. 43 [34 %] of 127, p less than 0. 01). The discharge diagnoses for those who had received dimenhydrinate included asthma, pelvic inflammatory disease and urinary tract infection.

40|$|Background:: An {{analysis}} performed on the collected data from the Local Drug and <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (DPIC) of Jundishapur University revealed that stings are the main causes of poisonings with frequency of 56 %, followed by drug poisoning in 31 %, and chemical exposure poisoning in 5. 5 % in Khuzestan, the southwestern province of Iran [...] Objectives:: The aim {{of the present study}} was to report the prevalence of poisoning in Khuzestan province referred to hospitals during the year 2007, on the basis of documents from the local Drug and <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (DPIC) and the main Khuzestan Hospitals Discharge Registry, to elucidate demographic trends of poisoning in this region [...] Materials and Methods:: In the present study, 3258 cases of poisoning including 4. 7 % of all admissions to hospitals of Khuzestan during one year (2007) were investigated. Antidepressant drugs were the main-drug category inducing poisoning (24. 37 %). Others include sedative-hypnotics (19 %), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) (14. 7 %) and cardiovascular drugs (11. 4 %) [...] Results:: The research showed that most poisonings are occurred in autumn (29. 6 %) season.

Method:We retrospectively analyzed adult MPH exposures reported to the Danish <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> from January 2006 to July 2012 and the association with MPH sales and the number of patients prescribed MPH. Results:Of the 394 exposures (57 % males, median age 27 years) reported, MPH status was available in 249 of whom 65. 5 % were prescribed MPH. Exposure was in 54 % motivated by suicidal attempt and in 40 % by recreational use (based on 375 cases). Exposure was dominated by one trade name and exposure incidence correlated significantly with sales (p 0. 001) and prevalence of MPH-treated patients (p 0. 0008). Conclusions: The increase in MPH exposures parallels the prescription rates (particularly Ritalin 1 /Ritalin 1 Uno).

Objective: 1) Availability and incidence of pre-emptive stockpiling of AC on site in the German region Bavaria 2) time saved by AC-stockpiling and application on site, 3) quality of AC-application defined by completeness of the applied AC-dose, time needed, incidence of side-effects in lay-care and in professional-care, considering confounding variables: AC-formulation/powder/tablets, recommended AC-dose, patientâs age. Method: telephone-interviews in cases with AC-recommendation by a <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (PIC). Lay-care was suggested according to risk-assessment by PIC. Ingestion sites were classified as either apt for AC-stockpiling or not apt. Results: 1) availability: In Bavaria only 20 %â 22 % of eligible cases had AC on-hand, 2) time-saving was at least 14 Â min. 3) Lay-care/professional-care or patientâs age had no significant influence on the completeness of the applied AC-dose, which was higher with AC as powder but negatively correlated with the recommended AC-dose.

Systematic data monitoring of antidote stocking in Lebanese hospitals is lacking. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the adequacy of antidotes stocking in Lebanese hospitals according to type and quantity and explore the characteristics associated with their differential availability. Methods Data collection to assess antidote availability and its correlate was undertaken through a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaires were distributed by the unit of surveillance at the Ministry of Public Health to eligible hospitals providing emergency care services. The list of essential antidotes was adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) list and the British Columbia Drug and <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre.</b> Results Among the 85 Lebanese hospitals surveyed none had in stock all the 35 essential antidotes required. The frequency of stocking by type of antidote varied from a minimum of 1. 2 % of the hospitals having a (cyanide kit) to 100 % availability of (atropine and calcium gluconate). Teaching hospitals and those with a large bed-capacity reported a higher number of available antidotes for both immediate and non-immediate use than non-teaching hospitals while controlling for the hospital geographical region and public vs private sector. Conclusion The Lebanese hospitals have a suboptimal stock of essential antidotes supply. It is recommended that the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health monitors closely on the hospital premises the adequacy and availability of essential antidotes stock. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|Aims: There {{is limited}} {{information}} on safety of angiotensin coverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists in unintentional paediatric ingestions. This {{study was conducted}} with the aim of developing referral guidelines for poison information centres. Methods: Calls to the NSW <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centre</b> from January 2002 to July 2004 regarding paediatric ingestion of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists were recruited and prospectively followed up. Information collected included: demographics (age, gender, weight), type of exposure (unintentional, therapeutic error), ingested dose and clinical effects. Dose was reported in defined daily doses (DDD) to compare across and within the two drug classes with respect to the normal adult dose. Results: Nineteen cases of paediatric ingestion of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists were included. The median age was 2 years (Interquartile range (IQR) : 20 – 33 months) and the median dose ingested was 1 DDD (IQR: 1 – 2). There were nine ACE inhibitor ingestions and 10 AII receptor antagonist ingestions. One of nine children (11 %) observed in hospital developed transient hypotension but required no treatment and recovered without complication. This child ingested an ACE inhibitor and ingested > 3 DDD. Conclusion: Unintentional paediatric ingestions of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists resulted in the majority of children remaining asymptomatic.

Various agents such as pesticides, drugs have been used for intentional and accidental poisoning in different countries. In the Indian scenario, pesticides are the most commonly used poisoning agents. To assess the prevalence and mortality incidence rate due to various poisoning agents a retrospective and prospective study conducted over a period of nine months in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Retrospective data of poisoning cases was collected from the medical records section and the prospective data of poisoning cases was collected from the emergency and causality departments. A total of 1045 poisoning related admissions were identified during the period January 2005 to September 2008. Among them, 68. 40 % of cases were due to intentional poisoning and 31. 60 % were due to accidental poisoning. Of the poisoning related admissions, 84. 4 % of patients recovered, whereas in 7. 6 % of cases condition did not improve. Mortality rate was observed 4 %. Intentional poisoning was observed more in male population (60. 2 %) in the age group of 18 - 29 years. Accidental poisoning was seen more in children in the age group of 1 - 3 years.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Physicians might {{prescribe}} corticosteroid {{in addition}} to chelation therapy in patients with inorganic mercury poisoning {{with the presence of}} proteinuria. However, there is controversy over the efficacy of corticosteroid in treating these patients. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} study a case series to evaluate patient characteristics and treatment outcome of inorganic mercury poisoning due to cosmetic cream for skin whitening. METHODS: Cases in 2008 to 2015 were identified and reviewed using the electronic database of the Hong Kong <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre.</b> For inclusion, patients must have documented inorganic mercury toxicity, use of cosmetic cream, and proteinuria. Patients were classified into two groups (dimercaptosuccinic acid chelation or combination therapy of dimercaptosuccinic acid and prednisolone) according to their treatment received during period of mercury toxicity. The primary outcome of the study was the duration to proteinuria remission. Data were analysed using SPSS statistics version 22. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included in this study: 15 (88. 2 %) patients were female and 13 (76. 5 %) patients were Southeast Asians. Of the patients, 14 (82. 4 %) were treated with chelation, prednisolone, or combination therapy. Comparing patients with combination therapy to chelation only, there was no significant difference in the duration to achieve proteinuria remission (67. 3 ± 4. 91 vs 46. 8 ± 12. 5 days; P= 0. 307). Baseline blood mercury level correlated with duration to achieve proteinuria remission (r= 0. 79; P= 0. 004). CONCLUSION: Inorganic mercury in certain skin-whitening creams can cause mercury poisoning and nephrotic syndrome. The duration of proteinuria is related to baseline blood mercury level and is not significantly affected by the addition of corticosteroid to chelation therapy...|$|E

There is ongoing {{debate about the}} significance of bites by mouse spiders and the frequency of severe envenoming by funnel-web spiders. We conducted a prospective cohort study of definite spider bites with expert spider identification and include the analysis of mygalomorph spiders here. Subjects were recruited prospectively from February 1999 to April 2003 from patients presenting to participating hospitals or contacting a state <b>poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centre.</b> Forty-nine cases of bites by mygalomorph spiders were included: 16 were by funnel-web spiders, 13 by mouse spiders and 20 by other trapdoor spiders (Families Idiopidae and Nemesiidae). Of the 49 bites, 45 (92 %) occurred on distal limbs (hands and feet). Local effects included severe pain (53 %), puncture marks (61 %) and bleeding (27 %), local redness (33 %). Itchiness did not occur. The following were highly statistically associated with mygalomorph spider bites compared to all other spiders (p> 0. 0001) circumstances (gardening at the time (likelihood ratio (LR) 7. 9) and distal limb bites (LR 2. 0)) and early clinical features (presence of puncture marks OR bleeding (2. 3), or severe pain (2. 0)). Of 16 funnel-web spider bites, there were 10 cases with minor local effects, four with moderate envenoming (non-specific systemic or local neurotoxicity) and two with severe envenoming requiring antivenom. In addition to local effects, mouse spider bites caused local paraesthesia in three cases, local diaphoresis in one case and non-specific systemic effects in five cases, but not severe envenoming. True trapdoor spider bites caused only minor effects. The data from a mixed species sample of funnel-web spiders confirms previous observations suggesting that only a small proportion of funnel-web bites cause severe effects. Mouse spider bites are unlikely to cause major envenoming but the clinical effects are consistent with neurotoxic venom and are more severe than the trapdoor spiders...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Occasionally, mycologist {{assistance}} is requested to reliably identify mushroom species in symptomatic cases {{where there is}} a concern that a toxic species is involved. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the epidemiology of mushroom poisoning in Ireland, to describe the working arrangement between the National <b>Poisons</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (NPIC) and professional mycologists and to present a case series detailing the circumstances when mycologists were consulted. METHODS: Computerised records from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and data on patient demographics, circumstances, and mushroom species collated. In 1999, the NPIC established a national registry of volunteer professional mycologists who are available 24 h/day for mushroom identification. The NPIC staff liaises directly with the mycologist and arranges transport of mushroom material. Digital photographic images are requested if there is likely to be a delay in arranging transportation of mushroom material, and the images are subsequently emailed to a mycologist. Five cases of suspected mushroom poisoning were chosen to demonstrate the inter-professional collaboration between the NPIC and mycologists. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2009, the NPIC was consulted about 70 cases of suspected mushroom exposures. Forty-five children ingested unknown mushrooms, 12 adults and 2 children ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms and 11 adults ingested wild toxic mushrooms that were incorrectly identified or confused with edible species. The mycologists were consulted 10 times since 1999. In this series, Amanita species were identified in two cases. In three cases, the species identified were Clitocybe nebularis, Coprinus comatus and Panaeolina foenisecii, respectively, and serious poisoning was excluded. Incorrect mushroom identification by a health care professional using the Internet occurred in two cases. The mycologists assisted <b>Poisons</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centres</b> in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom in two cases. Digital photographs facilitated tentative mushroom identification in two cases. CONCLUSION: <b>Poison</b> <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> should maintain a registry of expert mycologists who are available for consultation following potentially serious mushroom intoxications. Health care workers should not attempt to identify toxic mushroom species using the Internet as erroneous identification can occur.

40|$|Introduction. The soccer World Cup {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{sporting}} events in the world, but data on the effect of sporting events of such a magnitude on the service demand on Poison Information Centres (PICs) are limited. Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the 2010 World Cup on the workload of the Tygerberg <b>Poison</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (TPIC). Methods. Data were collected prospectively for three time periods during 2010 : (1) 31 days preceding the World Cup (10 May- 10 June); (2) 31 days during the World Cup (11 June- 11 July); and (3) 31 days after the World Cup (12 July- 11 August). The calls received during 2010 were compared to calls received during corresponding time periods in 2008 and 2009. Collected data included date and time, caller's location and medical background, patient's age and gender, intent of exposure, route of exposure and specific toxin class. Results. During the study, 3888 calls related to human poisoning were received (1162 in 2010, 1412 in 2009 and 996 in 2008). The mean daily call volume between 2010 (12. 49; 95 % CI 11. 57 - 13. 42) and 2009 (13. 23; 95 % CI 12. 30 - 14. 15) did not differ significantly (p = 0. 25). The mean daily call volume during the World Cup was 11. 13 (95 % CI 9. 59 - 12. 67; n = 345) compared to 14. 26 (95 % CI 12. 71 - 15. 80; n = 442) for the similar period in 2009 (p = 0. 08). The mean daily call volume before and after the World Cup was 12. 74 (95 % CI 11. 20 - 14. 29; n = 395) and 13. 61 (95 % CI 12. 07 - 15. 16; n = 422); p = 1. 00 and p = 0. 39, respectively, when compared with the World Cup period. Discussion. An unexpected finding of this study was that the hosting of the 2010 World Cup resulted in fewer calls to the TPIC. This decrease could be attributed to the high visibility of policing, an extended school holiday and the positive attitudes of South Africans towards making the World Cup a success. Conclusion. PICs should be consulted during the planning stages of major sporting events. Contingency plans should still be in place to overcome any unexpected rise in call volume. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc. Articl...|$|E
40|$|The core {{function}} of the National <b>Poisons</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (NPIC) is to provide information, rapidly, by telephone, {{to assist in the}} treatment of poisoning. In 2010 we answered 9330 enquiries about human poisoning and followed-up 361 serious or unusual cases of poisoning to determine the outcome. We also answered 355 additional enquiries which included non-emergency requests for information and enquiries about poisoning in animals. Follow-up is usually performed by telephone and can involve multiple calls to nursing and/or medical staff. We are very grateful to everyone who takes the time to talk to us when we call to follow-up a case. Overall, 59. 4...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} species-specific envenoming {{rates and}} spectrum of severity of funnel-web spider bites, and the efficacy and {{adverse effects of}} funnel-web spider antivenom. Data sources: Cases were identified from a prospective study of spider bite presenting to four major hospitals and three state <b>poisons</b> <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> (1999 - 2003); museum records of spider specimens since 1926; NSW <b>Poisons</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> database; MEDLINE and EMBASE search; clinical toxinology textbooks; the media; and the manufacturer's reports of antivenom use. Data extraction: Patient age and sex, geographical location, month, expert identification of the spider, clinical effects and management; envenoming was classified as severe, mild-moderate or minor/local effects. Data synthesis: 198 potential funnel-web spider bites were identified: 138 were definite (spider expertly identified to species or genus), and 77 produced severe envenoming. All species-identified severe cases were attributed to one of six species restricted to NSW and southern Queensland. Rates of severe envenoming were: Hadronyche cerberea (75 %), H. formidabilis (63 %), Atrax robustus (17 %), Hadronyche sp. 14 (17 %), H. infensa (14 %) and H. versuta (11 %). Antivenom was used in 75 patients, including 22 children (median dose, 3 ampoules; range, 1 - 17), with a complete response in 97 % of expertly identified cases. Three adverse reactions were reported, all in adults: two early allergic reactions (one mild and one with severe systemic effects requiring adrenaline), and one case of serum sickness. Conclusions: Severe funnel-web spider envenoming is confined to NSW and southern Queensland; tree-dwelling funnel webs (H. cerberea and H. formidabilis) have the highest envenoming rates. Funnel-web spider antivenom appears effective and safe; severe allergic reactions are uncommon...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Medication {{errors are}} widely {{reported}} for hospitalised patients, but limited {{data are available}} for medication errors that occur in community-based and clinical settings. Epidemiological data from <b>poisons</b> <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> enable characterisation of trends in medication errors occurring across the healthcare spectrum. AIM: The objective {{of this study was}} to characterise the epidemiology and type of medication errors reported to the National <b>Poisons</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (NPIC) of Ireland. METHODS: A 3 -year prospective study on medication errors reported to the NPIC was conducted from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 inclusive. Data on patient demographics, enquiry source, location, pharmaceutical agent(s), type of medication error, and treatment advice were collated from standardised call report forms. Medication errors were categorised as (i) prescribing error (i. e. physician error), (ii) dispensing error (i. e. pharmacy error), and (iii) administration error involving the wrong medication, the wrong dose, wrong route, or the wrong time. RESULTS: Medication errors were reported for 2348 individuals, representing 9. 56 % of total enquiries to the NPIC over 3 years. In total, 1220 children and adolescents under 18 years of age and 1128 adults (>/= 18 years old) experienced a medication error. The majority of enquiries were received from healthcare professionals, but members of the public accounted for 31. 3 % (n = 736) of enquiries. Most medication errors occurred in a domestic setting (n = 2135), but a small number occurred in healthcare facilities: nursing homes (n = 110, 4. 68 %), hospitals (n = 53, 2. 26 %), and general practitioner surgeries (n = 32, 1. 36 %). In children, medication errors with non-prescription pharmaceuticals predominated (n = 722) and anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, anti-bacterials, and cough and cold preparations were the main pharmaceutical classes involved. Medication errors with prescription medication predominated for adults (n = 866) and the major medication classes included anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, psychoanaleptics, and psychleptic agents. Approximately 97 % (n = 2279) of medication errors were as a result of drug administration errors (comprising a double dose [n = 1040], wrong dose [n = 395], wrong medication [n = 597], wrong route [n = 133], and wrong time [n = 110]). Prescribing and dispensing errors accounted for 0. 68 % (n = 16) and 2. 26 % (n = 53) of errors, respectively. CONCLUSION: Empirical data from <b>poisons</b> <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> facilitate the characterisation of medication errors occurring in the community and across the healthcare spectrum. Poison centre data facilitate the detection of subtle trends in medication errors and can contribute to pharmacovigilance. Collaboration between pharmaceutical manufacturers, consumers, medical, and regulatory communities is needed to advance patient safety and reduce medication errors...|$|R
