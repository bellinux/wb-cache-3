The most famous of these is the polarity or reciprocity of two figures in a conic curve (in 2 dimensions) or a quadric surface (in 3 dimensions).

25|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>duality</b> can be {{explained}} from a group theory perspective by {{fact that there are}} exactly four functions that are one-to-one mappings (automorphisms) of the set of Boolean polynomials back to itself: the identity function, the complement function, the dual function and the contradual function (complemented dual). These four functions form a group under function composition, isomorphic to the Klein four-group, acting on the set of Boolean polynomials. Walter Gottschalk remarked that consequently a more appropriate name for the phenomenon would be the principle (or square) of quaternality.|$|E

He developed the concept of parallel lines meeting at a point at infinity and defined the circular points at infinity that are on every circle of the plane.

2500|$|Projective {{geometry}} is {{an elementary}} non-metrical form of geometry, {{meaning that it}} is not based on a concept of distance. In two dimensions it begins with the study of configurations of points and lines.

In higher dimensional spaces there are considered hyperplanes (that always meet), and other linear subspaces, which exhibit the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>duality.</b> The simplest illustration of duality is in the projective plane, where the statements [...] "two distinct points determine a unique line" [...] (i.e. the line through them) and [...] "two distinct lines determine a unique point" [...] (i.e. their point of intersection) show the same structure as propositions.

40|$|Background: Duality in the microeconomic theory {{enables us}} to {{represent}} consumers’ preferences and production technology with various dual functions satisfying certain regularity conditions. Objectives: Since {{the basis for the}} application <b>of</b> <b>duality</b> in the microeconomic theory is the price taking behaviour, this paper takes the challenge <b>of</b> applying <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>duality</b> to a monopolistic case where a single producer has an influence on the price which it charges for its product. Methods/Approach: The standard approach of deriving the profit function for the monopolist from the production function and the defined pseudoproduction function is accompanied by an alternative approach in which the starting point is the pseudocost function. Starting from the derived profit function, the pseudoproduction function and the pseudocost functions are recovered and a version of Hotelling’s lemma is given. Results: The structure of the profit maximization problem in a monopolistic case was made similar to the structure of the profit maximization problem in the perfectly competitive case and it is shown that all starting functions can be recovered back from derived functions. A version of Hotelling’s lemma is illustrated, which brings us indirectly from the profit function to the supply function. Conclusions: By introducing the pseudoproduction function in the profit maximization model of a monopolist, the structure of the problem becomes similar to the perfectly competitive case and duality results can be applied. The profit function is derived from the pseudoproduction and the pseudocost function, and all starting functions are recovered back from the derived profit function...|$|R
