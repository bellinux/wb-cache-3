5|$|With {{the start}} of the fire <b>preparation,</b> <b>tank</b> hunting detachments—groups of ten {{equipped}} with RPG-7 rockets, RPG-43 grenades, and AT-3 Sagger missiles—crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep, quickly occupying the tank ramparts, and proceeded to set up ambushes and lay mines. When the first barrage ended, Egyptian artillery began a second, 22 minute-long barrage, against targets at a depth of 1.5–3kilometers. At this time, 14:20, the first wave of assault infantry, 4,000 men, began crossing the canal. Around 2,500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops. Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover. During the night of October 5, engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank, preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it. The first wave was lightly equipped, armed with RPG-7s, Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the sand wall. Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa'iqa (lightning; these were commando forces), who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes. The Sa'iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces, while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses. Immediately following them, military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting them up. At this time Egyptian aircraft involved in the air strike began returning. Five aircraft were lost, although {{by the end of the}} day this rose to ten. The air strike put the Bir Gifgafa and Bir Thamada air bases out of operation for 48 hours, and damaged the Ras Nasrani and Bir Hasanah airbases. Around ten HAWK batteries, at least two 175mm artillery batteries, an electronic jamming center at Umm Khashib, and various radar stations were destroyed. This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground-based communications interference, as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el-Arish, considerably behind the front. Over a dozen AS-5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu-16 bombers as well. Several were shot down, but at least five hit their targets, including two missiles fitted with anti-radiation seekers that knocked out Israeli radars. The success of the air strike caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second air strike. Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost, and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes.|$|E

30|$|A <b>preparation</b> <b>tank</b> of (50  L) {{capacity}} {{was used}} to prepare the desired physiochemical seawater parameters for each experiment. The experiment was carried out only after the acclimatization of trilobite larvae for 36  h to the desired temperatures, pH and salinity prior to the commencement of the study. During the acclimatization and whole experimental period no feeding was administered to the trilobite larvae to avoid any potential increases in metabolic (and thus respiratory) rates associated with specific dynamic action. Initially the physiochemical parameter of the preparation tanks (4 tanks) was maintained at a temperature of 25  °C, salinity of 25 ppt and pH 7. A total of 360 larvae each were maintained in the preparation tanks of temperature and salinity. Meanwhile 450 larvae were maintained in <b>preparation</b> <b>tank</b> for pH and 180 larvae in dark–light <b>preparation</b> <b>tank.</b> In order to evaluate the effect of different temperature and salinity on the oxygen consumption pattern, a slow acclimatization procedure was followed before taking the measurement. A gradient of 5  °C and 5 ppt was either increased or decreased from the previously maintained temperature (25  °C) and 25 ppt salinity of trilobite larvae, whereas for pH experiment, a gradient of 1 pH was considered. The larvae were maintained in the newly introduced physiochemical parameters {{over a period of}} 24  h. An extended 12  h of acclimatization was only provided for the trilobite larvae which were taken for experimentation at that particular parameter and thus a total of 36  h was provided in total for acclimatization. Rest of the larvae were shifted to the new environmental parameters but before further modifying that specific parameter, the trilobite larvae were maintained for another 24  h. In general, after reaching the desired temperature the larvae were kept undisturbed for the next 36  h before commencing the experiment and after this a batch of 30 larvae was introduced into each respective respiratory chamber. For measuring the effect of different temperatures ranging from 10 to 40  °C on the oxygen consumption of trilobite larvae, pH of the water was maintained at 7 and salinity at 25 ppt for all different temperatures. Similarly, for measuring the effect of various salinities (10, 20, 30 and 40 ppt), on oxygen consumption rate in trilobite larvae, pH of the water was maintained at 7 and temperature at 25  °C. Meanwhile, for evaluating the effect of various pH (5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) on oxygen consumption, a constant salinity (25 ppt) and temperature (25  °C) was maintained. In the fourth set of experiment, the oxygen consumption by the trilobite larvae was assessed under light and dark conditions. The larvae were kept under complete light and dark conditions for 36  h before starting the experiment. The light condition was obtained with two fluorescent tube lights (10  W) and the dark condition was obtained by covering the respiratory chambers with black plastic sheets. This prevented any penetration of light into the respiratory chambers. Experiment to determine the effect of light and dark condition on oxygen consumption of trilobite larvae was conducted at a constant salinity (25 ppt), temperature (25  °C) and pH (7).|$|E

The goal of study was to develop a technology to reduce the viscosity of rapeseed oil by heating it before further pumping between the tanks. Material and methods. The research was raw rapeseed oil prior to transesterification. The simulation tests in the laboratory were performed on a specially designed test bench for testing the properties of a viscous liquid having a volume of 5 liter tank. The oil is heated heater at 5 °C temperature range 20 ¸ 80 °C and determined the cost of its heating HC, the costs of pumping PC, making up the total cost of transport TC.

Before transferring the larvae from the <b>preparation</b> <b>tank</b> to the respiratory chambers, proper aeration was provided in the experimental chambers for a period of 2  h. A total of 30 trilobite larvae were introduced in each respiratory chamber after recording the weight of larvae to the nearest 0.01  g. Larvae were blotted using a dry soft tissue paper before weighing and weight of the larvae used for the present study ranged from 0.060 to 0.0746  g. During the blotting process, the larvae were handled very gently to avoid any possible damage to the gill tissues and the whole process was done as quickly as possible to avoid any stress to the animal. Extreme care was taken to avoid variation in total biomass of the larvae in each replicated tanks and also for the entire experimental sets. The initial dissolved oxygen in the water was measured immediately after the introduction of weighed larvae in each tank in all set of experiment. This was followed by sealing the water surface with a thin layer of liquid paraffin wax (Gene Chem., Canada) to avoid any diffusion of oxygen from the atmosphere.

The equipment is installed within a high level waste tank {{to take advantage of the}} shielding provided by the waste tank. The process will involve adding monosodium titanate (MST) to the waste tank (i. e., Tank 41 H) to sorb the Sr and select actinides, removing the MST and entrained sludge with in-riser rotary microfilters, and subsequently using ion-exchange columns containing crystalline silicotitanate (CST) to remove the Cs.

The first two experiments examined desorption from MST and CST under two different sludge treatment processes, aluminum dissolution and sludge washing. Desorption of all sorbates was observed to varying degrees under the aluminum dissolution conditions. The extent of desorption ranged from < 3 % to about 50 % after 4 weeks, with Pu exhibiting the lowest desorption. At the end of the experiment, the temperature was reduced from 65 C to 25 C and the tests monitored for an additional two weeks. After reducing the temperature, partial resorption of the sorbates was observed with both MST and CST. Under the sludge washing conditions, no desorption of sorbates was observed with MST; however, some additional sorption did occur. For CST, a small amount of Cs leached from the material during the first day of testing, but no further leaching was observed over the remaining test period. The final test was designed to examine the possibility of desorption from both MST and mMST upon increasing the solid to liquid phase ratio. The results of these tests indicated some desorption of Pu from MST within the first two weeks after changing the phase ratio, then resorption of some of the leached Pu over the remaining 4 weeks of the experiment.

40|$|Thesis (MEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{main purpose}} of the base metal {{refinery}} (BMR) as operated by Lonmin at their Western Platinum Ltd BMR, is to remove base metals – such as copper and nickel – from a platinum group metal (PGM) containing matte. The leaching processes in which this is done pose several challenges to {{the control of the}} process. The most significant of these is the slow dynamics of the process, due to large process units, as well as the continuously changing composition of the first stage leach residue, which is not measured on-line. This is aggravated {{by the fact that the}} exact leaching kinetics (and therefore the effect of the disturbances) are not understood well fundamentally. The slow process dynamics mean that controllers cannot be tuned aggressively, resulting in slow control action. The large residence times and off-line composition analyses of major controlled variables also mean that the effects of operator set point changes are visible only the following day, often by a different shift of operators. Dorfling (2012) recently developed a fundamental dynamic model of the pressure leach process at Lonmin‟s BMR. This dynamic model incorporates 21 chemical reactions, as well as mass and energy balances, into a system of 217 differential equations. The model provides a simulation framework within which improved control strategies can be investigated. The primary aims of this study are twofold. The first is to validate the model for the purpose of the investigation and development of control structure improvements. This is done by comparing the model to plant data, and adapting it if necessary. The second aim to reconsider the current control philosophy to the extent that is allowed by the model‟s determined validity. The current plant control philosophy aims to maintain a PGM grade of 65 %, while the copper in the solids products of the second and third leaching stages should be below 25 % and 3. 5 % by mass, respectively. Two areas of particular concern in this process that have been raised by Lonmin are the control of the temperature of the first compartment and the addition of pure sulphuric acid to control the acid concentration in the second stage leach. Dynamic plant data were used to calibrate the model, which was migrated from its received MATLAB platform to Simulink, to assist with control development. Flow rates were imported from the data, with some data values adapted for this purpose, due to mass balance inconsistencies. The outputs from the calibrated model were compared with corresponding data values. The model was found to be suitable for the investigation and development of the control structures of pressure, temperatures and inventories (termed basic regulatory control) and the acid concentration and solids fraction in the preparation tanks (termed compositional regulatory control). It was, however, found to be inadequate for the investigation and development of supervisory control, since it does not provide accurate compositional results. The leaching of copper is especially under-predicted, with the predicted copper concentration in the second stage product being approximately 46 % lower than data values. The basic and compositional regulatory control structures were investigated. For each of these a base case was developed which aimed to represent the relevant current control structure, assuming optimal tuning. The variable pairings for the basic regulatory control were reconsidered using a method proposed by Luyben and Luyben (1997), since this part of the process does not permit the generation of a relative gain array (RGA) for variable pairing. The resulting pairing corresponds with Lonmin‟s current practice. Considering the temperature control of compartment 1, it was found that the addition of feed-forward control to the feedback control of the level of the flash tank improves the temperature control. More specifically, during an evaluation where the temperature‟s set point is varied up to 1 %, the IAE of the temperature of compartment 1 was decreased with 7. 5 % from the base case, without disturbing the flash tank. The addition of feed-forward control allows for more rapid control and more aggressive tuning of this temperature, removing the current limit on ratio between the flash recycle stream and the autoclave feed. The compositional control was investigated for the second stage leach only, due to insufficient flow rate and compositional information around the third stage <b>preparation</b> <b>tank.</b> Variable pairing showed that three additive streams are available for the preparation tanks of the second and third stage leach to control the acid concentration and solids fraction in those tanks. Focussing on the second stage, the aim was to determine whether the acid concentration in the flash tank can be successfully controlled without the addition of pure acid to the tank. With four streams available around the second stage <b>preparation</b> <b>tank</b> to control its mass/level, the acid concentration and solids fraction, three manipulated variables were derived from these streams. The resulting pairings were affirmed by an RGA. Control loops for the control of acid concentration and solids fraction in the flash tank were added as cascade controllers, using the preparation tank‟s control as secondary loops. The added compositional control was evaluated in two tests. The first of these entailed the adding of typical disturbances, being the flash recycle rate, the solids and water in the feed to the second stage <b>preparation</b> <b>tank</b> and the acid concentration in copper spent electrolyte. In the second test the control system was tested for tracking an acid concentration set point. It was found that the cascade structure controls the acid concentration in the flash tank less tightly than the base case (with an IAE that is 124 % and 80. 6 % higher for the two tests), but that it decreases the variation of solids fraction (lowering the IAE with 40. 8 % with the first test) in the same tank and of the temperature in the first compartment (lowering the IAE with 73. 6 % in the second test). It is recommended that the relative effects of these three variables on leaching behaviour should be investigated with an improved model that is proven to accurately predict leaching reactions in the autoclave. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die hoofdoel van die basismetaal-raffinadery (BMR), soos dit bestuur word deur Lonmin by hulle Western Platinum Ltd BMR, is om basismetale – soos koper en nikkel – te verwyder uit 'n mat wat platinum groep metale (PGM) bevat. Die logingsprosesse waarin dit gedoen word hou talle uitdagings in vir die beheer van die proses. Die mees beduidende hiervan is die proses se stadige dinamika, wat veroorsaak word deur groot proseseenhede, sowel as die deurlopend veranderende samestelling van die eerste stadium residue (wat nie aanlyn gemeet word nie). Dit word vererger deur die feit dat die presiese logingskinetika (en daarom ook die effek van versteurings) nie fundamenteel goed verstaan word nie. Die stadige dinamika beteken dat die beheerders die aggressief verstel kan word nie, en dit lei tot stadige beheeraksies. Die groot verblyftye en aflyn samestellingsanalises van die belangrikste beheerde veranderlikes beteken dat die gevolge van 'n operateur se stelpunt veranderinge slegs die volgende dag sigbaar is – dikwels in die skof van 'n ander operateur. Dorfling (2012) het onlangs 'n fundamentele, dinamiese model van die drukloog proses by Lonmin se BMR ontwikkel. Hierdie dinamiese model inkorporeer 21 chemiese reaksies, sowel as massa- en energiebalanse, in ‟n stelsel van 217 differensiaalvergelykings. Die model bied 'n simulasie-raamwerk waarbinne verbeterde beheerstrategieë ondersoek kan word. Die hoofdoel van hierdie studie is tweeledig. Die eerste hiervan is om die model te valideer vir die ondersoek en ontwikkelling van beheerstruktuur verbeteringe. Dit is gedoen deur die model met aanlegdata te vergelyk en dit aan te pas, indien nodig. Die tweede doel is om die huidige beheerfilosofie te heroorweeg tot op 'n punt wat toegelaat word deur die bepaalde geldigheid van die model. Die huidige beheerfilosofie van die aanleg mik om 'n gehalte van 65 % te handhaaf, terwyl die koper in die vastestof produk van die tweede en derde logingsstadia onderskeidelik onder 25 % en 3. 5 % op 'n massa basis moet wees. Twee probleem-areas, soos ge-opper deur Lonmin, is die beheer van die temperatuur in die eerste kompartement en die byvoeging van suiwer swaelsuur om die suurkonsentrasie van die tweede stadium te beheer. Dinamiese aanlegdata is gebruik om die model te kalibreer. Hierdie model is van die oorspronklike MATLAB platform na Simulink gemigreer, ten einde beheerontwikkelling te vergemaklik. Vloeitempo's is van die data af ingevoer na die model toe, met sekere data waardes wat aangepas is vanweë massabalans inkonsekwenthede. Die uitsette van die gekalibreerde model is met die ooreenstemmende data waardes vergelyk. Daar is bevind dat die model geskik is vir die ondersoek en ontwikkelling van die beheer van druk, temperature en tenks (basiese reguleringsbeheer), sowel as die beheer van suurkonsentrasies en vastestoffraksies in die bereidingstenks (reguleringsbeheer van die samestelling). Daar is egter bevind dat die model nie geskik is vir die ondersoek en ontwikkelling van toesigbeheer nie, aangesien dit nie akkurate samestellingsresultate genereer nie. Die voorspelde loging van koper is veral te laag, met die model wat koperkonsentrasies vir die tweede stadium voorspel wat ongeveer 46 % laer is as ooreenstemmende data waardes. Die basiese en samestelling reguleringsbeheer strukture is ondersoek. Vir elkeen is ‟n basisgeval ontwikkel wat poog om die huidige beheerstruktuur te verteenwoordig, met optimale verstellings aanvaar. Die paring van veranderlikes vir die basiese reguleringsbeheer is heroorweeg met deur middel van ‟n metode wat deur Luyben en Luyben (1997) voorgestel is, aangesien hierdie deel van die proses nie die opstel van ‟n relatiewe winsmatriks (RWM) vir die paring toelaat nie. Die uiteindelike paring stem ooreen met Lonmin se huidige praktyk. Met die heroorweging van die temperatuurbeheer van kompartement 1 is daar bevind that die byvoeging van vooruitvoer beheer by die terugvoerbeheer van die flitstenk die temperatuurbeheer verbeter. Meer spesifiek het die IAE van hierdie temperatuur met 7. 5 % verlaag van die basisgeval af nadat die temperatuur se stelpunt tot met 1 % gevariëer is – sonder om die flitstenk te versteur. Die byvoeging van vooruitvoer beheer laat vinniger beheer en meer aggressiewe verstellings van die temperatuur toe, aangesien die huidige beperking op die verhouding tussen die flitsstroom en die outoklaaf voer verwyder word. Die samestellingsbeheer is slegs ondersoek in die geval van die tweede loogstadium as gevolg van onvoldoende vloeitempo- en samestellingsinligting om die bereidingstenk van die derde stadium. Die paring van veranderlikes het gewys dat drie voerstrome onderskeidelik beskikbaar is vir beide die bereidingstenks van die tweede en derde stadia, om die suurkonsenstrasies en vastestoffraksies in hierdie tenks te beheer. Met die fokus op die tweede stadium was die doel om te bepaal of die suurkonsentrasie in die flitstenk suksesvol beheer kan word sonder dat suiwer suur by hierdie tenk gevoeg word. Met vier strome beskikbaar rondom die bereidingstenk van die tweede stadium om die massa/vlak, die suurkonsentrasie en die vastestoffraksie te beheer, is drie manipuleerde veranderlikes vanuit hierdie strome afgelei. Die uiteindelike paring is bevestig deur 'n RWM. Beheerlusse is ingevoeg vir die beheer van die suurkonsentrasie en vastestoffraksie in die flitstenk, met die bereidingstenk se beheer wat dien as sekondêre lusse in kaskadebeheer. Die kaskadebeheer is geëvalueer in twee toetse. Die eerste hiervan behels die invoer van tipiese versteurings, soos die vloeitempo van die flitsstroom, die vastestof en water in die voer na die tweede stadium se bereidingstenk en die suurkonsentrasie in die gebruikte elektroliet. In die tweede toets is die vermoë van die beheerstelsel om 'n suurkonsentrasie stelpunt te volg getoets. Daar is bevind dat die kaskadestruktuur die suurkonsentrasie minder nougeset beheer as die basisgeval (met 'n IAE wat 124 % en 80. 6 % hoër is vir die twee toetse), maar dat dit die variasie in die vastestoffraksie in dieselfde tenk (40. 8 % vermindering van die IAE in die eerste toets) en in die temperatuur van die eerste kompartement (73. 6 % vermindering van die IAE in die tweede toets) beduidend verminder. Daar word aanbeveel dat die relatiewe effekte van hierdie drie veranderlikes op logingsoptrede ondersoek moet word, met die gebruik van 'n model wat logingsreaksies in die outoklaaf akkuraat voorspel...|$|E

The attack failed and the republican army lost 19 of its 48 tanks and more than 300 men (according to Hugh Thomas 12 tanks destroyed out of 40) An American member of the International Brigades said:Courage and heroism are plentiful in Spain and the Spanish people have no lack of it. What they need is tactics. And as for tactics, on 13 October, Regiment BT was bankrupt.|$|R
5000|$|Then {{the enemy}} counterattacked. The first counterattack was broken less than fifty {{yards from the}} perimeter, while the second was preceded by heavy {{artillery}} <b>preparation.</b> As enemy <b>tanks</b> and infantry closed in, the outnumbered and outgunned A Company fought its {{way back to the}} river's edge. The regiment sent I Company across to support the withdrawal. The 504th had lost only nine men to the enemy’s 150, and 32 troopers were captured for 10 days and forced marched 100 km to Plettendorf, Germany then were liberated by elements of the 83rd Infantry Division. Whether the two companies achieved the higher aim of diverting enemy forces from a more important sector upstream is unknown. For the men involved, it was a small-scale [...] "Dunkirk" [...] with a hollow satisfaction achieved. The 504th was then relieved of its active defense of the Rhine and was directed to patrol the area north of Cologne until 1 May 1945. With little resistance to slow it down, the regiment established its command post in the town of Breetze, Germany on {{the west bank of the}} Elbe River. Although tanks had been attached to the unit, the 504th was outnumbered 100 to 1 by German troops clogging every road. Nevertheless, throughout the next several days, the Americans stood at 100-yard intervals collecting souvenirs by the jeep-load as almost never-ending columns of enemy forces poured through the regiment’s lines to surrender.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear waste at Savannah River Site (SRS) waste tanks {{consists}} of three different types of waste forms. They are the lighter salt solutions referred to as supernate, the precipitated salts as salt cake, and heavier fine solids as sludge. The sludge is settled on the tank floor. About half of the residual waste radioactivity is contained in the sludge, which is only about 8 {{percentage of the total}} waste volume. Mixing study to be evaluated here for the Salt Disposition Integration (SDI) project focuses on supernate <b>preparations</b> in waste <b>tanks</b> prior to transfer to the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) feed tank. The methods to mix and blend the contents of the SRS blend tanks were evalutaed to ensure that the contents are properly blended before they are transferred from the blend tank such as Tank 50 H to the SWPF feed tank. The work {{consists of}} two principal objectives to investigate two different pumps. One objective is to identify a suitable pumping arrangement that will adequately blend/mix two miscible liquids to obtain a uniform composition in the tank with a minimum level of sludge solid particulate in suspension. The other is to estimate the elevation in the tank at which the transfer pump inlet should be located where the solid concentration of the entrained fluid remains below the acceptance criterion (0. 09 wt% or 1200 mg/liter) during transfer operation to the SWPF. Tank 50 H is a Waste Tank that will be used to prepare batches of salt feed for SWPF. The salt feed must be a homogeneous solution satisfying the acceptance criterion of the solids entrainment during transfer operation. The work described here consists of two modeling areas. They are the mixing modeling analysis during miscible liquid blending operation, and the flow pattern analysis during transfer operation of the blended liquid. The modeling results will provide quantitative design and operation information during the mixing/blending process and the transfer operation of the blended liquid in the Salt Disposition Integration (SDI) facility. The results will also help validate the anticipated performance of the pump vendor's design...|$|R
40|$|The {{propellant}} to {{fill the}} fuel tanks of the spacecraft, upper stages, and space rockets on technical and ground-based launch sites before fueling {{should be prepared to}} ensure many of its parameters, including temperature, in appropriate condition. Preparation of fuel temperature is arranged through heating and cooling the rocket propellants (RP) in the tanks of fueling equipment. Processes of RP temperature preparation are the most energy-intensive and timeconsuming ones, which require that a choice of sustainable technologies and modes of cooling (heating) RP provided by the ground-based equipment has been made through modeling of the RP [1] temperature preparation processes at the stage of design and operation of the groundbased fueling equipment. The RP temperature <b>preparation</b> in the <b>tanks</b> of the ground-based systems can be provided through the heat-exchangers built-in the internal space and being external with respect to the tank in which antifreeze, air or liquid nitrogen may be used as the heat transfer media. The papers [1 - 12], which note a promising use of the liquid nitrogen to cool PR, present schematic diagrams and modeling systems for the RP temperature preparation in the fueling equipment of the ground-based systems. We consider the RP temperature preparation using heat exchangers to be placed directly in RP tanks. Feeding the liquid nitrogen into heat exchanger with the antifreeze provides the cooling mode of PR while a heated air fed there does that of heating. The paper gives the systems of equations and results of modeling the processes of RP temperature preparation, and its estimated efficiency. The systems of equations of cooling and heating RP are derived {{on the assumption that the}} heat exchange between the fuel and the antifreeze, as well as between the storage tank and the environment is quasi-stationary. The paper presents calculation results of the fuel temperature in the tank, and coolant temperature in the heat exchanger, as well the heat flows and the relative amounts of the liquid nitrogen used to cool the fuel RG- 1 as compared with other cooling technologies. The RP temperature preparation process using a heat exchanger, placed directly in the tank of the filling system is applicable for any high-boiling RP and has some of the best performance characteristics. Modeling the heating and cooling RP processes in the internal tanks of the ground-based systems using the numerical solution of the equations presented can be applied when calculating the RP temperature preparation processes with estimating their effectiveness and time of heating and cooling operations of RP. </p...|$|R
