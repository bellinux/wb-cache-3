5|$|Males tend to {{move over}} longer {{distances}} than females. The average home range size in Fleming's study was 1.33hectares (3.3acres); males had larger home ranges on average. Specimens {{that were once}} captured tended to be captured more frequently than those {{that had never been}} captured. Fleming estimated that population densities reached peaks of up to 4.3 per ha (1.7 <b>per</b> <b>acre)</b> late in the rainy season (October–November), but dropped to near zero around June; however, these figures may well be underestimates. In central Venezuela, population densities vary from 5.5 to 9.6 per ha (2.2 to 3.8 <b>per</b> <b>acre).</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{red-headed}} myzomela {{is widely}} distributed, {{it is not}} abundant within its range. The largest recorded population was 5.5 birds per hectare or 2.2 <b>per</b> <b>acre</b> at Palmerston in the Northern Territory. The peak abundance of the species in the mangroves around Darwin Harbour during the mid-dry and early wet season coincided with the production of young and the flowering of the yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).|$|E
5|$|Harrison became {{chairman}} of the Committee on Public Lands and successfully promoted passage of the Land Act of 1800, which {{made it easier to}} buy land in the Northwest Territory in smaller tracts at a low cost. The sale price for public lands was set at $2 <b>per</b> <b>acre.</b> This became an important contributor to rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory.|$|E

5000|$|It's {{difficult}} for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because of reduced sporulation from red oaks and summerwood cell development. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried in from upwind and the re-opening of oaks' 2011 earlywood cells. The oak wilt fungus {{is too large}} to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This increased the chances of infection to storm damaged oaks 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection <b>per</b> 1,500 <b>acres,</b> foresters were seeing one new infection <b>per</b> 10 <b>acres.</b> The manageable level of oak wilt disease is one infection per 640 acres.One year after the storm, in summer 2012, oak wilt specialists found 10 - 20 infections <b>per</b> 100 <b>acres</b> both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State Park [...] in Pine County, Minnesota. Wounding & infecting at ten oaks <b>per</b> 100 <b>acres,</b> one oak <b>per</b> 100 <b>acres</b> or one oak <b>per</b> 200 <b>acres,</b> presents {{a serious threat to}} the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northern-most infected oak and southern-most infected oak were 10 miles apart. The only way you get that broad of coverage for infection in mid-summer is, huge spore supplies and the re-opening of that years' early wood cells.|$|R

5|$|The work paid well, and {{attracted}} many navvies to the area. Initial wages were 3.20 kroner per day, though this later was reduced. Two {{and a half}} thousand men were employed, with fewer jobs being offered than there were applicants. Land owners were compensated 50–200 kroner per hectare (NOK 20–80 <b>per</b> <b>acre)</b> for cultivated land, and 10 kroner per hectare (NOK 4 <b>per</b> <b>acre)</b> for forest. Many local farmers made good money offering transport of cargo for the construction, as well as renting out annexes for navvies; others made money as traders. As with all such construction areas, many legal and illegal pubs and brothels were established. After construction was completed, some moved on, while others settled in the area; many of these received jobs with the railway company.|$|E
50|$|The Donation Land Claim Act allowed {{settlers}} {{to claim}} {{land in the}} Oregon Territory, then including the modern states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and parts of Wyoming.

5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up {{a significant percentage of}} the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels <b>per</b> <b>acre</b> in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E
5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in woodland, the common {{blackbird}} has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs <b>per</b> <b>acre),</b> with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E

5|$|Although {{reproduction}} occurs {{around the}} year, {{there is a}} peak during the summer (November to April). Molting mostly occurs during autumn and winter (April to August). At one locality in Mendoza, Akodon spegazzinii occurs at an estimated density of 21 individuals per hectare (8.5 <b>per</b> <b>acre)</b> and has a home range size of about 300 m2 (3200sqft). A number of sigmodontines have been recorded as occurring with A.spegazzinii, including A.caenosus, A.simulator, Neotomys ebriosus, Abrothrix illuteus, Reithrodon auritus, Andinomys edax, and various species of Eligmodontia, Necromys, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Oxymycterus, and Phyllotis. The tick Ixodes sigelos has been recorded on A.spegazzinii in Tucumán. In addition, the mites Androlaelaps fahrenholzi, Androlaelaps rotundus, and Eulaelaps stabularis and the flea Cleopsylla townsendii are known from the species.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 <b>per</b> <b>acre).</b> It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E
5|$|Present-day Erie is {{situated}} in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a triangle of land claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut (as part of its Western Reserve), and Massachusetts. It officially became part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York relinquished their claims to the federal government, which in turn sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75cents <b>per</b> <b>acre</b> or a total of $151,640.25 in Continental currency. The Iroquois released the land to Pennsylvania in January 1789 for payments of $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government.
