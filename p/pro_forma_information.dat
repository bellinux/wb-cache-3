40|$|This paper {{provides}} evidence {{bearing on}} the controversial debates about pro forma earnings information in the literatures. Pro forma earnings exclude normal income statement items that managers deem to be nonrecurring or non-representative of ongoing operations. Some studies identify <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>information</b> as managerial attempts to disclose {{a clearer picture of}} core earnings, while others regard them as attempts to mislead investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has established Regulation G (Reg. G), which requires companies to quantitatively reconcile pro forma earnings with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings. By investigating analysts, we extend prior research by conducting a complete examination of the association between <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>information</b> and forecast revisions. We find that analysts use pro forma earnings to revise their forecasting earnings, especially after the implementation of Reg. G. In addition, our results strongly hold for those pro forma press releases which contain directly comparable reconciliation of the GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings numbers. Finally, we find that pro forma press releases from high-tech firms are more convincing to analysts than those of non-high-tech firms. We thus show that analysts appear to use pro forma earnings information in their forecasting revisions, and that Regulation G enhances the quality of pro forma earnings reporting...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, many {{companies}} have emphasized adjusted‐GAAP earnings numbers in their quarterly press releases. While managers use different names to describe these nonstandard earnings metrics, the financial press frequently refers {{to them as}} “pro forma” earnings. Managers and other advocates of pro forma reporting argue that these disclosures provide {{a clearer picture of}} companies 2 ̆ 7 core earnings. On the other hand, regulators, policymakers, and the financial press often allege that managers 2 ̆ 7 pro forma earnings disclosures are opportunistic attempts to mislead investors. Recent evidence suggests that while many pro forma earnings disclosures are altruistically motivated, some may represent managers 2 ̆ 7 attempts to portray overly optimistic financial performance. If this is the case, then less wealthy, less sophisticated, individual investors are arguably the most at risk of being misled. Consequently, this study investigates who trades on pro forma earnings information. Our intraday investigation of transactions around earnings announcements containing pro forma earnings information reveals that less sophisticated investors 2 ̆ 7 announcement‐period abnormal trading is significantly positively associated with the magnitude and direction of the earnings surprise based on pro forma earnings. In contrast, we find no association between sophisticated investors 2 ̆ 7 trading and manager‐reported <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>information.</b> Overall, our analyses and numerous robustness tests suggest that the segment of the market that relies on pro forma earnings information is populated predominantly by less sophisticated individual investors. This evidence is particularly relevant to standard‐setters and regulators given that Section 401 (b) of the Sarbanes‐Oxley Act of 2002 and subsequent SEC regulations are specifically designed to protect ordinary investors from misleading <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>information...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigates the}} {{usefulness}} of spin-off historical and pro forma financial statements on the market’s ability to predict the firm’s future earnings. This study evaluates the spin-off historical and pro forma financial statements required for a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation (Form 10 - 12 (b). The study evaluates the question Are spin-off financial statements that reflect the firm’s adoption of the accounting required for the regulation (SEC form 10 - 12 (b)) predictive of future earnings and thus useful? According to Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8 (SFAC 8), the objective of general purpose financial reporting is that financial statements are useful to investors in making decisions about providing resources to the firm. Financial information is capable of {{making a difference in}} decisions if they have predictive value, confirmatory value or both. This is a quantitative, positivist, empirical archival study of final SEC Forms 10 - 12 (b) for spin-off firms filed for listing on a public exchange of either NYSE or NASDAQ from the period of 2000 to 2014. The study evaluates if spin-off financial statements (historical and pro forma) are predictive, confirmatory or both. This study compares the performance of these companies to their peer group to assess if the results of this population are significantly different from the performance of the peer group in predicting future earnings. There were large variances between the historical, pro forma and Year 1 key financial statement elements. Variances ranged between 4 % to over 500 %. The difference in means in the population were significant between historical and pro forma net income as well as the change in shareholders equity and between historical and Year 1 shareholders’ equity. There was {{a significant difference in the}} leverage metric between historical leverage ratio and Year 1 ’s leverage ratio of the firms. The study found that the peer financial metrics were predictive of future earnings but the historical spin statements are not as predictive as their peer group. There was a significant difference in the predictability between the peer group and the historical spin metrics. The research supports {{the usefulness of}} the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>information.</b> The research does not appear to support the usefulness of the historical information. Thus, the study provides the first empirical evidence that spin-off financial statements provide less information to the market. This is a new approach to study the application of accounting standards...|$|E
40|$|Research on <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> {{earnings}} disclosure {{usually does}} {{not distinguish between}} different types of <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings. However, non-GAAP earnings and earnings-before (EB) metrics such as the EBIT fit the conventional perception of <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings but offer varying degrees of flexibility to management in pursuing strategic reporting motives. This study {{presents the results of}} an experiment that builds upon Maines and McDaniel’s (Account Rev 75 (2) : 179 – 207, 2000) framework and analyzes if variations in the use and combination of <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings <b>information</b> affect whether nonprofessional investors acquire (<b>pro</b> <b>forma)</b> earnings <b>information,</b> and how this information is evaluated, and weighted when making investment-related judgments. Our results indicate that a “pure” non-GAAP disclosure increases investors’ evaluation of a company’s earnings performance compared to all other reporting strategies. However, we also find that nonprofessional investors consider non-GAAP information strategically motivated and thus weight it less heavily in arriving at investment-related judgments. Overall, we find that investors’ judgments (i. e., the overall favorability of the earnings announcement and the company’s attractiveness as an investment) are highest when the earnings press release contains the non-GAAP earnings and the EB measure. This has important implications for behavioral accounting theory as well as corporate practice and policy-making...|$|R
40|$|This study extends prior {{research}} {{by examining the}} extent to which financial reporting knowledge and information viewing behavior affect the influence of reconciled non-GAAP, or “pro forma” earnings disclosures on nonprofessional investors’ judgments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experiment that examines {{the effect of}} <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings disclosures on the judgments of analysts (i. e., more sophisticated investors) and nonprofessional (i. e., less sophisticated) investors. In the experiment, participants developed stock price assessments after reviewing background financial information and a current earnings announcement for a company. The earnings announcement was manipulated to report only GAAP earnings in one condition and both <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> and GAAP earnings in the other condition. Consistent with empirical evidence, the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings in our experiment exceeded GAAP earnings. The results indicate that nonprofessional investors who received an earnings announcement that contained both <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> and GAAP disclosures assessed a higher stock price than did nonprofessionals who received an announcement containing only GAAP disclosures. Financial analysts' stock price judgments were not affected by the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> disclosures. Followup analyses suggest that analysts and nonprofessional investors used different valuation models and information processing. Analysts used well-defined valuation models, based on either earnings-multiples or cash flows, while the nonprofessional investors {{were more likely to}} use simpler, heuristic-based valuation models. The <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> disclosure did not cause nonprofessional investors to assess a higher earnings number for determining a stock price, but rather caused nonprofessionals to perceive the earnings announcement as more favorable, which in turn caused them to convert earnings or some other performance metric into a higher stock price. This effect appears to be due to unintentional cognitive effects, rather than nonprofessionals relying on <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings <b>information</b> because they perceived it to be informative...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{two studies}} on the value relevance and perceived credibility of <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings. In the first study, I investigate the value relevance of <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings relative to two alternative earnings measures – GAAP earnings and analysts’ actual earnings. Value relevance is assessed using two approaches. The first approach examines whether the market’s expectations (contemporaneous returns or price) is best reflected in future <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings, future GAAP earnings, or future analyst’s actual earnings. The second approach is to determine through pair-wise comparisons of the three earnings measures (e. g., <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings versus GAAP earnings), which has the greatest explanatory power (comparing adjusted R 2 s) in explaining price and returns. Across approaches and models, {{each of the three}} earnings measures tends to be value relevant. However, <b>Pro</b> <b>forma</b> is consistently the most value relevant, followed by analysts’ actuals, with GAAP earnings having the least value relevance. That is, <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings have the greatest information content. This finding is consistent with managers, in aggregate, using <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> to inform rather than to manage expectations or to mislead. In the second study, I examine the impact of credibility attributes – board characteristics, auditor quality and overall information quality – on the value relevance of <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings. It is hypothesized that the credibility attributes will have a statistically significant impact on investors’ reaction to <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings. Consistent with the predictions, I find that stronger board characteristics, higher auditor quality and higher overall information quality are positively associated with higher market reaction to the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> announcement. That is, credibility attributes increase the value relevance of <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings. This finding is consistent with some firms providing <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings that are perceived to be credible and others providing <b>pro</b> <b>formas</b> that are perceived as less credible and possibly provided to manage expectations or to mislead...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pro</b> <b>forma</b> is {{originated}} from Latin. It contains different meaning {{depends on which}} discipline it is used.

40|$|Insights on how ordinary, less-sophisticated investors {{interpret}} and process management-issued <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings numbers are useful to regulators {{because of concerns}} that <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> disclosures are misleading to ordinary investors. Two recent experimental studies [Frederickson, J. R., 2 ̆ 6 Miller, J. S. (2004). The effects of <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> earnings disclosures on analysts’ and nonprofessional investors’ equity valuation judgments. The Accounting Review, 79 (3), 667 – 686; Elliott, W. B. (2006). Are investors influenced by <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> emphasis and reconciliations in earnings announcements?

Experimental and archival methodologies complement one another and results that persist in both settings are likely to be robust to both internal and external validity concerns. Therefore, we complement experimental evidence using trade-size-based proxies constructed from intraday transactions data to distinguish the trading activities of less-sophisticated investors from more-sophisticated investors. Our results suggest that less-sophisticated investors rely significantly more on quarterly earnings press releases that include a <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> number than on those that do not, while more-sophisticated investors exhibit the opposite behavior. This result is consistent with Frederickson and Miller’s experimental evidence. Further, consistent with Elliott’s results, we find that less-sophisticated investors rely more on the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> figure when it is placed before the GAAP earnings number in the press release, while more-sophisticated investors’ trading behavior is unaffected by the relative placement of the two earnings metrics. We conclude that the existence of a <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> number as well as its strategic placement in the press release generally affect the judgments of less-sophisticated (but not more-sophisticated) investors and these inferences are robust because they persist in both experimental and archival settings...|$|R
