5000|$|UV coats, {{and other}} {{coatings}} such as aqueous coatings {{are used to}} speed manufacturing of the cards. Cards that are not dry will [...] "offset", i.e., the ink {{from the front of}} one card will mark up back of the next one. UV coatings are generally highly glossy but are more likely to fingerprint, while aqueous coatings are not noticeable but increase the life of the card. It is possible to use a dull aqueous coating on uncoated stock and get some very durable uncoated cards, and using UV coating or <b>plastic</b> <b>lamination</b> can also be applied to thicken thin stocked cards and make them more durable as well.|$|E

40|$|We {{report for}} the first time a highly {{sensitive}} paper based tactile sensor using laminated graphite drawn on paper. Thanks to the high gauge factor of 26. 2, as well as its excellent robustness and humidity-resistance, plastic laminated graphite-on-paper has a high potential for mechanical sensors. Additionally, the <b>plastic</b> <b>lamination</b> combined with the laser cutting technique proposed in this study would enable the mass production of cleanroom-free fabrication and low-cost MEMS devices.

5000|$|Plastic {{coatings}} or layers {{usually make}} paper recycling more difficult. Some <b>plastic</b> <b>laminations</b> can {{be separated from}} the during the paper recycling process, allowing filtering out the film. [...] If the coated paper is shredded prior to recycling, the degree of separation depends on the particular process. Some plastic coatings are water dispersible to aid recycling and repulping. Special recycling processes are available to help separate plastics. [...] Some plastic coated papers are incinerated for heat or landfilled rather than recycled.|$|R
30|$|Photopolymer jetting (PolyJet) is {{the method}} of inkjet {{technology}} combined with photopolymer resin technology that liquid-type photopolymer resin jetted through the nozzle is added layer by layer on the forming plate, and hardened by UV laser. A precise model {{can be made by}} very thin layers added (Noh and Lee 2016; Hyun 2015). Digital light processing (DLP) is {{the method of}} printing that photopolymer resin is evenly applied to the bed floor, and the image is shot by projection beam and then hardened, and another layer is added. This method is used in a variety of fields of modeling, architecture, figure, jewelry, and dental care (Noh and Lee 2016). In addition, various types of 3 D printing methods are utilized in diverse fields (e.g., direct metal printing, laminated object manufacturing, <b>plastic</b> sheet <b>lamination)</b> (Noh and Lee 2016; Shin 2015).|$|R
40|$|A paper-based laboratory-on-a-chip assay for {{the rapid}} {{detection}} {{of a highly}} pathogenic strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) was developed for the first time. The single-unit chip was simply fabricated using Whatman filter paper and <b>plastic</b> <b>lamination.</b> The chip measured 2. 5 3. 0 cm 2 and was divided into two parts, one for nucleic acid amplification {{and the other for}} signal detection. The HP-PRRSV assay was performed by specific ORF I Nsp 2 gene amplification via an isothermal reverse transcription loop-mediated DNA amplification platform, whereas the cDNA signal detection was performed by visual observation of colorimetric changes in blue silver nanoplates (AgNPls). Positive results caused non-aggregation of the blue AgNPls on the detection pad, whereas negative results induced colorimetric changes in the AgNPls from blue to colourless on the pad. The assay had a limit of detection of 100 copies of the target Nsp 2 gene and high specificity for other types of infectious viruses. The assay required only one hour to complete. This work demonstrates a simple and rapid assay for viruses using a simple, low-cost, paper-based chip...|$|E

40|$|Glass cannot {{compete with}} steel {{in terms of}} {{strength}} or durability, but it is the only structural material that offers the highly sought after qualities of translucency and transparency. The use of glass has evolved from purely decorative or architectural to structural, encouraging glass technologies to advance concurrently with increased demand. As a result, contemporary methods used to produce structural glass provide excellent strength characteristics, particularly after treatments including annealing, tempering, and heat-strengthening, which reduce its vulnerability to cracking and sudden brittle failure. Its modulus of elasticity is roughly equal to that of aluminum-greater than both wood and concrete-but doesn't allow any <b>plastic</b> deformation. <b>Lamination</b> dramatically improves both the strength and durability of glass by joining strengthened layers of glass using resin or a polyvinyl butyral foil. No comprehensive design code is currently available to aid in the design of structural glass members. The behavior of glass is examined through a variety of structural applications including beams, columns, walls, roofs and floors, and domes. Case studies are explored to underscore the technical principles discussed for each structural glass element utilized in place of more traditional building materials. by Katherine K. Leitch.
