40|$|The Geotechnics Division of the Flemish Government uses {{fiber optics}} in civil constructions to measure strains and {{temperature}} during construction. In {{the summer of}} 2016 {{the construction of a}} tunnel under an existing road started. In a first <b>phase</b> <b>diaphragm</b> walls were constructed. Those walls will keep the tunnel open during excavation and will function as the future walls of the tunnel. For safety reasons the deformation and stability of these walls are closely monitored. During construction of the diaphragm walls, fiber optics were attached to the reinforcement cage. The fiber optics runs on both sides along the complete depth of the wall. This emplacement allows to monitor the vertical strain and temperature changes during the different construction phases. An inclinometer tube is placed in the diaphragm wall {{in the vicinity of the}} fiber optics. This allows the researchers of the Geotechnics Division and the KU Leuven Technology Campus Ostend to closely monitor both the forces in the wall and the horizontal displacement of the wall. When these exceed the allowable limits, corrective actions can be undertaken. This paper presents both the practical aspects of installation and some preliminary results. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTumor motion {{caused by}} {{respiration}} {{is an important}} issue in image-guided radiotherapy. A 2 D/ 4 D matching method between 4 D volumes derived from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and 2 D fluoroscopic images was implemented to track the tumor motion without the use of implanted markers. In this method, firstly, 3 DCBCT and phase-rebinned 4 DCBCT are reconstructed from cone beam acquisition. Secondly, 4 DCBCT volumes and a streak-free 3 DCBCT volume are combined to improve the image quality of the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Finally, the 2 D/ 4 D matching problem is converted into a 2 D/ 2 D matching between incoming projections and DRR images from each phase of the 4 DCBCT. The diaphragm is used as a target surrogate for matching instead of using the tumor position directly. This relies on the assumption that if a patient has the same breathing <b>phase</b> and <b>diaphragm</b> position as the reference 4 DCBCT, then the tumor position is the same. From the matching results, the <b>phase</b> information, <b>diaphragm</b> position and tumor position at the time of each incoming projection acquisition can be derived. The accuracy of this method was verified using 16 candidate datasets, representing lung and liver applications and one-minute and two-minute acquisitions. The criteria for the eligibility of datasets were described: 11 eligible datasets were selected to verify the accuracy of diaphragm tracking, and one eligible dataset was chosen to verify the accuracy of tumor tracking. The diaphragm matching accuracy was 1. 88 ± 1. 35 mm in the isocenter plane and the 2 D tumor tracking accuracy was 2. 13 ± 1. 26 mm in the isocenter plane. These features make this method feasible for real-time marker-free tumor motion tracking purposes...|$|R
40|$|A general {{procedure}} was laid down for estimating precise molecular weights by ultracentrifugation equilibrium using schlieren optical system. The <b>phase</b> plate <b>diaphragm</b> was checked against the knife {{edge of the}} schlieren optical system, and {{it was observed that}} the results using both the diaphragms are quite similar. The temperature indicating and control system of the MSE ultracentrifuge was also checked by running sedimentation velocity experiments at a wide range of temperatures, and {{it was found that the}} results of such experiments on s 20,w are consistent, and are independent of temperature to the range studied. When similar experiments were performed on the Beckman Model E, the results were temperaure dependent. The new methods (Rowe and Rowe Method II and III) yielded excellent results. The method II provides satisfactory results for ideal systems using presmoothed data of concentration or concentration gradient as a function of distance from the axis of rotation. The method III provides acceptable results of Mo from data of a single sedimentation equilibrium experiment for both ideal and non-ideal systems. For both the methods to work it is essential to smooth the data with the help of fourier series, which is devised by incorporating it in the programs used by the digital computer. Procedures were also developed to determine Mo values by using hand smoothed data (instead of fourier smoothed data) with the desk computer. these procedures have made it possible to get comparable results of MO from a single photograph taken at equilibrium with any optical system without the cost of digital computer. Finally it is concluded that the new methods can be used for the estimation of precise values of molecular weights from a data of single experiment obtained by using any optical system...|$|R
40|$|Purpose] We {{investigated}} {{the correlation between}} diaphragm motion evaluated using fluoroscopy and a respiratory monitoring device(Abches: APEX Medical, Inc, Tokyo), which comprised two arms for measuring changes in the levels of the chest and abdominal walls. [Method] Fluoroscopic abdominal sequences(512 × 512 matrix, 5. 36 f/s) during normal and forced breathing were taken from five healthy men aged 22 - 23 years. Simultaneously, a video of the respiratory indicator(Abches) was recorded(720 × 480 matrix, 30 f/s). Diaphragm positions in the fluoroscopic sequences were measured and the indicator values were read from the videos. [Result] During normal respiration there was a linear relationship between the indicator values and diaphragm positions measured using fluoroscopy. The coefficients of correlation ranged from 0. 958 to 0. 985. During forced respiration the correlation of these values was quadric(r= 0. 919 to 0. 996). Hysteresis {{in the relationship between}} these motions was observed in two of the five cases. [Conclusion] In normal breathing, we found that the correlation between fluoroscopic and respiratory indicator measurements had linearity. In forced breathing, the correlation was quadric, and <b>phase</b> shifting between <b>diaphragm</b> motion and respiratory indicator measurements was observed in two of the five cases...|$|R
40|$|Multi-girder steel bridges {{are found}} {{as part of}} the {{transportation}} infrastructure of countries throughout the world. These bridges are typically constructed with a steel reinforced concrete deck rigidly attached to the top flange of steel girders. The deck and the transverse steel members distribute loads laterally between bridge girders. The weld connecting transverse stiffeners to the girder web are commonly terminated several inches away from the girder flanges to avoid overlapping with the web-to-flange connection weld, leaving a short, unstiffened portion of the girder web [...] the web gap. The large flexibility of the web gap region relative to the other components forces it to accommodate the majority of the distortion. Since 1998, several research efforts have investigated methods for predicting the amount of web gap stress a bridge will experience during its service life. Phase I of this research resulted in a simple equation for estimating web gap stress using data collected during field testing and subsequent finite modeling of a skew supported bridge with staggering bent-plate <b>diaphragms.</b> <b>Phase</b> II produced an approximate method for predicting diaphragm differential deflection of skew supported bridges with bent-plate diaphragms. The combined result of Phase I and Phase II was a useful method for predicting peak web gap stress in skewed multi-girder steel bridges with staggered bent-plate diaphragms. The next step was to develop a reliable procedure for the rapid assessment of distortional stresses in steel bridges that includes a test of the applicability of this procedure to bridges with geometries differing from those that formed the basis of the previous research. As a consequence of this most current research, the authors propose changes and recommend modifications of previously developed methods of field measurement and assessment.

40|$|In {{vertebrate}} skeletal muscles, {{the type}} 1 isoform of ryanodine receptor (RyR 1) {{is essential in}} triggering contraction by releasing Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to plasma membrane depolarisation. Recently, the presence of another RyR isoform, RyR 3, has been detected in mammalian skeletal muscle cells, raising {{the question of the}} eventual relevance of RyR 3 for muscle cell physiology. The expression of RyR 3 was investigated during differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. Using antibodies able to distinguish the different RyR isoforms and Western blot analysis, the RyR 3 protein was detected in the microsomal fractions of differentiated skeletal muscle cells but not of undifferentiated cells. Accordingly, blocking muscle differentiation by the addition of either transforming growth factor-beta or basic fibroblast growth factor prevented the expression of the RyR 3 protein. In differentiated skeletal muscle cells, RyR 3 was expressed independent of cell fusion and myotube formation. The expression of RyR 3 was also investigated during development of the diaphragm muscle. The RyR 3 content in the diaphragm muscle increased between the late stage of fetal development and the first postnatal days. However, at variance with RyR 1, which reached maximum levels of expression 2 - 3 weeks after birth, the expression of RyR 3 was found to be higher in the neonatal <b>phase</b> of the <b>diaphragm</b> muscle development (2 - 15 days after birth) than in the same muscle from adult mice. The differential content of RyR 3 in adult skeletal muscles was found not to be mediated by neurotrophic factors or electrical activity. These findings indicate that RyR 3 is preferentially expressed in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. In addition, during skeletal muscle development, its expression is regulated differently from that of RyR 1...|$|R
40|$|Currently in our clinic, a mega-voltage cone beam {{computed}} tomography (MVCBCT) scan is performed before each treatment for patient localization. For {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients, a strain gauge {{is used as}} an external surrogate to indicate tumor motion in both the planning stage and the treatment stage. However, {{it is likely that the}} amplitude of tumor motion varies between treatment fractions without a corresponding change in the surrogate signal. Motion amplitude larger than what was planned may underdose the tumor and overexpose normal tissues. The overall objective of this project is to extend the capabilities of MVCBCT for respiratory motion management by taking advantage of 2 D projection images. First, a new method was developed to detect ipsi-lateral hemi-diaphragm apex (IHDA) motion along superior-inferior (SI) direction in 3 D. Then a respiratory correlated reconstruction method was implemented and verified. This method is able to create MVCBCT volume in the full exhale (FE) and the full inhale (FI) <b>phases,</b> respectively. The <b>diaphragm</b> to tumor motion ratio (DTMR) was derived by quantifying the absolute position of the tumor and IHDA in these two volumes. The DTMR and the extracted IHDA motion were further used to calibrate the strain gauge signal. Second, an organ motion detection approach was developed, in which the detection is converted into an optimal interrelated surface detection problem. The framework was first applied to tumor motion extraction, which enables accurate detection for large tumors (with a diameter not smaller than 1. 9 cm). The framework was then applied to lung motion extraction and the extracted lung motion model was used to create a series of displacement vector fields for a motion compensated (MC) reconstruction. The accuracy of both tumor extraction and the MC approach was validated, which shows their clinical feasibility. Last but not least, a novel enhancement framework was developed. The aim of this approach is to eliminate the overlapping tissues and organs in the CBCT projection images. Though scattering and noise is the major problem, the proposed method is able to achieve enhanced projection images with a higher contrast to noise ratio (CNR) without compromising detection accuracy on tumors and IHDA...|$|R
