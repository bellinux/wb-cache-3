40|$|Rapid <b>permanent</b> <b>setting</b> of wool fabrics by {{conductive}} heat transfer Keith R Millington High levels (50 – 70 %) of <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> were obtained when wet pure wool fabric was heated rapidly to 110 – 130 C {{for up to}} 1 minute under conditions that limit the evaporation of water. If the final regain of the fabric after treatment was less than 34 %, lower levels of <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> were generally observed. If the initial regain was less than 34 %, <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> levels were invariably < 20 % and the specimens were usually damaged by scorching due to the low heat capacity and poor thermal conductivity of wool compared with water. This result precludes {{the use of a}} rapid chemical-free per-manent setting process based on {{conductive heat}} transfer at the dry finishing stage. Under more severe conditions (higher temperatures or longer pressing times) significant shrinkage, yellowing and fabric damage due to supercontrac-tion were observed. The high level of <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> obtained in this study suggests that the performance of continuous crabbing machines could be improved by optimizing the treatment conditions without the need for chemical setting agents...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} average layered {{silicate}} particle size on the mechanical properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanocomposites has been investigated. At fixed addition levels (3 wt% organosilicate), {{an increase in}} average particle size resulted {{in an increase in}} stiffness. Negligible stiffening was observed for the smallest particles (30 nm) due to reduced long-range intercalation and molecular confinement, as well as ineffective stress transfer from matrix to filler. At low strain (<= 100 %), an increase in filler particle size was associated with an increase in the rate of stress relaxation, tensile hysteresis, and <b>permanent</b> <b>set.</b> At high strain (1200 %), two coexisting relaxation processes were observed. The rate of the slower (long-term) relaxation process, which is believed to primarily involve the hard segment rich structures, decreased on addition of particles with an average diameter of 200 nm or less. At high strain the tensile hysteresis was less sensitive to particle size, however the addition of particles with an average size of 200 nm or more caused a significant increase in <b>permanent</b> <b>set.</b> This was attributed to slippage of temporary bonds at the polymer-filler interface, and to the formation of voids at the sites of unaligned tactoids. Relative to the host TPU, the addition of particles with an average size of 30 nm caused a reduction in <b>permanent</b> <b>set.</b> This is a significant result because the addition of fillers to elastomers has long been associated with an increase in hysteresis and <b>permanent</b> <b>set.</b> At high strain, well dispersed and aligned layered silicates with relatively small interparticle distances and favourable surface interactions are capable of imparting a resistance to molecular slippage throughout the TPU matrix. © 2007, Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A {{test program}} was {{undertaken}} {{to demonstrate the}} ability of elastic-plastic finite element methods to predict dynamic inelastic response for simple structural members. Cantilever and fixed-beam specimens were tested to levels that produced plastic straining {{in the range of}} 2. 0 % and to 3. 0 % and <b>permanent</b> <b>sets.</b> Acceleration, strain, and displacement data were recorded for use in analytical correlation. Correlation analyses were performed using the ABAQUS finite element code. Results of the correlation show that current elastic-plastic analysis techniques accurately capture dynamic inelastic response (displacement, acceleration) due to rapidly applied dynamic loading. Peak elastic and inelastic surface strains are accurately predicted. To accurately capture inelastic straining near connections, a solid model, including fillet welds, is necessary. The hardening models currently available in the ABAQUS code (isotropic, kinematic) do not accurately capture inelastic strain reversals caused by specimen rebound. Analyses performed consistently underpredicted the peak strain level of the first inelastic reversal and the rebound deflection and overpredicted the <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> of structures experiencing inelastic rebound. Based on these findings, an improved hardening model is being implemented in the ABAQUS code by the developers. The intent of this model upgrade is to improve the ability of the program to capture inelastic strain reversals and to predict <b>permanent</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Rapidly applied {{transient}} {{dynamic loads}} produce stresses and deflections in structures that typically exceed those from static loading conditions. Previous acceptance criteria for structures designed for rapidly applied transient dynamic loading limited stresses to those determined from elastic analysis. Different stress limits were established for different grades of structure {{depending upon the}} amount of <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> considered acceptable. Structure allowed to sustain very limited <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> is designed to stress limits not significantly greater than yield stress. Greater <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> in structure under rapidly applied transient dynamic loading conditions is permitted by establishing stress limits that are significantly greater than yield stress but still provide adequate safety margin (with respect to failure). This paper presents a strain-based elastic-plastic (i. e., inelastic) analysis criterion developed {{as an alternative to}} the more conservative stress-based elastic analysis stress criterion for structures subjected to rapidly applied transient dynamic loading. The strain limits established are based on a fraction of the strain at ultimate stress obtained from an engineering stress/strain curve of the material. Strains limits are categorized by type as membrane or surface and by region as general, local, or concentrated. The application of the elastic-plastic criterion provides a more accurate, less conservative design/analysis basis for structures than that used in elastic stress-based analysis criteria, while still providing adequate safety margins...|$|R
