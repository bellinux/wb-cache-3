Several of the songs shared an environmental theme. [...] "Hook the Monster" [...] was about fishing, [...] "12 Gauge" [...] was inspired by hunting, {{and the impact of}} land development in the swamps of Finland was the subject of [...] "Swampwar". Commenting further on the swamps, Pekka remarked, [...] " [...] valuable areas are a part of our northern wilderness and [...] always threatened to be ditched or drained. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in those areas [...] as a source of energy." ...|$|E
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E

Sakamoto also denied Dreads connection with the Nintendo 3DS game [...] (2017), and stated that Samus Returns is a remake of [...] (1991) and not {{something to do with}} Dread. GamesTM asked Sakamoto whether Dread ever existed; Sakamoto confirmed its existence but stated that if the staff went back to it, they would [...] "start from scratch." [...] Sakamoto also stated that they were [...] "waiting and watching and reading the comments to see what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in before we make any comment on the project." [...] According to Sakamoto, questions about Metroid Dread were popular, especially in interviews following E3. In May 2010, Craig Harris confirmed that the story for Metroid Dread was fully written and that he had seen it. He claimed that Nintendo was able to [...] "bring it back at any time." [...] Metroid Dread is the only game on the internal software list that has not yet been released.|$|E

500|$|William Warren Bartley, III, {{professor}} of philosophy at California State University, prior to writing his biography on Erhard, had authored The Retreat to Commitment, on the epistemology of Sir Karl Popper; Wittgenstein, a biography of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein; edited Lewis Carroll's Symbolic Logic; and authored a book titled, Morality and Religion. Bartley was first introduced to and referred to est in March 1972 by a doctor whom he had consulted about his nine-year struggle with insomnia. As {{a result of his}} experience in the est training his insomnia was cured. [...] He then became very involved in the est organization, and served for several years as the company's philosophical consultant. He received payments of over US$30,000 in this capacity during the two years he spent writing the book. He also served on the [...] "Advisory Board" [...] of est. Bartley interviewed a number of individuals who were involved in his subject's life and made use of quotations from a wide array of sources. Bartley commented on his subject in an article on the book in The Evening Independent, stating: [...] "He's not a huckster, although he's a great salesman. I think he's a very good man, a very important man. ... He's a fascinating man. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in him." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release {{party at}} New York City's Industria Superstudio, and signed all the invitations under her Sex alter ego [...] "Dita". During the party, Madonna showed up dressed as Little Bo Peep and even carried {{with her a}} stuffed toy lamb. Madonna's {{publicist}} Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to [...] "what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking" [...] but later said that it [...] "all depends on your idea of lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give {{new meaning to the}} word erotic". Both Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble prepared corporate statements that the managers could share with customers who are offended by Sex. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide [...] "diversity and choice" [...] to customers and say censorship is not the role of bookstores.) Many book stores, too, stated that the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 {{and that it would be}} for display only behind the cash register. Bookstore owner David Epstein stated that [...] "The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art, , they're not the kind of people who are buying it because it's smut and dirty pictures. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in it as art." ...|$|E

6000|$|When it is {{admitted}} that classes are not things, the question arises: What do {{we mean by}} statements which are nominally about classes? Take such a statement as, [...] "The class of people interested in mathematical logic is not very numerous." [...] Obviously this reduces itself to, [...] "Not very many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in mathematical logic." [...] For the sake of definiteness, let us substitute some particular number, say 3, for [...] "very many." [...] Then our statement is, [...] "Not three <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in mathematical logic." [...] This may be expressed in the form: [...] "If x is interested in mathematical logic, and also y is interested, and also z is interested, then x is identical with y, or x is identical with z, or y is identical with z." [...] Here {{there is no longer}} any reference at all to a [...] "class." [...] In some such way, all statements nominally about a class can be reduced to statements about what follows from the hypothesis of anything's having the defining property of the class. All that is wanted, therefore, in order to render the verbal use of classes legitimate, is a uniform method of interpreting propositions in which such a use occurs, so as to obtain propositions in which {{there is no longer any}} such use. The definition of such a method is a technical matter, which Dr Whitehead and I have dealt with elsewhere, and which we need not enter into on this occasion.[54] ...|$|E
6000|$|The further {{we go back}} in {{the history}} of {{literary}} forgeries, the more (as is natural) do we find them to be of a pious or priestly character. When the clergy alone can write, only the clergy can forge. In such ages <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> chiefly in prophecies and warnings, or, if they are careful about literature, it is only when literature contains some kind of title-deeds. Thus Solon is said to have forged a line in the Homeric catalogue of the ships for the purpose of proving that Salamis belonged to Athens. But the great antique forger, the [...] "Ionian father of the rest," [...] is, doubtless, Onomacritus. There exists, to be sure, an Egyptian inscription professing to be of the fourth, but probably of the twenty-sixth, dynasty. The Germans hold the latter view; the French, from patriotic motives, maintain the opposite opinion. But this forgery is scarcely [...] "literary." ...|$|E

While holding an {{institute}} at Marcelline, Illinois, 96 attendees decided that they wished to be baptized into the faith. Sadie, at first reluctantly, continued to preach after this impressive response. As Sechler writes, [...] "At the Marceline Institute {{she was asked to}} go on with a meeting since so many young <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested.</b> She told them she could not as her sermons were used and she had no more ready. The old Elder there told her that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> who had never <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> before, and that if she left their blood would be on her soul.

The modest man, tolerably far gone with beer and other matters, enters a saloon (twenty-five cents is the price for anything and everything, and specie the only money used) and lays down a half dollar; calls for whiskey and drinks it; the bar-keeper makes change and lays the quarter in a wet place on the counter; the modest man fumbles at it with nerveless fingers, but it slips and the water holds it; he contemplates it, and tries again; same result; observes that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in what he is at, blushes; fumbles at the quarter again--blushes--puts his forefinger carefully, slowly down, to make sure of his aim--pushes the coin toward the bar-keeper, and says with a sigh: ...|$|E
60|$|The arts have failed; fewer <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in {{them every}} generation. The mere {{business}} of living, of making money, of amusing oneself, occupies people more and more, {{and makes them}} less and less capable of the difficult art of appreciation. When they buy a picture it generally shows a long-current idea, or some conventional form that can be admired in that lax mood one admires a fine carriage in or fine horses in; and when they buy a book {{it is so much}} in the manner of the picture that it is forgotten, when its moment is over, as a glass of wine is forgotten. We who care deeply about the arts find ourselves the priesthood of an almost forgotten faith, and we must, I think, if we would win the people again, take upon ourselves the method and the fervour of a priesthood. We must be half humble and half proud. We see the perfect more than others, it may be, but we must find the passions among the people. We must baptize as well as preach.|$|E
