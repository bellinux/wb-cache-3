40|$|A factor {{present in}} rat liver {{supernatant}} catalyzes binding of Phe-tRNA to 40 S ribosomal subunits from rat skeletal muscle. This factor could {{be distinguished from}} aminoacyltransferase I {{by a number of}} criteria: (1) at lower concentrations of magnesium (5 mM) the 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> factor was approximately seven times as effective as T-I in catalyzing binding of Phe-tRNA to 40 S subunits; (2) the kinetics of the binding reaction were different when catalyzed by the 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> factor, in particular the initial rate was greater than in the presence of T-I—indeed, the kinetics of the T-I catalyzed reaction resembled nonenzymic binding; (3) GTP was required for maximal binding of Phe-tRNA to 40 S subunits {{in the presence of the}} 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> factor, but not for the T-I catalyzed reaction; (4) the 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> factor was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide whereas T-I was not; (5) finally, the 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> factor was more susceptible to heat inactivation. Binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to 40 S ribosomal subunits may be a paradigm for the initiation of protein synthesis, and the 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> factor may play a role in the process...|$|R

We find that the O 1 <b>s</b> <b>binding</b> energy of an oxygen adatom increases near linearly with its adsorption energy due to the ionic nature of the Ag/O interaction. Thus, contrary to widespread assignments, a weakly bound oxygen adatom does not account for the electrophilic species with an O 1 <b>s</b> <b>binding</b> energy of 530 eV that is thought to be active in ethylene epoxidation. Instead, we show that the only species with O 1 <b>s</b> <b>binding</b> energies near 530 eV are covalently bound, which we find in our calculations, for example, when hydrogen or carbon are present...|$|R

40|$|In {{membranes}} of rat olfactory bulb, a brain {{region in}} which muscarinic agonists increase cyclic AMP formation, the muscarinic stimulation of guanosine 5 '-O-(3 -[35 S]thiotriphosphate) ([35 S]GTP gamma <b>S)</b> <b>binding</b> {{was used as}} a tool to investigate the receptor interaction with the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). The stimulation of the radioligand binding by carbachol (CCh) was optimal (threefold increase) in the presence of micromolar concentrations of GDP and 100 mM NaCl. Exposure to N-ethylmaleimide and pertussis toxin markedly inhibited the CCh effect, whereas it increased the relative stimulation of [35 S]GTP gamma <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> elicited by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). On the other hand, membrane treatment with cholera toxin curtailed the PACAP stimulation of [35 S]GTP gamma <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> but did not affect the response to CCh. Like CCh, a number of cholinergic agonists stimulated [35 S]GTP gamma <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. The antagonist profile of the muscarinic stimulation of [35 S]GTP gamma <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> was highly correlated with that displayed by the muscarinic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. These data indicate that the olfactory bulb muscarinic receptors couple to G 1 /G 0, but not to Gs, and support the possibility that activation of G 1 /G 0 mediates the stimulatory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity...|$|R

40|$|I {{suggested}} in the accompanying article [Mol Pharmacol 2001; 59 : 875 - 885] that muscarinic receptors catalyzed G protein activation. Acetylcholine or carbamylcholine recognition facilitated not only the GDP release from receptor-coupled inactive G proteins but also the release of G from the (unstable) HRG complex. The two effects facilitated [(35) S]GTP gamma <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> {{in the presence of}} GDP, but could be studied separately by comparing [(35) S]GTP gamma <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> in the absence and presence of GTP. Guanyl nucleotides affected the efficiency of receptor-G protein coupling. The relative efficacies of partial agonists in the absence and presence of GTP should remain nonlinearly correlated if all agonists stabilize (to different extents) the same active receptor conformation. The correlation between M(1) muscarinic agonists' efficacy in accelerating [(35) S]GTP gamma <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> in the absence of other nucleotides and their in vivo efficacy (inositol phosphate accumulation) was in fact very poor. This probably reflected the presence of GTP in intact cells: pertussis toxin pretreatment (which inactivates the G(i/o) proteins) did not affect the agonists' efficacy profile (evaluated in the absence of spare receptors), but the addition of GTP to the [(35) S]GTP gamma <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> medium did. These results did not support the allosteric "two states" model of receptor activation, but suggested that different agonists induced different receptor conformations ("induced fit").

40|$|The human 5 -HT 2 C receptor, when {{expressed}} heterologously {{in various}} mammalian cell lines (HEK 293, SH-EP and NIH- 3 T 3) at various receptor densities (6 to 45 pmol mg− 1 protein), mediates robust agonist-induced GTPγ 35 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> from coupling to Gi subtypes of G proteins, {{in addition to}} Gq/ 11. Such a phenotype, however, was not seen with the human 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors, indicating their common pathway with 5 -HT 2 C limited to Gq/ 11, not including Gi. Because intracellular regions are largely responsible for signalling pathways, we prepared the chimeras of the 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors where {{the second and third}} intracellular loops, and the C-terminal region were replaced with the 5 -HT 2 C counterparts. The chimeras showed robust agonist-induced GTPγ 35 <b>S</b> <b>binding.</b> Relative intrinsic efficacies of agonists from the GTPγ 35 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> were nearly identical to the reported values for their parent receptors as measured with Ca 2 + or [3 H]-inositol phosphate accumulation. Also the chimeras displayed the same ligand-binding properties as the parent receptors. We conclude that the phenotype of agonist-induced GTPγ 35 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> is unique to 5 -HT 2 C among the 5 -HT 2 receptor family, and is transferable to 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B, upon swapping intracellular sequences, without altering their receptor pharmacology...|$|R

The present study examines the characteristics of LDL and its binding properties with the main glycosaminoglycan of the vascular wall, chondroitin 6 - sulphate (C 6 S). The compositional characteristics that were studied for each LDL sample were phase transition temperature, phospholipid content, free cholesterol content, cholesteryl ester content, triglyceride content, and size. Correlations of these characteristics with LDL-C 6 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> were analyzed using a turbidity assay. Our results showed that there is no correlation between LDL-C 6 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> and phase transition temperature, triglyceride content, or size. Strong correlations were present for LDL-C 6 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> and phospholipid content (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001, r 2 = 0. 4591), free cholesterol content (P 3 ̆c 0. 01, r 2 = 0. 2495), and cholesteryl ester content (P 3 ̆c 0. 005, r 2 = 0. 2952). When values for surface (phospholipids and free cholesterol) and core (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides) lipids were determined a positive correlation was also present with LDL-C 6 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 0005, r 2 = 0. 4172; P 3 ̆c 0. 0005, r 2 = 0. 4282; respectively). These results indicate that large, lipid-rich LDL particles have a higher capacity to bind C 6 S than smaller, lipid poor LDL. Possible implications for the atherogenicity of LDL are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{found that}} mutating the RNP 1 motif in the {{predicted}} RRM domain in yeast eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF 3) subunit b/PRT 1 (prt 1 -rnp 1) impairs its direct interactions in vitro with both eIF 3 a/TIF 32 and eIF 3 j/HCR 1. The rnp 1 mutation in PRT 1 confers temperature-sensitive translation initiation in vivo and reduces 40 S-binding of eIF 3 to native preinitiation complexes. Several {{findings indicate that}} the rnp 1 lesion decreases recruitment of eIF 3 to the 40 S subunit by HCR 1 : (i) rnp 1 strongly impairs the association of HCR 1 with PRT 1 without substantially disrupting the eIF 3 complex; (ii) rnp 1 impairs the 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> of eIF 3 {{more so than the}} 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> of HCR 1; (iii) overexpressing HCR 1 -R 215 I decreases the Ts phenotype and increases 40 S-bound eIF 3 in rnp 1 cells; (iv) the rnp 1 Ts phenotype is exacerbated by tif 32 - 6, which eliminates a binding determinant for HCR 1 in TIF 32; and (v) hcr 1 impairs 40 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> of eIF 3 in otherwise wild-type cells. Interestingly, rnp 1 also reduces the levels of 40 S-bound eIF 5 and eIF 1 and increases leaky scanning at the GCN 4 uORF 1.

40|$|A steroid binding protein {{fraction}} with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 9 S (molecular weight approximately equal to 200, 000) {{has been identified}} in 105, 000 X g supernatants of several androgen-responsive organs. Highest concentrations were found in epididymis and testis, but small amounts were detected in prostate, seminal vesicle, kidney, submandibular gland, and lung. The 9 S protein binds [3 H]dihydrotestosterone (17 beta-hydroxy- 5 alpha-androstan- 3 -one) and [3 H]progesterone (4 -pregnene- 3, 20 -dione) with equilibrium binding constants of approximately 10 (5) M- 1 and 10 (6) M- 1, respectively. The concentration of 9 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> sites in epididymis is approximately 10 (- 11) mol/mg of supernatant protein, which is at least 10 (5) {{times greater than the}} concentration of androgen receptor. 9 <b>S</b> <b>binding</b> protein appears to be a nonsecretory, intracellular protein and has properties different from the andorgen receptor.

As expected, NT-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and intracellular calcium mobilization were not altered after PTx treatment. This suggests the existence of multiple signaling cascades activated by NT.
