5|$|Spontaneous {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. <b>propofol,</b> ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of <b>propofol</b> which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but <b>propofol</b> has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and <b>propofol</b> has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Jackson had been {{administered}} <b>propofol,</b> lorazepam, and midazolam, and the Los Angeles coroner decided to treat the death as a homicide. Law enforcement officials conducted a manslaughter investigation of his personal physician Conrad Murray, and charged him with involuntary manslaughter in Los Angeles on February 8, 2010. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} {{for a series of}} comeback concerts scheduled to begin in July 2009, Jackson died of acute <b>propofol</b> and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. His personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death and sentenced to four years in prison.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Aphrodite Jones, Patrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, stated {{that he would have}} known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any drugs in the house. He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when <b>Propofol</b> was administered.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or <b>propofol</b> is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or <b>propofol.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aspects of Jackson's {{personal}} life, {{including his}} changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, {{he was accused}} of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute <b>propofol</b> and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication. Jackson is also remembered for his generous philanthropy and his pioneering efforts in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry. In October 2017, Forbes announced that Jackson had topped the publication's list of top-earning dead celebrities for the fifth straight year with annual earnings of $75 million.|$|E
25|$|If this proves {{ineffective}} or if barbiturates {{cannot be}} used for some reason, then a general anesthetic such as <b>propofol</b> may be tried; sometimes it is used second after the failure of lorazepam. This also means putting the people on artificial ventilation. <b>Propofol</b> {{has been shown to}} be effective in suppressing the jerks seen in myoclonus status epilepticus.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to anesthesia induction, sodium thiopental was historically used to induce medical comas. It {{has now been}} superseded by drugs such as <b>propofol</b> because their effects wear off more quickly than thiopental.|$|E
25|$|An {{anaesthetist}} or anesthesiologist places intravenous and arterial {{lines and}} injects an analgesic, usually fentanyl, intravenously, followed within minutes by an induction agent (usually <b>propofol</b> or etomidate) {{to render the}} patient unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies show}} that menthol acts as GABAA {{receptor}} positive allosteric modulator and increases GABAergic transmission in PAG neurons. Menthol also shares anaesthetic properties similar to <b>propofol,</b> by modulating same sites of GABAA receptor.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{was said}} to have used <b>propofol,</b> as well as {{alprazolam}} (an antianxiety agent), and sertraline (an antidepressant). Other drugs named in connection with him included omeprazole, hydrocodone, paroxetine, carisoprodol, and hydromorphone. After his death, police found several drugs in his home, which included <b>propofol.</b> Some of these drugs had labels made out to Jackson under pseudonyms, while others were unlabeled. A 2004 police document prepared for the 2005 People v. Jackson child abuse trial alleged that Jackson was taking up to 40 alprazolam pills a night. Alprazolam was not found in his bloodstream at his time of death. Dr. A.J. Farshchian, Michael Jackson's friend and confidante, has claimed that Jackson was scared of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Honokiol {{belongs to}} a class of neolignan biphenols. As a {{polyphenol}} it is relatively small and can interact with cell membrane proteins through intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, or aromatic pi orbital co-valency. It is hydrophobic and readily dissolved in lipids. It is structurally similar to <b>propofol.</b>|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died {{of acute}} <b>propofol</b> and {{benzodiazepine}} intoxication {{at his home}} on North Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said he had found Jackson in his room, not breathing and with a barely detectable pulse, and that he administered CPR on Jackson to no avail. After a call was placed to 9-1-1 at , Jackson was treated by paramedics at the scene and was later pronounced dead at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. On August 28, 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner concluded that his death was a homicide. Shortly before his death, Jackson had reportedly been administered <b>propofol</b> and two anti-anxiety benzodiazepines, lorazepam and midazolam, in his home. His personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 and served a two-year prison sentence.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{fentanyl}} {{is often}} used for anaesthesia and analgesia. During anaesthesia it {{is often used}} along with a hypnotic agent like <b>propofol.</b> It is also administered in combination with a benzodiazepine, such as midazolam, to produce sedation for procedures such as endoscopy, cardiac catheterization, and oral surgery, or in emergency rooms. It is often used {{in the management of}} chronic pain including cancer pain.|$|E
25|$|Thiopental is a {{rapid and}} {{effective}} drug for inducing unconsciousness, since it causes {{loss of consciousness}} upon a single circulation through the brain due to its high lipophilicity. Only a few other drugs, such as methohexital, etomidate, or <b>propofol,</b> {{have the capability to}} induce anesthesia so rapidly. (Narcotics such as fentanyl are inadequate as induction agents for anesthesia.) Supporters argue that since the thiopental is given at a much higher dose than for medically induced coma protocols, it is effectively impossible for the condemned to wake up.|$|E
25|$|Medications may {{be mixed}} into the fluids {{mentioned}} above. Compared with other routes of administration, such as oral medications, the intravenous route {{is the fastest}} way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body. The bioavailability of the IV medication is 100%, unlike oral medications where much of the medication is lost in digestion before entering circulation. Certain types of medications can only be given intravenously, such as when there is insufficient uptake by other routes of administration such as enterally. Examples include intravenous immunoglobulin and <b>propofol.</b>|$|E
25|$|After Murray {{pleaded not}} guilty to the {{manslaughter}} charge, several members of the Jackson family said they felt he deserved a more severe charge. On June 25, 2010, Joseph filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray. The lawsuit alleges that Murray repeatedly lied to cover up his use of <b>propofol,</b> did not keep sufficient medical records and was negligent in his use of medications on Jackson. Murray's civil attorney, Charles Peckham, denied that Murray gave Jackson anything life-threatening. On August 15, 2012, Joseph dropped his wrongful death lawsuit against Murray.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} initial treatment after which typically phenytoin is given. Possible benzodiazepines include intravenous lorazepam {{as well as}} intramuscular injections of midazolam. A number of other medications may be used if these are not effective such as valproic acid, phenobarbital, <b>propofol,</b> or ketamine. Intubation {{may be required to}} help maintain the person's airway. Between 10 and 30% of people who have status epilepticus die within 30 days. The underlying cause, the person's age, and the length of the seizure are important factors in the outcome. Status epilepticus occurs in up to 40 per 100,000 people per year. It makes up about 1% of people who visit the emergency department.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, Cherilyn Lee, a {{nurse who}} had worked as Jackson's nutritionist, {{said that he had}} asked her in May to provide <b>propofol</b> to help him sleep, but she refused. He told her he had been given the drug before for {{persistent}} insomnia, and that a doctor had said it was safe. Lee said she received a telephone call from an aide to Jackson on June 21 to say that Jackson was ill, although she no longer worked for him. She reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She advised the aide to send Jackson to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|In Conrad Murray's {{manslaughter}} trial, David Walgren stated {{another one}} of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson {{under the influence of}} <b>propofol</b> on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they could see him perform in London.|$|E
25|$|Patients with grade I–II {{encephalopathy}} {{should be}} transferred to a liver transplant facility and listed for transplantation. Consider a brain computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out other causes of altered or impaired mental status. Stimulation and overhydration can cause elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP) and should be avoided. Unmanageable agitation may be treated with short-acting benzodiazepines in small doses. Lactulose can be considered at this stage. A preliminary report from the ALFSG on 117 patients suggests that use of lactulose in the first 7 days after diagnosis {{is associated with a}} small increase in survival time, but with no difference in severity of encephalopathy or in the overall outcome. For patients who progress to grade III–IV encephalopathy, intubation for airway protection is generally required. Many centers use <b>propofol</b> for sedation because it may reduce cerebral blood. The head of the bed should be elevated to 30 degrees, and electrolytes, blood gasses, glucose, and neurologic status monitored frequently.|$|E
500|$|Following Jackson's death, {{reports of}} {{his use of}} {{pethidine}} (Demerol) surfaced. Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he asked her for unspecified [...] "products for sleep." [...] On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was <b>propofol.</b> Lee refused, telling him, [...] "Michael, {{the only problem with}} you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not going to wake up." [...] Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe. He did not name the doctor. [...] An overdose of <b>propofol</b> can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, Fox News {{entertainment}} reporter Roger Friedman {{said that}} Jackson had been recording at {{a studio in}} rural Westmeath, Ireland. It was not known at the time what Jackson was working on, or who had paid for the sessions, since his publicist had recently issued a statement claiming that he had left Two Seas. In November 2006, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and MSNBC reported that {{he was working on}} a new album, produced by will.i.am. Jackson performed at the World Music Awards in London on November 15, 2006, and accepted a Diamond Award for selling over [...] records. During his period in Ireland he sought Dr. Patrick Treacy for cosmetic treatment after reading about his experience with HLA fillers and his charitable work in Africa. Treacy became his only doctor when he lived in Ireland in 2006. He started as Jackson's personal dermatologist and developed a friendship with the singer. Jackson returned to the United States after Christmas 2006 to attend James Brown's funeral in Augusta, Georgia, where he gave one of the eulogies, saying that [...] "James Brown is my greatest inspiration." [...] In 2011, Treacy appeared on the Dr. Drew show on CNN and said that he had gave <b>propofol</b> to Michael Jackson on two occasions but the singer always requested an anaesthetist to be present.|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson {{died at the}} age of 50 on June 25, 2009 from {{cardiac arrest}} (it would later be {{determined}} that Jackson died of [...] "acute <b>propofol</b> intoxication" [...] with the additional factor of [...] "benzodiazepine effect"). Prior to his death, the singer was planning on performing 50 concerts for his sold out This Is It dates in the United Kingdom from 2009 to 2010. Shortly after his death, on June 25th, 2009, Sony Music Entertainment announced that they were to release a two-disc compilation [...] "soundtrack" [...] for Jackson's concert documentary film, Michael Jackson's This Is It. In the announcement it was confirmed that This Is It would be released on October 26, 2009, one day before the film's theatrical release. This Is It is the sixth posthumous album to be released by Sony and Motown/Universal since Jackson's death in June 2009. The previous five albums are The Collection, , The Stripped Mixes, The Definitive Collection, and The Remix Suite. This Is It was released on Sony Music's Epic Records, though, in certain countries, This Is It is listed under Sony Music Entertainment. The album was made available for pre-order – on Amazon.com as a compact disc and on the iTunes Store as a digital download. As planned, This Is It was released on October 26, 2009 in the US and worldwide on October 27 and 28.|$|E
2500|$|Lee Joon as Fama, idol singer {{investigated}} for <b>propofol</b> use (ep 19) ...|$|E
2500|$|Sodium thiopental {{decreases}} the cardiac stroke volume, {{which results in}} a decrease in cardiac output. [...] The decrease in cardiac output occurs {{in conjunction with a}} decrease in systemic vascular resistance, which results in hypotension. [...] However, in comparison with <b>propofol,</b> the reflex tachycardia seen during states of hypotension is relatively spared (a bradycardia is common after administration of <b>propofol)</b> and therefore the observed fall in blood pressure is generally less severe.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{anesthetic}} {{drugs are}} considered safe [...]These include local anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine), opiates (morphine, fentanyl), [...] ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, <b>propofol,</b> etomidate, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
2500|$|Of all {{the drugs}} found in Jackson's home, {{the one that}} most {{concerned}} investigators was <b>propofol</b> (Diprivan), a powerful anesthetic administered intravenously in hospitals to induce and maintain anesthesia during surgery. Nicknamed [...] "milk of amnesia" [...] because of its opaque, milk-like appearance (and a play on the words [...] "milk of magnesia"), the drug {{has been associated with}} cardiac arrest, but it still may be increasingly used off-label for anxiolytic and other medically unsubstantiated purposes. Several <b>propofol</b> bottles, some empty, some full, were found in Jackson's home.|$|E
2500|$|Some endoscopists {{are experimenting}} with, or {{routinely}} use, alternative or additional {{methods such as}} nitrous oxide and <b>propofol,</b> which have advantages and disadvantages relating to recovery time (particularly the duration of amnesia after the procedure is complete), patient experience, {{and the degree of}} supervision needed for safe administration. [...] This sedation is called [...] "twilight anesthesia". For some patients it is not fully effective, so they are indeed awake for the procedure and can watch the inside of their colon on the color monitor. [...] Substituting <b>propofol</b> for midazolam, which gives the patient quicker recovery, is gaining wider use, but requires closer monitoring of respiration.|$|E
2500|$|Sodium thiopental, {{also known}} as Sodium Pentothal (a {{trademark}} of Abbott Laboratories, {{not to be confused}} with pentobarbital), thiopental, thiopentone, or Trapanal (also a trademark), is a rapid-onset short-acting barbiturate general anesthetic that is an analogue of thiobarbital. [...] Sodium thiopental was a core medicine in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic healthcare system, but was supplanted by <b>propofol.</b> Despite this thiopental is still listed as an acceptable alternative to <b>propofol,</b> depending on local availability and cost of these agents. It was previously the first of three drugs administered during most lethal injections in the United States, but the U.S. manufacturer Hospira stopped manufacturing the drug and the EU banned the export of the drug for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Arnold Klein {{said that}} Jackson used an {{anesthesiologist}} to administer <b>propofol</b> {{to help him}} sleep {{while he was on}} tour in Germany. The anesthesiologist would [...] "take him down" [...] at night and [...] "bring him back up" [...] in the morning during the HIStory tour of 1996 and 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Benign myoclonic {{movements}} are commonly seen during the induction of general anesthesia with intravenous medications such as etomidate and <b>propofol.</b> These are postulated {{to result from}} decreased inhibitory signaling from cranial neurons. [...] Prolonged oxygen deprivation to the brain, hypoxia, may result in posthypoxic myoclonus. People suffering from benign fasciculation syndrome can often experience myoclonic jerking of limbs, fingers and thumbs.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{anesthetic}} agents used {{in human}} medicine {{are used in}} veterinary medicine. [...] Alpha-2 receptor agonist drugs such as xylazine, romifidine, detomidine, and medetomidine, are used frequently in veterinary species (particularly large animal), but are rarely used in people. [...] Guaifenesin {{is used as a}} muscle relaxant prior to anesthesia induction in some animals. [...] <b>Propofol</b> is commonly used in small animal anesthesia, however it is rarely used in large animals due to the cost. 'Propoclear' is also commonly used in smaller branches of small animal surgery as it has a longer shelf life once opened than <b>propofol</b> whilst essentially having the same properties. [...] Butorphanol is rarely used in people but is commonly used in all species. [...] Ketamine, used in children for anesthesia, is used extensively in many species to induce anesthesia or cause heavy sedation. [...] Expensive agents, such as etomidate and desflurane are rarely used outside of university hospitals. [...] Different species have different responses to drugs. [...] For example, horses may experience mania with morphine whereas dogs typically become sedated. [...] Rabbits and guinea pigs are well sedated with midazolam, which can occasionally excite dogs and cats.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of the person receiving sedative, the effect is a feeling of general relaxation, amnesia (loss of memory) and time passing quickly. [...] Many drugs can produce a sedative effect including benzodiazepines, <b>propofol,</b> thiopental, ketamine and inhaled general anesthetics. [...] The advantage of sedation over a general anesthetic is that it generally does not require support of the airway or breathing (no tracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation) and can have less of an effect on the cardiovascular system which may add to a greater margin of safety in some patients.|$|E
