50|$|In {{addition}} to its potential roles as a second messenger, IP4 may also function as an essential precursor for other more highly phosphorylated inositol phosphates such as IP5, IP6, IP7, and IP8. These higher order inositol phosphates {{are thought to be}} important for phosphate storage, may serve as additional second messengers, and may be involved in the <b>post-signal</b> recovery phase whereby calcium stores are refilled and the phosphatidylinositol supply is replenished. Such maintenance is necessary to prepare the cell for a future incoming signal.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMagnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) has highlighted {{the effects of}} chronic cocaine exposure on cerebral structures and functions, and implicated the prefrontal cortices in deficits of cognitive control. Recent investigations suggest power spectrum scale invariance (PSSI) of cerebral blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals as a neural marker of cerebral activity. We examined here how PSSI is altered in association with cocaine misuse and impaired cognitive control. MethodsEighty-eight healthy (HC) and seventy-five age and gender matched cocaine dependent (CD) adults participated in functional MRI of a stop signal task (SST). BOLD images were preprocessed using standard procedures in SPM, including detrending, band-pass filtering (0. 01 – 0. 25 Hz), and correction for head motions. Voxel-wise PSSI measures were estimated by a linear fit of the power spectrum with a log-log scale. In group analyses, we examined differences in PSSI between HC and CD, and its association with clinical and behavioral variables using a multiple regression. A critical component of cognitive control is <b>post-signal</b> behavioral adjustment, which is compromised in cocaine dependence. Therefore, we examined the PSSI changes in association with <b>post-signal</b> slowing (PSS) in the SST. ResultsCompared to HC, CD showed decreased PSS and PSSI in multiple frontoparietal regions. PSSI {{was positively correlated with}} PSS in HC in multiple regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which showed reduced PSSI in CD. ConclusionsThese findings suggest disrupted connectivity dynamics in the fronto-parietal areas in association with <b>post-signal</b> behavioral adjustment in cocaine addicts. These new findings support PSSI as a neural marker of impaired cognitive control in cocaine addiction...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the {{fabrication}} of a multivalent, cell-type specific and cytoplasmic delivery {{system based on}} single-walled carbon nanotubes. The latter were functionalized through adsorption of phospholipids terminated by biotinylated PEG chains functionalized with fluorochrome-coupled neutravidin, and subsequently with antibodies (anti-CD 3 epsilon and anti-CD 28) for T cell receptor <b>post-signaling</b> endocytosis and a synthetic fusogenic polymer for disruption of lysosomal compartments. The biomimetic nanoassemblies were composed by PEGylated individual/very small bundles of carbon nanotubes having an average length and {{a standard deviation of}} 176 nm and 77 nm, respectively. The nanoassemblies were stably dispersed under physiological conditions, visible by conventional optical and confocal microscopy and specifically targeted to T cells both in vitro and in living animals. The addition of a fusogenic polymer to the nanoassemblies did not affect the cellular uptake and allowed the release into the cytosol of the targeted cells both in vitro and in the animals. The present manuscript is the first report about the cytoplasmic delivery of carbon nanotubes in a specific cell type in intact animals and paves the way for their use as in vivo intracellular delivery systems...|$|R
40|$|Nonparametric {{control charts}} that can detect {{arbitrary}} distributional changes are highly desirable {{due to their}} flexibility to adapt to different distributional assumptions and distributional changes. However, most of such control charts in the literature either involve some tuning parameter, which needs to be pre-specified, or involve intensive computation. In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric adaptive CUSUM chart for detecting arbitrary distributional changes. The proposed control chart {{does not depend on}} any tuning parameter and is efficient in computation. Its self-starting nature makes the proposed control chart applicable to situations where no sufficiently large reference data are available. Our proposed control chart also has a built-in <b>post-signal</b> diagnostics function that can identify what kind of distributional changes have occurred after an alarm. Our simulation study and real data analysis show that the proposed control chart performs well across a broad range of settings, and compares favorably with existing nonparametric control charts...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{vehicular}} networks {{provide the}} necessary intelligence for vehicular communication networks in order to optimally utilize the limited resources and maximize the performance. One of the important functions of cognitive networks is to learn the radio environment by means of detecting and identifying existing radios. In this context we use the cyclostationarity features of dedicated short range communication (DSRC) signals to blindly detect them in the environment. We present experimental results on the cyclostationarity properties of DSRC wireless transmissions considering the CEN (European) standards for both uplink and downlink signals. By performing cyclostationarity analysis we compute the cyclic power spectrum (CPS) of the CEN DSRC signals which is then used for detecting {{the presence of the}} CEN DSRC radios. We obtain CEN DSRC signals from experiments and use the recorded data to perform <b>post-signal</b> analysis to determine the detection performance. The probability of false alarm and the probability of missed detection are computed and the results are presented for different detection strategies. Results show that the cyclostationarity feature based detection can be robust compared to the well known energy based technique for low signal to noise ratio levels. JRC.

40|$|A novel capacitance-based sensor {{designed}} for monitoring mechanical stresses at the stump–socket interface of lower-limb amputees is described. It provides practical means of measuring pressure and shear stresses simultaneously. In particular, {{it comprises of}} a flexible frame (20 mm × 20 mm), with thickness of 4 mm. By employing rapid prototyping technology in its fabrication, it offers a low-cost and versatile solution, with capability of adopting bespoke shapes of lower-limb residua. The sensor was first analysed using finite element analysis (FEA) and then evaluated using lab-based electromechanical tests. The results validate that the sensor is capable of monitoring both pressure and shear at stresses up to 350 kPa and 80 kPa, respectively. A <b>post-signal</b> processing model is developed to induce pressure and shear stresses, respectively. The effective separation of pressure and shear signals can be potentially advantageous for sensor calibration in clinical applications. The sensor also demonstrates high linearity (approx. 5 – 8 %) and high pressure (approx. 1. 3 kPa) and shear (approx. 0. 6 kPa) stress resolution performance. Accordingly, the sensor offers the potential for exploitation as an assistive tool to both evaluate prosthetic socket fitting in clinical settings and alert amputees in home settings of excessive loading at the stump–socket interface, effectively preventing stump tissue breakdown at an early stage...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, an oscillator-based {{touch sensor}} {{detection}} circuit with adaptive resolution has been proposed. Current popular touch screen detection technologies include resistive, capacitance, infrared based imaging sensor; however, some {{are designed with}} a fixed resolution {{and it is not}} optimal for nowadays low power requirement. In order to solve this problem, an oscillator-based touch sensor detection circuit with adaptive resolution has been presented. The circuit detects the touching finger by using a 6 stage ring oscillator to sense the change of the input capacitance. To make the resolution tunable, an 8 bit R- 2 R DAC has been implemented to change the bias voltage of the ring oscillator which will change the oscillator's resonant frequency as well as system resolution. Finally, a digital processing unit has been designed which is used to analyzes the change of the frequency and transfer information to PC to do <b>post-signal</b> processingThe design is achieved by using TSMC 65 nm technology, occupying an area of 0. 9 mm x 1. 1 mm, power consumption of 10 mW when oscillating at 120 MHz, and runs on a digital clock frequency of 100 KHz. Test result shows that the system can be very sensitive to detect if a finger touch it or not and the resolution can be adaptive by changing the frequency of the oscillator through DAC's outpu...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 5 years, {{research}} works on distribution-free (nonparametric) process monitoring have registered a phenomenal growth. A Google Scholar database search on early September 2015 reveals 246 articles on distribution-free control charts during 2000 – 2009 and 466 {{articles in the}} following years. These figures are about 1400 and 2860 respectively if the word ‘nonparametric’ is used in place of ‘distribution-free’. Distribution-free charts do not require any prior knowledge about the process parameters. Consequently, they are very effective in monitoring various non-normal and complex processes. Traditional process monitoring schemes use two separate charts, one for monitoring process location {{and the other for}} process scale. Recently, various schemes have been introduced to monitor the process location and process scale simultaneously using a single chart. Performance advantages of such charts have been clearly established. In this paper, we introduce a new graphical device, namely, circular-grid charts, for simultaneous monitoring of process location and process scale based on Lepage-type statistics. We also discuss general form of Lepage statistics and show that a new modified Lepage statistic is often better than the traditional of Lepage statistic. We offer a new and attractive <b>post-signal</b> follow-up analysis. A detailed numerical study based on Monte-Carlo simulations is performed, and some illustrations are provided. A clear guideline for practitioners is offered to facilitate the best selection of charts among various alternatives for simultaneous monitoring of location-scale. The practical application of the charts is illustrated...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{statistical}} control schemes {{have been}} mainly focused on detecting constant mean shifts. In many practical applications, however, {{the mean of}} the observed sequence can exhibit a time-varying behavior after the fault occurrence. Shewhart control charts supplemented with sensitizing run rules have been suggested for detecting nonrandom dynamic mean patterns. However, the choice of a particular set of run rules requires some prior knowledge of the possible expected patterns. In addition, the resulting schemes can have a poor performance against small shifts. When the mean shift pattern is known in advance, Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR), Cumulative Score (CUSCORE) and Optimal General Linear Filter (OGLF) control charts have also been proposed for change point detection. Further, some adaptive CUSCORE schemes have been recently developed for detecting an unknown patterned mean shift. However, these adaptive CUSCOREs assume the occurrence of one-sided mean shifts. Hence, their performance may be poor {{in the case of an}} oscillatory behavior of the process mean. To overcome these limitations, we propose to estimate a possible pattern in the mean using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), which is especially effective with one-sided shifts in the mean, combined with a wavelet smoother, which is effective in estimating oscillatory mean patterns. The two estimates then drive two separate conventional GLR tests for significance. A control chart is proposed for observations from normal distributions and then extended to a completely distribution-free setting. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed charts with a wide variety of patterned mean shifts in both the independent and autocorrelated scenarios and with a wide variety of distributions. In addition, the proposed scheme provides <b>post-signal</b> diagnostic information that estimates the change point location and the shift pattern of the mean.

40|$|This study {{recognizes the}} communicational nature of helping and the {{importance}} of the process conditions of helper empathic understanding, respect, genuineness and intensity and the helpee behaviour of self-exploration, Additionally, nonverbal behaviour is regarded as a critical aspect of helping interaction and for the helper this centres on a composite of variables incorporated within the concept of attending. Recently training and practice have emphasized a skills approach with the Human Resource Development model of R. R. Carkhuff being one comprehensive model which recognizes the positive functions of process conditions and helper nonverbal attending. The technology of the skills approach can often be over-emphasized, and this can be seen for example in the manner of prescribing a forward-lean behaviour to enhance helper attending. Although often resisted by trainees, this deliberate lean frequently becomes an aspect of the trained helper's integrated repertoire. Experienced helpers have at times reported that such a deliberate movement often in and of itself promotes heightened involvement and increased levels of communicated process conditions. The present study was designed {{to examine the relationship between}} such a postural shift and helping interaction. Twelve trained male helpers and 12 female volunteer helpees were the subjects. Each helper met three helpees in separate sessions. The sessions began with helpers in an upright attending posture and at a signal they had one minute during which to adopt one of three designated behaviours - a prescribed forward lean; a prescribed backward lean; or a choice of any posture. These alternatives were counterbalanced within the design to control for order effects. The overall duration of the sessions was 19 minutes (nine minutes for each of the pre-signal and <b>post-signal</b> periods and one minute for the signal period). Data were collected from several sources. The primary data were audiotaped segments within the sessions which were given in random order to trained raters using Carkhuff's (1969) scales of Empathic Understanding, Respect, Genuineness and helpee Self-Exploration, and Truax's (1962) scale of Intensity. For each scale the ratings were pooled into pre-signal and <b>post-signal</b> scores and analysed using analysis of variance with repeated measures. Supplementary data were obtained from the helpees, the helpers and from videotapes of the sessions, focussing on similar criteria to the rating scales. These data were analysed independently. Analyses were done in regard to postural-shift conditions for the total helper sample then for helper sub-samples based on distinctions of forward or backward postural preferences. Results from the helping interaction data revealed significant differences on levels of Intensity and Respect in relation to the backward lean movement away from the initial upright posture. An overall pattern of differences between and within the postural conditions emerged on the scales, which suggested a compensatory relationship between verbal and nonverbal behaviours. On the whole, making a forward lean was associated with decreased levels on the scales and a backward lean with increased levels. This was most evident on the Intensity and Respect scales and in particular for those helpers whose preference was to move forward. The pattern of differences was considered in relation to Argyle and Dean's theory of compensation in the maintenance of an equilibrium level of interpersonal intimacy. There were essentially no differences, based on the various postures, in the helpees' assessments of the helpers' communications nor in the helpers' experiences of the sessions. These findings were related to the equilibrium level of the helpers' overall communication, to the perspective of participating in the sessions, and to the likelihood of the initial upright attending position being an especially powerful prehelping behaviour. A strong and consistent finding was that helpers whose preference when given the choice was to lean forward, communicated at higher levels on all of the scales and were regarded as more competent counsellors by their trainers than those whose preference was to move backward. The context of the interaction is important in considering the meaning of the findings of this study. The results may represent the helpers' maintenance of a subtle balance of verbal and nonverbal communication appropriate to the experimental setting. This would suggest a transcendence of mechanical techniques in line with the intentions of Carkhuff and others using skills methodology. The relationship between a torso lean and levels of communication on the process conditions seems more complex than has been previously considered...|$|E
