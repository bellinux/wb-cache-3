5|$|Apical abscesses {{can spread}} to involve {{periodontal}} <b>pockets</b> around a tooth, and periodontal <b>pockets</b> cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E

Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
