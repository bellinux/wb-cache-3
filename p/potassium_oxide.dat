25|$|Lead crystal {{glassware}} {{was formerly}} used to store and serve drinks, {{but due to}} the potential health risks of lead, this has become rare. One alternative material is crystal glass, in which barium oxide, zinc oxide, or <b>potassium</b> <b>oxide</b> are employed instead of lead oxide. Lead-free crystal has a similar refractive index to lead crystal, but it is lighter and it has less dispersive power.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, {{combustion}} converts {{less than}} half the mass of black powder to gas, most of it turns into particulate matter. Some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving off a soldier position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of soot inside the barrel, where it also is a nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an automatic weapon. Moreover this residue is hygroscopic, and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a corrosive substance. The soot contains <b>potassium</b> <b>oxide</b> or sodium oxide that turns into potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, which corrodes wrought iron or steel gun barrels. Black powder arms must therefore be well cleaned after use, both inside and out, to remove the residue.|$|E

5000|$|Potassium {{superoxide}} is {{a potent}} oxidizer, and can produce explosive reactions when combined {{with a variety of}} substances, including water, acids, organics, or powdered graphite. Even dry superoxide can produce an impact-sensitive explosive compound when combined with organic oils such as kerosene.

50|$|Potassium {{arsenite}} is an {{inorganic salt}} that exists as an odorless white solid. It is largely {{soluble in water}} and only slightly soluble in alcohol. Solutions of potassium arsenite contain moderate concentrations of hydroxide, and are thus slightly basic. While potassium arsenite is noncombustible, heating it results in its decomposition {{and the formation of}} toxic fumes that include arsine, arsenic <b>oxides,</b> and <b>potassium</b> <b>oxides.</b> <b>Potassium</b> arsenite also reacts with acids to yield toxic arsine gas.|$|R
500|$|Potassium oxidizes {{faster than}} most metals and forms oxides with oxygen-oxygen bonds, as do all alkali metals except lithium. Three species are formed during the reaction: <b>{{potassium}}</b> <b>oxide,</b> potassium peroxide, and potassium superoxide formed {{of three different}} oxygen-based ions: oxide (...) , peroxide (...) , and superoxide (...) [...] The last two species, especially the superoxide, are rare and are formed only in reaction with very electropositive metals; these species contain oxygen-oxygen bonds. All potassium-oxygen binary compounds are known to react with water violently, forming potassium hydroxide.

It also has a high elasticity, making glassware [...] "ring". It is also more workable in the factory, but cannot stand heating very well. This kind of glass is also more fragile than other glasses and is easier to cut.|$|E
30|$|Taking the {{presence}} of Si as granted in both man-made and natural volcanic glasses, {{the presence}} of significant amounts of calcium, potassium, aluminium and sodium provide additional evidence to support Raman spectroscopic results, that obsidian igneous rock {{was used as the}} mirror matrix. These are the main elements of obsidian glass [32, 33] and are responsible for their characteristic brown-black colour. The elemental composition of obsidians is the result of specific geological processes and can be chemically classified as peralkaline, subalkaline, metaluminous and peraluminous, according to their aluminium, calcium, sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>oxides</b> content, respectively [32].|$|R

Studies of the catalytic ammonia decomposition over the cobalt catalysts are presented. The studies of the ammonia decomposition were carried out for various ammonia-hydrogen mixtures in which ammonia concentration varied in the range from 10 % to 100 %. Co(0) catalyst, promoted by oxides of aluminium, calcium, and potassium, showed the highest activity in the ammonia decomposition reaction.

40|$|To {{reduce their}} sulfur emissions, many {{coal-fired}} electric power plants use wet flue-gas scrubbers. These scrubbers convert sulfur oxides into solid sulfate and sulfite sludge, which must then be disposed of. This sludge {{is a result}} of reacting limestone with sulfur dioxide to precipitate calcium sulfite and calcium sulfate. It consists of calcium sulfite, gypsum, and unreacted limestone or lime, with miscellaneous objectionable impurities such as iron oxides, silicates, and magnesium, sodium, and <b>potassium</b> <b>oxides</b> or salts. These impurities prevent many sludges from being utilized as a replacement for natural gypsum, and as a result they must be disposed of in landfills, which presents a serious disposal problem...|$|R

For example, <b>potassium</b> <b>oxide</b> is about 83% potassium by weight, while potassium chloride is only 52%. Potassium chloride provides less potassium than an equal amount of <b>potassium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Thus, if a fertilizer is 30% potassium chloride by weight, its standard potassium rating, based on <b>potassium</b> <b>oxide,</b> would be only 18.8%.|$|E

50|$|The two-mica granites are {{strongly}} peraluminous - {{they have a}} high ratio of aluminium oxide to sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>oxides.</b> They also have a low ratio of sodium to potassium and overall high level of alkalis. The granites are highly enriched in lithium, boron, caesium and uranium and moderately so in fluorine, gallium, germanium, rubidium, tin, tantalum, tungsten and thallium. Given the overall chemistry, the levels of phosphorus are also high. Strontium, barium and the elements from scandium to zinc are relatively depleted. This chemistry is consistent with partial melting of a source consisting of greywackes (a variety of sandstone). The conditions under which the melts formed is modelled to be temperature of 770 Â°C and a confining pressure of 50 MPa.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to measure {{the sum of the}} elastic, {{rotational}} and vibrational scattering of electrons by KOH at low impact energies (5 to 20 eV) at angles from 10 to 120 deg. Energy loss spectra taken in the 0 to 18 eV range using an electron impact spectrometer are used to identify the species contributing to electric scattering. At temperatures between 300 and 500 C, only inelastic spectral features belonging to water are detected, while at temperatures from 500 to 800 C strong atomic K lines, indicative of molecular dissociation, and H 2 energy loss features become prominent. No features attributable to KOH, the KOH dimer, O 2 or <b>potassium</b> <b>oxides</b> were observed, due to the effects of the dissociation products, and it is concluded that another technique will have to be developed in order to measure electron scattering by KOH...|$|R

40|$|Thin {{films of}} sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>oxides</b> {{have for the}} first time been {{deposited}} using atomic layer deposition. Sodium and potassium complexes of tert-butanol, trimethylsilanol and hexamethyldisilazide have been evaluated as precursors by characterising their thermal properties as well as tested in applications for thin film depositions. Out of these, sodium and potassium tert-butoxide and sodium trimethylsilanolate and hexamethyldisilazide were further tested as precursors together with the Al(CH 3) 3 + H 2 O/O 3 process to form aluminates and together with ozone to form silicates. Sodium and potassium tert-butoxide and sodium trimethylsilanolate showed self-limiting growth and proved useable at deposition temperatures from 225 to 375 or 300 Â°C, respectively. The crystal structures of NaOtBu and KOtBu were determined by single crystal diffraction revealing hexamer- and tetramer structures, respectively.

40|$|International audienceStudies of {{characterization}} and electrochemical {{promotion of}} the electrochemical catalyst Pt/K-Î²Al 2 O 3 for low-temperature propene combustion are reported for the first time. Characterization of Pt/K-Î²Al 2 O 3 by surface titration, SEM, and XRD revealed useful information about the electrochemical catalyst. On the other hand, {{it was found that}} Pt/K-Î²Al 2 O 3 can be strongly promoted at low temperature for propene oxidation under both near-stoichiometric and oxygen-rich conditions. For instance, under C 3 H 6 /O 2 : 2000 ppm/ 7 % at 200 Â°C, a rate enhancement ratio (ÏCO 2) of 7 was achieved under application of VWR=â 2 V, increasing propene conversion from 10 to 70 %. In addition, the origin of the NEMCA effect was investigated using cyclic voltammetry along with CO 2 analysis as well as FTIR measurements and SEM-EDX analysis. These techniques showed that the presence of more stable and effective promoter phases (<b>potassium</b> <b>oxides</b> and superoxides) were responsible for both a permanent NEMCA effect and a higher promotional phenomenon in comparison to sodium conductors...|$|R
40|$|Borate {{glasses are}} {{suitable}} for thermoluminescent dosimetry. In particular, borate glasses doped with different elements show good characteristics in terms of linearity, sensitivity and effective atomic number. However, these glasses are also hygroscopic, which can reduce their viability as dosimeters. In this work, the characteristics of borate glasses made with lithium and <b>potassium</b> <b>oxides</b> (LKB) were studied. To improve the glass features new formulations adding different amounts of magnesium oxide were developed. Mg improves {{the stability of the}} glasses since it reduces the mobility of the alkali ions and thus may reduce the hygroscopicity of the LKB glass. Three glass formulations containing 0, 5 and 11 mol% of magnesium oxide were produced by wet quenching method {{in order to determine the}} effect of Mg specifically on hygroscopicity and high-temperature resistance. The possibility to use this material for optically stimulated luminescence dosimetry was demonstrated.

The ink of the drawings, text and page and quire numbers had similar microscopic characteristics. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) performed in 2009 revealed that the inks contained major amounts of iron, sulfur, potassium, calcium and carbon and trace amounts of copper and occasionally zinc.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of western subbituminous coals has generated concerns regarding highly reflective ash disrupting heat transfer in the radiant zone of pulverized-fuel boilers. Ash emissivity and reflectivity is primarily a function of ash particle size, with reflective deposits expected to consist of very small refractory ash materials such as CaO, MgO, or sulfate materials such as Na{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }. For biomass fuels and biomass-coal blends, similar reflectivity issues may arise {{as a result of}} the presence of abundant organically associated calcium and potassium, which can transform during combustion to fine calcium, and <b>potassium</b> <b>oxides</b> and sulfates, which may act as reflective ash. The relationship of reflectivity to ash chemistry is a second-order effect, with the ash particle size distribution and melting point being determined by the size and chemistry of the minerals present in the starting fuel.
