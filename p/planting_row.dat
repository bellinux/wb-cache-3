40|$|ABSTRACT High corn yields in {{high-tech}} systems {{are related to}} proper crop implementation. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of variability {{in the distribution of}} seeds along the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> on corn production components. The study was conducted under Cerrado conditions in the municipality of Uruta√≠, GO, Brazil. The experimental design was randomized blocks in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme, with four replicates. The effects of five coefficients of variation (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 %) of non-uniformity in the spatial distribution of seeds along the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> of two corn hybrids (P 30 F 53 HX and P 3646 HX) were evaluated. No interactions were observed for the analysed corn variables. However, as the non-uniformity in seed distribution along the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> increased, stalk diameter, hundred-grain weight, number of rows per ear, number of kernels per row and ear length decreased. Additionally, linear reductions were observed in corn grain yield with the increase in the coefficient of variation of the spatial distribution of seeds along the <b>planting</b> <b>row.</b> Between the hybrids, the 30 F 53 HX showed higher hundred-grain weight...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of traffic control on soil compaction in sugarcane areas with mechanical harvesting system. The study {{was carried out in}} a randomized complete block design in a split plot arrangement, with the following treatments: traditional mechanical harvesting, mechanical harvesting with traffic control, mechanical harvesting with traffic control and automatic tractor guidance. Soil physical properties were assessed at 0. 0 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 0. 2 and 0. 2 - 0. 3 -m depths, at the <b>planting</b> <b>row,</b> at the wheel tracks, and between wheel tracks. The effects of these treaments on sugarcane yield were evaluated, respectively, too. Agricultural traffic increases soil density, and reduces aggregate mean geometric diameters and macroporosity at the wheel tracks in comparison to the <b>planting</b> <b>row,</b> which leads to cumulative soil physical quality degradation throughout the years. The two years of agricultural traffic control did not influence the studied soil physical attributes...|$|E
40|$|Subsoiling to a {{depth of}} 35 cm under the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> for 3 {{consecutive}} years increased annual yields of seed cotton by 50 to 200 %. Annual subsoiling was essential for maximum yields. The application of a nematicide, 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane (DBCP) or aldicarb, reduced the population of Hoplolaimus columbus but did not increase seed-cotton yields over subsoiling alone. Subsoiling reduced H. columbus in the top 20 cm of soil since the treatment favored deeper penetration by much of the root syslem and, consequently, less root colonization of the upper soil zone...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} agricultural production, Brazil opted {{for the expansion of}} farming areas and the intensive use of mechanization, causing serious damage to soils. At the same time, conservation practices such as no-tillage farming are also in use. Nevertheless, soil density assessments are necessary in both situations. Practical and controversial, the methodology of penetrometry is the most utilized in such assessments. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the vertical stratification of soil resistance to penetration. Data was collected in a Typic Hapludox under no-tillage. Samples were collected in forty points of a 50 x 50 m grid. Soil resistance was evaluated in three different positions in each point: <b>plant</b> <b>rows,</b> between the <b>plant</b> <b>rows,</b> and in the rows of the tractor path. Measurements were taken using a hydraulic-electronic penetrometer. Factorial analysis with orthogonal rotation, a Multivariate Analysis technique, was used to analyze soil resistance of soil layers. Four layers were identified in the <b>plant</b> <b>rows,</b> when more superficial layers had higher relative variance. Three layers were identified in the <b>plant</b> <b>rows</b> and in rows of the tractor path, points of anthropic action; in this case, deeper layers had higher relative variance...|$|R

Sample population counts were fit to the negative binomial distribution model before cultivation, but distributions differed among plots. The Neyman type A and negative binomial distributions both fit the data after cultivation disturbed the soil. Population clusters 1 - 3 m long were detected in plant beds before cultivation.

40|$|Machinery {{traffic in}} {{sugarcane}} (Saccharumsp.) plantations reduces soil physical quality, and hinders both root development and crop yield. We evaluated the physical quality of an Oxisol {{and the development}} of sugarcane roots under controlled traffic. The treatments assessed were: without controlled machinery traffic (WCT), controlled traffic by adjusting the tractor and infield wagons to a 3. 0 m track width with the operator guiding the machinery (CT 1) and the previous treatment using real time kinematic / global positioning system (RTK / GPS) precision auto steer (CT 2). Soil samples were collected from the planting rows, seedbed and inter-row center to determine the least limiting water range (LLWR) and soil porosity from scanned 2 -D images. The root dry mass was sampled from monoliths, separated from the soil by washing through a 2 -mm sieve and dried in an oven. A higher LLWR was observed in the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> under CT 1 and CT 2 than under WCT. The <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> had a predominance of complex pores with a diameter > 500 &# 181;m in the 0. 15 - 0. 27 m depth layer under CT 1 and CT 2. In the planting rows under WCT, the root dry mass was only 44 % of that measured under CT 2. Benefits regarding soil physical quality and growth roots were observed when the tractor-wagon track width was adjusted based on the sugarcane spacing using either precision auto steering or manual operation of the machinery...|$|E
40|$|Soil tillage {{can improve}} tree {{survival}} and growth by reducing competing vegetation, increasing nutrient availability, improving planting quality, and improving soil physical properties. The authors conducted a tillage study with competition control and nutrient amendments {{to isolate the}} physical effects of tillage on tree growth. The objectives {{of this study were}} to understand: (1) how tillage affects soil physical properties; (2) the relationships between these properties and root growth; (3) linkages between root growth response and aboveground growth; and (4) tillage effects on aboveground growth. Four replicates of a 2 x 2 factorial combination of surface (disking) and subsurface (subsoiling) were installed on a well-drained, clay-textured subsoil, soil located on the Piedmont of North Carolina. Disking improved soil physical properties (reduced bulk density and increased aeration porosity) in the surface 20 -cm of soil. Subsoiling improved soil physical properties at all depths in the <b>planting</b> <b>row,</b> with improvements still noted at 60 -cm from the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> in the surface 10 -cm of soil. Rooting patterns followed the changes in soil physical properties. Despite improvements in soil physical properties and changes in rooting patterns, aboveground tree growth was not affected by tillage. The results of this study point to the need for better diagnostics for identifying sites were tillage is appropriate in situations where fertilization and vegetation control are planned. Potential factors to consider are presence and abundance of old root channels, soil shrink/swell capacity, soil structure, presence and depth to root restricting layers, and historical precipitation records...|$|E
50|$|Row spacing is {{the second}} factor that determines canopy closure and yield components. Row spacing can either refer to the space between plants in the same row or the {{distance}} between two rows. Row spacing determines the degree of plant to <b>plant</b> competition. <b>Rows</b> <b>planted</b> closer together in a population will decrease the space between <b>plants.</b> Closer <b>row</b> widths increase <b>plant</b> to plant competition for nutrients and water but also increase sunlight use efficiency. According to former Iowa State University Soybean Extension Specialist Palle Pedersen, current recommendations are to <b>plant</b> <b>rows</b> that are less than 30‚Äù apart.

40|$|The {{region of}} Campos Gerais in the State of Paran√°, Brazil, is {{a pioneer in}} the {{implementation}} of new technologies, with superior grain yield performance. No-tillage farming system, for instance, is widely adopted in this region. This particular system requires accuracy and precision in the planting process to achieve high grain yields. Regarding regional attributes, the corn planting process in Campos Gerais under no-tillage was evaluated. Forty-eight properties were selected for a plant population pressure analysis. Four or five <b>planting</b> <b>rows</b> delimited the study area, 3 m per row. The spacing between <b>plants</b> and between <b>rows</b> was measured. No significant differences were observed between <b>planting</b> <b>rows</b> in 42 properties, and the average coefficient of variation was around 33 %. None of the areas had an average lower than 50. 000 plants ha - 1, the lowest value recommended for the hybrids in study.

40|$|In this study, the {{sensitivity}} of the C-band (5. 3 GHz) with a 23 ¬∞ incidence angle and the Ku-band (14. 85 GHz) with 35 ¬∞, 55 ¬∞, and 75 ¬∞ incidence angles to surface soil moisture content from a semiarid region were evaluated. To obtain an improved soil moisture estimation, a practical technique to reduce the influence of soil roughness and vegetation in the SAR data was developed in a study area located in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, a representative site of shrub- and grass-dominated rangelands of the southwestern part of the United States. To correct for soil roughness effects, the C-band radar backscattering coefficients œÉ¬∞ from a wet season image were subtracted from a¬∞ derived from a dry season image. The assumption was that, in semiarid regions, the SAR data from the dry season was dependent only on the soil roughness effects. To correct for vegetation effects, an empirical relation between œÉ¬∞ and leaf area index was used, the latter derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper data. The results showed that when both soil roughness and vegetation effects were corrected for, {{the sensitivity}} of a¬∞ to soil moisture improved substantially. The sensitivity of œÉ¬∞ to soil moisture was also evaluated in agricultural fields with bare soil and periodic roughness components (<b>planting</b> <b>row</b> and furrow structures). Four types of SAR system configurations were analyzed: C-band with a 23 ¬∞ incidence angle and Ku-band with 35 ¬∞, 55 ¬∞, and 75 ¬∞ incidence angles.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to assess changes in fine root anisotropy and specific root lengths throughout the development of Eucalyptus grandis (W. Hill ex Maiden) plantations and to establish a predictive model of root length density (RLD) from root intercept counts on trench walls. Fine root densities (< 1 mm in diameter) were studied in 6 -, 12 -, 22 -, 28 -, 54 -, 68 - and 72 -month-old E. grandis plantations established on deep Ferralsols in southern Brazil. Fine root intercepts were counted on 3 faces of 90 - 198 soil cubes (1 dm 3 in volume) in each stand and fine root lengths (L) were measured inside 576 soil cubes, sampled between the depths of 10 cm and 290 cm. The number of fine root intercepts was counted on one vertical face perpendicular to the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> (Nt), one vertical face parallel to the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> (Nl) and one horizontal face (Nh), for each soil cube sampled. An overall isotropy of fine roots was shown by paired Student's t-tests between the numbers of fine roots intersecting each face of soil cubes at most stand ages and soil depths. Specific root lengths decreased with stand age in the upper soil layers and tended to increase in deep soil layers {{at the end of the}} rotation. A linear regression established between Nt and L for all the soil cubes sampled accounted for 36 % of the variability of L. Such a regression computed for mean Nt and L values at each sampling depth and stand age explained only 55 % of the variability, as a result of large differences in the relationship between L and Nt depending on stand productivity. The equation RLD= 1. 89 *LAI*Nt, where LAI was the stand leaf area index (m 2 m? 2) and Nt was expressed as the number of root intercepts per cm 2, made it possible to predict accurately (R 2 = 0. 84) and without bias the mean RLDs (cm cm? 3) per depth in each stand, for the whole data set of 576 soil cubes sampled between 2 years of age and the end of the rotation.

40|$|Seed vigor is a {{characteristic}} that determines potential for fast and uniform seedling emergence and establishment of crops. Such characteristic defines crop initial growth {{what could have}} direct and indirect effects on capacity of plants in capturing natural nutritive resources and intervene in their competition intra- and interspecific. Aiming at identifying and understanding the possible effects of seed vigor on crop initial growth a field experiment was performed during two years at University of S√£o Paulo, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; using two seed lots at each year, which were previously characterized by tests of physiological potential as high and low vigor. Thus, five different ratios (100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100) of seeds originating from seed lots with higher or lower vigor were used. Assessments were performed at the phenological stages of four and eight leaves by assessing plant height, stem diameter, and leaf area index. It was also observed that mean values for all variables assessed have increased according to increase of seeds with high vigor at <b>planting</b> <b>row.</b> Therefore, it is concluded that increased percentage of seeds with high vigor results in greater initial growth of cron crop until phenological stage of eight leaves. 201...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} plant density and weed {{interference}} on sunflower yield and its attributes and also to determine the response of grain filling period in sunflower to plant density and weed interference, a factorial experiment was carried out using randomized complete block design with 3 replicates at research site of university of Mohaghegh Ardabili. Treatment were three levels of plant density (6, 8 and 10 plant m 2 as D 1 , D 2 and D 3, respectively) and 2 levels of weed control (weedy and weed free). Results indicated that plant density had significant effects on sunflower growth characteristics. The highest grain yield obtained from D 2 . The highest 1000 -grain weight, grain per head, stem and head diameter, dry matter, yield per plant and harvest index recorded at D 1 , while D 3 showed the highest values of plant height and percentage of hollow grains. The levels of weed control did not affected sunflower yield and yield attributes significantly (except number of grain per head) that probably due to soil salinity, weed genus, <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> space, density and high tolerance of sunflower to weeds. The highest rate and duration of grain filling recorded at D 1 in both levels of weed treatments. Furthermore, D 1 showed the highest mean of final grain weight, that probably due to effects of density on light interception by canopy...|$|E
40|$|Objective„Äë In {{order to}} {{research}} the effect of biodiversity on spatial distribution of Sitobion avenae in wheat, the population density of S. avenae was investigated in wheat fields in Langfang Experimental Station of Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, using wheat intercropped with pea by different patterns, and the field cultivar monoculture of wheat was planted as control. „ÄêMethod„ÄëUsing the Geographical Information System(GIS) and the traditional analysis methods of spatial distribution, the Kriging-interpolation figures, aggregation indices, Iwao and Taylor‚Ä≤s regression models were analyzed. „ÄêResult„ÄëThe {{results showed that the}} spatial distribution of S. avenae was mainly aggregation distribution in intercropping patterns of wheat and pea, by the <b>planting</b> <b>row</b> of pea : wheat in 2 Ô∏∞ 2, 2 Ô∏∞ 4, 2 Ô∏∞ 6, 2 Ô∏∞ 8 and wheat monoculture, but the degrees of aggregation were different, 2 Ô∏∞ 2 pattern > 2 Ô∏∞ 6 pattern > 2 Ô∏∞ 4 pattern > wheat monoculture > 2 Ô∏∞ 8 pattern. Kriging-interpolation figures indicated that wheat aphids distributed mainly around the field during early stage, and spreaded to the middle of field gradually. There were many aggregation centers mostly at wheat monoculture and 2 Ô∏∞ 2 patterns plots during aphid peak period. Compared with each intercropping field, there were higher population densities of aphid in field cultivar monocultures at the level of P< 0. 01. „ÄêConclusion„ÄëAlthough the reasonable biodiversity in wheat fields could control the population of wheat aphid effectively, the spatial distribution did not change.
