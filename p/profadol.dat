50|$|<b>Profadol</b> (CI-572) is an opioid {{analgesic}} which {{was developed in}} the 1960s by Parke-Davis. It acts as a mixed agonist-antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor. The analgetic potency is about the same as of pethidine (meperidine), the antagonistic effect is 1/50 of nalorphine.|$|E
40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} between dextrorphan (10 mg/kg) and saline in a task in which 20 consecutive key pecks on either {{the left or right}} key, depending on whether dextrorphan or saline had been administered, produced food. During sessions in which stimulus generalization to other drugs was evaluated, 20 consecutive responses on either the dextrorphan- or saline-appropriate key produced food. Dextromethorphan and dexox-adrol produced dose-related stimulus control of behavior similar to that produced by dextrorphan. In contrast, the /-isomers of these compounds, levomethorphan, levoxadrol and levorphanol, at doses up to and including those that markedly decreased the rate of responding, produced responding primarily on the saline-appropriate key. In addition, both the d- and /-isomers of meth-adone, codeine, morphine, butorphanol and <b>profadol</b> resulted i...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a series of opiold drugs on urine output in the water-loaded rat were studied and also the block of those effects by the {{irreversible}} opiold receptor antagonist, j 3 -funaltrexamine (8 -FNA). Fentanyl, d-propoxyphene, <b>profadol,</b> bromadoline, bu-prenorphine and nalbuphine produced only a decrease in unne output, which was antagonised by pretreatment with $-FNA, 40 mg/kg s. c., 24 hr beforehand. These drugs were thus character-ized as selective mu receptor agonists. U- 50, 488, tifluadom, Mr 2034, proxorphan, ethylketocydazocine and butOrphanOl aN produced an initial decrease in unne output, which was antago-nized by f 3 -FNA, and therefore probably mu receptor mediated, followed by a 13 -FNA insensitive diuretic effect, which was prob-aty kappa receptor mediated. For U- 50, 488, tifluadom, Mr 2034 and proxorphan the threshold dose for increasing unne outpu...|$|E
40|$|In {{differentiated}} SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells, various opioids {{exhibited a}} wide range of potencies (K 1) in acutely inhib-iting adenylate cyclase to different extents (‘max). After exposure of the cells to opioids for 24 hr, the initially reduced cAMP content of the cells recovered toward pre-exposure levels. With-drawal of agonist from, or addition of antagonist to, the tolerant cells rapidly increased the cAMP content to 1. 5 times the basal value. Long term treatment of the cells with agonists of high acute potency, such as Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(Me) Phe-Gly-ol and levor-phanol, decreased the Bmax of the antagonist [3 H]naltrexone by 80 - 95 %, increased the K 2 for GTPase stimulation 1 0 - 14 -fold, and increased the K, for adenylate cyclase inhibition 2 - 3 -fold. On the other hand, these parameters were only marginally affected by agonists of lower acute potency, such as <b>profadol</b> and mor-phiceptin, regardless of their in inhibiting adenylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of membrane microviscosity on m-opioid agonist and antagonist binding, {{as well as}} ag-onist efficacy, was examined in membranes prepared from SH-SY 5 Y cells and from a C 6 glioma cell line stably expressing the rat m-opioid receptor (C 6 m). Addition of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) to cell membranes in-creased membrane microviscosity and reduced the in-hibitory effect of sodium and guanine nucleotides on the affinity of the full agonists sufentanil and [D-Ala 2,N-MePhe 4,Gly-ol 5]enkephalin (DAMGO) for the m-opioid re-ceptor. Binding of the antagonists [3 H]naltrexone and [3 H]diprenorphine and the partial agonist nalbuphine was unaffected by CHS. The effect of CHS on agonist binding was reversed by subsequent addition of cis-vaccenic acid, suggesting {{that the effect of}} CHS is the result of increased membrane microviscosity and not a specific sterol–receptor interaction. CHS addition increased the potency of DAMGO to stimulate guanosine- 59 -O-(3 -[35 S]thio) triphosphate binding by fourfold, whereas the potency of nalbuphine was unaffected. However, nalbu-phine efficacy relative to that of the full agonist DAMGO was strongly increased in CHS-treated membranes com-pared with that in control membranes. Membrane rigidi-fication also resulted in an increased efficacy for the partial agonists meperidine, <b>profadol,</b> and butorphanol relative to that of DAMGO as measured by agonist-stim-ulated GTPase activity in control and CHS-modified membranes. These findings support a regulatory role for membrane microviscosity in receptor-mediated G protein activation.
