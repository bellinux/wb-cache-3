40|$|This {{case report}} of a school boy {{with a history of}} severe and {{repeated}} episodes of epistaxis presents a short overview of the clinical and laboratory findings which lead to confirm the suspected diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (vWD). Suspicion of defective <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> should arise when unusual (because of their number or duration) mucosal bleeds appear in an otherwise normal and healthy patient. Because of its definitive inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation, acetylsalicylic acid (more than other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exerting unselective inhibition of cyclooxygenase) is a strong factor in triggering or sustaining the bleeding disorders in these patients. Among the congenital disorder of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis,</b> vWD {{is by far the most}} frequent one. The difficulties of laboratory diagnosis of vWD are stressed; the promises and pitfalls of new in vitro methods for measuring <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> (PFA- 100 analyzer) are discussed. An accurate diagnosis of the specific type of vWD is of critical importance for correct patient management as well as for genetic counseling...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Mild {{hypothermia}} (32 - 35 °C) impairs <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> and coagulation. Correction {{of these}} haemostatic impairments by rewarming alone {{may not be}} possible or desirable, particularly in major trauma, neuroanaesthesia and in critically ill patients. Pharmacological treatment of these impairments, if available, may be a useful alternative. Desmopressin has been used to treat various congenital and acquired platelet disorders, but its effects on hypothermia-induced impairment of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> is not known. This study aims to investigate the in vitro effects of desmopressin on hypothermia-induced impairment of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> using PFA- 100 ® platelet function analyzer. Methods: Whole blood was collected from 20 healthy volunteers, divided into 2. 7 ml aliquots and some incubated at 32 °C, and others at 37 °C as control. Three log doses of desmopressin (0. 01, 0. 1 or 1 nM) were added to aliquots at 32 °C, and saline was added to controls at both 32 and 37 °C, all in 0. 1 ml volume. After incubating for 30 min, closure times (CT) was measured by PFA- 100 ® using both collagen/epinephrine (adrenaline) (Col/EPI) and collagen/adenosine- 5 ′-diphosphate (Col/ADP) cartridges. Results: CT was prolonged by 30. 9 % (Col/EPI) and 18. 8 % (Col/ADP) at 32 °C, respectively, compared to 37 °C (P < 0. 001). All the three doses of desmopressin significantly, but incompletely corrected CT prolongation due to hypothermia (P < 0. 002). Conclusion: Desmopressin partially reverses hypothermia-induced impairment of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> in vitro, and may be potentially useful in improving haemostasis in hypothermic patients with bleeding where immediate rewarming is difficult or undesirable. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Summary - This paper {{illustrates}} {{the difficulties of}} accurately assessing the coagulation profile due {{to the complexity of}} this system, which is strictly related to inflammatory conditions. Moreover, the classical interpretation of the blood coagulation cascade has been reviewed, and some new highlights pointed out. Currently, several tests are available to explore <b>primary</b> or secondary <b>haemostasis</b> as well as fibrinolysis. The decision to use a preliminary panel of tests readily accessible to veterinarians in practice is worthy. Tests included in the preliminary panel should give a basic interpretation in the several steps of coagulation with good sensitivity and specificity. Then, depending on the results obtained, more detailed assays could be used in order to characterize the defect or the exact deficiency in haemostasis...|$|R
40|$|The {{adhesion}} of platelets to collagen {{and their}} activation is the <b>primary</b> event in <b>haemostasis.</b> Following adhesion, platelet aggregation mediated by ADP, thromboxane A 2 and thrombin {{leads to the}} formation of a platelet plug. It is known that platelet activation by each of these agonists involves an increase in the cytosolic free Ca 2 + concentration, and this has been thought to be controlled by cyclic AMP. However, we report here that while signal transduction induced by ADP plus a thromboxane mimetic (U 46619), or by thrombin, is inhibited by stimulators of adenylate cyclase such as a prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2) analogue (Iloprost), PGD 2 and forskolin, elevation of cyclic AMP does not inhibit either platelet adhesion to collagen or the associated Ca 2 + mobilization, phosphatidic acid formation or 5 -hydroxytryptamine secretion. Furthermore, collagen did not lower elevated levels of cyclic AMP in platelets measured in the presence of both a thromboxane antagonist and an ADP-removing system. The present results are discussed in the context of previous findings...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{vessel wall}} injury {{platelets}} rapidly {{adhere to the}} exposed subendothelial matrix which is mediated by several cellular receptors present on platelets or endothelial cells and various adhesive proteins such as von Willebrand factor, collagen and fibrinogen. Subsequent platelet activation results in the recruitment of additional platelets and the generation of platelet aggregates forming a stable platelet plug. In addition, activated platelets form a strong link between <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>haemostasis</b> as they provide the phospholipid surface that {{is necessary for the}} assembly of activated coagulation factor complexes required for thrombin generation. Other than the physiological function acting as a first line of defence against bleeding, platelets may also contribute to pathological thrombus formation. Platelets {{play an important role in}} thromboembolic diseases and may contribute to the formation of occlusive thrombi which can lead to severe complications such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Improved understanding of the respective roles of the various cellular receptors, adhesive proteins and regulatory proteins involved in platelet-vessel wall interaction and subsequent thrombus formation, both under physiological and pathological conditions, has led to the development and investigation of a broad range of antiplatelet drugs. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the mechanisms involved in the interaction between platelets and vascular endothelium and discusses recent advancements in the development of drugs interfering with platelet-vessel wall interaction at various stages of thrombus formatio...|$|R
40|$|Background. Laboratory {{evaluation}} is indicated when a disorder of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> is suspected by a personal or {{family history of}} easy bruising, nose bleeds, menorrhagia or postoperative bleeding, especially following dental extraction or tonsillectomy. The traditional procedures to diagnose defect in <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> are bleeding time, measurement of von Willebrand factor and platelet aggregometry. The most widely used screening test is bleeding time. Despite attempts at standardisation, the bleeding time remains poorly reproducible and is relatively insensitive to platelet function defects. Recently, a new test method, the platelet function analyser (PFA- 100) has been introduced for the investigation of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis.</b> PFA- 100 measures the ability of platelets activated in a high-shear environment to occlude an aperture in membrane treated with collagen and epinephrine and/or collagen and ADP. The time taken for flow across the membrane to stop (closure time) is recorded. Conclusions. This article highlights the benefits and limitations of the clinical utility of the PFA- 100.  Because of its simplicity and excellent sensitivity the PFA- 100 is useful mainly as a screening test for von Willebrand disease, hereditary and acquired platelet-dysfunctions including acetylsalicylic acidinduced abnormalities. Recently the PFA- 100 {{has been shown to}} be of value in monitoring antiplatelet therapy and in monitoring desmopressin treatment in von Willebrand disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{bleeding}} time is frequently used to screen <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> before surgical procedures, although it poorly predicts {{the risk of}} hemorrhage. The platelet function analyzer (PFA), which {{is also used to}} screen <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis,</b> has a higher sensitivity and other advantages, like patient friendliness, higher degree of objectivity and analytical reliability, but needs more extensive clinical validation. METHODS: We compared the predictive values of the PFA-CTs (closure times) and {{bleeding time}} for bleeding events after renal biopsy. We prospectively evaluated the complications in patients that underwent a renal biopsy and were screened with PFA in advance (n= 170). For comparison we used a historical cohort of patients screened with the bleeding time (n= 132). RESULTS: When the PFA-CTs were normal, 26. 0 % of the patients had a mild bleeding event after the biopsy, which did not differ from the event rate with a normal bleeding time (29. 4 %). When one or both PFA-CTs were prolonged, 51. 3 % of the patients had post-biopsy bleeding events independently of the measures to correct the closure time(s), significantly more than with either a prolonged bleeding time (26. 7 %) or normal PFA-CTs (26. 0 %). CONCLUSION: For bleeding events, the PFA has a higher positive and similar negative predictive value compared to the bleeding time. Taken into account the additional advantages of the PFA like patient friendliness and better analytical qualities, we prefer the PFA over the bleeding time as a screening tool for <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> before performing a renal biopsy...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{cirrhosis}} {{can have}} abnormalities in laboratory tests reflecting changes in <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis,</b> including bleeding time, platelet function tests, markers of platelet activation, and platelet count. Such {{changes have been}} considered particularly relevant in the bleeding complications that occur in cirrhosis. However, several {{studies have shown that}} routine diagnostic tests, such as platelet count, bleeding time, PFA- 100, thromboelastography are not clinically useful to stratify bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, treatments used to increase platelet count or to modulate platelet function could potentially do harm. Consequently the optimal management of bleeding complications is still a matter of discussion. Moreover, {{in the last two decades}} there has been an increased recognition that not only bleeding but also thrombosis complicates the clinical course of cirrhosis. Thus, we performed a literature search looking at publications studying both qualitative and quantitative aspects of platelet function to verify which <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> defects occur in cirrhosis. In addition, we evaluated the contribution of qualitative and quantitative aspects of platelet function to the clinical outcome in cirrhosis and their therapeutic management according to the data available in the literature. From the detailed analysis of the literature, it appears clear that <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> may not be defective in cirrhosis, and a low platelet count should not necessarily be considered as an automatic index of an increased risk of bleeding. Conversely, caution should be observed in patients with severe thrombocytopenia where its correction is advised if bleeding occurs and before invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. © 2011 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

40|$|Fibrinogen is {{the major}} plasma protein {{coagulation}} factor. Low plasma fibrinogen concentrations are therefore {{associated with an increased}} risk of bleeding due to impaired <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>haemostasis.</b> Fibrinogen is a classical positive acute-phase reactant protein and is an independent predictor of coronary heart g disease events. This review considers available methods for measurement of fibrinogen and makes recommendations as to their appropriate use. Total clottable fibrinogen assays are the definitive and reference method for plasma fibrinogen measurement. However, they are time-consuming and are rarely required in clinical practice. Clotting rate assays remain the routine method of choice for investigation, monitoring and treatment of bleeding disorders associated with low plasma fibrinogen concentrations. They are appropriately sited in haematology or haemostasis laboratories, with facilities for further relevant investigations, and expert advice from consultant haematologists on appropriate management. They have also been used in the majority of studies investigating increasing fibrinogen concentrations as a cardiovascular risk factor. Prothrombin-time derived assays are widely used, because they are less expensive and come at no extra cost with prothrombin time assays. However, their results vary widely with analysers and reagents, show discrepancies with Clotting rate assays for both low and normal plasma fibrinogen samples, and at present they are not recommended by routine clinical use. Immunoassays (radial immunodiffusion, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or nephelometric) are useful in (a) differentiating hypofibrinogenaemia from dysfibrinogenaemia, and (b) assessing cardiovascular risk and acute-phase reactions. Unlike clottable fibrinogen assays, immunoassays can be performed in dipotassium edetate anticoagulated samples...|$|R
40|$|The liver is an {{essential}} player in the pathway of coagulation in both <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>haemostasis.</b> Only von Willebrand factor is not synthetised by the liver, thus liver failure is associated with impairment of coagulation. However, recently {{it has been shown}} that the delicate balance between pro and antithrombotic factors synthetised by the liver might be reset to a lower level in patients with chronic liver disease. Therefore, these patients might not be really anticoagulated in stable condition and bleeding may be caused only when additional factors, such as infections, supervene. Portal hypertension plays an important role in coagulopathy in liver disease, reducing the number of circulating platelets, but platelet function and secretion of thrombopoietin have been also shown to be impaired in patients with liver disease. Vitamin K deficiency may coexist, so that abnormal clotting factors are produced due to lack of gamma carboxylation. Moreover during liver failure, there is a reduced capacity to clear activated haemostatic proteins and protein inhibitor complexes from the circulation. Usually therapy for coagulation disorders in liver disease is needed only during bleeding or before invasive procedures. When end stage liver disease occurs, liver transplantation is the only treatment available, which can restore normal haemostasis, and correct genetic clotting defects, such as haemophilia or factor V Leiden mutation. During liver transplantation haemorrage may occur due to the pre-existing hypocoagulable state, the collateral circulation caused by portal hypertension and increased fibrinolysis which occurs during this surgery...|$|R

To achieve haemostasis without risk of local ischaemia and necrosis of kidney parenchyma after standard haemostatic suturing, we investigated TachoSil((R)) 's efficacy and safety as atraumatic haemostatic treatment after kidney tumour resection. METHODS: A total of 185 patients scheduled for NSS for small, superficial kidney tumours were included in an open, randomised, prospective, multicentre, parallel-group trial. Primary objectives were to test haemostatic efficacy and safety of TachoSil versus standard suturing. Efficacy was tested by comparing intraoperative time to <b>haemostasis</b> (<b>primary</b> end point). Secondary objectives included proportion of subjects with haemostasis after 10 min of trial treatment, occurrence of haematoma on day 2 after surgery, volume and haemoglobin concentration of postoperative drainage fluid, and surgeon's rating of usefulness of trial treatments. Safety was evaluated by occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population, time to haemostasis was significantly shorter with TachoSil versus standard suturing (mean: 5. 3 vs. 9. 5 min [p< 0. 0001]). Haemostasis was obtained within 10 min in 92 % of patients in the TachoSil group and in 67 % in the standard treatment group (p< 0. 0001). Differences in other secondary end points were not statistically significant. Both treatments were well tolerated. Surgeons rated TachoSil higher in terms of convenience to prepare and apply, and impression of efficacy. CONCLUSION: TachoSil was superior to standard suturing in obtaining intraoperative control of haemorrhage and was as well tolerated as standard haemostatic treatment during NSS. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Acquired Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) is an {{uncommon}} bleeding disorder caused by glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa-specific autoantibodies. Covering of the fibrinogen binding site of GPIIb/IIIa {{results in a}} moderate-to-severe bleeding tendency. We performed a diagnostic evaluation and evaluated the underlying risk factors in six patients with a bleeding tendency caused by acquired GT. One patient, with GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies of the immunoglobulin G 2 (IgG 2) subclass, used diclophenac and recovered after discontinuation of this drug. A second patient was primarily diagnosed with multiple angiodysplastic lesions. In this patient, the acquired GT was caused by GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies of the IgG 4 subclass that was treated with DDAVP and platelet transfusions. A third patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma and anti-GPIIb/IIIa of the IgG 2 subclass was treated for haemorrhagic diathesis with corticosteroids and azathioprin. A fourth patient, with IgG 2 anti-GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies, diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma, responded well to treatment of an axillary mass with local radiotherapy.

40|$|Changes in {{coagulation}} parameters {{were studied}} in dogs naturally infected with Babesia canis canis (n = 30), and haemostasis was evaluated and compared to values obtained from healthy dogs (n = 29). To date, there {{have not been}} any studies examining the dynamics of thrombin-antithrombin complex formation in cases of canine babesiosis. Coagulation parameters evaluated before (day 0) and on days 1, 2, and 3 after treatment with imidocarb (6 mg/kg inj. s. c.) included the determination of platelet counts, the formation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), prothrombin time (PT), {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) and antithrombin III (AT III) activity. TAT complexes were significantly elevated in animals with babesiosis on days 0 and 2 (mean 49. 7 and 87. 7 μg/L vs. control, 7. 2 μg/L). AT III activity was significantly decreased at all time-points examined. There were no differences in PT. On days 2 and 3 the APTT was significantly shortened in the infected dogs when compared to control animals (means of 21. 3 and 19. 2 s vs. control, 30. 0 s).

40|$|The procoagulant {{platelet}} is characterised by {{its ability}} to support functional prothrombinase and links <b>primary</b> to secondary <b>haemostasis.</b> Excess procoagulant activity is linked to pathological thrombosis, however {{the identity of the}} procoagulant platelet has been elusive to date. Many of the biochemical and morphological features of the procoagulant platelet are common to the cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) necrosis pathway. Platelet apoptosis, on the other hand, is thought to be involved in regulating a platelet’s lifespan. Whilst the procoagulant platelet has features akin to cell death, their precise nature is unknown, as progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of a suitable and specific marker. GSAO [4 -(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl) amino) phenylarsenoxide] can label cells with a compromised plasma membrane when conjugated to reporter groups. This thesis shows that highly activated platelet subset undergoes Cyp-D mediated necrosis and provides the surface for coagulation assembly, thrombin generation and fibrin formation. The necrotic phenotype can be identified in flow cytometry analysis by co-expression of GSAO and P-selectin, with the major ligand for GSAO in necrotic platelets being thromboxane synthase- 1 via a dithiol covalent linkage. This thesis demonstrates that necrotic platelets are functionally procoagulant, by means of global coagulation assays. Correlation studies surface FXa and platelet dependent peak thrombin generation indicates that GSAO can be used a s a surrogate marker for the procoagulant platelet. In vivo, platelet necrosis is present in the occlusive 10 % ferric chloride injury model and is minimally present in the non-occlusive laser injury model, demonstrating that necrotic platelets are formed in thrombi, but only in the context of certain stimuli. This thesis demonstrates that cyclophilin D is a promising target for inhibition of procoagulant platelet formation. Platelet activation and necrosis pathways are uncoupled and an enhanced benefit is seen when both pathways are targeted in combination. GSAO is a valuable probe that can investigate biological factors potentiating procoagulant platelet formation.

40|$|Stroke is {{the most}} common {{life-threatening}} neurological disease, the clinical sequelae are serious. The genesis is multifactorial with strong interactions between genetic and environmental factors. As stroke and its sequelae consume huge resources of the public health the prevention is of great importance. The first step for that is the identification of people with high stroke risk to which more and more alleles of susceptibility are searched for. The von Willebrand factor (vWF) {{plays an important role in}} the interaction of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>haemostasis.</b> Various polymorphisms of the gene encoding vWF are known. The Sma I polymorphism is located in intron 2 of vWF, and is strongly associated with increased risk of acute ischaemic stroke in a Chinese case-control study. But until now there is no investigation of this association in a Caucasian population. It is merely known that the allele frequencies between both ethnic groups differ considerably. In a geriatric hospital in Berlin, 140 patients with non-cardioembolic cerebral infarction and 209 control subjects of the same age were recruited and examined for the Sma I polymorphism. The aim of the present case-control study was to determine the correlation between that polymorphism and ischaemic strokes among Caucasians as well as to compare the result with the Chinese study. The prevalence of the CC genotype in stroke patients was not significantly higher than that of the controls (OR= 1. 14; p= 0. 56). As well there was no significant difference with regard to the frequencies for the C allele (OR= 1. 21; p= 0. 41) that correspond in both groups to the published frequency among Caucasians. Even after exclusion of the stroke patients without documented carotid atherosclerosis there was a trend to a higher prevalence of the CC genotype, but no significance (OR= 1. 32; p= 0. 25). However, a significant difference regarding the genotype prevalences was found between the Berlin population and the Chinese one (p= 0. 018). In conclusion, the Sma I polymorphism in the vWF gene is not associated with non-cardiogenic cerebral infarction in a Berlin population. With it, this population differs significantly from a Chinese one. That polymorphism may represent a risk factor for ischaemic stroke in Chinese, but not in Caucasians. This result joins numerous moleculargenetic investigations into the correlation between haemostatic factors and atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis which altogether showed inconsistent results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionHaemostasis after liver {{resection}} may {{be difficult}} to achieve {{as a result of the}} presence of challenging bleeding, the anatomic landscape of the liver and the quality of tissue making up the hepatic parenchyma. The fibrin pad (FP) is a topical absorbable haemostat designed to be effective in a variety of tissues and across multiple bleeding intensities. This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the hemostat's safety and effectiveness in controlling bleeding during elective hepatic resection. MethodsThis prospective, randomized, controlled superiority trial enrolled 104 subjects undergoing elective hepatectomy in 5 countries. After parenchymal transection, subjects with an appropriately defined target bleeding site (TBS) were stratified according to the type of hepatic parenchyma and immediately randomized 1 : 1 : FP versus Standard of Care (SoC). SoC comprised manual compression with the use of an approved topical absorbable haemostat. The <b>primary</b> endpoint was <b>haemostasis</b> at 4 [*]min from identification of the TBS, with no re‐bleeding requiring re‐treatment prior to abdominal closure. Results were stratified for both normal and abnormal (steatosis or cirrhosis) hepatic parenchyma. All subjects were followed for 60 days post‐operatively. ResultsThe intent‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis showed an overall treatment difference of 53. 0 % (P < 0. 001), 82. 5 % (33 / 40 FP) versus 29. 5 % (13 / 44 SoC) in achieving haemostasis at 4 [*]min with no re‐bleeding requiring treatment up to wound closure. The per protocol analysis showed an overall treatment difference of 65. 7 % (P < 0. 001), with 33 / 35 successes (94. 3 %) in the FP group and 12 / 42 in the SoC group (28. 6 %). The stratification results showed treatment differences between the normal parenchyma group, 63. 6 % (95. 8 % FP versus 32. 3 % SoC P < 0. 001) and a larger difference of 72. 7 % in the abnormal parenchyma group (90. 9 % FP versus 18. 2 % SoC P = 0. 0003). Post‐operative intra‐abdominal fluid collections were less frequent in the FP group (3. 4 % FP versus 13. 3 % SoC P = 0. 059). There was no difference in the safety profile between the FP or SoC groups. ConclusionsThe FP is safe and effective when used as an adjunct to achieve haemostasis during hepatic surgery. The success rate of achieving haemostasis with a FP remained high compared with the SOC group, especially in steatotic or cirrhotic liver tissue where the control success rates diminish. In addition, FP treatment of hepatic parenchymal surfaces may reduce the risk of post‐operative biliary and fluid collections...|$|R
40|$|The {{brain is}} a highly fragile organ kept {{separated}} in its unique environment by specialised brain barriers, mainly the aptly named blood-brain barrier (BBB). Apart from being a physical barrier, the BBB also functions as a transport barrier to strictly govern the balance of ions and molecules that traverse between the blood and the brain. In a number of neuropathological conditions, particularly in the highly prevalent and debilitating conditions of stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), {{the integrity of the}} BBB becomes compromised leading to the dysregulated migration of blood constituents such as platelets, into the brain. Platelets are best known for their <b>primary</b> role in <b>haemostasis.</b> However, it is also known that platelets partake in several non-haemostatic events including immune regulation, angiogenesis, wound healing {{as well as in the}} propagation and migration of cancerous cells. The association of platelets with multiple roles has been attributed to the extensive inventory of bioactive molecules that are released by platelets or exposed on the platelet surface upon platelet activation. Due to its participation in wound repair, platelets in the form of “platelet concentrates” have been exogenously applied in clinical settings to accelerate the recovery of various organs such as skin, tendon, muscle and bone. Surprisingly, despite its widespread use, there is a clear lack of mechanistic insight into precisely how platelets aid in the recovery of these organs. With regard to the role of platelets in the brain, intriguingly, published studies to date have focussed solely on the thrombotic actions of platelets. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the non-thrombotic roles of platelets in the brain. This project builds upon the understanding that upon BBB breakdown, platelets again unimpeded access into the brain where they become activated and release hundreds of bioactive molecules. These bioactive platelet-released molecules (PRMs) have direct contact with injured neurons and thereby may influence brain injury. To address this aim, we show that cerebrospinal fluid from human TBI patients contain elevated levels of soluble GPVI (a platelet marker) compared to cerebrospinal fluid from non-TBI patients; with the mean levels of soluble GPVI measured at 35. 42 ng/mL versus 0 ng/mL, respectively. Interestingly, the amount of GPVI detected within cerebrospinal fluid of TBI patients is comparable to that observed in the plasma of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Next, using a mouse model of TBI, we document that platelet deposition is not confined within cerebral vasculature but that platelets also extravasate in considerable number into the surrounding brain parenchyma. The deposition of platelets within the brain after TBI coincides with BBB breakdown and plasma extravasation. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that platelets that deposit in the brain after TBI become activated thereby intimating the presence of bioactive PRMs with the injured brain. Having established that PRMs do indeed come in contact with injured neurons, we used primary neuronal cultures to study the effects of PRMs on injured neurons. We find that PRMs profoundly protect neurons against injuries induced by etoposide or linsidomine. Contrastingly, PRMs have no influence on the viability of neurons that are challenged with glutamate or subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions. In our neuronal culture system, both etoposide and linsidomine induce apoptosis whereas glutamate and oxygen-glucose deprivation induce necrosis. Therefore, we show that PRMs selectively protect neurons from undergoing apoptosis but have no effect on necrotic injuries. We further demonstrate that the introduction of PRMs after the induction of apoptosis dampens neuronal injury, highlighting the presence of a therapeutic window for the cytoprotective capabilities of PRMs. This remarkable neuroprotective effect of PRMs has never been previously described. Altogether, our novel finding of a selective cytoprotective role of PRMs in neurons extends current understanding of the non-thrombotic role of platelets in the brain. Due to the paucity in efficacious cytoprotective therapies for neuropathological conditions, the isolation of neuroprotective molecule(s) coupled with the identification of how PRMs protect neurons will certainly be beneficial. Studies into these areas will open novel avenues to develop therapeutic strategies that may ultimately impact on the treatment and recovery of patients that sustain brain injury. Accordingly, we further pursued two avenues of investigation: 1) to determine which molecule(s) within the plethora of bioactive PRMs are responsible for its cytoprotective actions and 2) to determine the neuronal signal transduction events that mediate the cytoprotective actions of PRMs. To address the first objective, we separated PRMs into fractions using ion-exchange chromatography and assessed the capacity of these fractions to inhibit apoptosis. We uncovered several fractions that significantly prevent apoptosis. Within these fractions, we identified 6 candidate anti-apoptotic proteins namely: haemoglobin, profilin-I, GAPDH, aldolase A, immunoglobulin and CXCL 7. Importantly, these identified molecules have no known thrombotic actions. Consistent with this notion, we show that 5 out of the 7 cytoprotective fractions do not cause platelet aggregation. Thus, we have not only narrowed the identities of cytoprotective molecules within PRMs to a number of candidates, but also uncoupled the cytoprotective function of platelets from their pro-thrombotic role; thereby substantially increasing the therapeutic potential of PRMs. To address the second objective, we used a phospho-protein microarray to show that in etoposide-injured neurons, PRMs cause differential up-regulation of 25 molecules and down-regulation of 44 molecules. Based on this, we find that neuronal activation of the following kinases: p 38 α, JNK 1, JAK 1 and DNA-PK, mediates the cytoprotective actions of PRMs. Interestingly, the anti-apoptotic action of PRMs is not restricted to neurons, as we find that PRMs also protect human U 937 cells (a leukaemic monocyte lymphoma cell line) from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. The ability of PRMs and its fractions to inhibit apoptosis in U 937 cells denotes that in addition to the other known contributions of platelets to tumour growth and progression, platelets also confer significant protection to cancerous cells against chemotherapy. As such, efforts to counteract the anti-apoptotic effect of PRMs represent an interesting prospect to reduce chemoresistance of tumour cells and thereby improve cancer prognosis. Taken together, our findings of an anti-apoptotic role of platelets have implications not only for brain injury where there is a clear lack of neuroprotective therapies; but also bears substantial consequences to treatment of cancer whereby chemoresistance of cancer cells remains a major challenge. Given that platelet concentrates are currently used in clinical settings to aid recovery, this highlights the clinical applicability of our findings. Altogether, we provide novel evidence supporting the applicability of platelet concentrates in any situation where platelet activation and widespread apoptosis coincide...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of a gelatin-based plasma expander on blood coagulation and haemostasis in human subjects. Six healthy men were studied in a randomised, controlled cross-over study to investigate the effects of a 60 min intravenous infusion of either 1 l gelatin-based plasma substitute (Gelofusine) or 0. 9 % NaCl (control). The infusion of gelatin resulted in a 1. 7 fold increase in bleeding time at 60 min and a 1. 4 fold increase at 120 min, while saline had no effect (p < 0. 05). Aggregation studies revealed a significant impairment of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (p < 0. 05), associated with a substantial decrease of vWF:ag (- 32 % vs. - 5 %, p < 0. 05) and ristocetin co-factor (- 29 % vs. + 1 %, p < 0. 05) and without in vitro impairment of the platelet glycoprotein 1 b receptor. Gelatin caused a decrease in thrombin-antithrombin complexes (- 45 % vs. - 4 %, p < 0. 05) and F 1 + 2 (- 40 % vs. + 1 %, p < 0. 05). The decrease in circulating levels of vWF:ag, vWF R:Co, thrombin-antithrombin complexes and F 1 + 2 was more than could be expected by the calculated plasma-dilution generated by Gelofusine. Our results demonstrated that the administration of a gelatin-based plasma substitute results in a significant impairment of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> and thrombin generation. The defect in <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> appears to be related to a gelatin-induced reduction in von Willebrand factor, whereas the decreased thrombin generation may be due to the dilution of coagulation factors induced by Gelofusin...|$|E

40|$|Septic shock is {{frequently}} seen {{in intensive care}} units and is associated with significant mortality. Endotoxin – a major mediator of the pathophysiologic responses – is released during lysis of Gram-negative bacteria. These responses can be mimicked in the endotoxaemic pig. This thesis focuses on the following topics: the inflammatory and pathophysiological responses to various endotoxin doses and infusion patterns; covariations between endotoxin induced inflammatory and pathophysiological responses; whether the biological effects of endotoxin can be modulated by clopidogrel and whether tobramycin or ceftazidime reduce plasma cytokine levels. Endotoxin induced linear log-log cytokine and F 2 -isoprostane responses. Leukocyte and platelet responses, pulmonary compliance, circulatory variables as well as indicators of plasma leakage and hypoperfusion exhibited log-linear responses to the endotoxin dose. Biological responses to endotoxaemia such as inflammation, hypotension, hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction were more expressed when the organism was exposed to endotoxin at a higher rate. These results may facilitate the possibility to choose relevant endotoxin administration, when experiments are set up in order to evaluate certain responses to endotoxaemia. Correlation studies between cytokines, leukocytes, platelets and the endotoxin dose were {{in agreement with the}} well-known ability of endotoxin to induce cytokine expression and to activate both <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> and leukocytes. Free radical mediated lipid peroxidation and COX-mediated inflammation correlated to cytokine expression and organ dysfunction in endotoxaemic shock. Endotoxaemic pigs pretreated with clopidogrel, exhibited a trend towards less expressed deterioration of renal function, although blocking of ADP-induced <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> is not a key mediator of endotoxin induced deterioration of renal function. Tobramycin did not neutralise the biological effects of endotoxin or the plasma levels of endotoxin, suggesting that these antibiotics do not bind to endotoxin.

Since evaluation of platelet physiology in the particular patient group of preterm and term neon-atal infants is highly restricted for ethical reasons, there are hardly any data available in healthy and much less in extremely immature or ill neonates.

40|$|Canine {{bleeding}} disorders arise due to {{a multitude}} of conditions and require detailed clinical and laboratory investigation. A productive diagnostic approach depends on a thorough patient history, physical examination, haemostatic screening tests {{and an array of}} specific diagnostic tests. Patient history is necessary to assist determination of the onset, severity and possible aetiologies of a bleeding disorder. Similarly, a complete physical examination should ideally allow differentiation between disorders of primary and secondary haemostasis. Following this distinction, a variety of laboratory tests are indicated to further define the nature of the bleeding episode. These tests may be broadly categorised as screening tests of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis,</b> secondary haemostasis and fibrinolysis, and specific tests directed at identifying particular disorders.

40|$|To {{investigate}} pre-analytical {{variables and}} the diagnostic performance of the platelet function analyser (PFA- 100), a new device to test <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis</b> in vitro by simulating platelet adhesion and aggregation under high shear stress. Venous whole citrated blood is aspirated through a capillary towards an aperture of a collagen coated membrane containing either adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or epinephrine (EPI). The time needed for occluding this aperture by plug formation is called closure time (CT) and was assessed in 70 healthy subjects and 43 patients with a suspected mild bleeding disorder. The reference range for the PFA- 100 {{was found to be}} 82 - 159 s for EPI-CT and 62. 5 - 120. 5 s for ADP-CT. Duplicate analyses revealed a mean coefficient of variations of 7. 1 % (EPI-CT) and 5. 7 % (ADP-CT). The EPI- and ADP-CT of blood samples collected in the evening were significantly longer (p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 004, respectively) than the CT of blood samples collected in the morning. Acetylsalicylic acid(100 mg, 300 mg or 500 mg) administered as a single dose or daily on 10 consecutive days resulted in a prolongation of the EPI-CT, whereas the ADP-CT was not affected. EPI-CT was more sensitive in detecting acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) ingestion than was the bleeding time (BT). Sensitivity and specificity of the PFA- 100 to detect von Willebrand disease (vWD) were comparable to the results obtained with the BT. The PFA- 100 represents a simple and easy to use test for investigation of <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis.</b> Limitations of the system are: special citrated whole blood has to be proceeded within 0. 5 to 4 h after sampling, duplicate measurements are necessary, and the results differ between blood sampled in the morning or in the afternoon.

Its use is preferable to BT determination, because it is less invasive and more sensitive to abnormalities of primary haemostasi...|$|E
30|$|Haemostasis is {{the process}} by which {{bleeding}} is arrested, when blood vessels are damaged. It occurs in three steps rapidly: vasoconstriction, platelet plug formation and coagulation (fibrin clot formation) (Marieb and Hoehn 2010). Vasoconstriction or vascular spasm involves the constriction of vessels in order to prevent the blood flow. This is followed by the aggregation of platelets, which form a temporary plug at the site of injury, releasing certain chemical messengers such as thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and serotonin. This causes more platelets to arrive at the site of injury, clump together leading to platelet plug formation and is termed as <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis.</b> The final step of haemostasis (secondary haemostasis) is the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin threads. These fibrin threads along with platelet plug forms a solid clot to seal the injured vessel wall to prevent blood loss (Porrett et al. 2005; Zdanowicz 2002).|$|E
40|$|Platelets, {{known for}} their role in <b>primary</b> <b>haemostasis,</b> prevent {{excessive}} bleeding after injury. The study of platelets has, therefore, traditionally focused on bleeding disorders. It has recently become evident, however, that platelet research can contribute to unravelling the disease mechanisms that underlie neuropathological disorders that have a subtle subclinical platelet phenotype. Platelets and neurosecretory cells have common gene expression profiles and share several biological features. This review provides a literature update {{on the use of}} platelets as easily accessible cells to study neurological disorders. We provide examples of the use of different platelet-based tests to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for both complex and monogenetic neuropathological disorders.
