5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to Press Your Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and <b>prizes</b> {{and attempting to}} avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it.

After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or <b>prizes,</b> and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in round one reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and <b>prizes</b> of similar values also appeared.|$|E
