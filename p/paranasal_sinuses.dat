40|$|Genotype-phenotype {{correlations}} in {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) {{have been found}} for lung and pancreatic function, but not for <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease. Because such correlations may have pathophysiological and clinical implications, the correlation of mutations, in particular DeltaF 508, with <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was investigated in 113 CF patients with known genotype. The clinical importance of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was evaluated using three parameters: polyps, overall clinical severity of upper airway problems, and surgery. Polyps were evaluated by nasal endoscopy and graded on a five-point scale. Four severity groups were distinguished based on history, clinical records, and examination: no upper airway problems; more problems than in control subjects; severe, recurrent or chronic problems; and <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> surgery cases. DeltaF 508 homozygosity correlated with clinical severity (p < 0. 02) and {{with the presence of}} polyps on endoscopy (p < 0. 05). The relative risk for <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> surgery in DeltaF 508 homozygous CF patients was 2. 33.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe study aims were {{to assess}} the {{association}} of microflora between the <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> and the lower airways of children attending a regional paediatric cystic fibrosis centre and to determine the performance of an eradication treatment protocol for positive <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> samples. MethodPaired nasal lavage and lower airway samples (cough swabs or sputum) were taken from 54 children with cystic fibrosis (median age 11 years). Positive <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> samples received eradication treatment, using oral and sinonasal nebulised antibiotics. ResultsA correlation between <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> and lower airways was detected in 33 / 54 paired timed samples (p< 0. 02). Of 4 / 54 children who reported sinus symptoms, only 2 had <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> positive samples. 28 positive nasal lavage samples cultured 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), 8 Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and 12 other bacterial pathogens. Eradication using sinonasal nebulised antibiotics and oral antibiotics showed a success of 14 / 21 (67 %) treated <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> positive samples at 1 month & 3 months after treatment. Success rate was 75 % in the PA group and 71 % in the SA group. Ongoing monitoring with nasal lavage will continue. ConclusionThere was agreement between pathogens or lack of them found in the <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> and lower airways. Paranasal infection is often asymptomatic in children with cystic fibrosis. The eradication protocol for <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> pathogens had a good success rate...|$|R

Background: The association between diabetes and <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: We cross-sectionally investigated the association between diabetes and the presence of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease, which was confirmed by a head MRI scan in 1350 adults who underwent a health screening program focusing on brain diseases and metabolic syndrome. Logistic regression, which was adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension, smoking status, alcohol intake, and white blood cell count, was performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of having <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease among adults with diabetes in relation to those without. The dose-response relationship between hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) levels and the presence of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was also investigated. Results: Of the 1350 participants (mean age, 61. 6 ± 10. 0 years; 71. 6 % men), 220 diabetes cases were identified. <b>Paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was diagnosed in 151 adults. The adjusted OR of having <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease was 1. 74 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 12 – 2. 71) in those with diabetes. The odds of having <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease increased with HbA 1 c levels. Compared to those with HbA 1 c of ≤ 5. 4 %, those with HbA 1 c of 5. 5 %– 6. 4 %, 6. 5 %– 7. 9 %, and ≥ 8. 0 % {{were more likely to have}} <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease, with adjusted ORs of 1. 32 (95 % CI, 0. 88 – 1. 98), 1. 63 (95 % CI, 0. 86 – 3. 09) and 2. 71 (95 % CI, 1. 12 – 6. 61), respectively (P for trend = 0. 019).

25|$|Mucus in the <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> {{is equally}} thick {{and may also}} cause {{blockage}} of the sinus passages, leading to infection. This may cause facial pain, fever, nasal drainage, and headaches. Individuals with CF may develop overgrowth of the nasal tissue (nasal polyps) due to inflammation from chronic sinus infections. Recurrent sinonasal polyps can occur in 10% to 25% of CF patients. These polyps can block the nasal passages and increase breathing difficulties.|$|E
25|$|CST most {{commonly}} results from contiguous spread of infection from a nasal furuncle (50%), sphenoidal or ethmoidal sinuses (30%) and dental infections (10%). Less common primary sites of infection include tonsils, soft palate, middle ear, or orbit (orbital cellulitis). The highly anastomotic venous {{system of the}} <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> allows retrograde spread of infection to the cavernous sinus via the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins.

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the relationship between nasal septal deviation, concha bullosa, and chronic rhinosinusitis by using a definitive pathological and simplified model. Fifty-two consecutive sinus computed tomography scans were performed on patients who received endoscopic sinus surgery and whose final diagnosis was <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> fungus balls. The incidences of nasal septal deviation and concha bullosa for patients diagnosed with <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> fungus balls among the study group were 42. 3 % and 25 %, respectively. About 63. 6 % sinuses with fungus balls were located on the ipsilateral side of the nasal septal deviation, and 46. 2 % were located on the ipsilateral side of the concha bullosa. When examined by Pearson’s chi-square test and the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, no significant statistical difference {{for the presence of}} <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> fungus balls between ipsilateral and contralateral sides of nasal septal deviation and concha bullosa was noted (P= 0. 292 and P= 0. 593, resp.).

500|$|These earlier {{works were}} {{followed}} after the Second World War by {{the publication of}} Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Larynx (1949). This work was a condensed and updated version of Negus's original 1929 work on the larynx. It was in this post-war period that Negus would increasingly study {{the function of the}} nose, both as the organ for the sense of smell (olfaction) {{and the role of the}} nose in respiration. This was prompted by wartime damage in 1941 to the Royal College of Surgeons' Hunterian Museum, which included the loss of parts of the Onodi Collection. This collection had contained specimens of the accessory sinuses (<b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses)</b> prepared by the Hungarian laryngologist Adolf Onodi (1857–1919) and demonstrated by him in 1900. Negus undertook to replace the destroyed and damaged specimens and to extend the collection with animal specimens. This work was covered in Negus's Hunterian Lecture, delivered on 20 May 1954 at the Royal College of Surgeons under the title [...] "Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses". This was followed four years later by the publication of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Nose and <b>Paranasal</b> <b>Sinuses</b> (1958). Much of this later work was carried out after retirement in 1952, both at the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons and at the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology at the Middlesex Hospital. Negus's research over many years on these topics and their relation to nose and throat surgery led to the awarding of the 1954 Lister Medal. This was presented the following year when Negus delivered the Lister Oration on 5 April 1955 at the Royal College of Surgeons. The oration was titled [...] "The Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory Tract in Relation to Clinical Problems". Ten years later, towards the end of his life, Negus published The Biology of Respiration (1965).|$|E
500|$|Symptoms of DPB include chronic {{sinusitis}} (inflamed <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses),</b> wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields {{large amounts of}} sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include [...] (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of {{the walls of the}} bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or [...] "right heart failure").|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{association}} between headache and <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> disease is still unclear. Because of symptom overlap, the two conditions {{are not easily}} studied {{on the basis of}} symptoms alone. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> opacification on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was associated with migraine, tension-type headache (TTH) or unclassified headache. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 844 randomly selected participants (442 women, age range 50 – 65 years, mean age 57. 7 years). Based on 14 headache questions, participants were allocated to four mutually exclusive groups: migraine, TTH, unclassified headache or headache free. On MRI, opacifications as mucosal thickening, polyps/retention cysts and fluid in the five paired sinuses were measured and recorded if ≥ 1 [*]mm. For each participant, opacification thickness was summed for each sinus and, in addition, a total sum of all sinuses was calculated. Opacification in each sinus was compared between headache-free participants and the headache groups using non-parametric tests, and the total sum was compared by logistical regression. Results: No significant association was found between <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> opacification and headache in general, nor when headache was differentiated into migraine, TTH and unclassified headache. This was also true in separate analyses of mucosal thickening and fluid and of opacification from each <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus.</b> Conclusion Migraine:, TTH and unclassified headache were found not to be associated with an increased degree of <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinus</b> opacification at MRI...|$|R

500|$|In {{parallel}} with {{his career as}} a throat surgeon at a teaching hospital, Negus become a leading expert on the comparative anatomy of first the larynx and then the nose and the <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses.</b> This strand of his professional life started with the research he carried out in his thirties in the 1920s that eventually led to his degree of Master of Surgery (MS), awarded by the University of London. This work started as early as 1921 in the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, whose museum housed the collections of animal specimens gathered by the anatomist John Hunter. Working on these specimens, and adding to them with others supplied by the Zoological Society of London, Negus carried out meticulous dissections that enabled him to trace the stages of evolution and development of the larynx across a wide variety of animals. Part of this research was submitted as his thesis, and the excellence of the work was recognised by the award of a Gold Medal with his MS degree in 1924.

2500|$|There {{are risks}} {{associated}} with HBOT, similar to some diving disorders.

2500|$|For solids and liquids like bone, {{muscle and}} blood, this added {{pressure}} {{is not much}} of a problem; but it is a problem for any air-filled spaces like the mouth, ears, <b>paranasal</b> <b>sinuses</b> and lungs. This is because the air in those spaces reduces in volume when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with support against the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of [...] underwater, an inability to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with outside water pressure can cause pain, and the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can rupture at depths under 10ft (3 m). The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the ratio of pressure change is greatest near the surface of the water. For example, the pressure increase between the surface and 10m (33ft) is 100% (100 kPa to 200 kPa), but the pressure increase from 30m (100ft) to 40m (130ft) is only 25% (400 kPa to 500 kPa).|$|E
