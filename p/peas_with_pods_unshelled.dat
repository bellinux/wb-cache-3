40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Greece, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Nisso Chemical Europe GmbH to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance acetamiprid in purslane, legume vegetables and pulses (beans and peas). In order to accommodate the intended uses of acetamiprid, Greece proposed to raise the existing MRLs of acetamiprid from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in purslane, from 0. 01 * mg/kg in <b>peas</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods)</b> and 0. 06 mg/kg in beans (<b>with</b> <b>pods)</b> to 0. 5 mg/kg, from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 0. 05 mg/kg in beans (without pods) and from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 1 mg/kg in pulses (dry beans and peas). Greece drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 15 mg/kg on beans (<b>with</b> <b>pods),</b> 0. 4 mg/kg on <b>peas</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods),</b> 0. 07 mg/kg on beans (without pods), 0. 15 mg/kg on peas (without pods) and 0. 07 mg/kg on pulses (dry beans and peas); these MRL proposals reflect the intended uses in southern EU only. In addition, a MRL proposal for purslane (3 mg/kg) was derived by extrapolation from trials on lettuce. A deficiency was noted in some trials concerning the storage conditions of the samples prior analysis. Information needs to be provided to confirm that samples were effectively stored under conditions for which integrity of residues is demonstrated. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of acetamiprid in the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this work is the {{examining}} {{of one of the}} key genetic principles in domestication traits in pea pod dehiscence. First, this work was preceded by the employment of the method called MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends). The method analyzed the mRNA which was isolated from pod sutures. The two parental lines were used JI 64 (Pisum sativum ssp. elatius L.) wild field <b>pea</b> <b>with</b> dehiscent <b>pods,</b> JI 92 (Pisum sativum ssp. sativum L.) landrace <b>with</b> indehiscent <b>pods</b> and RILs (Recombinant inbred lines) of reciprocal hybridization of both. As a result of the MACE analysis ten million reads were generated and seven thousand genes were identified only seventy seven genes differed with statistical significance in the samples with dehiscent and indehiscent pods. For the purpose of this work only three of them were used. Expression of these three candidate genes were assigned using Real-Time qRT-PCR for pod dehiscence. Base on qRT-PCR process the Ct values were calculated. The result of this work is the graphical view of expression volume of these candidate genes for both field pea lines during pod maturation...|$|R
40|$|A {{centrifugal}} bambara {{groundnut sheller}} was designed, constructed and evaluated. The sheller {{consists of a}} feed hopper with a flow rate control device, shelling unit, separating unit and power system. Nine different impellers {{were used for the}} investigation at three different pod moisture contents. Results of the performance tests were examined using a 3 x 3 x 3 factorial design with moisture content, impeller slot angulations and number of impeller slots as variables. Results showed that moisture content, impeller slot angulations, number of impeller slots and interaction between these variables statistically affected the performance indicators (shelling efficiency, percentage of breakage, percentage of partially shelled <b>pods,</b> percentage of <b>unshelled</b> <b>pods</b> and winnowing efficiency) at the significance level of 5 %. The forward facing impeller with eight slots gave the best performance of 96 % shelling efficiency, 3. 4 % breakage, 0. 6 % partially shelled <b>pods.</b> No <b>unshelled</b> <b>pods</b> were recorded, and winnowing efficiency of 97. 3 % was recorded at an average feed rate of 215. 8 kg h- 1...|$|R

40|$|Infection of {{immature}} <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> <b>with</b> Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli (a non-pathogen of peas) or f. sp. pisi (a pea pathogen) {{resulted in}} induction of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase. Within 30 hours, {{activities of the}} two enzymes increased 9 -fold and 4 -fold, respectively. Chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase were also induced by autoclaved spores of the two F. solani strains and by the known elicitors of phytoalexins in pea pods, cadmium ions, actinomycin D, and chitosan. Furthermore, exogenously applied ethylene caused an increase of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase in uninfected pods. Fungal infection or treatment with elicitors strongly increased ethylene production by immature pea pods. Infected or elicitor-treated <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> were incubated <b>with</b> aminoethoxyvinylglycine, a specific inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. This lowered stress ethylene production to or {{below the level of}} uninfected controls; however, chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase were still strongly induced. It is concluded that ethylene and fungal infection or elicitors are separate, independent signals for the induction of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase...|$|R
40|$|Crop traits {{can alter}} {{economically}} important interactions between plants, pests, and biological control agents. For example, a reduced waxy bloom {{on the surface}} of pea plants alters interactions between pea aphids and their natural enemies. In this study, we assess whether the effect of wax reduction extends beyond the 2 or 3 arthropod species closely associated with the plants and into the structure of the broader arthropod community of over 200 taxa at our site. We sampled arthropods on lines of <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> normal and reduced wax in Latah Co., Idaho using pitfall traps within randomly assigned pairs of 5 × 5 meter plots. During the 1998 and 1999 growing seasons, we collected 12, 113 individual arthropods from 221 unambiguously identified morphospecies. The number of individuals collected from each morphospecies responded idiosyncratically to the reduced wax peas. To test whether arthropod community structure differed between the collections from plots having <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> normal or reduced wax, we performed a randomization test. The collection from <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> reduced wax had higher species evenness and thus higher community diversity despite having lower species richness. Our results demonstrate the potential of a single plant trait, epicuticular wax, to affect a community of arthropods. Two pests of peas had opposite responses to <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> reduced wax. The number of pea aphids collected was greater from <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> normal wax <b>peas</b> than those <b>with</b> reduced wax. In contrast, the number of pea leaf weevils collected was greater from <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> reduced wax...|$|R

40|$|A b s t r a c t. One of {{the most}} tedious {{operations}} in processing bambara groundnut is the shelling operation. However, moisture content normally affects the handling and processing of agro-materials, such as nut shelling/cracking. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of moisture content on shelling efficiency of bambara groundnut using a centrifugal cracker. A 50 kg bag of bambara groundnut obtained from Damboa Local Government Area of Borno State, Nigeria, was divided into three groups. These groups were prepared for tests by soaking them in ordinary water at room temperature for different periods of 0, 60 and 90 min to obtain different levels of moisture content. Moisture content of each sample was determined by oven drying at 130 °C for 6 h. The moisture content levels were found to be 5. 3, 9. 6, and 12. 2 % (d. b.) for samples A, B and C, respectively. The samples were subjected to impact energy through a centrifugal impaction device operating at an angular velocity of 1920 r. p. m., using three different types of impellers. Data obtained on the percentage of fully shelled pods and unbroken seeds, fully shelled <b>pods</b> <b>with</b> broken seeds, partially shelled <b>pods</b> and <b>unshelled</b> <b>pods</b> were statistically analysed. Results showed that both moisture content and impeller angula-tions {{have a significant effect on}} these performance indices. The most effective performance was obtained at moisture content of 5. 3 % (d. b.), at which the shelling efficiency, percentage of dama-ged seeds, percentage of partially shelled pods and percentage of <b>unshelled</b> <b>pods</b> were 96, 3. 4, 0. 6 and 0, 86. 6, 3. 6, 5. 6 and 4. 2, 85, 2. 4, 5. 4, and 7. 2 % for the forward facing impeller, radially posi-tioned impeller and the backward facing impeller, respectively.
