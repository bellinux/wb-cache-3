50|$|Wheat, in {{the form}} of rotis and parathas, forms the staple food of the city, which is eaten with cooked {{vegetables}} or legumes, usually in a spicy curry, using cooking oil. The common vegetables include potato, cauliflower, eggplant, okra and carrot. The popular legumes often cooked {{in the form}} of curry are lentil, chickpea, pigeon pea, black gram, peas and beans. Rice and dairy products are also {{an important component of the}} local food. Paneer - milk solids pressed under a weight and cut into cubes - is an expensive dairy food, eaten as curry with peas or other vegetables. The food is often supplemented by dairy products, such as yogurt or clarified butter, chutneys, pickles, papad onion, cucumbers or tomatoes. The local cuisine is well classified into two categories: vegetation and non-vegetation. However, meat is expensive, so most people cannot afford to eat meat or fish everyday, and even affluent people eat relatively little meat by western standards. Western style breakfast of toast, eggs, or <b>prepared</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> is gaining popularity in the city compared to traditional Punjabi cuisine. The most popular method of cooking is using LPG gas stoves and traditionally, the household cooking is done by women.|$|E

Wholegrain wheat flour in amount of 50, 60 and 70 % of total mass was the basic raw material, additionally corn grit, rice flour, cocoa and sugar were used. The initial moisture content of raw materials was set to 17, 20 and 23 %. Processing conditions, like process efficiency and energy consumption, as well as selected physical properties, like the expansion ratio, bulk density, water absorption and solubility indexes were tested. Texture profile with Ottawa cell for hardness, adhesiveness and chewiness, and sensory characteristics of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> were evaluated. Higher wholegrain wheat flour content in the recipe and higher moisture of raw materials lowered energy consumption during extrusion-cooking of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals.</b> The expansion ratio, water absorption and solubility index values lowered with higher initial moisture content of raw materials.

Kellogg's Western Health Reform Institute served peanut butter to patients because they needed a food that contained a lot of protein, yet which could be eaten without chewing. At first, peanut butter was a food for wealthy people, as it became popular initially as a product served at expensive health care institutes. Early peanut-butter-making machines were developed by Joseph Lambert, who had worked at John Harvey Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanitarium, and Dr. Ambrose Straub who obtained a patent for a peanut-butter-making machine in 1903. [...] "In 1922, chemist Joseph Rosefield invented a process for making smooth peanut butter that kept the oil from separating by using partially hydrogenated oil"; Rosefield [...] "...licensed his invention to the company that created Peter Pan peanut butter" [...] in 1928 and in [...] "...1932 he began producing his own peanut butter under the name Skippy". Under the Skippy brand, Rosefield developed a new method of churning creamy peanut butter, giving it a smoother consistency. He also mixed fragments of peanut into peanut butter, creating the first [...] "chunky"-style peanut butter. In 1955, Procter & Gamble launched a peanut butter named Jif, which was sweeter than other brands, due {{to the use of}} [...] "sugar and molasses" [...] in its recipe.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the absence}} of water inclusions, DCPA is less soluble than DCPD (Table  1). Like DCPD, DCPA can be {{crystallized}} from aqueous solutions containing Ca/P ratio ~ 1 at solution pH within ~ 2.0  < pH < ~ 6.5 but at temperatures >~ 90  °C. In addition, DCPA might be prepared by dehydration of DCPD. Furthermore, it might be also prepared at ambient temperatures in water-restricted or non-aqueous systems, such as gels (Sivkumar et al. 1997), ethanol (Tas 2009), {{as well as in the}} oil-in-water and water-in-oil systems (Chen et al. 2005). DCPA is physically stable and resisted hydration even when dispersed in water for over 7  months in the temperature range of 4 – 50  °C (Miyazaki et al. 2009). A calcium-deficient DCPA was also prepared. It might be sintered at ~ 300  °C (Eshtiagh-Hosseini et al. 2008). Unlike DCPD, DCPA occurs in neither normal nor pathological calcifications. It is used in self-setting CaPO 4 formulations (Dorozhkin 2013 b). Besides, DCPA might be implanted as bioceramics (Tamimi et al. 2010). Other applications include using as a polishing agent, a source of calcium and phosphate in nutritional supplements (e.g., in <b>prepared</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals,</b> enriched flour and noodle products), a tableting aid (Takami et al. 1996) and a toothpaste component (Dorozhkin 2013 c). In addition, it is used as a dough conditioner in food industry (Budavari et al. 1996). DCPA of a technical grade of purity might be used as a fertilizer (Habashi 2011).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of food expenditures {{are made in}} supermarkets and this environment influences our purchasing and food intake. <b>Breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> are frequently marketed as healthy food choices. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the frequency of in–store promotions for cold <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> in Canadian supermarkets and to determine whether healthier or less healthy <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> are promoted more frequently. Methods Data was collected once per week over a four-week period from a convenience sample of the five largest Canadian supermarkets in the Ottawa/Gatineau area. Data collection included the number of shelf facings, promotional displays, and the cost of cereals/ 100 g. The UK Nutrient Profiling Model was used to determine the healthfulness of each <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal.</b> Results 29. 8 % (n =  67) of the 225 unique cereals were classified as healthier and 70. 2 % (n =  158) were classified as less healthy. Less healthy cereals were displayed at eye level, in the profitable middle shelves, 2. 9 times more frequently than healthier cereals. There were 5. 3 times more <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> shelf facings, 4. 2 more end cap displays, 1. 7 more mid-aisle displays and 3. 3 more special pricing signage for less healthy cereals compared to healthier cereals. Less healthy cereals had a significantly higher average total number of shelf facings compared to healthier cereals (t = − 4. 28 (280. 8), p < . 001). Conclusions <b>Breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> manufacturers need to consider reformulation of their <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> to improve their healthfulness and supermarkets need to increase the marketing of healthy <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> within their stores...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that both negative life events and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption are associated with the incidence and severity of subjective symptoms of upper respiratory tract illnesses (URTIs) Two studies were conducted to examine whether objective markers of illness were also associated with stress and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that regular consumption of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> is associated with lower stress levels and reports of better physical and mental health.

Although {{it was not possible to}} rule out all the alternative explanations of the association between <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption and cortisol, analyses did show that the effect could not be accounted for by general health or nutritional status. The effects of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumption and stress were also independent, which shows that the effects of breakfast found here cannot be due to stress buffering.

Although only 9 % of children skipped breakfast, 61 % of skippers were aged 14 – 18 years. Among breakfast consumers, 49 % had <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal,</b> and 62 % of these exclusively consumed MPS <b>cereal.</b> <b>Breakfast</b> skippers had a higher saturated fat intake than <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal</b> consumers, and lower intakes of dietary fibre and most micronutrients (p < 0. 001).

The overall aim of these policy objectives are to increase the dietary fibre intake from grain consumption so as to significantly contribute to the general recommended (minimum) increase of the fibre intake. Based on parameter estimates from a demand system we simulate the resulting changes in volumes purchased and fibre intake from two policy reforms entailing differentiated VAT on grain products. In the first reform we remove the VAT on "keyhole labelled" bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals,</b> in the second reform we consider a more extensive policy package of subsidizing the keyhole labelled bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> by 20 percent while removing the VAT on all other grain products.
