25|$|The {{commercial}} variant, the BV 107-II, {{was first}} ordered by New York Airways during 1960. During July 1962, they took delivery {{of their first}} three aircraft, which was configured to seat up to 25 passengers. During 1965, Boeing Vertol sold the manufacturing rights of the 107 to Japanese conglomerate Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Under this arrangement, all Model 107 civilian and military aircraft built in Japan were referred to by the KV 107 designation. On 15 December 2006, Columbia Helicopters, Inc acquired the type certificate for the BV 107-II; at the time, the company was reportedly {{in the process of}} acquiring a <b>Production</b> <b>Certificate</b> from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

50|$|Industrial <b>Production</b> <b>Certificates</b> (IPCs) is the {{abstract}} unit of currency in the Axis & Allies series, representing one million man-hours of labour. Up until 1942, {{a pack of}} paper IPCs has been included with every copy of Axis & Allies (though the money used in Anniversary differs that from other games); {{they have not been}} included since 1942 partly to cut costs, and partly due to input from fans that it was easier to keep track of IPCs with pencil and paper. In these games IPCs were renamed as Industrial Production Credits.|$|R
25|$|Axis & Allies is not {{a strict}} {{historical}} wargame, due to its streamlining for ease of play and balancing so that both sides {{have a chance to}} win. For instance, the economic model is simplistic, with each territory producing a number of Industrial <b>Production</b> <b>Certificates</b> (IPCs) for the purchase of new units. Moreover, the game is supposed to start in the spring of 1942, but Japan is immediately in position to attack Hawaii again, while Germany is pressed well into the Soviet Union with an initially superior force. If the game were truer to history, the Axis empires would be at their climax in 1942, about to be pushed back by the Allies.|$|R

50|$|Each {{round of}} a game {{involves}} each of the powers moving in turn according to a specified order; the game ends when either the Axis powers or the Allied powers complete their objectives. When each power takes its turn, they must first declare how they are to spend the IPCs (Industrial <b>Production</b> <b>Certificates,</b> an abstract currency representing one million man-hours of labor) in their possession: this may go into buying new units, improving units through research (in earlier editions), or repairing damaged structures (in later editions). Players then declare any movements made {{that would result in}} combat, moving their pieces as appropriate, and after resolving combat, declaring any non-combat movements. At the end of the turn, players then place any units that were purchased {{at the beginning of the}} turn and collect IPCs based on all territories that they control at the end of their turn.|$|R

5000|$|The model 11A was {{reworked}} {{into the}} model 11E by engineers at the Luscombe Aircraft Corporation (later renamed to Quartz Mountain Aerospace after learning that the DLAHF had trademarked the Luscombe name). The 11E model features tri-gear landing and an [...] Continental IO-360. Quartz Mountain Aerospace produced the 11E in Altus, Oklahoma until they declared bankruptcy in November 2009.

The Connecticut group which fabricates and supplies aircraft parts to several major North American companies was the successful bidder for the airplane's Federal Aviation Administration type certificate. Geza Scap, president of JGS Properties, said he purchased the Luscombe type certificate because he is interested in manufacturing the plane, a single-engine four-seater. Scap said his company fabricates parts for Boeing and for several helicopter companies and owns five vehicle dealerships in Connecticut.|$|R
