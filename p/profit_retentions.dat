40|$|Corporations {{have become}} the {{dominant}} organizational form in modern market economies, managing vast resources. Corporations are however associated {{with a number of}} governance problems. This dissertation deals with these corporate governance issues from an investment perspective. The dissertation comprises one introductory chapter and five, from each other independent, essays. These essays can be read independently, but are kept together by a corporate governance and investment theme. The essays mainly contribute to the empirical literature on corporate governance and investment behavior. In chapter 2 a measure of capital allocation, based on the acceleration principle, is estimated across 44 countries. Capital allocation is compared to ownership concentration and indicators of corporate governance. Support for the so-called economic entrenchment hypothesis is found, whereas the legal origin hypothesis is rejected. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 look at corporate governance and investment in Scandinavia, and Sweden in particular. Chapters 3 and 4 look into how ownership concentration affects firm investment performance. Performance is measured with marginal q. How dual-class shares affect this ownership-performance relationship is examined. Dual-class shares are, in chapter 4, found to reduce the so-called incentive effect and enhance the so-called entrenchment effect. The role of <b>profit</b> <b>retentions</b> for investment is examined in chapter 5. Scandinavian firms are found to rely on earning retentions to a higher degree than firms in other countries. Chapter 6 contains an analysis of how the quality of property rights and investor protection affect the cost of capital...|$|E

The study finds that performance improved with various reforms such as increasing competition, appointing new managers, using firm-level pay sensitivity, raising marginal <b>profit</b> <b>retention</b> rates, and allowing managers to determine wages and to make production decisions. Adopting performance contracts did not improve performance significantly. These results confirm the importance of competition, control rights, managerial and internal incentives, as emphasized by the theory of the firm.

The results of the work show that the sustainable growth rates of the saving banks and the credit cooperatives are quantitatively close each other and higher than the ones of the banks.

The analysis is based on panel data estimation on a sample covering 87, 000 company-year observations. We find local companies to be more leveraged than MNCs, mainly explained by use of intra group equity financing, lower investment intensity and higher <b>profit</b> <b>retention</b> of the latter. However, MNCs appear to have had better access to external finance, resulting in their competitive advantage over local companies, especially in periods characterised by significant credit constraints. In contrast, local companies appear to have started to increase their leverage under relaxed credit constraints {{during the years of}} economic boom, demonstrating local companies’ greater vulnerability to adverse cyclical effects. capital structure, multinational companies, local companies, Baltic States...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which agency theory may explain CEO compensation in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China during the 1980 s. We find that the sensitivity of CEO pay to firm performance decreases with the variance of performance. This is consistent with the prediction of a tradeoff between incentives and insurance in agency theory. On the other hand, the data lend little support to the relative performance evaluation hypothesis. We also find that the performance sensitivity of CEO pay increases with the marginal return to executive action, that is, pay sensitivity increases with managerial control rights, worker incentives, <b>profit</b> <b>retention</b> rates of firms, and the degree of product market competition faced by the firm. While the elasticity of pay to sales is slightly smaller than that found in the literature on conventional firms in the West generally, our estimate of the semi-elasticity of pay with respect to profitability is comparable to estimates for regulated industries in the United States...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the various determinants of dividend payout of selected Commercial Banks in Nigeria. Secondary data collected from 1989 - 2010 were analyzed using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression technique. The findings revealed that while current earnings, lagged dividend and lending rate were the major determinants of cash dividend payout in these banks, Inflation rate and liquidity ratio failed to explain the variation in dividend payout. Also, these banks have a lower Average Marginal Propensity (AMP) to pay out of current earnings of 30. 67 %. This implies a <b>profit</b> <b>retention</b> of 69. 33 % during the period, indicating the conservative nature of management of these banks. The paper recommend that if informed Nigerians are to be encouraged to buy more shares in the banking sector, management of such banks should strive to reduce their retained earnings. This is necessary due to the axiom of time value of money. Since money invested in shares is part of individual investments, shareholders should have maximum returns on their investment such as dividend...|$|R

The upsurge of investment since the Mid- 1980 s, however, has overstepped many of these principles. This flood of FDI is variously attributed to the particular circumstances of the Japanese economy such as higher value of the Yen, lower interest rates at home, overproduction, empire-building efforts at the Eastern wing of the Triad, and so on. These special features have led many researchers to relate the Japanese FDI only to some other Macroeconomic elements of the Japanese economy such as trade, GNP, domestic demand etc., while other FDI economists have attempted to relate it to the globalisation process in which Japan is a big player. In explaining the special character of the Japanese FDI, researchers with a business-economic slant, tend to gravitate to the following issues: export/domestic sales proportions, <b>profit</b> <b>retention</b> / repatriation, HQ/subsidiary relationships, the role of domestic input, technology, strategy, culture, quality, and so on. Some valuable large-scale studies (though in dire need of updating) exist that deal with these issues. These are of course largely based on ‘arms-length...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) {{is an attempt}} to incorporate private sector business incentives into the public sector. Truly efficient incentive initiatives must provide the motivation and necessary resources for organizations to make cost reducing investments. If either the motivation or resources are missing an organization will not become more cost effective and efficient. The private sector goal is profit maximization. This goal is projected to the firm's production and service divisions through chargeback methods. DBOF is a variant of cost based chargeback. This thesis examines the application of this incentive with special emphasis on Navy contracting activities. It found that some motivation for making investments in efficiency and effectiveness is provided through gainsharing and competition. However, only nominal resources are provided for investment. DBOF could be enhanced by allowing for <b>profit</b> <b>retention</b> and mitigating price sensitivity. This requires the ability to carry unexpended funding forward to the next fiscal year and implementing success sharing or a similar initiative. Success sharing, an innovative suggestion by Dr. Francois Melese, allows the activity to share in some of the cost savings by reducing price (unit cost) slightly less than the cost savings. The Government captures most of the profits, but it provides the activity with some profit to reinvest in more cost reducing investments. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigates the}} effect of {{dividend}} policy on stock prices. Objective {{of the study is}} to see if there exists any relationship between dividend policy and stock prices. We analyzed 45 non-financial companies listed on KSE- 100 index that have earned profits and paid dividend for a period of twelve year w. e. f. 2001. Technique adopted for sampling adopted is convenience sampling. As the nature of data is panel therefore, pooled regression, fixed and random effect tests are run. Random effect results are focused after applying Hausman’s test. Regression Results witness that Dividend per Share andRetention Ratio havean insignificant relationship with Share Market Prices. Dividend Payout Ratio has a significant positive relationship with Share Prices as supported by the Bird in hand theory suggested that owners give preference to a dollar of estimated dividends over a likely dollar of capital gains. Profit after tax, Earning per share and Return on Equity are the three control variables. Profit after Tax has insignificant relation to Stock Prices. Earnings per Share have positive significant relation to Stock Prices. There is negative significant relation between Return on Equity and Share Prices. It is recommended that firms in the sample should regularly pay dividend as it will cause an upward movement in the stock market prices.

40|$|Commitment is as an {{essential}} ingredient for successful long-term relationships. Developing a customer's commitment in business relationships does pay off in increased <b>profits,</b> customer <b>retention,</b> willingness to refer and recommend. Relationship marketing literature suggests customer satisfaction and trust as major determinants of commitment. Recently, practitioners and scholars have identified customer value as a pivotal issue {{in the management of}} business relationships. In this article the authors theorize (1) customer satisfaction, (2) customer trust, (3) customer relationship value, and (4) customer commitment as key variables for successful business relationship management. A framework for the interrelationships of these key variables is provided. Drawing upon a database of 230 customer-supplier relationships, this study shows that trust and relationship value are powerful predictors of commitment. The influence of customer satisfaction on commitment is mediated by trust and relationship value. Some theoretical and managerial implications are given.

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that firms should direct more effort into retaining existing customers than to attracting new ones. To achieve this, customers likely to defect {{need to be}} identified {{so that they can}} be approached with tailored incentives or other bespoke retention offers. Such strategies call for predictive models capable of identifying customers with higher probabilities of defecting in the relatively near future. A review of the extant literature on customer churn models reveals that although several predictive models have been developed to model churn in B 2 C contexts, the B 2 B context in general, and non-contractual settings in particular, have received less attention in this regard. Therefore, to address these gaps, this study proposes a data-mining approach to model non-contractual customer churn in B 2 B contexts. Several modeling techniques are compared in terms of their ability to predict true churners. The best performing data-mining technique (boosting) is then applied to develop a <b>profit</b> maximizing <b>retention</b> campaign.

The purpose of this case study was to identify effective strategies used by retail store managers that lead to employee commitment to increase business performance. The study population was 8, 230 retail store managers in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. The conceptual framework for this study was the Meyer and Allen 3 -component model of commitment. Participants were purposefully selected for their knowledge, experience and success in implementing effective retention strategies. Data were collected via face-to-face semistructured interviews, indirect participant observations, and archival document reviews with 5 retail store managers. The data analysis process involved organizing the interviews, color coding themes, and using NVivo software to interpret the data. Three themes emerged: Employee engagement increased employee commitment to the organization, managers decreased employee turnover by taking a personal interest in employees, and employee empowerment increased organizational commitment. Increasing employee commitment contributes to social change by providing organizational managers and leaders with important insights. Enhancing employee commitment contributes to society through increased organizational profitability resulting from improved retention strategies...|$|R

40|$|Small rockets {{have the}} {{potential}} {{to play an important role}} in the changes that are now occurring in the spaceflight domain. Currently, satellite miniaturization is opening up new possibilities to form constellations capable of full-time global coverage for internet service, real-time earth observation applications, and disaster monitoring. Such programs involving small satellites require low-cost and frequent access to orbit. A new class of launch vehicles is uniquely positioned to offer these small satellites dedicated access to space, with no restrictions on target orbit height or inclination traditionally associated with current rideshare arrangements. A number of new launch service providers has stepped up to this challenge, developing systems with decreased size and payload capability in a commercial way. Their offerings are priced lower than costs traditionally associated with a rocket launch. However, most of these firms do not have hardware in production yet, so the question arises whether or not these early price quotes are realistic with respect to the actual costs incurred. This research has made a first step towards answering this question, by developing a way to estimate costs for such systems in partnership with the European Space Agency’s Cost Engineering Section. All aspects of the estimating process were addressed, from gathering and selecting data, to building Cost Estimating Relationships, detailing cost-risks, and employing existing - and developing new - parametric relationships, whilst exploring their applicability to systems that have a lower payload capacity and gross lift-off weight than traditionally larger rockets. An early phase parametric cost estimate was synthesized with which it is now possible to approximate for commercial liquid and solid propellant rockets in the 100 - 700 kg payload range the development, production and operating costs, and their cost-based price per flight to within 20 % of reported costs. By doing so at an equipment-level depth, novel contributions to theory could be made by adapting the Theoretical First Unit T 1 method of estimating,mirroring the reductions in cost achieved by commercial launch operators through <b>profit</b> <b>retention</b> and reduced subcontractor management effort. Whilst exploring these new launch vehicles’ costs, it was also discovered that small rockets in particular require a launch rate of over 4 per year to keep program commercialization expenses fromcausing up to a threefold increase in launch prices. An ESA liquid methane vehicle concept was central to the estimate; it was however concluded that this rocket ineffectively addresses the LEO market at a price point that is too high to gainmarket share. Nonetheless, other future proposals for small launch systems can now be evaluated for their cost feasibility, either by potential investors or agencies seeking shared technology development with commercial partners.

40|$|There {{are three}} aims to this thesis. First, in chapter I, {{the record of}} {{takeover}} activity in the U. K. from 1957 - 69 using a census of U. K. public quoted companies is analysed. This involves {{an examination of the}} frequency of takeovers over time, the industrial pattern of take-overs, the characteristics of raiders, differences between the performance of acquired and surviving firms, the payment practices and the bid premium, the distinction between takeovers and mergers, unsuccessful takeover bids and defensive strategies, and finally the timing of the offer with respect to the acquired firm's accounting period. This will set the scene for the second aim of the thesis which is the development, in chapter II, of a theory of the causes of takeovers based on the valuation discrepancy hypothesis suggested by Robin Marris. as well as more directly in terms of the financial characteristics of the acquired firms whose impact should be felt via the stock market valuation of the firm. In chapters III and IV these models of takeovers are tested at the industry level through the use of the linear probability function estimation technique. It was found that the valuation ratio, profits and growth emerged as significant influences On the probability of takeover in a majority of industries but that Size, retentions and liquidity, in general, failed to provide any important contribution to an explanation of the causes of takeover. Attempts to analyse the differences in the industry results in terms of industry characteristics proved unsuccessful. Of primary interest is the market valuation as an explanation of takeovers for it offers not only an explanation of takeovers based on the price of the acquired firm, but also it forms the basis of the operation of the security constraint in Marris's managerial model of firm behaviour. Although demonstrating the existence of the valuation constraint in the form envisaged by Marris, i argued that this provided only a necessary condition of his revision to the theory of the firm and did not provide a basis for choosing between one or other of the posited managerial objectives of the new theories of the firm or the neo-classical formulation of profit maximization. In chapter V an alternative estimational technique is employed on aggregate data ignoring the industry classifications; that of profit analysis. The results for the market valuation and the financial variables of <b>profits,</b> growth and <b>retentions</b> offer greatly improved results over the linear probability function in terms of the proportion of firms taken over at various levels of the explanatory variables. Aside from more fully exposing the nature of the takeover process and its role as a constraint on managerial discretion, little contribution can be made towards the choice of appropriate managerial objective. The third and final aim is to relate the takeover process to the appropriate model of the theory of the firm which has not been possible in the earlier chapters. For this I turned to an analysis of the takeover raiders and attempt to derive mutually exclusive predictions for the raider's performance relative to their industry average performance for the two assumed objectives of growth maximization and profit maximization. Reasonably clear distinctions are drawn on the basis of <b>profits,</b> growth, <b>retentions</b> and valuation ratio and the sign test used to demonstrate that the performance of raiders is better explained by the assumption that they seek to maximize growth rather than profits. ...|$|R

In general, most of the efforts in churn studies involve prediction with different definitions of the churn event [14, 21], evaluating new data mining algorithms [15, 22, 23], and introducing {{ways to deal with}} large volumes of data [24]. In these studies, churn prediction has usually been considered as a benchmark against which novel analytic approaches are evaluated, and domain-specific historical actions (e.g., aggregation of service usage in unit time) of customers are typically involved as features for prediction. Neslin et al. [25] analyze the effect of the methodological factors on the accuracy of churn prediction models across top-decile lift and Gini criteria. Verbraken et al. [26] further investigated the techniques to employ for churn prediction problem by analyzing effectiveness of Bayesian Network classifiers. They suggest that Bayesian approaches could produce lean models which can aid the analysts in making judgments on the dependencies between explanatory variables. Verbeke et al. [27] argue that, in order to minimize the cost associated with customer churn, the statistical evaluation approaches tend to yield suboptimal prediction models. They introduce a profit-driven data mining approach which determines the optimal model by targeting the customers with whose <b>retention</b> <b>profit</b> is maximized.|$|R

The study will focus on retailer’s strategies for customer retention in a competitive environment. Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper is}} study customer retention strategies adopted by compressed natural gas (CNG) retailing stations, in a developing country (Pakistan). Research Question: How do CNG retailing stations satisfy, make loyal, and retain their customers in a competitive environment? Methodology: Deductive approach has been adopted for this research to investigate the behaviour of customers through telephone interviews, as it is a distant research. Convenience sample has been selected for this research and ten semi-structured telephonic interviews have been conducted to get the empirical data from the CNG retailers of Lahore, stations from ten different stations have been selected on the basis of prestige, repute and amount of publicity in print and electronic media. Semi structured interviews will be based on primary and secondary data together. Primary data is in the form of interviews, secondary in the form of reports and published journals. Telephonic interview was based on open-ended questions to judge the views, knowledge and utility of customers experience and close-ended questions that have provided the direct and accurate answers. Telephonic interviews have advantages and disadvantages but for a distant research like this, it is the only best possible methodology to get first-hand knowledge quickly, interview was based on ten questions to get a complete picture of customers’ retention. Operationalization was based on 14 questions question 1 to 6 are about customers’ satisfaction, 7 to 11 customer loyalty and 12 to 14 customer retention. Validity and reliability is the key to success for any research. Same question were asked in different ways to check the reliability of the answers, target oriented questions were asked to validate the objective of the research and to make research credible. Conclusion and Results: The research establishes that most companies do not have specific plans for the customer retention in a cut-throat competitive environment. Customers’ service and technical issues were the targeted areas to understand the customers’ retention. Customers’ <b>retention</b> means <b>profit,</b> low <b>retention</b> means low <b>profits.</b> Result in a nutshell is an increased focus on imperial investigation, which is inevitable to study strategies for customer retention for the survival in the competitive world...|$|R
40|$|There is {{extensive}} {{literature on}} employee engagement; its antecedents; linkages to positive business outcomes; and its {{positive impact on}} retention. Top performing organisations have even found that aligning the engagement strategies to the business goals drive performance outcomes. There is no universal definition of employee engagement and drivers, therefore, a general approach without due cognisance of worker demographics may result {{in the application of}} inappropriate engagement strategies. In this study, the focus is on knowledge workers within the banking sector of Botswana. Knowledge workers make up almost two thirds of organisations and are said to be unique and complex in their nature. Work to a knowledge worker is more mental than physical, hence, the need to use interventions aimed at the behaviour to increase their performance. The needs of a knowledge worker and that of the business ought to be integrated. An organisation that is able to identify those factors that would influence their engagement is promised high levels of productivity that would translate into <b>profits</b> and high <b>retention.</b> The main research problem for {{this study was to determine}} the strategies that should be used to engage knowledge workers within the banking sector in Botswana. A literature study was conducted to identify characteristics of knowledge workers, meaning of employee engagement and approaches to measuring employee engagement. Eleven organisational factors that have an influence on employee engagement and some of the engagement strategies were identified from literature. The eleven factors identified were: growth and development; rewards and recognition; trust in leadership; work/life balance; two way communication; mission, vision and values; quality of manager; relationship with colleagues; fairness of HR policies; job design; and accountability. An empirical study was also conducted to investigate which of the eleven organisational factors had an influence in the engagement of knowledge workers. The current engagement level of knowledge workers within the banking sector was measured using the Gallup Q 12 measuring tool. The main findings from this research are that a significant number of knowledge workers are engaged. The findings of this study also coincide with the theoretical overview that there are organisational factors that have an influence on the engagement of employees. A significant finding was that, although knowledge workers differ in their perception of the organisational factors, they generally indicate that work/life balance initiatives are lacking in their workplac...|$|R
40|$| {{rule-based}} classification techniques. Since monotonicity {{is guaranteed}} during a postprocessing step, the RULEM {{approach can be}} combined with any rule- or tree-based classification technique. In a first step, the RULEM algorithm checks whether a rule set or decision tree violates the imposed monotonicity constraints. Existing violations are resolved in a second step by inducing a set of additional rules which enforce monotone classification. The algorithm is able to handle non-monotonic noise, and {{can be applied to}} both partially and totally monotone problems with an ordinal target variable. Based on the RULEM algorithm, two novel justifiability measures are introduced. The RULEMS and RULEMF measures allow to calculate {{the extent to which a}} classification model is in line with domain knowledge expressed in the form of monotonicity constraints. Both measures provide an intuitive indication of the justifiability of a rule set, and can be calculated in a fully automated manner. An extensive benchmarking experiment has been set up to test the impact of the RULEM approach on the predictive power and the comprehensibility of the resulting rule set. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed approach preserves the predictive power of the original rule induction techniques while guaranteeing monotone classification, at the cost of a small increase in the size of the rule set. Hence, the RULEM algorithm is shown to yield accurate, comprehensible, and justifiable rule based classification models. The predictive power of the final rule set therefore depends on the selected rule induction technique that RULEM is combined with. New insights into churn prediction in the telecommunication sector: a profit driven data mining approachCCP models are typically evaluated using statistically based performance measures, such as for instance top decile lift or AUC. However, as shown in Chapter 4 of this thesis, this may lead to suboptimal model selection, and consequently to a loss in profits. Therefore, in the first part of Chapter 4, a novel, profit centric performance measure is developed. Optimizing the fraction of included customers with the highest predicted probabilities to attrite yields the maximum profit that can be generated by a retention campaign. Since reducing the costs or losses associated with customer churn is the main objective of a CCP model, this chapter advocates the use of the maximum profit (i. e., the maximum reduction in costs or losses) that can be generated by using the output of the model as a measure to evaluate CCP models. In the second part of the fourth chapter a large benchmarking experiment is conducted, including twenty-one state-of-the-art predictive algorithms that are applied on eleven data sets from telco operators worldwide. The benchmarking experiment allows to rigorously analyze and assess the impact of classification technique, oversampling, and input selection on the performance of a CCP model. The results of the experiments are tested using the appropriate test statistics, and evaluated using both the novel profit centric based measure and statistical performance measures, leading to the following conclusions:Applying the maximum profit criterion and including the optimal fraction of customers in a retention campaign leads to substantially different outcomes. Furthermore, the results of the experiments provide strong indications that the use of the maximum profit criterion can have a profound impact on the generated <b>profits</b> by a <b>retention</b> campaign. Secondly, the effect of oversampling on the performance of a CCP model strongly depends on the data set and the classification technique that is applied, and can be positive or negative. Therefore, we recommend to adopt an empirical approach, and as such to consistently test whether oversampling is beneficial. Third, the choice of classification technique significantly impacts the predictive power of the resulting model. Alternating Decision Trees yielded the best overall performance in the experiments, although a large number of other techniques were not significantly outperformed. Hence, other properties of modeling techniques besides the predictive power have to be taken into account when selecting a classification technique, such as comprehensibility, justifiability, and operational efficiency. Rule induction techniques, decision tree approaches, and classical statistical techniques such as logistic regression and Naive Bayes or Bayesian Networks score well on all three aspects, and result in a powerful, yet comprehensible model that is easy to implement and operate. Therefore these techniques are recommended to be applied for CCP modeling. Comprehensibility or interpretability is an important aspect of a classifier which allows the marketing department to extract valuable information from a model, in order to design effective retention campaigns and strategies. The comprehensibility of a model however also depends on the number of variables included in a model. Clearly a model including ten variables is easier to interpret than a model containing fifty variables or more. This leads to a fourth conclusion, i. e., input selection is crucial to achieve good predictive power, and six to eight variables generally suffice to predict churn with high accuracy. Consequently, from an economical point of view it may be more efficient to invest in data quality, than in gathering an extensive range of attributes capturing all the available information on a customer. Furthermore, the input selection procedure has shown that usage attributes are the most predictive kind of data. However, also socio-demographic data, financial information, and marketing related attributes are indispensable sources of information to predict customer churn. Moreover, marketing related attributes such as the hand set that is provided to a customer by the operator, are important sources of actionable information to design effective retention campaigns. Finally, this chapter also provides benchmarks to the industry to compare the performance of their CCP models. Social network analysis for customer churn predictionThe fifth chapter develops a range of new and adapted relational learning algorithms for customer churn prediction using social network effects, designed to handle the massive size of the call graph, the time dimension, and the skewed class distribution typically present in a customer churn prediction setting. Furthermore, an innovative approach to incorporate non-Markovian network effects within relational classifiers is presented, i. e., the weight product, which allows to upgrade the network neighborhood of the weight matrix. The weight product can be applied complementary to existing relational classifiers, and is shown to be the equivalent operation for weighted networks to the distance product for distance networks. Finally, a novel parallel model setup to combine a relational and non-relational classification model is introduced, which selects a top-fraction of the customers with the highest predicted probabilities to churn of both models. The performance of the newly proposed techniques is experimentally tested, and the profit driven evaluation methodology presented in Chapter 4 is applied to assess the results of two real life case studies on large scale telco data sets, containing both networked (call detail record data) and non-networked (customer related) information about millions of subscribers. The experiments indicate the existence of a significant impact of social network effects on the churn behavior of telco subscribers. Interestingly, also non-Markovian social network effects are observed: the churn behavior of not only the friends, but also the friends of friends have an impact on the churn behavior of telco subscribers. Relational and non-relational classifiers, which are built using respectively networked and non-networked information, are found to detect different groups or types of churners, hinting towards a great potential of social network analysis for customer churn prediction. A propositionalization approach to incorporate social network information within a non-relational model by including network variables yields the best performing stand-alone CCP model. However, the novel parallel modeling setup, resulting in a non-integrated model, outperforms all other approaches to combine a relational and non-relational model and generates significant gains in profit compared to integrated models, including the propositionalization approach. Hence, the main finding of this chapter with strong consequences for the practice of customer relationship management is that applying relational classifiers in combination with the current generation of CCP models can generate significant profit gains. This results from the fact that relational and non-relational CCP models detect different types of churners. Finally, including second order network effects by upgrading the network neighborhood using the weight product, is shown to improve classification power and to further increase the generated profits compared to a model that restricts the impact of the network to first order effects.
