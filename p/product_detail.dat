Willis stated that the major challenge when creating the brand identity for Beckham was: [...] "How do you convey through a brand mark the sheer diversity of the David Beckham world?". He expanded his comment, stating that the identity needed to represent [...] "the future of the man as well as being true to his core DNA as one of the world's most respected and talented sportsmen. The identity needed to deliver against all these elements and at the same time be cool, relevant, desirable, versatile and accessible". Fuller added that the brand should also be aspirational, optimistic and inclusive.|$|E

50|$|During the {{engineering}} {{phase of the}} Digital Prototyping workflow, engineers create the product’s 3D model (the digital prototype), integrating design data developed during the conceptual design phase. Teams also add electrical systems design data to the digital prototype while it’s being developed, and evaluate how different systems interact. At {{this stage of the}} workflow, all data related to the product’s development is fully integrated into the digital prototype. Working with mechanical, electrical, and industrial design data, companies engineer every last <b>product</b> <b>detail</b> in {{the engineering}} phase of the workflow.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{potential}} impact of e-commerce soft-ware packages on the diffusion of markup for structured data on the Web. We argue that such an analysis must focus on the <b>product</b> <b>detail</b> pages, i. e. the “deep links ” to individual items, rather than the pure number of shop sites, for assessing the potential. Based on (1) a systematic analysis of the popularity of 56 software packages for e-commerce sites among the Alexa list of the one mil-lion most popular Web sites, we (2) estimate the number of <b>product</b> <b>detail</b> pages for the respective shops and then (3) project the potential lever of each e-commerce package for the adoption of structured markup, assumed that adding support for structured data can be made a readily available feature of a respec-tive software. Our results indicate that by adding a structured markup compo-nent to as little as seven popular e-commerce systems, we could instantly de-ploy structured data markup on nearly 90 % of the <b>product</b> <b>detail</b> pages among the one million most popular Web sites...|$|E

By exploiting the richness of the data that come from fine geographic and <b>product</b> <b>detail,</b> we show how own-industry multinational firm presence helped to stimulate new trade, and to elevate the quality of those trades. In contrast, while we find that greater concentrations of other-industry multinational activity was associated with greater export introduction, and longer survival, other-industry exposure was also correlated with lower-valued export introductions...|$|E
30|$|Open {{innovation}} {{requires the}} {{support from the}} product scheme or architecture to allocate the product function to its physical components. Product architecture normally dominates the innovative process to form the <b>product</b> <b>detail</b> [1]. Therefore, the architecture approach provides a very important perspective for massive innovative research. Product architecture is an interactive pattern of functional modules in the product to form a technical system, which allows components of a product to interact and correlate with each other [1]. Therefore, using open concept in the product architecture, called open-architecture product (OAP), will form a bridge to link product developers and users for the massive innovation of products.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a systematic estimation of import demand elasticities {{for a broad}} group of countries at a very disaggregated level of <b>product</b> <b>detail.</b> We use a semiflexible translog GDP function approach to formally derive import demands and their elasticities, which are estimated with data on prices and endowments. Within a theoretically consistent framework, we use the estimated elasticities to construct Feenstra's (1995) simplification of Anderson and Neary's trade restrictiveness index (TRI). The difference between TRIs and import-weighted tariffs is shown {{to depend on the}} tariff variance and the covariance between tariffs and import demand elasticities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the impact of the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN) on the major discriminatory trade arrangements. We present results from the import-disaggregated version of the Michigan Computational Model of World Production and Trade which has been used to analyze the production, trade, employment, and price effects of the tariff and some nontariff barrier (NTB) {{reductions}} of the Tokyo Round. The model used in this study, while retaining the same degree of country and <b>product</b> <b>detail</b> obtained by Deardorff and Stern (1981, 1983) distinguished bilateral trade flows. Thus the model can be constrained to reflect preferential trading...|$|E
30|$|The IO matrix and IO {{environmental}} extension matrix {{used for}} this study (referred to as the “IO system” and indicated by the subscript IO) is the same two-region SUT framework used in Teh et al.

It comprises 341 industries, 345 products, 26 rest-of-the-world (RoW) sectors, and four environmental extensions representing direct emissions of CH 4, N 2 O, CO 2, and CO 2 -eq for the year 2009.

30|$|This paper {{introduces}} a static, but scenario-based approach to implementing existing climate change scenarios, {{such as the}} IEA ETP scenarios, in GMRIO systems. The work here is distinct from other macroeconomic models, {{in that it is}} neither a forecasting tool for the world economy nor a way to investigate policy responses, rather it is a GMRIO system calibrated to meet the specifications of already existing scenarios. It adds industry and <b>product</b> <b>detail</b> to the scenarios and allows for the calculation of not only direct, but also indirect economic effects and environmental and socio-economic impacts of technological and structural change along global production chains. The aim of this exercise is to have a simple tool to estimate carbon and material footprints under different “what if” scenarios.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} goal of online comparison shopping services is to "convert" a viewer from general product category pages (for example product {{groups such as}} "smartphones" or "air-conditioners") to detailed product pages and ultimately to order pages. Comparison shopping websites provide a familiar web interface {{as well as a}} chance for consumers to purchase items at competitive prices. In return for providing access to a large market of potential consumers, the comparison shopping service usually receives financial compensation for product clicks and orders. This study looked at 2. 5 million product listing visits at price. com. hk to determine whether a modification in the way prices are displayed on general category pages resulted in more "conversions" to <b>product</b> <b>detail</b> pages. We found a statistically significant improvement over-all {{as a result of the}} new price display resulting in 3. 6 % more product clicks over all categories. Additional analysis showed that the effect is heterogeneous among different categories, and in a few cases there may be some categories negatively affected by the display modification...|$|E
