5|$|A {{number of}} {{similarity}} solutions to this equation {{have been found}} for various types of flow, including flat plate boundary layers. The term similarity refers to the <b>property</b> <b>that</b> the velocity profiles at different positions in the flow are the same apart from a scaling factor.

5|$|A path in a {{directed}} graph {{can be described}} by a sequence of edges having the <b>property</b> <b>that</b> the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence {{is the same as}} the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a {{directed graph}} that has no cycles.|$|E

Second, fourteen (14) properties were not resolved through the Initiative at all. This group includes active Housing Court cases, <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> Housing Court has lost jurisdiction over, and publicly owned <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> have not been either ordered demolished or occupied.

40|$|The rich {{collection}} of successes in property testing raises a natural question: Why {{are so many}} different properties turning out to be locally testable? Are there some broad “features ” of <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> make them testable? Kaufman and Sudan (STOC 2008) proposed the study {{of the relationship between the}} invariances satisfied by a property and its testability. Particularly, they studied <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> were invariant under linear transformations of the domain and gave a characterization of testability in certain settings. However, the <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> they examined were also linear. This led us to investigate linear-invariant <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> are not necessarily linear. Here we describe some of the resulting works which consider natural linear-invariant <b>properties,</b> specifically <b>properties</b> <b>that</b> are described by forbidden patterns of values that a function can take, and show testability under various settings...|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{can form}} very long chains of {{interconnecting}} carbon–carbon bonds, a <b>property</b> <b>that</b> is called catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon that {{those that do}} not. A similar claim {{can be made for}} hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{algebraic}} {{functions are}} defined by an algebraic equation, and transcendental functions (including those discussed above) {{are defined by}} some <b>property</b> <b>that</b> holds for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.|$|E
5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the <b>property</b> <b>that</b> all these other filters {{can be derived from}} it by applying a scaling factor to the components of the prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E
