2500|$|A Royal North-West Mounted Police {{investigation}} {{began after}} word reached Fort Norman that Inuit {{had been seen}} wearing the priests' clothing, {{and the two men}} surrendered themselves without incident in May 1916. Part of Uloqsaq's police statement read, [...] "I wanted to speak; Ilogoak [...] <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> my mouth... Ilogoak pointed the gun at us. I was afraid and I was crying... Sinnisiak said to me 'We ought to kill these white men before they kill us.'" [...] Partly due to a previous incident with similar circumstances following which no action was taken, the authorities wished to make an example out of the two Inuit men, and Sinnisiak was tried in Edmonton for the murder of Rouvière, largely because it was thought that Sinnisiak had been the 'ringleader'. He was found not guilty because the jury thought that the Inuit man had cause to kill the priest.|$|E
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> her face, to feel if {{her lips}} were moving, and tore off the neckerchief.|$|E
60|$|When {{the voice}} stopped, he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his eyes, murmuring {{that the light}} was strong upon them.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he made a}} fretful {{movement}} and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> ears.|$|R
60|$|He smiled comfortably and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes {{because of}} the light.|$|R
60|$|Clutton <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes so that {{he might}} {{concentrate}} his mind on what he wanted to say.|$|R
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> {{his mouth}} to conceal a yawn. When he {{uncovered}} his lips they were smiling faintly.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Jewell {{glanced at}} him {{from the corner of his}} eye. [...] "Cooking," [...] he said, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth with some suddenness.|$|E
6000|$|Soames <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth--he had so {{very nearly}} said: [...] "God help the publisher!" [...] His grey eyes scrutinised the {{agitated}} young man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tchee--tchee--tchee," [...] {{said the}} hapless Mr. Boxer, <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mouth and making noble efforts to {{restrain}} himself; [...] "tchee--tch ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is not dead," [...] said Cheenbuk, <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the Indian's heart, while Anteek caught poor Attim by {{the nose}} and held him gently back.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sam Axworthy! {{repeated}} Leonard, <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{as if one}} sensation overpowered everything else; {{and thus}} he stood for some seconds, to the perplexity of both.|$|R
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> {{his mouth}} again and laughed silently, until his wife, coming behind him, {{took him by}} the {{shoulders}} and shook him violently.|$|E
60|$|Spencer <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> {{the white}} fingers that {{rested on the}} railing. He bent forward until his breath stirred the tendrils of hair on her forehead.|$|E
6000|$|Frank's face worked, and he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> {{it as he}} said, [...] "You are all torturing her; I shall write {{a letter}} and settle it myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "C-Cynthy," [...] he said, <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> hers on the table, [...] "I {{want you}} to do {{something}} for me er--for me," [...] he repeated, emphasizing the last word.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes--ah--yes,' says Mr. Smee, <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes, and {{standing}} before it, looking steady, you know, {{as if he}} was going to see whereabouts he should hit Boadishia.|$|R
60|$|It was an {{argument}} the minister could not answer save by <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face; his distress made Babbie strong; {{she moved to}} the door, trying to smile.|$|R
60|$|His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> {{his heart}} and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've go--got to gi--give up!" [...] panted Gus, {{and came}} to a halt. [...] "Go--got a pa--pain in my side!" [...] And he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his hip.|$|E
60|$|Fernando {{scarcely}} answered, save {{by half a}} smile, and a {{long sigh}} of relief: but when Mr. Audley <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the long brown fingers, they closed upon it.|$|E
60|$|But I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering {{a hoarse}} and inarticulate cry, again annihilated his {{masterpiece}} of cards, and <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the keenest agony.|$|R
5000|$|Carl {{was known}} for his {{trademark}} symbol he made where after scoring a basket, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head in the shape of an [...] "X" [...] and claimed it was to represent the Bronx.|$|R
6000|$|The Professor <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> ears, {{with a look}} of dismay. [...] "If {{you once}} let him begin a Poem," [...] he said to Sylvie, [...] "he'll never leave off again! He never does!" ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> {{the gate}} and shook hers. Then he opened {{the gate and}} invited her into the house. Worth stayed to tea, and Uncle Paul showed her all over Greenwood.|$|E
60|$|His voice glared. Regardless of {{the office}} folk about them, he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> hers. She was sure that Miss Moynihan was bulkily {{watching}} them. She dared not take time to think.|$|E
6000|$|At this Dan <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> one eye, {{and reached}} for the flint arrow-head on the grass. He missed it by inches. 'It's true,' he whispered to Una. 'You can't judge {{distances}} a bit with only one eye.' ...|$|E
50|$|The nanobots {{not only}} cure Andy's cancer, they improve his health in other ways, including: {{removing}} a scar, improving his eyesight, and making him more energetic and sexually active with his fiancée. In Stephen's lab, Andy <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> a bunsen burner causing a severe burn, but the nanobots repair the damaged skin in seconds.|$|R
60|$|Flora at {{that moment}} half-opened the door, and called Mr. Ward, {{stopping}} {{for a moment to}} say it was for nothing of any consequence. Mr. Wilmot and Norman were left together. Norman <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face and groaned--his master looked at him with kind anxiety, but did not feel as if it were yet time to speak of consolation.|$|R
6000|$|The almost {{universal}} habit of batsmen of shouting [...] "Heads!" [...] at whatever height {{from the ground}} the ball may be, is not a little confusing. The average person, on hearing the shout, <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> skull, crouches down and trusts to luck. This is an excellent plan if the ball is falling, but is not much protection against a skimming drive along the ground.|$|R
60|$|She stopped suddenly, and, held by her father's gaze, backed slowly {{out of the}} room. Mr. Porter, {{left with}} the chairs, stood {{regarding}} them thoughtfully. Their emptiness made an appeal that no right-minded man could ignore. He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth and his eyes watered.|$|E
6000|$|The bright {{sunshine}} dazzled his eyes, {{the passing}} vehicles and foot-passengers startled and bewildered him. He shrank into a by-street, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his eyes. [...] "I'd better go home," [...] he thought, [...] "and shut myself up, {{and think about}} it in my own room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear old chap!" [...] said Islington, laughing, {{and trying}} to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> Bill's bearded mouth, [...] "but you--YOU don't look exactly like yourself! You're not well, Bill." [...] And indeed, as he turned toward the light, Bill's eyes {{appeared}} cavernous, and his hair and beard thickly streaked with gray.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I! I don't {{want to see}} {{you make}} a fool of {{yourself}} before everybody!-—I say-—you'll have to come up stairs again, you know! Shut the door I say!"-—shouted Jock, as he found Armine deaf to all his expostulations, and then getting up, he banged it himself, and then shuffling back to the sofa, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face and exclaimed, [...] "There! What an eternal brute I am!" ...|$|R
60|$|And then at {{last they}} all got into bed for Wendy's story, the story they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually {{when she began to}} tell this story he left the room or <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> ears; and {{possibly}} if he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no answer}} to this. Dick <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> softly <b>over</b> hers; and, despite her half-hearted {{struggle}} to free it, he held on.|$|R
