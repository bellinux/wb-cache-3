40|$|Vibration {{control has}} been and still remains a subject of primary {{importance}} in modern manufacturing industry. To be able to remove high volumes of material in shorter {{time as well as}} {{to be able to get}} the right quality of the parts at the first time are goals that many shops would like to achieve. Tooling systems, and especially cantilever tools, and cantilever structural units of machine tools are the least rigid components of machining systems and therefore the most prone to vibration. Boring tools are often encountered as rotating tools in machining centres or as stationary tools in internal turning. In this thesis the focus is on internal turning. Internal turning is widely known as a very delicate operation and it is often carried out with cutting parameters far from optimal, from a productivity point of view, due to limitations imposed by vibration. Another type of tooling system whose functionality is impaired by vibration is the <b>parting-off</b> <b>tool.</b> The design of damped <b>parting-off</b> <b>tool</b> is one of the focus of this thesis as well. Vibration control has the purpose to achieve an efficient energy dissipation of a vibrational system. Basically this is achieved by controlling the damping of the system. Since damping involves the conversion of energy associated with a vibration to other forms, there are several mechanisms to remove energy from a vibrating system. Typically these mechanisms are divided in two classes: 1. Mechanisms that convert mechanical energy to heat, i. e. passive damping. 2. Mechanisms that transport energy away from vibrating systems, i. e. active damping. Both these techniques have been used during the years and both have been giving excellent results. The active vibration control mechanisms are more expensive and not suitable for machining due to the cables they necessitate that could interfere with the machining operation. This work proposes an original approach to vibration damping in machining systems, the objects of vibration dissipation being the structural components on the link between turret and cutting insert. The idea is to use composite materials to create damping interfaces between and within the different structural components. Different clamping system designs are being compared in order to see how these influence the performance of the machining system and different cutting inserts have been compared for machining hardened steel. The newly designed components have been going through both extensive off-line (modal analysis) and on-line dynamic testing (machining test) and the results show that the new tool holders used in combination with hydrostatic clamping system are the most optimal solution among the tested ones. The new design for the turret has been giving promising results and more can be achieved by bringing minor changes to it, these changes are being implemented at the time of writing this thesis.

40|$|Increasing steel {{prices and}} {{environmental}} aspects have put forward the demand to reduce material consumption in manufacturing industry and near-net-shape manufacturing techniques have thus become increasingly important. High-velocity parting-off, or adiabatic cutting, has shown {{to result in}} very low material waste as well as narrow dimensional tolerances of parted-off samples. However, for optimisation of the process improved knowledge is required regarding fracture characteristics and deformation mechanisms associated with the process. For evaluation of samples cut by commercially available technology, incorporating impact velocities of 5 - 10 m/s, a hydraulic high-velocity pressing machine with a <b>parting-off</b> <b>tool</b> was used. In addition, for evaluation of the possible influence of a higher impact velocity on the shear localisation, a non-conventional method was developed. In that case velocities up to 285 m/s could be employed. By measurement of velocities an estimation of fracture energies could be made. Microstructure evolution during deformation and fracture was characterised using optical microscopy combined with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. It has been concluded that for impact velocities of 5 - 285 m/s, the parting-off is, within {{the full range of}} velocities, initiated through shearing resulting in ductile shear fracture. However, depending on sample size and velocity the fracture mechanisms active {{in some parts of the}} fracture are ductile tensile indicating a triaxial stress state. Microstructural studies showed that the depth of the severely deformed region below the fracture surface is more dependent on the size of the sample than on the microstructure, resulting in much smaller deformed regions for smaller samples. The severe deformation results in cracks: For small samples only microcracks initiated on precipitates such as carbides and MnS inclusions, but for larger samples inter- and intragranular cracking also occurred. Electron microscopy of the severely deformed region below the fracture surface has shown three different types of structures: Right below the fracture surface a white-etching band (appears white in optical microscopy) consisting of nanocrystalline equiaxed grains was occasionally found. The grain size within this region was between 50 and 150 nm. The region below the white-etching band consisted of a mixture of equiaxed grains and highly elongated subgrains. The third region, located below region two, is composed of highly elongated subgrains. In the case of speroidise-annealed 100 Cr 6 parted-off at an impact velocity of 225 m/s the elongated subgrains were shown to have a mutual orientation, adjacent subgrains having (110) type of planes parallel. This could be an indication of formation of white etching bands being a mechanically rate controlled process involving dynamic recovery. In the case of parting-off pearlitic 100 CrMn 6 steel it has been shown that the lamellar spacing of the cementite decreases and cementite lamellae aligned in a direction perpendicular to the generated fracture surface are severely distorted during the extreme deformation, resulting in breaking up of the lamellar structure. The white-etching band consists of small finely distributed carbides in a ferrite matrix...|$|E
