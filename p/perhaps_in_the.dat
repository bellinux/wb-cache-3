5|$|Dynastic rulership {{among the}} lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at Tikal. According to later hieroglyphic records, the dynasty {{was founded by}} Yax Ehb Xook, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1st century AD. At the {{beginning}} of the Early Classic, power in the Maya region was concentrated at Tikal and Calakmul, in the core of the Maya heartland.|$|E
5|$|For much {{of recent}} history, Dhaka was {{characterized}} by roadside markets and small shops that sold {{a wide variety of}} goods. Recent years have seen the widespread construction of shopping malls. Two of the largest shopping malls in Dhaka and <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian subcontinent are Jamuna Future Park and Bashundhara City shopping mall.|$|E
5|$|Interesting, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use {{of weapons}} in these recent “revolutionary” works {{is that they}} are, {{generally}} speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances. The introduction of weaponry into Chinese ballet—regardless of the revolutionary message—was, itself, a revolution.|$|E
50|$|A flourishing metropolis, {{the crowd}} bustling about, each one conjecturing a {{beautiful}} wish {{to wait for}} his or her fate.

5|$|Sigeberht was {{probably}} either a younger son of Rædwald of East Anglia, or his step-son from Rædwald's {{marriage to a}} pagan princess from the kingdom of Essex. Nothing is known of his life before he was exiled to Gaul, which was possibly done {{in order to ensure}} that Rædwald's own descendants ruled the kingdom. After his step-brother Eorpwald's assassination in about 627, Sigeberht returned to East Anglia and (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of a military campaign) became king, ruling jointly with Ecgric, who may have been either a son of Rædwald's, or his nephew.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, {{another possibility is that}} he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, it is apparent that about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early hours of the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E

50|$|Example: If the {{negative}} argued {{the plan would}} cause nuclear war, which is bad, the affirmative could impact turn by arguing that nuclear war is an on-face positive event (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> preventing <b>the</b> development of even more deadly weapons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future).|$|R
5|$|After a power struggle, Bolesław III Wrymouth (r. 1102–1138) {{became the}} duke of Poland by {{defeating}} his half-brother Zbigniew in 1106–1107. Zbigniew {{had to leave the}} country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, who attacked Bolesław's Poland in 1109. Bolesław was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum (see Battle of Głogów). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1113. Bolesław's other major achievement was the conquest of all of Mieszko I's Pomerania (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father Władysław I Herman and completed by Bolesław around 1123. Szczecin was subdued in a bloody takeover and Western Pomerania up to Rügen, except for the directly incorporated southern part, became Bolesław's fief, to be ruled locally by Wartislaw I, the first duke of the Griffin dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{original}} monuments in Jordan, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of Iraq Al-Amir in the valley of Wadi Al-Sir, southwest of Amman, which is home to Qasr Al-Abd (Castle of the Slave). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, {{all of which are}} barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit the region in the year 362. Qasr Al-Abd {{is believed to have been}} built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them. After losing Philadelphia, we no longer hear of the Tobiad family in written sources.|$|E

25|$|At its zenith, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first half}} of the 1st {{millennium}} AD, Teotihuacan was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas, with a population estimated at 125,000 or more, making it at least the sixth largest city in the world during its epoch.|$|E
25|$|The Afroasiatic family {{probably}} originated {{during the}} Mesolithic period, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{context of the}} Capsian culture.

Around 1350, during the reign of either Philip IV or his successor John II, an additional storey was added to the tower with a rectangular turret on the top.
