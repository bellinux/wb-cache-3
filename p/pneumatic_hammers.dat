40|$|When bending {{sharp and}} Jagged edges of {{materials}} and riveting different components of the cars structures, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammers</b> generate noise and vibration. The severity of the noise as a potential operator hazard {{should be considered in}} light of the following data. The noise produced by the six studied hammers is impact noise with more than 20 impulses per second. The average peak pressure level is 131. 9 dB with the standard deviation of 2. 1 dB. The equivalent level during a shift work, 8 hours per day, is 114 dB. Hand-arm vibration has also been measured in each applicable direction (x,y,z).

40|$|ABSTRACT Body {{reactions}} during {{chain saw}} work were studied in 14 subjects. The subjects {{divided into three}} groups (control, sulpiride, and propranolol) successively cut down logs with a chain saw for seven minutes. The start of the sawing led to a pronounced increase in heart rate which persisted during the sawing. The groups taking sulpiride and propranolol showed a smaller increase in heart rate compared with the controls. Hormonal values (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, adrenaline (Ad), noradrenaline (NA), and dopamine) were increased by the operation. A com-parison of these values {{before and after the}} operation showed that the increase of cortisol, Ad, and NA values was highest in the controls, intermediate in the propranolol group, and lowest in the sulpiride group. The increase in ACTH, however, was greatest in the sulpiride group, intermediate in the controls and correct in the propranolol group. These findings provide some evidence that chain saw work may have an influence on the whole body, including the hypothalamus and the limbic lobe of the brain.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{vibration}} perception could {{be influenced by the}} device parameters and technique of measurement. The influence of confounding factors like age, weight and height on VPTs values was assessed in previous analyses in non-exposed subjects. The aim of present study was to compare the results of two techniques of vibrotactile thresholds measurement in workers exposed to hand-arm vibration. Two methods of vibration perception assessment were compared in 124 workers (21 – 62 years old, 1 – 40 years of employment) exposed mainly to hand-arm vibration during the work as: chain saw operator, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammers</b> operators, metal grinders, fitters, dentist techni-cian.

40|$|In the {{limestone}} quarries of Indiana, USA, pneumatic percussive hammers replaced the mallet and hammer around 1900. By 1917 the air hammer {{was being used}} exclusively for periods of eight to ten hours a shift. In 1918 Alice Hamilton investigated an unusual "disease" in these stonecutters of Bedford, Indiana, who complained of "attacks of numbness and blanching of the fingers coming on suddenly {{under the influence of}} cold and then disappearing. " The prevalence of vibration induced white finger (VWF) found in this population of 38 stonecutters was 89 %, with decreased light touch, pain, and temperature appreciation in advanced cases. In 1978 a VWF research team revisited these limestone quarries. During the 60 year interval the stonecutting industry had contracted from 4000 workers in 40 quarries in 1918 to 3 - 400 in 10 quarries in 1978, with only 50 employees remaining in the Bedford area. In a population of 30 stonecutters the prevalence of VWF in 1978 was 80 %, with similar sensory loss in light touch, pain, and temperature appreciation. Between 1918 and 1978 no change had taken place {{in the design of the}} air hammers used for stonecutting.

40|$|The Kirschner (K-) wire {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1909 by Martin Kirschner. This is a thin unthreaded wire of surgical steel with a diameter of up to three millimeters and a selection of different tips. The use of K-wires is often promoted as a simple technique because of its easy placement, cost-effectiveness and safety. The most important advantage of K-wires is the ability for percutaneous placement and is especially prevalent in hand surgery as {{the bones of the}} hand have suitable access for wire placement. The quality of K-wire fixation after drilling depends on several factors like drilling speed, insertion time and force, irrigation, K-wire diameter and tip configuration. These factors can lead to temperature elevation and subsequent disappearance of osteocytes in the immediate surrounding of the K-wire. In order to find out if hammering K-wires could prevent or lessen the amount of damage to the bone caused by high speed drilling, we analysed the insertion time, degree of temperature development, degree of fixation, histology, the influence of irrigation and the effect of K-wires with different tips. It became clear that there exists a positive correlation between the distance of the empty osteocyte lacunae and the drilling time. In daily practice this means the longer the drilling time, the longer the distance of empty osteocytes surrounding the pin track, i. e. the more osteonecrosis resulting in preterm loosening and pin track infections. We further found that reduced drilling times may prevent the disappearance of osteocytes in the absence of cooling. The use of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammer</b> however prevents for thermal related damage i. e. osteonecrosis without the use of irrigation due to the shorter insertion time and lower temperature elevation compared to the high speed drill. This was confirmed by the osteocytes which were still in the lacunae surrounding the pin track after hammering K-wires. Finally we showed that the fixation of hammered K-wires is at least as good as the drilled ones, especially concerning the hammered sharp trocar tip K-wires. Despite the promising results mentioned above, there does not exist a perfect hammering device at the present time. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammering</b> devices we used in our experimental setting were effective but had some serious disadvantages, like microfractures in the cortex. In order to use the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammer</b> in a clinical setting the device has to be further improved and adapted. In conclusion, the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hammer</b> seems to be an effective K-wire insertion technique. The in vitro and in vivo results we described are promising because they are at least equal and often better compared to drilling concerning insertion time, survival of the osteocytes, heat generation and fixation. However, the golden standard for insertion of K-wires at this moment is still the high speed drill. But more extensive research {{and the development of a}} perfect hammering device might probably change the second century of K-wire insertion in the near future...|$|R
