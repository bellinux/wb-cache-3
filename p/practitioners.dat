In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong <b>practitioners</b> in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.|$|E

In order to become a DNP, one would need to obtain his or her doctorate in nursing practice. Specific program requirements vary with each program.

In 2014 there were 3,065 DNP graduates.|$|R

But what about where it is the <b>practitioner</b> who wants to end the relationship with the patient? An example may be where the patient has subjected the <b>practitioner</b> to sustained harassment or has otherwise undermined the relationship such that the <b>practitioner</b> feels there has been an irrevocable breakdown in the professional relationship. Is the <b>practitioner</b> entitled to end the relationship? The short answer is that a <b>practitioner</b> may terminate the relationship, but such occasions are likely to be rare, and it should be done with great care. The doctor/patient relationship {{is at the heart of}} clinical medicine. Coles Medical practice in New Zealand 1 states that the essential elements of a good doctor/patient relationship are communication, respect, professional honesty and trust.

Discussion is organised in three parts. First, we explore what are generic good practices around all forms of <b>practitioner</b> research. Second, we move to identify particular forms of good practice within what we call Type 1 and Type 2 <b>practitioner</b> research, situating them alongside a <b>practitioner</b> research matrix of stakeholder benefits.

The <b>practitioner</b> then uses the ribcage or side adjacent the arm that encircles the opponent’s neck to trap the opponent’s {{head so that}} avoiding the choke is less possible. The <b>practitioner</b> will then clasp their hands together, in a gable grip, palm-to-palm, with hands in 90-degree variation one from another. Almost simultaneously, the <b>practitioner</b> will sprawl their hips backward and down, to circumvent any danger from sweeps. To finish the submission the <b>practitioner</b> will lower the shoulder that corresponds to the arm that encircles the opponent’s neck, reducing the supply of oxygen to the brain, by constricting the trachea.|$|R
