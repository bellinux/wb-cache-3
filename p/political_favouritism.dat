Kangler rejects the blame for the failed project and argues that his organizing committee has done everything in their power to host the event and that the blame lies on the shoulders of the Government and the [...] "third-rate state bureaucrats". To date, the Commission for Prevention of Corruption in Slovenia has issued multiple opinions in which they labeled some of Kangler's actions as [...] "corrupt".

Our analysis builds on a unique, comprehensive dataset covering all {{public procurement contracts}} and all corporate donations to major political parties in the Czech Republic over the period 2007 - 2014, and exploits changes in political control over regional governments within this period for identification purposes. We find that firms donating 10 % more to a political party gaining (losing) power witness an increase (decrease) {{in the value of}} their public procurement contracts by 0. 5 to 0. 6 %. Importantly, these gains from political donations accrue predominantly to firms with previous procurement experience, and only arise for contracts allocated under less restrictive procurement allocation processes. Established firmlevel political relationships and politicians’ discretionary power thus present crucial moderating factors for the impact of political donations on the procurement process. nrpages: 43 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In many {{developing}} countries, {{the beneficiaries of}} transfer programmes are determined by community-based processes, based on some general targeting rules related to needs. This {{opens the door for}} local social and political processes to impact on who gets access. Despite increasingly large scale social protection programmes in Africa, we have limited evidence on the political economy processes involved. We focus on Ethiopia were the local political authorities are in charge of food aid transfers. We investigate whether social networks and political connections matter for access. We find evidence for the hypothesis that the process results in the targeting of households that cannot easily rely on support from relatives or friends. On average, for each additional person the household can rely on in times of need, the probability of this household of obtaining food aid decreases with almost 1 percentage point. We also find strong evidence of <b>political</b> connections and <b>favouritism.</b> Households having close associates holding official positions have, ceteris paribus, more than 10 percent higher probability of obtaining free food than households that are not well connected with powerful households. We do not find evidence for the hypothesis that other social networks in the community influence the food aid allocation process. Finally, investigating reverse causality, we find no evidence that social and political networks are affected by the food aid transfer system. Food aid, transfers, political economy, Africa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Development of {{infrastructure}} {{to meet the}} needs of South Africans is a major concern for the construction industry, however the failure of the industry to keep up with the expectation has drawn some criticism from the citizens. Lack of adherence to ethical practices that help ensure transparency and accountability within the industry is a major impediment towards being a consistent and an effective contributor to the growth of the South African economy. This study therefore examines unethical practices in South African Construction Industry and measures to address the menace for better project performance. Well-structured questionnaires were administered on registered and experienced construction professionals within the industry and Mean Item Score (MIS) was used to analyse the returned data. Non-adherence to ethical practices in the industry are as a result of greed, <b>favouritism,</b> <b>political</b> influence, monopoly of bigger companies over smaller and emerging companies and pressure to meet unrealistic company objective and deadlines. The unethical practices prevalent in the industry include bribery and fraud, falsification of experience, illegal award of tenders and collusive tendering. These unethical practices result to dissatisfied clients, poor workmanship, poor quality of infrastructural development and loss of public trust. Professionals, especially construction and project managers should shoulder the responsibility of stamping out unethical practices in the industry by developing viable measures to achieve the goal. More so, whistle-blower protection mechanisms need to be revised and improved to encourage effective monitoring and sanctioning of individuals involved in unethical practices in the industry...|$|R

50|$|Since the program's inception, {{critics have}} pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design. Some claim {{that the amount of}} RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished {{families}} above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month. Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality. Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment. These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers. Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments. There have also been accusations of corruption and <b>political</b> <b>favouritism.</b> By some estimates, only 50-60 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed. Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments. It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates. For example, in the Prime Minister's hometown of Multan, there is twice the number of people receiving BISP payments than in Lahore, the opposition party's stronghold. Punjab, another area where opposition parties dominate, has the lowest ratio of eligible families—1,974 for every 100,000 people; versus 6,829 families for every 100,000 people in Sindh, the ruling party's stronghold. Beneficiaries have also complained that the postal service charges an additional RS 100 to RS 200 for each delivery of payment.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the relationship between the}} concept of neutrality in community mediation and partisan party politics in Nepal. Focusing on one donor-sponsored, US model-based community mediation programme in the Terai, this article contributes to a growing literature on authority formation and the role of party politicians in post-conflict Nepal. It argues that both neutrality and bias in dispute settlement are constitutive of building (Weberian) authority, allowing for the legitimate exercise of power by politicians. Neutrality is not only highly valued in mediation ideology, but is also a crucial legitimizing register in dispute settlement in Nepal. Although resolving disputes neutrally enhances the local legitimacy of (political) mediators, our research finds that there are cases when showing <b>political</b> <b>favouritism</b> also helps maintain power. We find that these contradictory incentives and the need to balance them guide the arena in which politicians choose to resolve disputes and how they choose to resolve them. These strategic decisions made by politicians in order to balance neutrality and bias thus guide outcomes of dispute settlement, and mediation in particular. This raises questions about the proclaimed ability of community mediation to overcome power imbalances and provide justice to disadvantaged communities...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how the EU LEADER Programme, as a policy to promote endogenous rural development, has met the institutional context of two regions of the European Union, North Karelia in Finland, and South Tyrol in Italy. In North Karelia, the backbone of the LEADER approach is rooted in the village movement and associational legacy; in a period characterized by an increasing withdrawal of the Finnish Welfare State from remote and sparsely populated areas, local movement is gaining a critical importance similar to when this social phenomenon emerged in the 1970 s. The empirical material suggests that LEADER best fits North Karelia’s rural policy setting, traditionally characterized by horizontal and power-sharing organizations. At the same time, the fragmented nature of Finnish intermediate level (between central and local level of government) prevents a unitary, strong, and politically-accountable development strategy for the region; this results in some discrepancies between rural and regional policy, and between rural and agricultural policy. In the South Tyrol case study, the LEADER method is rooted in the binomial politics-agriculture; if on the one hand the vertical, top-down approach adopted by the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol has successfully implemented a strong and politically-accountable development strategy for the region, on the other hand the main risks of exogeneity are <b>political</b> <b>favouritism,</b> and a potential inhibition of endogenous development processes. 1...|$|E

40|$|All Member States of the EU and {{countries}} from Central and Eastern Europe use agencies of various {{shapes and sizes}} {{as part of their}} system of public administration. The legal forms vary widely from country to country depending on the legal tradition and the system of administration. Public agencies, if properly designed and managed, provide an opportunity for decentralising public administration, achieving greater transparency in government operations, and improving the efficiency and effectiveness with which government services are delivered to end users. Agencies can thus be used for economically and socially beneficial reasons, and indeed are sometimes employed as a stepping stone to more radical options, e. g. the privatisation of government services. However, agencies can also be misused for purposes that contravene the tenets of good governance and sound financial management. They can be a source of inefficiency, unregulated and covert expenditures, <b>political</b> <b>favouritism</b> and corruption. This paper originated in a request from the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic for SIGMA advice in developing new legal provisions for the financial management of public agencies. However, this subject cannot be addressed without avoiding the broader context. This paper has expanded well beyond the scope of the original mandate. It highlights the practice and experience of five EU Member States with very different legal systems and administrative structures. It focuses on issues relating to the financial management of public agencies but also discusses, in less detail, other issues concerning legal structures and governance. No single good practice "model" exists in this complex field. International best practice is still evolving. Moreover, we recommend a cautious approach by countries that are tempted to transpose elements of the agency models applied in countries such as New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Would-be reformers should consider whether the legal and administrative structures are comparable, and the necessary systems of regulation, control and open reporting are in place and can be enforced. Whilst avoiding simplistic solutions, the paper includes recommendations that policy makers in Central and Eastern Europe should take into account before embarking on major reforms in this area. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary - {{document}} has {{no additional}} text]. What happens when member {{states do not}} comply with EU law? To answer this question, {{the role of the}} EU Commission as guardian of the treaties demands particular attention, especially the instruments it may employ, and the enforcement policy it actually pursues, against member states that violate binding EU rules. Our qualitative data on how fifteen member states have transposed a sample of six EU social policy Directives allows us to confront the Commission’s enforcement policy with the "real" amount of domestic transposition failures. We thus challenge the approach taken by much of the existing literature, which looks {{at the tip of the}} iceberg only by restricting itself to the analysis of available data on EU infringement procedures. This allows us to reject or validate some of the most dominant assumptions in this literature about the logics of Commission enforcement policy. We show that enforcement often does not take place at all or does not take place in a consistent manner when compared to the Commission’s own rules. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Commission heavily focuses on non-notification rather than on incorrect transposition. One of the explanations is that infringement procedures are constrained by the length and complexity of the Commision’s internal procedures. Although our data suggest significant diversity in the treatment of different member states, we argue that this is not the result of <b>political</b> <b>favouritism</b> but of the necessity to prioritise some cases over others under the conditions of administrative overload. Our sample shows that these prioritisations often follow different Directives. It seems that the choice is made largely by the responsible unit and depends on its workload, the complexity of the Directive, and the overall importance attached to the respective policy. Furthermore, we show that neither the general level of labour law protection, nor the level of misfit with pre-existing national policies, nor opposition during the negotiations determine the Commission’s enforcement policy – even though the last factor does have some influence. Finally, we discuss kick-start, acceleration and correction as different effects that infringement procedures had in the implementation processes under scrutiny. Overall we conclude that infringement proceedings as they are practised today are a rather inadequate instrument for assuring compliance, even though the situation would be even worse if there were none at all...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} the privatisation policy {{and its role}} in the transition to a market economy in Albania. The disintegration of the old regime took place over a much longer time than in other Central and East European countries, resulting in chaos and a political vacuum in which no systematic or effective policy could be formulated. The new government, committed to fundamental reforms necessary for a market economy, did not take power until after the second general election in March 1992. One outcome of this long pre-transition period was that the privatisation programme had to evolve gradually in the course of transformation, without ever having been planned in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Privatisation proceeded on five different fronts: small privatisation, privatisation of agriculture, housing, small and medium-sized enterprises and mass privatisation. The article discusses the progress of each aspect and provides up-to-date information and data on their progress. The privatisation of agriculture and housing were the most crucial aspects of the overall policy, with significant impacts on economic growth and the progress of the transformation programme. The privatised agricultural sector grew very rapidly and made a major contribution to pulling the whole economy out of the 'transformational recession'. Privatised housing created a significant wealth effect amongst the urban population, providing many of them with collateral or start-up capital. The privatisation of state-owned enterprises, however, was carried out with much more difficulty and controversy. Although auctions were to be the main method of transfer, ensuring a significant income for the treasury, in practice many enterprises were privatised through other methods, bringing in less income and giving rise to allegations of <b>political</b> <b>favouritism.</b> Another aspect of privatisation was the weak corporate governance mechanism which replaced state ownership. Many small and medium-sized enterprises (probably about half) were sold or transferred to their employees, without any outsider interest. The performance of this sector has to be monitored closely in order {{to assess the impact of}} massive insider privatisation, reminiscent of Russia's privatisation programme. Mass privatisation too, by distributing enterprise shares amongst the general public, resulted in the increased power of insiders. The shares of nearly 100 enterprises were transferred to the private sector over the first year of the implementation of this programme. Although the privatisation programme progressed very rapidly, no serious attention was paid to problems of corporate governance. Without concentrated ownership or the involvement of financial intermediaries to oversee and monitor the managers, it is unlikely that the expected efficiency gains will be realised. The political crisis resulting from the collapse of informal financial schemes brought the whole reform process, including the privatisation programme, to a halt in early 1997. It is expected that, with a new government in power, there will be a new push for reforms and an increased pace of privatisation. It is hoped that the renewed efforts will also deal with the shortcomings of the previous schemes-particularly the corporate governance issues. ...|$|E
