50|$|In {{the past}} decades, many {{excellent}} <b>power-aware</b> routing algorithms/protocols {{have been proposed}} for mobile ad hoc networks. However, most of the existing results rely on the knowledge of certain global information, such as the remaining energy of all nodes and/or the minimum transmission power between every pair of nodes. The maintenance problem of similar global information is highly challenging in protocol designs {{because of the difficulty}} and cost in the maintenance of up-to-date information. As a result, various assumptions, such as static network topologies and/or fixed traffic patterns, are made to reduce the problem complexity.|$|E

In 2015, Cadence released the Sigrity Parallel Computing 4-pack which enabled efficient product creation with 3X speedup in signoff-accurate PCB extraction, an updated <b>power-aware</b> system signal integrity (SI) feature which supports LPDDR4 analysis with full JEDEC compliance checking, and flexible licensing options.|$|E
50|$|The Si2 Common Power Format, or CPF is a {{file format}} for specifying power-saving {{techniques}} {{early in the}} design process. In the design of integrated circuits, saving power is a primary goal, and designers are forced to use sophisticated techniques such as clock gating, multi-voltage logic, and {{turning off the power}} entirely to inactive blocks. These techniques require a consistent implementation in the design steps of logic design, implementation, and verification. For example, if multiple different power supplies are used, then logic synthesis must insert level shifters, place and route must deal with them correctly, and other tools such as static timing analysis and formal verification must understand these components. As power became an increasingly pressing concern, each tool independently added the features needed. Although this made it possible to build low power flows, it was difficult and error prone since the same information needed to be specified several times, in several formats, to many different tools. CPF was created as a common format that many tools can use to specify power-specific data, so that power intent only need be entered once and can be used consistently by all tools. The aim of CPF is to support an automated, <b>power-aware</b> design infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Power-Aware</b> routing {{has proven}} to be {{effective}} in maximizing the life time of ad-hoc networks. However, all the previous works focused on the <b>power-aware</b> routing algorithms in a cooperative network, where all the nodes honestly report battery usage. However, selfish nodes in ad-hoc networks tend to misreport lower residual energy to maximize their own usage in practice. In this paper, we first show that it is a dominant strategy for a selfish node to report lower residual energy in a <b>power-aware</b> ad-hoc network, which diminishes the benefits of <b>power-aware</b> routing algorithms. We then propose a novel <b>Power-Aware</b> Reputation System (PARS), to stimulate cooperation on <b>power-aware</b> routing in ad-hoc networks. Analysis and simulation results show that PARS is effective in supporting <b>power-aware</b> routing in selfish ad-hoc networks.

40|$|<b>Power-aware</b> {{processors}} {{operate in}} various power modes to reduce energy consumption with a corresponding decrease in peak processor throughput. Recent work has shown <b>power-aware</b> clusters can conserve significant energy (> 30 %) with minimal performance loss (< 1 %) running parallel scientific workloads. Nonetheless, such savings are typically achieved using a priori knowledge of application performance. Accurate prediction of parallel power consumption and performance {{is an open}} problem. However, such techniques would improve our understanding of <b>power-aware</b> cluster tradeoffs and enable identification of “sweet spots ” in system configurations optimized for performance and power. Speedup models are powerful analytical tools for evaluating and predicting the performance of parallel applications. Unfortunately, existing speedup models do not quantify parallel overhead for simplicity leaving them incapable of accurately accounting for performance and power. We propose <b>power-aware</b> speedup to model and predict the scaled execution time of <b>power-aware</b> clusters. The new model accounts for parallel overhead and predicts (within 7 %) the <b>power-aware</b> performance and energy-delay products for various system configurations (i. e. processor counts and frequencies) on NAS Parallel benchmark codes. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present five {{different}} <b>power-aware</b> metrics based on battery power consumption at nodes for determining broadcast routes in wireless ad hoc networks. We show that using these metrics in a <b>power-aware</b> broadcasting algorithm reduces the cost/broadcast of routing packets to all destinations by 5 - 50 %over a broadcast tree constructed using a greedy strategy based on network topology information only (this cost reduction {{is on top}} of a 40 - 70 %reduction in energy consumption obtained by using PAMAS, our MAC layer protocol). We also show that the maximum node cost after many broadcasts is reduced by 20 - 150 % with the <b>power-aware</b> algorithm compared to the nonpower-aware algorithm, thereby increasing the life of the network significantly. For comparison purposes, we also ran simulations with the flooding algorithm for broadcasting which performs worse by a factor of 10 compared to the <b>power-aware</b> algorithm. An interesting property of using <b>power-aware</b> broadcasting is that the average packet delays do not increase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Power {{consumption}} {{is an important}} issue in the design of real-time embedded systems. As many embedded systems are powered by batteries, the goal is to extend the autonomy of the system as much as possible. To reduce power consumption, modern processors can change their voltage and frequency at runtime. A <b>power-aware</b> scheduling algorithm can exploit this capability to reduce power consumption while preserving the timing constraints of real-time tasks. In this paper, we present GRUB-PA, a novel <b>power-aware</b> scheduling algorithm based on a resource reservation technique. In addition to providing temporal isolation and time guarantees and, unlike most of the <b>power-aware</b> algorithms proposed in the literature, GRUB-PA can efficiently handle systems consisting of both hard and soft, aperiodic, sporadic, and periodic tasks. We compared our algorithm with existing <b>power-aware</b> scheduling algorithms on an extensive set of simulation experiments on synthetic task sets. The results show that the performance of our algorithm is in line with the state-of-the-art <b>power-aware</b> algorithms. We also present the implementation of our algorithm in the Linux operating system and discuss practical implementation issues like switching overhead and power models. Finally, we show the results of experiments performed on a real testbed application. Index Terms—DVS, real-time, resource-reservation, scheduling, <b>power-aware.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANET) is a {{group of}} mobile wireless nodes which communicate without any fixed networking infrastructure. The nodes in an ad hoc mobile network are typically powered by batteries with a limited energy supply. For MANETs, One of the most important and challenging issues is how to conserve energy, maximizing the network lifetime. Since routing is an essential function in these networks, developing <b>power-aware</b> routing protocols has been an intensive research area in recent years. As a result, many <b>power-aware</b> routing protocols have been proposed from a variety of perspectives.

40|$|As Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) power {{consumption}} continues to increase, lower power FPGA circuitry, architectures, and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools {{need to be}} developed. Before designing low-power FPGA circuitry, architectures, or CAD tools, we must first determine where the biggest gains (in terms of energy reduction) are to be made and whether these gains are cumulative. In this thesis, we focus on FPGA CAD tools. Specifically, we describe a new <b>power-aware</b> CAD flow for FPGAs that was developed to answer the above questions. Estimating energy using very detailed post-route power and delay models, we determine the gains obtained by our <b>power-aware</b> technology mapping, clustering, placement, and routing algorithms and investigate how each gain behaves when the algorithms are applied concurrently. The individual energy reductions of the <b>power-aware</b> technology-mapping, clustering, placement, and routing algorithms were 7. 6 %, 12. 6 %, 3. 0 %, and 2. 6 % respectively. The majority of the overall energy reduction was achieved during the technology mapping and clustering stages of the <b>power-aware</b> FPGA CAD flow. In addition, the gains were mostly cumulative when the individual <b>power-aware</b> CAD algorithms were applied concurrently wit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an eco-friendly daemon that reduces power consumption while better maintaining high per-formance via a novel behavioral quantification of workload. Specifically, our behavioral quantification achieves a more ac-curate workload characterization than previous approaches by inferring “processor stall cycles due to off-chip activities. ” This quantification, in turn, provides a foundation upon which we con-struct an interval-based, <b>power-aware,</b> run-time algorithm that is implemented within a system-wide daemon. We then evaluate our <b>power-aware</b> daemon in a cluster-computing environment with the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. The {{results indicate that}} our novel behavioral quantification of workload allows our <b>power-aware</b> daemon to more tightly control performance while delivering substantial energy savings.

40|$|New {{embedded}} systems must be <b>power-aware,</b> not just low-power. That is, they must track their power sources {{and the changing}} power and performance constraints imposed by the environment. More-over, they must fully explore and integrate many novel power man-agement techniques. Unfortunately, these techniques are often in-compatible with each other due to overspecialized formulations or they fail to consider system-wide issues. This paper proposes a new graph-based model to integrate novel power management tech-niques and facilitate design-space exploration of <b>power-aware</b> em-bedded systems. It captures min/max timing and min/max power constraints on computation and non-computation tasks through a new constraint classification and enables derivation of flexible system-level schedules. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} model with a <b>power-aware</b> scheduler on real mission-critical applications. Experimental results show that our automated techniques can im-prove performance and reduce energy cost simultaneously. The application model and scheduling tool presented in this paper form the basis of the IMPACCT system-level framework that will enable designers to aggressively explore many power-performance trade-offs with confidence.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{is an important}} concern at data centers, where storage systems consume a significant {{fraction of the total}} energy. A recent study proposed <b>power-aware</b> storage cache management to provide more opportunities for the underlying disk power management scheme to save energy.

This paper presents a new <b>power-aware</b> on-line algorithm called PB-LRU (Partition-Based LRU) that requires little parameter tuning. Our results with both real system and synthetic workloads show that PB-LRU without any parameter tuning provides similar or even better performance and energy savings than the previous <b>power-aware</b> algorithm with the best parameter setting for each workload...|$|E

40|$|<b>Power-aware</b> {{scheduling}} {{has been}} of great interest for systems whose energy consumption needs to be minimized. In this paper, we improve a voltage-scalingbased <b>power-aware</b> scheduling algorithm to reduce the task’s energy consumption {{at the cost of}} a slower execution rate. The improved algorithm allows multiple scaling voltage levels of individual tasks in a task precedence graph and attempts to maximize the amount of energy saved while still meeting a deadline constraint. Five bounded number of processor scheduling algorithms are used as the basis for this improved <b>power-aware</b> scheduling. Other sophisticated scheduling algorithms can be easily embedded in our improved <b>power-aware</b> scheduling algorithm to reduce the energy consumption. We use the simulation program AnyLogic ™ to implement an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface for building largescale task graphs and running various simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheduling can reduce the energy consumption and achieve more energy savings than the static voltage scaling step alone. In addition, our simulation tool also provides an efficient and effective means for building task graphs and viewing the scheduling results {{in the form of the}} Gantt chart. This simulation quickly facilitates the testing of the validity of a problem and its outcomes and greatly fosters learning.

40|$|<b>Power-aware</b> {{scheduling}} reduces CPU {{energy consumption}} in hard real-time systems through dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). In this paper, {{we deal with}} pinwheel task model which is known as static and predictable task model and {{could be applied to}} various embedded or ubiquitous systems. In pinwheel task model, each task’s priority is static and its execution sequence could be predetermined. There have been many static approaches to <b>power-aware</b> scheduling in pinwheel task model. But, in this paper, we will show that the dynamic priority scheduling results in <b>power-aware</b> scheduling could be applied to pinwheel task model. This method is more effective than adopting the previous static priority scheduling methods in saving energy consumption and, for the system being still static, it is more tractable and applicable to small sized embedded or ubiquitous computing. Also, we introduce a novel <b>power-aware</b> scheduling algorithm which exploits all slacks under preemptive earliest-deadline first scheduling which is optimal in uniprocessor system. The dynamic priority method presented in this paper could be applied directly to static systems of pinwheel task model. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm with the algorithmic complexity of O(n) reduces the energy consumption by 10 – 80 % over the existing algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining {{low power}} {{consumption}} is critical in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. With packet transmissions and re-transmissions consuming much of the energy resources in wireless networks, it becomes important to minimize the number of transmissions associated with the end-to-end delivery of packets. <b>Power-aware</b> routing algorithms must balance {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of selecting to forward packets over shorter high-quality links against selecting longer and less reliable links. This paper proposes a new <b>power-aware</b> geographic routing technique that combines geographic greedy routing with proba-bilistic random walks to recover from local minima (i. e., cases when the forwarding node is not aware of any neighboring node providing “greedy ” progress towards the destination). Building upon previous <b>power-aware</b> protocols without recovery mecha-nisms, our protocol uses simple distance metrics that combine information about the individual reception rates between node pairs and the relative forward progress candidate nodes provide towards the target destination. The combined metrics are used to make greedy choices (when at least one node provides progress) and probabilistic choices (when the packet recovers from a local minimum). Using simulations we show that <b>power-aware</b> routing significantly reduces the energy consumption in the network, and our probabilistic recovery mechanism can significantly increase the delivery rates with only a small decrease in energy efficiency.
