40|$|In this thesis, a Nonlinear Acoustic Technique (NAT) {{has been}} used to do a {{non-destructive}} quality assurance of <b>plasticized</b> polyvinyl chloride (<b>PVC)</b> specimens. The response of the specimen to an ultrasonic wave is analyzed in order to characterize its material properties. The analysis focuses on finding out linear and non-linear properties of the propagated ultrasound wave, such as the second order non-linearity parameter (β) and the sound velocity. The outcomes agree well with the actual properties of specimens in terms of: degree of molecular dispersion of plasticizing agent, non-mixed granulates and the volume fraction of air in strands. As conclusion, it was shown that non-linear acoustic method can be used for predicting mechanical properties of extruded <b>plasticized</b> <b>PVCs.</b> Furthermore, acoustic measurements can be used as on-line measurements during the manufacturing process. It will lead to: increased profit, saved time, less energy and lower costs. There are four questions which are base of this thesis: 1. Is it possible to use non-linear acoustic methods to detect non-mixed granulates within strands? If so, what are the limits? 2. Is it possible to evaluate the degree of molecular dispersion of plasticizing agent with non-linear acoustic methods? If so, what are the limits? 3. Is it possible to determine the volume fraction of air in strands with non-linear acoustics methods? 4. If acoustics methods are used for on-line measurements, what are the limitations and how is it possible to automate measurements with respect to the conceptual design of non-linear methods? The three first questions can be shortened in, investigating degree of non-mixed granulates, molecular dispersion and volume of air in extruded PVC materials. To investigate them, the second order non-linearity parameter (β) and velocity of propagated ultrasound wave in material are measured. β parameter which indicates nonlinear behavior of material is used to examine quality of different PVC samples (non-mixed granulates and molecular dispersion), with respect to each other. Moreover, sound velocity is used to compare volume of air in the samples.

This study focuses on polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) enhanced polymeric systems. POSS are hybrid organic-inorganic nano-scale molecules which consist of a silica cage with functional groups attached to the cage comers. Various binary and ternary polymer blends were produced by incorporating methacryl-POSS (C 56 I 88, 28 Si 8) (mPOSS) and dioctyl phthalate (DOP) into poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) through melt blending. mPOSS {{was found to be}} miscible with PVC up to 15 wt% added. Both mPOSS and DOP <b>plasticize</b> <b>PVC</b> and reduce the [alpha]-transition temperature. While mPOSS also reduces the secondary ([beta]) transition temperatures in PVC, DOP was found to restrict the p-relaxation motions. (cont.) The rate-dependent yield and postyield behavior was characterized in compression testing over a wide range of strain rate (10 - 4 /s to [approx. ] 4000 /s). Due to the geometric and size distinctions between the two molecules, mPOSS and DOP have different influences on PVC local molecular motions, resulting in dissimilar mechanical behavior. A clear rate-dependent sensitivity transition in yield was observed in the pure PVC and PVC/mPOSS blends in the intermediate strain rate regime, which is attributed to the need for stress-assisted activation of [beta]-motions at high strain rates. A transition in rate sensitivity was also identified in high DOP content compounds; this transition is due to the [alpha]-transition. The potential of using POSS as a plasticizer for PVC was evaluated. Through the use of ternary compositions, the proportion of mPOSS in PVC was increased substantially. The T 8 of appropriately formulated ternary PVC/mPOSS/DOP compounds can be reduced to near room temperature, and these materials exhibit desirable ductile behavior. A constitutive model was used to predict the large deformation behavior of the PVC compounds. The two-process model is shown to capture the rate-sensitivity transitions in yield and the large deformation stress-strain behavior at low and high strain rates. by Sharon Yu-Wen Soong. Thesis (Ph.
