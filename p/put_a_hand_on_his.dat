60|$|Johnny <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{lips and}} beckoned Bumble to come inside.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned from}} me, and her mood changed swiftly. For she laughed lightly, musically, and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|E

60|$|Auchincloss {{stood up}} and, shaking himself {{as if to}} ward off his testy temper, he <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Dale's arm.|$|R
6000|$|But Tarvrille {{restrained}} his forbidding arm, {{and then}} after <b>a</b> second's interval <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my shoulder. [...] "Come," [...] he said....|$|R
60|$|A {{moment after}} the man made a heavy {{movement}} forward, as if to recover his tool; but the doctor <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Down, Mischief, down!" [...] said Spini, {{with sudden}} roughness. [...] "Malediction!" [...] he added, still more gruffly, pushing the dog aside; then, {{starting}} from his seat, he stood close to Tito, and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{shoulder as he}} spoke.|$|E
6000|$|She laughed happily. [...] "It's {{only the}} next day. Just keep {{where you are}} till the sun gets a little higher." [...] She drew near and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> brow. [...] "You don't feel feverish. Oh, I hope this trip hasn't set you back." ...|$|E
60|$|With a solemnity {{that touched}} Felix, John <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{each side of}} her face, raised it, and {{kissed her on the}} forehead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well {{up in your}} studies?" [...] he asked, cordially. Then he seated himself, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each knee, and {{deliberately}} and curiously studied Ken.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Ay!’ {{returned}} Will, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each of Trotty’s shoulders. ‘And like {{to prove}} a’most {{as good a}} friend, if that can be, as one I found.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Joel spoke huskily. There was {{no doubt}} that he had been deeply hurt. Lucy saw tears in his eyes, and her first impulse was to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> and tell him how sorry she was. But she desisted. She did not feel at her ease with Joel.|$|E
6000|$|The chief {{strode to}} Neale and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. [...] "Son, I believe you. Maybe I've {{been a little}} hard. Let's forget it." [...] His tone {{softened}} {{and there was a}} close pressure of his hand. [...] "The thing is now--will you come back on the job?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kurt, I understand," [...] she said, softly, and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. And {{she stood}} thus beside him, sadly troubled, vaguely {{divining}} that her presence was helpful, until he recovered his composure. As {{he raised his}} head and wiped tears from his eyes he made no excuses for his weakness, nor did he show any shame.|$|E
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{either side}} of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.|$|R
60|$|JAYSON--[Starting {{to follow}} SHEFFIELD, hesitates and <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his son's shoulder.] Curt. Remember I'm your father. Can't you confide in me? I'll do {{anything}} to help.|$|R
6000|$|Slone went {{close to}} the King and, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the pommel, {{he looked up at}} Lucy. [...] "Maybe--it is--a dream--an' you won't come back," [...] he said, with {{unsteady}} voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{got to see}} Reddy {{for myself}} before I'll go a step nearer," [...] he whispered. Just then Johnny Chuck <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> lips and pointed with the other hand. There was Reddy Fox {{crawling}} out of his doorway into the sun. Peter Rabbit leaned forward to see better. Was Reddy Fox really so badly hurt, or was he only pretending? ...|$|E
6000|$|As Ken {{walked out}} toward the pitcher's box Homans <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm, and said: [...] "Kid, put them all over. Don't waste any. Make every batter hit. Keep your nerve. We're back of you out here." [...] Then Reddy Ray, in passing, spoke with a cool, quiet faith that thrilled Ken, [...] "Peg, we've got enough runs now to win." ...|$|E
60|$|Mercedes {{called to}} Yaqui. At her bidding {{there was always}} a {{suggestion}} of hurry, which otherwise was never manifest in his actions. She <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bared muscular arm and began to speak in Spanish. Her voice was low, swift, full of deep emotion, sweet as the sound of a bell. It thrilled Gale, though he understood scarcely a word she said. He did not need translation to know that here spoke the longing of a woman for life, love, home, the heritage of a woman's heart.|$|E
6000|$|Fan {{moved to}} her side. [...] "Dear Constance," [...] she said, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the other's shoulder, [...] "it {{is better to}} cry than to be as you have been all these days." ...|$|R
60|$|Dick {{looked from}} me to Jim, and Jim slowly straitened his tall form. For a moment neither spoke. Dick's white face caused me to look away from him. Jim <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just never}} {{can get by}} this place," [...] {{explained}} the rancher, as he came and stood {{so that he could}} <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Dorn's knee. [...] "Look, son--an' Lenore, don't you miss this." ...|$|R
6000|$|A smile went straying {{about in}} the shadows of his brother's face. [...] "A woman? Little Nollie! Bob, I've made a terrible mess of it with my girls." [...] He hid his lips with his hand, and turned again to the flames. Robert felt a lump in his throat. [...] "Oh! Hang it, old boy, I don't think that. What else could you have done? You take too much on yourself. After all, they're fine girls. I'm sure Nollie's a darling. It's these modern notions, and this war. Cheer up! It'll all dry straight." [...] He went up to his brother and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. Edward seemed to stiffen under that touch.|$|E
5000|$|The Connie Blair {{series has}} been criticized for its sexism. As critic Bobbie Ann Mason writes, [...] "the series {{stresses}} appearance, popularity, and femininity as I.D. card for entry into the business world" [...] Mason cites several moments from the series in which Connie uses sex appeal, rather than brains, to achieve her goals: She <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm and looked at him {{in a way that would}} have melted a stronger man.She tried to look especially appealing and demure, because she wanted to get her information in a hurry.|$|E
5000|$|A famous {{incident}} is consistently reported {{from various sources}} in slightly different versions that during the planning in 1944 of Operation Bagration, Rokossovsky disagreed with Stalin, who demanded in accordance with Soviet war practice a single break-through of the German frontline. Rokossovsky held firm in his argument for two points of break-through. Stalin ordered Rokossovsky to [...] "go and think it over" [...] three times, but every time he returned and gave the same answer [...] "two break-throughs, comrade Stalin, two break-throughs". After the third time Stalin remained silent, but walked over to Rokossovsky and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. A tense moment followed as the whole room waited for Stalin to rip the epaulette from Rokossovsky's shoulder; instead, Stalin said [...] "Your confidence speaks for your sound judgement", and ordered the attack to go forward according to Rokossovsky's plan. The battle was successful and Rokossovsky's reputation was assured. After crushing German Army Group Centre in Belarus, Rokossovsky's armies reached the east bank of the Vistula opposite Warsaw by mid-1944. For these victories he gained the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Stalin once said: [...] "I have no Suvorov, but Rokossovsky is my Bagration".|$|E
60|$|The girl sat very insecurely, {{clinging}} fast. He <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her waist, {{to support}} her. And {{he held her}} closely, he clasped her as in an embrace, he was weak with desire as he strode beside her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Jessie, we {{will take}} you first. The stream runs strongly, and it were best that you went over separately. All {{you have to do}} is to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{shoulder}} of each of us. Come along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "do it! Do it, and {{see what}} happens. By God, if you <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> me, I'll finish you. Do {{you think you can}} bully me? Do you think I care for your size?" ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Toby, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each knee, {{bent down}} his {{nose to the}} basket, {{and took a long}} {{inspiration}} at the lid; the grin upon his withered face expanding in the process, as if he were inhaling laughing gas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dull; {{things will}} look up toward spring, they say. I get on well enough, but I miss you fellows dreadfully;" [...] and Ed <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the broad {{shoulder}} of each friend, {{as if he}} longed to be a school-boy again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. Thank you. It's {{a weight}} off my mind," [...] says the trooper with a heave {{of his chest}} as he unfolds his arms and <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each leg, [...] "though I had set my heart on being scratched, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't say nothing, sir, for I {{could make}} neither head nor tail {{of what he}} was saying, and, I dessay, looked as {{surprised}} as might be. Then he takes a step forward, and he <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my shoulder, and says he: ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Deemas {{was a sort}} {{of human}} eagle. She had an eagle eye, an aquiline nose, an eagle flounce, and an eagle heart. Going up to Miss Tippet, she <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each of her shoulders, and stooping down, pecked her, so to speak, on each cheek.|$|R
60|$|Somehow Bostil {{could not}} find words for {{what he wanted to}} say. He <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the red stallion--patted his shoulder. Then he gripped Slone close and hard. He was {{thinking}} how he would have gloried in a son like this young, wild rider. Then he again faced his comrades.|$|R
