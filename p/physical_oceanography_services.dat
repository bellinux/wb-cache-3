40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to review {{progress}} in the fields of atmospheric science and <b>physical</b> <b>oceanography</b> made by workers based at South African institutions over approximately the last 5 years. Research published by South African scientists working abroad is not included. Most published research in these fields falls within the broad areas of climate variability, climate change, aerosols and atmospheric pollution, seasonal forecasting, numerical modelling (both atmospheric and oceanic), and the <b>physical</b> <b>oceanography</b> of the Agulhas and Benguela current systems. Most but not all of the atmospheric science papers relate to South Africa or southern Africa; however, some work pertaining to the southern hemisphere as a whole or to other regions has been done. We note that funding and institutional support for atmospheric science and <b>physical</b> <b>oceanography</b> research in South Africa remains poor and this situation significantly hampers local efforts...|$|R
