5|$|Fatboy and Poppy's {{relationship}} turns sour when Poppy {{suggests that}} they should buy a house together. Fatboy eventually <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> together and tells her that they haven't been together long enough yet. She then ends their relationship and Fatboy moves in with Tamwar. Fatboy later suggests to Poppy that they rent a flat to begin with and take it from there. The couple reunite with a romantic kiss. However, when Denise feels uncomfortable with the way her new fiancée Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is currently treating her, she gets comfort from Fatboy and the pair are unable to resist each other. When Poppy finds out that they shared a kiss, they realise {{that they are not}} right for each other and Poppy returns to go and live with her mum. Upset by the couple's break-up, Fatboy gently tells Dot that her and Poppy are still friends. He supports Dot when he learns that her son Nick Cotton (John Altman) dies and is surprised by the arrival of her estranged grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). When Fatboy is told that he is no longer needed at The Queen Vic, he accepts a job at Ian's restaurant as a waiter. Denise feels awkward and confesses the truth to Ian, but doesn't mention Fatboy's name. Fatboy spends time away from Walford caring for his uncle when he falls ill, and, on his return, Dot suggests that he finds a new place to live, due to Charlie moving in with her and her only being allowed one lodger by council regulations. When Charlie's son is born, Fatboy is unsuccessful in persuading Charlie to take the baby home. He follows Charlie home and discovers that Nick is alive. When Charlie later moves out, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. On Ladies' Night at the Vic, Fatboy consoles Denise when their kiss during the engagement party is revealed. Tina visits Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) to find Fatboy with her.|$|E
25|$|Savil, realizing Vanyel needs special assistance, {{takes him}} to the Tayledras, human beings who live in K'Treva, an {{environment}} immersed in magic. They {{teach him how to}} control his abilities, and convince him that being gay is not wrong or sinful. Vanyel {{does not want to be}} a Herald or a Mage, and suspects the people around him value his powers, not himself. He runs away, but as he thinks things over he realizes that Savil and the others have shown that they care about him. Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can even think to do anything, he witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.|$|E
500|$|Chris {{is shown}} {{participating}} in the video [...] "Take on Me" [...] — a song released by a-ha in 1985 — while fetching milk for Lois. He then breaks out on the other side, with no understanding of what just happened. Lois calls on Brian saying {{he was too busy}} eye-balling Glenn Close on Redbook magazine. Chris watches the movie The Blob. Peter riding Falkor the luckdragon is a reference to fantasy novel The Neverending Story. The chase sequence between Lois and Joe is a reference to a sequence from Raiders of the Lost Ark as Joe is pulled along by the attached garden hose and <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> under the moving car.

The Griffins escaping out of their apartment to evade Joe is a reference to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids, {{with the rest of the}} chase through Asiantown being a reference to Revenge of the Pink Panther. The police helicopter pilot in Asiantown stating he pretends he is shooting at Jamie Farr and Alan Alda when firing rockets is a reference to the actors of M*A*S*H. Joe shooting down two TIE fighters while flying through the sewer is a reference to Star Wars. Characters from the 1985 adventure–comedy film The Goonies are seen talking with the Griffins in the sewer.

2500|$|Venus and Adonis is a {{narrative}} poem by William Shakespeare {{that was published}} in 1593 and is probably Shakespeare's first publication. [...] As noted by Erwin Panofsky, the poem certainly has similarities with Titian's painting, general ones in that Venus has difficulty attracting the very young Adonis, and in specific details. [...] On his last morning she tries to physically restrain him from going hunting, but he <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> away, as in the Titian.|$|E

60|$|NAPOLEON. Of course. (Suddenly recollecting himself.) Stop: no.

6000|$|STEPHEN: (Nervous, friendly, <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> up) I {{understand}} {{your point of}} view though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicines.
