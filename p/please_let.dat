25|$|The pink {{sandstone}} {{sculptures of}} Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) {{to reach a}} very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art {{that the world is}} now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

500|$|After Harriet Adams died in 1982, her protÃ©gÃ©, Nancy Axelrad, oversaw {{production}} of the Nancy Drew books briefly before the Stratemeyer Syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers. The books and Nancy's character began to change as a result, although there is disagreement {{on the nature of}} this change. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes [...] "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [...] since 1956."

500|$|When Kabila {{took power}} in 1997, {{the country was}} renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo and so {{the name of the}} {{national}} army changed once again, to the Forces armÃ©es congolaises (FAC). Tanzania sent six hundred military advisors to train Kabila's new army in May 1997. Command over the armed forces in {{the first few months of}} Kabila's rule was vague. GÃ©rard Prunier writes that 'there was no minister of defence, no known chief of staff, and no ranks; all officers were Cuban-style 'commanders' called 'Ignace', 'Bosco', Jonathan', or 'James', who occupied connecting suites at the Intercontinental Hotel and had presidential list cell-phone numbers. None spoke French or Lingala, but all spoke Kinyarwanda, Swahili, and, quite often, English.' On being asked by Belgian journalist Colette Braeckman what was the actual army command structure apart from himself, Kabila answered 'We are not going to expose ourselves and risk being destroyed by showing ourselves openly... We are careful so that the true masters of the army are not known. It is strategic. <b>Please,</b> <b>let</b> us drop the matter.' Kabila's new Forces armÃ©es congolaises were riven with internal tensions. The new FAC had Banyamulenge fighters from South Kivu, kadogo child soldiers from various eastern tribes, such as Thierry Nindaga, Safari Rwekoze, etc... Lunda Katangese Tigers of the former FNLC, and former FAZ personnel. Mixing these disparate and formerly warring elements together led to mutuny. On 23 February 1998, a mostly Banyamulenge unit mutiniued at Bukavu after its officers tried to disperse the soldiers into different units spread all around the Congo. By mid-1998, formations on the outbreak of the Second Congo War included the Tanzanian-supported 50th Brigade, headquartered at Camp Kokolo in Kinshasa, and the 10th Brigade â€” one of the best and largest units in the army â€” stationed in Goma, as well as the 12th Brigade in Bukavu. The declaration of the 10th Brigade's commander, former DSP officer Jean-Pierre Ondekane, on 2 August 1998 that he no longer recognised Kabila as the state's president was one of the factors in the beginning of the Second Congo War.|$|E
