As physical reactions are aroused by fluctuating acoustical features of the music, it has been suggested that ratings of physical reactions for each music passage differ. In this light this study makes an attempt to clarify the relationship between overall and <b>partial</b> <b>evaluations</b> of physical reactions in listening to music. Four representatives of <b>partial</b> <b>evaluations</b> of physical reactions were calculated and it was hypothesized that one of them corresponded to overall evaluations of physical reactions. The four representatives considered were the mean, the median, the maximum, and the upper values of cumulative relative frequency distribution of <b>partial</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Absolute values of differences between overall <b>evaluations</b> and <b>partial</b> representatives of physical reactions were calculated, and then averaged to indicate degrees of correspondence. As a result, R 80, the 80 % value of cumulative relative frequency distribution, strongly corresponded to overall evaluations. This suggests that an overall evaluation is determined rather based on high <b>partial</b> <b>evaluations</b> than by averaging all <b>partial</b> <b>evaluations.</b> This study is expected to contribute to the quantitative clarification of SEM in the future. 1...|$|R

Previous tree search algorithms using a <b>partial</b> order <b>evaluation</b> have attempted to propagate partially ordered values through the search tree, which leads to many problems in practice, such as the complexity of backing up sets of incomparable evaluations. POB compares partially ordered values only in the leaves of a game tree, and backs up boolean values through the tree. A closely related new algorithm, linear extension partial order bounding (LE-POB), uses a standard scalar alpha-beta search with values from a suitably chosen linear extension of the <b>partial</b> order <b>evaluation.</b> As an application, the effectiveness of <b>partial</b> order <b>evaluation</b> {{is shown in the}} case of modeling capturing races called semeai in the game of Go...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} constructing an evaluation function for game tree search. The established method, which is used as {{the main component of}} almost all game playing programs, uses a scalar evaluation function, which is backed up through the tree in min-max fashion. We argue that partial orders can be used to construct a more expressive and more precise evaluation in many cases. Previous tree search algorithms which used <b>partial</b> order <b>evaluation</b> have attempted to propagate partially ordered values through the search tree. As a result, these algorithms have suffered from restrictions on the type of partial orders allowed and from the complexities involved in backing up sets of incomparable options through the search tree.
