25|$|On 5 March, Sapper Adam Moralee, aged 23, from 32 Engineer Regiment, died {{preparing}} engineer <b>plant</b> <b>equipment</b> for redeployment within Camp Bastion. Moralee {{was killed}} instantly when the bucket on the earthmover {{that he and}} his team were cleaning moved downwards and one of its teeth speared him between the shoulder blades. In April 2017, two members of the cleaning team were sentenced at a military court in Catterick to nine months in prison (for the Lance corporal in charge) and an 18 month suspended prison term with a curfew for the operative who moved the lever in the cab and made the bucket fall. Both were initially charged with manslaughter, but were both convicted on a lesser charge of negligence.|$|E
25|$|The {{furnaces}} of {{the steel}} plant were changed in the 1980s to designs which blow oxygen in from the front. This increased the production and also reduced the pollution. In the 1990s, they were additionally altered to blow oxygen in from the top as well. This further increase production and reduced pollution. In December 2000, all three production lines of Anshan Iron and Steel company switched from mould-casting to continuous casting. This new technology has significantly reduced the dust and other pollution in the city. The new <b>plant</b> <b>equipment</b> is also much less labour-intensive. This has meant {{a reduction in the}} workforce has caused an unemployment problem in the city. A new drive to market Anshan as a tourist destination is hoped to help bolster the cities economy.|$|E

25|$|It {{was soon}} clear that strict demand {{reduction}} programs {{would be needed}} to avoid widespread blackouts. In June 2001, the government created the Crisis Management Board (CGE), chaired by President Cardoso himself. The CGE received special powers among which was the authority to set up special tariffs, implement compulsory rationing and blackouts, and bypass normal bidding procedures of the purchase of new <b>plant</b> <b>equipment.</b> Instead of resorting to rolling blackouts, the government chose to apply a quota system. Quotas were established for all the consumers based on historical and target consumption level, applying bonuses for consumption well below the prescribed level, penalties for over-consumption and some freedom for the large users to trade their quotas in a secondary market. The government's goal of reducing historical consumption levels by at least 20% for an eight-month period was successfully achieved, with the government having to pay over US$200 million in bonuses to residential, industrial, and commercial customers. This achievement allowed the system to overcome that long period without blackouts and brownouts and proved the potential of demand-side management and energy efficiency efforts, which were able to create a virtual capacity of 4,000MW, helping the country to bridge the supply demand gap in a very economic way. In addition, the government launched a program for contracting emergency generation capacity, with bids for a total of 2,100MW of new thermal capacity accepted.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{commissioning}} of new dams in the James Bay area, the Tracy plant ceased operations {{prior to}} the 2010-2011 winter to be kept as a reserve.

2500|$|All {{electrical}} equipment was shipped from the US, including power system <b>plant</b> <b>equipment.</b> A power station was {{built at the}} Shore Road pumping station and was designed, anticipating extension of the electrification to the Wirral Railway, although this was not to occur until 1938. The conductor rails were fed direct, without any distribution. Four rail 600V DC electrification was installed, the positive outer rail set [...] from the running rail. The new multiple units had British wooden bodies on US bogies; 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided and trains were initially 2-car or 4-car sets.

Access to the building was provided by an ordinary door through an enclosed exterior stairwell from ARA-603, the Support Facilities Building. An emergency exit door was also included, with an exterior stairwell going to the ground level. The reactor building was not a pressure-type containment shell as would {{have been used for}} reactors located in populated areas. Nevertheless, the building was able to contain most of the radioactive particles released by the eventual explosion.|$|E

50|$|Planting also {{requires}} specialized <b>planting</b> <b>equipment.</b> The most common <b>planting</b> <b>equipment</b> is a waterwheel type transplanter. The waterwheel transplanter utilizes a rotating drum or drums with spikes at set intervals. The drum or drums have a water supply that continuously fills the drum with water. The transplanter rolls the spiked drum {{over the bed}} of plastic. As the drum presses a spike into the plastic a hole is punched a water flows into the punched hole. A rider on the transplanter can then place a plant in the hole. These drums can have multiple rows and varied intervals to create the desired spacing for that particular crop.|$|R

Often, a central office {{is defined as a}} building used to house the inside <b>plant</b> <b>equipment</b> of potentially several telephone exchanges, each serving a certain geographical area. Such an area has also been referred to as the exchange. Central office locations may also be identified in North America as wire centers, designating a facility from which a telephone obtains dial tone. [...] For business and billing purposes, telephony carriers also define rate centers, which in larger cities may be clusters of central offices, to define specified geographical locations for determining distance measurements.|$|E
2500|$|By 1922, {{more than}} a {{thousand}} steamships lay idle in the United States alone, and work in the shipbuilding industry was virtually nonexistent. When the last of the USSB orders rolled off the ways at Bristol, Harriman transferred the yard back to the ownership of the EFC, but he attempted to keep the Chester yard open by diversifying his product line. The MSC announced that it would diversify into [...] "steel construction in general, manufacturing and power <b>plant</b> <b>equipment,</b> machinery and machine work, railroad equipment and material, and plate shop works." [...] Due to increasing specialization however, the era in which shipbuilding companies could readily diversify into other fields had passed. Harriman was forced to close the Chester shipyard in 1923, and the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation was subsequently transformed into an investment vehicle known as Merchant-Sterling.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson quickly {{took control}} of the economy. All raw {{materials}} were under the control of ODM, which rationed them to the civilian economy. [...] Production quotas were set, and businesses ordered to supply the government with goods and services. Companies which failed to meet their production quotas were threatened with seizure by ODM. Companies found to be secretly diverting raw materials to civilian uses were severely punished through the withdrawal of lucrative government contracts, fines, and the imposition of government supervisors on-site at the workplace. Defense plants, concentrated at the time near existing manufacturing centers and where electrical power was plentiful, were dispersed across the Southeast and Deep South. The government restricted investment in new <b>plant</b> <b>equipment</b> so that only investments meeting national security needs were made. [...] Additionally, ODM invested millions of dollars in new plant and equipment to rapidly expand production capacity. [...] Strict price controls were placed on all goods and services, and wages were subject to federal government approval and control. [...] Black marketeers were severely punished with fines and jail sentences. Wilson's austerity program worked: By 1951, inflation had fallen back to 1.9 percent, and the economy was no longer threatened with recession.|$|E
