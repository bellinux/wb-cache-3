40|$|We {{investigate}} the rational cohomology algebra of various unipotent group schemes defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. For the r-th Fobenius kernel U_(r) of many unipotent algebraic groups U, we construct an algebra S^*(U_(r)) given by explicit generators and relations {{together with a}} map η_U,r: S^*(U_(r)) → H^*(U_(r),k) of graded k-algebras {{which serves as a}} good approximate model. Our work is motivated by the challenge of understanding the stabilization with respect to r of the cohomology H^*(U_(r),k) and the natural map H^*(U,k) →_r H^*(U_(r),k).

The O-C {{phase diagram}} of the 71 -s signal reveals out-of-eclipse phase {{variations}} resulting from the self eclipses of a nearly edge-on, non-axisymmetric disc. We work the forward problem of simulating DQ Herculis numerically using the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and from the time-averaged structure calculate the O-C phase variations {{as a function of}} inclination angle. The WET and SPH O-C phase variations match to a remarkable degree, and suggest a system inclination in the range 89. 5 to 89. 7 degrees.

(We later found statistical errors in some of {{the conclusions}}; we are still working on this.) Most of the redundancies in the later sections were deleted, but there were some errors related to graceful labeling that we had added. An important number-theoretical technique in the opening section related to one of the main techniques in the last (sixth) section, but we found a critical error: We assumed that N _r_k ∈ C (1 - 1 /r_k) =π(N), but later found this to be incorrect. That is, π(N) = N^ 2 / 3, as we had concluded was asymptotically true. Comment: There was significant text overlap with arXiv: 1102. 1087 and arXiv: 1107. 327...|$|R

40|$|Let R be a {{differential}} domain {{finitely generated}} over a differential field, F, with field of constants, C, of characteristic 0. Let E be the quotient field of R. The paper investigates necessary and sufficient conditions on R's differential ideals for the constants of differentiation of E to also be C (no new constants). It was known that no proper nonzero differential ideals guarantees no new constants. The paper shows that when C is algebraically closed that if R has only finitely many height one prime differential ideals that E {{will have no}} new constants. An example with F infinitely generated over C shows the converse is false. The paper gives conditions on C and F so that when F is finitely generated over C and R is a polynomial ring over F that no new constants in E implies that R has only fintely many height one prime differential ideals.

40|$|A raga is a melodic {{structure}} with fixed notes {{and a set}} of rules characterizing a certain mood endorsed through performance. By a vadi swar is meant that note which plays the most significant role in expressing the raga. A samvadi swar similarly is the second most significant note. However, the determination of their significance has an element of subjectivity and hence we are motivated to find some truths through an objective analysis. The paper proposes a probabilistic method of note detection and demonstrates how the relative frequency (relative number of occurrences of the pitch) of the more important notes stabilize far more quickly than that of others. In addition, a count for distinct transitory and similar looking non-transitory (fundamental) frequency movements (but possibly embedding distinct emotions!) between the notes is also taken depicting the varnalankars or musical ornaments decorating the notes and note sequences as rendered by the artist. They reflect certain structural properties of the ragas. Several case studies are presented.
