40|$|Functional imaging {{techniques}} have allowed researchers to look within the brain, and revealed the cortical representation of pain.

In this brief article, we review the imaging literature to date that has allowed these advances to be made, and examine the new frontiers for pain imaging research: imaging the brainstem and other structures involved in the descending control of pain; functional and anatomical connectivity studies of pain processing brain regions; imaging models of neuropathic pain-like states; and going beyond the brain to image spinal function. The ultimate goal of such research is to take these new techniques into the clinic, to investigate and provide new remedies for chronic pain sufferers...|$|R

Pain was classically viewed in terms of a single mechanism consisting of a modality-specific, hard-wired system of nerve fibres running between the periphery and a specific <b>pain</b> <b>centre</b> in the brain. The implication of this view was that pain could only result from clear tissue pathology, with the result that physiotherapy treatment was often directed at the peripheral source of the pain.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Based on the fear-avoidance and {{helplessness}} models, {{the relative}} contribution {{of fear of}} pain, avoidance behavior, worrying, and helplessness were examined in relation to fluctuations in functional disability in chronic-pain patients. METHODS: A cohort of 181 chronic-pain patients first completed various questionnaires and kept a 7 -day pain journal during a standard 3 -month waiting-list period prior to their scheduled treatment at an Interdisciplinary <b>Pain</b> <b>Centre</b> and did so again immediately preceding the intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, fear of pain, avoidance behavior, and helplessness all predicted functional disability after 3 months. Stepwise regression analyses showed avoidance behavior to be the strongest predictor of change in functional disability followed by helplessness, thus both ahead of fear of pain. CONCLUSION: The current findings support the roles of both fear-avoidance factors and helplessness in the functional disability in chronic-pain patients awaiting treatment but revealed a central role for avoidance behavior...|$|E

The alterations with aging of the neurobiology of pain have impacts of pain threshold, tolerance and treatment. In this review the available evidence from animal and human experimentation is discussed to highlight the differences between young and older subjects along with consideration of how these changes have practical effect on drug treatment of pain. Cognitive impairment, physical disability and social isolation can also impact on the accessibility of treatment and have to be considered along with the biological changes with ageing. Conventional pain therapies, while verified in younger adults cannot be automatically applied to the elderly without consideration of all these factors and in no other group of patients is a holistic approach to treatment more important.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{efficacy}} of shortterm transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment in chronic pain with respect to pain intensity and patients' satisfaction with treatment results.

One hundred and sixty-three patients with chronic pain referred to the <b>Pain</b> <b>Centre</b> entered the study. Conventional TENS and sham TENS were applied in the segments of pain, for a period of ten days. Outcome measures were pain intensity (visual analogue scale) and patients' satisfaction with treatment result (yes or no). The proportions of patients satisfied with treatment result differed significantly for TENS compared to sham TENS (58 and 42. 7 % respectively, chi(2) = 3. 8, p= 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: Pain {{acceptance}} {{is considered}} important for mental well-being with better functional outcomes for chronic pain patients. The present study explored whether pain-related variables (pain severity, pain interference, pain duration, and pain catastrophizing) and non-pain-related variables (personality traits) influence acceptance and additionally examined the interrelationship between the influencing variables and acceptance. Methods: One hundred {{patients with chronic}} pain from a multidisciplinary <b>pain</b> <b>centre</b> completed self-report questionnaires on acceptance, pain severity, interference of life, pain duration, pain catastrophizing, and personality. Results: Pain severity, pain interference, and pain duration had no significant correlations with acceptance. Pain catastrophizing and most personality traits were significantly and negatively related to acceptance. Regression analyses revealed that of all personality traits, the avoidant personality trait explains most variance of acceptance. Subsequent mediation analysis indicated that catastrophizing about pain mediated {{the relationship between the}} avoidant personality trait and acceptance. Conclusion: The findings indicate that acceptance is influenced by catastrophizing and avoidant personality traits. The clinical implication might be that acceptance-oriented treatments may prove less successful in chronic pain patients with more pronounced avoidant personality traits.

Different {{techniques}} for radiofrequency denervation of the sacroiliac joint {{have been used to}} treat this condition. However, results have been inconsistent because the variable sensory supply to the sacroiliac joint is difficult to disrupt completely using conventional radiofrequency. Cooled radiofrequency is a novel technique that uses internally cooled radiofrequency probes to enlarge lesion size, thereby increasing the chance of completely denervating the sacroiliac joint. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of cooled radiofrequency denervation using the SInergyTM cooled radiofrequency system for sacroiliac joint pain. Methods: The charts of 20 patients with chronic sacroiliac joint pain who had undergone denervation using the SInergyTM cooled radiofrequency system were reviewed at two years following the procedure. Outcome measures included the Numeric Rating Scale for pain intensity, Patient Global Impression of Change, and Global Perceived Effect for patient satisfaction. Results: Fifteen of 20 patients showed a significant reduction in pain (a decrease of at least three points on the Numeric Rating Scale). Mean Numeric Rating Scale for pain decreased from 7. 4 ± 1. 4 to 3. 1 ± 2. 5, mean Patient Global Impression of Change was "improved" (1. 4 ± 1. 5), and Global Perceived Effect was reported to be positive in 16 patients at two years following the procedure.
