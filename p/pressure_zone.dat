5|$|The north–south {{orientation}} of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean, forming an extensive rain shadow and causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52°S, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province and allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast. Patagonia is located between the subtropical high pressure belt and the subpolar low <b>pressure</b> <b>zone,</b> meaning it is exposed to westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40°S there is little land to block these winds. Because Patagonia is located between the semi-permanent anticyclones of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean at around 30°S, and the Subpolar Low at around 60°S, {{the movement of the}} high and low pressure systems along with ocean currents determine the precipitation pattern.|$|E
5|$|Patagonia {{is located}} between the {{subtropical}} high pressure belt, and the subpolar low <b>pressure</b> <b>zone,</b> meaning it {{is exposed to}} westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40o S, there is little land to block these winds. Being located between the semipermanent South Pacific and the South Atlantic Highs at around 30oS, and the Subpolar Low at arount 60o S, {{the movement of the}} high and low pressure systems, along with ocean currents, determine the precipitation pattern. During winter, both the South Pacific and South Atlantic highs move to the north, while the Subpolar Low strengthens, which, when combined with higher ocean temperatures than the surrounding land, results in higher precipitation during this time of the year. Due to the northward migration of the South Pacific High, more frontal systems can pass through, allowing for more precipitation to occur. During summer, the South Pacific High migrates southward, preventing the passage of fronts, and cyclones that can cause precipitation to occur, resulting in lower precipitation during this time of the year. Northeastern areas, along with southern parts of the region, are influenced by air masses from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in precipitation being more evenly distributed throughout the year. Most precipitation comes from frontal systems, particularly stationary fronts that bring humid air from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

25|$|The Tropical {{continental}} airmass (CT) finally retreats {{from most}} part of Nigeria, and the West African atmosphere around April to May, leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria. The sun's rays enters {{into the atmosphere}} of Nigeria more intense than it does during {{the presence of the}} Tropical continental airmass, which contained dust (in form of haze) that reduced the intensity of the sun. The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria. This low <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass (MT) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure.|$|E
500|$|Fronts in {{meteorology}} are {{the leading}} edges of air masses that have a density, air temperature, and humidity different from the air mass it is invading. When an air mass passes over an area, it is marked by changes in temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and often {{a change in the}} precipitation pattern. The change is called a front, whether it be warm or cold. Cold fronts develop when cold air masses, usually moving equatorward from the polar region high pressure zones, interact with warm moist air of [...] low pressure systems. The fronts develop at the leading edge of that cold air mass and wrap around (counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere) about the low <b>pressure</b> <b>zone.</b> [...] A polar front may form approximately along the equatorward edge of the high-level polar jet. Fronts are guided by winds aloft, but they normally move at lesser speeds than those winds. In the northern hemisphere, they usually travel from west to east, although they can move in a north-south direction as well as they may wrap around an associated low <b>pressure</b> <b>zone.</b> Movement is driven by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the Coriolis force (caused by the Earth's rotation on its axis). Frontal zones can be distorted by such geographic features as mountains and large bodies of water.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the Coriolis Force deflects wind and water currents. However, its influence on groundwater flow is neglected.

500|$|Both towers share {{a similar}} three-petal {{triangular}} footprint for stability and a tapering form, with sheer height and wind being the biggest structural design challenge. The smooth, sloped façade of Kingdom Tower particularly induces a beneficial {{phenomenon known as}} [...] "wind vortex shedding," [...] whereas normally when wind swirls around the leeward side of a building, rushing in from both sides to fill the low <b>pressure</b> <b>zone,</b> it would create tornado-like vortices, which would rock the building {{from side to side}} due to variations in pressure, direction, and velocity, the dynamic façade of Kingdom Tower creates an infinite timing differential (whereas Burj Khalifa is limited by the number of steps) in air pressure exertion in any one particular direction, thus creating a more stable structure, as there is no broad area of outstanding pressure or depression at any given time. Put simply, a smooth taper is more aerodynamic than an irregular or jagged taper, while both are advantageous over rectangular geometries. At Jeddah Tower's height, it is considered essentially unfeasible to use a traditional square design.|$|E
2500|$|The year {{is divided}} into a wet season from June to September—as summer warmth over Inner Asia creates a low <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean—and a dry season from October to June as cold {{temperatures}} in the vast interior creates a high <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> causing dry air to flow outward. [...] April and May are months of intense water stress when cumulative effects of the long dry season are exacerbated by temperatures rising over [...] in the tropical climate belt. Seasonal drought further intensifies in the Siwaliks hills consisting of poorly consolidated, coarse, permeable sediments that do not retain water, so hillsides are often covered with drought-tolerant scrub forest. In fact much of Nepal's native vegetation adapted to withstand drought, but less so at higher elevations where cooler temperatures mean less water stress.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dome and}} swirler are {{the part of}} the {{combustor}} that the primary air (see Air flow paths below) flows through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use bluff body domes (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create wake turbulence to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are swirl stabilized (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.|$|E
2500|$|The {{functioning}} of the anal canal can be damaged, traumatically or atraumatically. The resting tone of the anal canal {{is not the only}} factor which is important, both the length of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> and its radial translation of force are required for continence. This means that even with normal anal canal pressure, focal defects such as the keyhole deformity can be the cause of substantial symptoms. External anal sphincter (EAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired voluntary control, whereas internal anal sphincter (IAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired fine tuning of fecal control. Lesions which mechanically interfere with, or prevent the complete closure of the anal canal can cause a liquid stool or mucous rectal discharge. Such lesions include piles (inflamed hemorrhoids), anal fissures, anal cancer or fistulae. Obstetric injury may tear the anal sphincters, and some of these injuries may be occult (undetected). The risk of injury is greatest when labor has been especially difficult or prolonged, when forceps are used, with higher birth weights or when an midline episiotomy is performed. Only when there is post operative investigation of FI such as endoanal ultrasound is the injury discovered. FI is a much under-reported complication of surgery. The IAS is easily damaged with an anal retractor (especially the Park's anal retractor), leading to reduced resting pressure postoperatively. Since the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions contribute 15% of the resting anal tone, surgeries involving these structures may affect continence status. Partial internal sphincterotomy, fistulotomy, anal stretch (Lord's operation), hemorrhoidectomy or transanal advancement flaps may all lead to FI post operatively, with soiling being far more common than solid FI. The [...] "keyhole deformity" [...] refers to scarring within the anal canal and is another cause of mucus leakage and minor incontinence. This defect is also described as a groove in the anal canal wall, and may occur after posterior midline fissurectomy or fistulotomy, or with lateral IAS defects. Rare causes of traumatic injury to the anal sphincters include military or traffic accidents complicated by pelvic fractures, spine injuries or perineal lacerations, insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and sexual abuse. [...] Nontraumatic conditions causing anal sphincter weakness include scleroderma, damage to the pudendal nerves and IAS degeneration of unknown cause. Radiation induced FI may involve the anal canal as well as the rectum, when proctitis, anal fistula formation and diminished function of internal and external sphincter occur. Irradiation may occur during radiotherapy, e.g. for prostate cancer.|$|E

The results revealed there were positive <b>pressure</b> <b>zones</b> and vacuum <b>pressure</b> <b>zones</b> in the air gap between the thrust disk and the bearing.

40|$|Compressive ice {{failure is}} an {{important}} aspect {{in the design of}} offshore structures in ice environments. The authors concentrate attention on the crushing failure mode. The scale effect is a phenomenon whereby the average pressure decreases with contact area. In classical elasticity, viscoelasticity and plasticity, there is no scale effect. In the case of ice compressive failure, there is ample evidence of a scale effect. Two factors are dominant in this situation. Ice is prone to fracture, thus reducing the volume of material to be crushed, and aiding in the formation of high <b>pressure</b> <b>zones.</b> The second factor in the scale effect is the averaging process that results from the transition from local pressures on small areas (dominated by high <b>pressure</b> <b>zones)</b> to global <b>pressures,</b> where this effect is averaged. The analysis of probabilistic averaging is described with the example of pressures measured on the Molikpaq structure. The implications for design are significant.

Two kinds of models of rigid aneurisms are investigated: a basilar-like bifurcation and a ophtalmica-carotis-like bifurcation aneurisms.

The largest cerebral arteries are explored using MR velocimetry to determine boundary conditions and flow repartition at branch points. The numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows is obtained using the finite element method.
