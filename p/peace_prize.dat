5|$|Another {{controversial}} <b>Peace</b> <b>Prize</b> {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past <b>Peace</b> <b>Prize</b> laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

5|$|The {{interval}} between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement.

However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 <b>Peace</b> <b>Prize</b> just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.|$|E

5|$|He {{became a}} member of Institut International de la Paix in 1913. He was a {{consultant}} for the Norwegian Nobel Institute from 1904 to 1913, with the task of examining proposed candidates for the Nobel <b>Peace</b> <b>Prize.</b> From 1918 to 1942 he served on the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In 1931, he gave the Award Ceremony Speech for the Nobelists Jane Addams and Nicholas Murray Butler, but was absent in the decisive meeting in 1936 that awarded the Nobel <b>Peace</b> <b>Prize</b> to Carl von Ossietzky. He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940, but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.|$|E
