40|$|Project {{planning}} {{is considered to}} be critical for project success. However, recent literature questions whether planning has similar importance in various contexts. This paper investigates the effectiveness of planning through an analysis of 183 project manager-supervisor dyads. Participants in this study consist of employees of four Fijian government ministries. Results show that the level of risk moderates the impact of planning on success, and in different ways for various success measures. Practical implications of these results suggest project managers to have more emphasis on planning in high risk project situations in order to meet project efficiency, whereas <b>project</b> <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> to be more involved in approving plans of low risk projects to support benefit realization. While project managers tend to use planning tools regardless of risk levels, they may benefit from using more advanced planning tools in high risk projects and for short term predictable periods. In particular, this behavior will contribute to enhanced project efficiency, which is a common measure to evaluate project managers’ work. Organizations, on the other hand, may become more actively involved in low risk projects. This approach may specifically support project effectiveness, e. g., by focusing on planning the realization of target benefits. Senior executives can provide additional resources and specialized teams for project planning, as well as ensure project benefit realization plans are properly discussed and approved by <b>project</b> <b>steering</b> <b>committees.</b> Key Words: <b>Project</b> planning, risk, Fijian government...|$|R

40|$|One {{could argue}} that good project {{governance}} positively influences productivity, and that this shapes the economy in a sustainable way. However, there is a prevailing perception in the corporate and government environment that <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> and boards in some way constitutes good project governance. This perception appears to be based in part upon the presumption that the corporate sector always performs better than government; the corporate sector assures good corporate governance through boards; Ergo everyone else, including government, would perform better if they did the same. The paper argues that this presumption is indefensible {{as there is no}} scientific or rational basis to support it. Moreover, the concept of governance as <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> and boards can diffuse responsibility and accountability in the hierarchical structures of government departments and large organisations that initiate their own projects and this can lead to project delay, confusion and uncertainty. The paper reviews the literature on governance and <b>project</b> <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> and concludes that establishing project advisory rather than <b>steering</b> <b>committees</b> removes the potential for organisational power play and provides an effective consultation mechanism that facilitates 'best for project' outcomes. ...|$|R
