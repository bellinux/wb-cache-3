In 1923 Heisman coached the Washington & Jefferson Presidents, which beat the {{previously}} undefeated West Virginia Mountaineers.|$|E
25|$|The most learned {{men have}} sought to {{ascertain}} the secret, and fancied they discovered the seed. Their promises, however, were vain, and no planting was ever followed by a harvest.

25|$|Isidore of Seville {{wrote about}} the local music in the 6th century. His {{influences}} were predominantly Greek, and yet he was an original thinker, and recorded {{some of the first}} details about the early music of the Christian church. He <b>perhaps</b> <b>is</b> most famous in musical history for declaring that {{it was not possible to}} notate sounds, an assertion which revealed his ignorance of the notational system of ancient Greece, suggesting that this knowledge had been lost with the fall of the Roman Empire in the west.|$|E

The new republic, which hardly has a population put together better than Rome had to begin with, may perhaps take advantage of Europe some day, {{in the same manner as}} Europe has taken advantage of America for two centuries.

25|$|Den was the {{original}} landlord of The Queen Victoria. He <b>perhaps</b> <b>is</b> best remembered for his stormy love-hate relationship with his alcoholic first wife Angie (Anita Dobson). After nearly 19 years of marriage, he finally handed divorce papers {{to her in the}} 1986 Christmas Day episode that was watched by a record-breaking 30.15 million viewers, {{more than half of the}} UK population at the time. He was also well known for his later involvement with the criminal gang known as The Firm that eventually led to an attempt on his life in 1989. For 14 years, it was believed that the Firm's attempt on his life had been successful, but he returned to Walford in September 2003. Seventeen months later, his character was killed off again, this time for good, at the hands of his manipulative second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman). Den's last appearance occurred one day before the 20th anniversary both the show and his character's first appearance.|$|E
25|$|Bogor Laksa (Indonesian: Laksa Bogor) <b>perhaps</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} famous Laksa variant in Indonesia from Bogor city, West Java. The thick {{yellowish}} coconut milk based soup {{is a mixture of}} shallot, garlic, kemiri (candlenut), kunyit (turmeric), ketumbar (coriander), sereh (lemongrass), and salt. Laksa Bogor has a distinct earthy and nutty flavour acquired from oncom (orange-colored fermented beans cake, similar to tempe but different fungi). The hot soup runs, drained, and filled several times into the bowl contains bihun (rice vermicelli), ketupat (glutinous rice cake), smashed oncom, tauge (bean sprout), kemangi (basil leaves), yellow tofu (colored with turmeric) and boiled egg, until all the ingredients is soft and cooked. The authentic and complete Bogor laksa would include cooked shredded chicken and ground dried prawn, the cheaper street-side version however is entirely vegetarian, without any chicken or prawn, since oncom is traditionally regarded as a meat-substitute. Usually Laksa Bogor is served with sambal cuka (ground chilli in vinegar).|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} Soviet times Russia has {{experienced}} another wave of Western cultural influence, {{which led to}} the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The most vivid example, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>is</b> the Russian rock music, which takes its roots both in the Western rock and roll and heavy metal, and in traditions of the Russian bards of Soviet era, like Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava. Saint-Petersburg (former Leningrad), Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk) and Omsk became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include Mashina Vremeni, Slot, DDT, Aquarium, Alisa, Kino, Nautilus Pompilius, Aria, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Splean and Korol i Shut. At the same time Russian pop music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as estrada into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like t.A.T.u. in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or Vitas in China.|$|E
500|$|Burges's {{furniture}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim. In his major study of English domestic architecture, Das Englische Haus, published some twenty years after Burges's death, Hermann Muthesius wrote of The Tower House, [...] "Worst of all, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>is</b> the furniture. Some of {{it is in the}} earlier manner, some of it box-like and painted all over. This style had now become fashionable, though with what historical justification {{it is not easy to}} say".|$|E
500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>is</b> the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E

500|$|Because of her [...] "shabby" [...] retinue {{and short}} visits, Marguerite Louise {{garnered}} {{the reputation of}} a Bohemian among the courtiers of Versailles, and, therefore, was compelled to allow [...] "those of insignificant birth" [...] into her circle. The Tuscan envoy, Gondi, issued frequent protests to the French court against Marguerite Louise's behaviour, to no avail. Eventually, the Abbess of Montmartre, Françoise Renée de Lorraine, (1621–1682), when questioned by the King about Marguerite Louise's latest affair with a groom, replied, [...] "A conspiracy of silence is the sole antidote to the depravity and excesses of [...] ". This <b>perhaps</b> <b>is</b> the motivation behind the fact of Marguerite Louise's absence from memoirs of the time.|$|E
500|$|Writing in Rolling Stone magazine, Jody Rosen {{called it}} a [...] "pallid New York shout-out". USA Todays Steve Jones {{perceived}} a maturity by Jay-Z in the song, writing that [...] "The upper-crust landmarks he now references are {{a far cry from}} the grimy Marcy Projects sights that he once detailed, something that <b>perhaps</b> <b>is</b> to be expected from the self-described 'new Sinatra'." [...] The Daily Telegraph described the song's sound as [...] "anthemic club pop" [...] and called Keys's chorus line a [...] "singalong". Shannon Barbour of About.com called [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] the album's apex, while commending Keys for her [...] "excellent display of some unusually strong vocals".

500|$|Additionally, past macroevolution can be {{inferred}} from historical traces. Transitional fossils, for example, provide plausible links between several different groups of organisms, such as Archaeopteryx linking birds and dinosaurs, or the Tiktaalik linking fish and limbed amphibians. Creationists dispute such examples, from asserting that such fossils are hoaxes or that they belong exclusively to one group or the other, to asserting {{that there should be}} far more evidence of obvious transitional species. Darwin himself found the paucity of transitional species {{to be one of the}} greatest weaknesses of his theory: Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>is</b> the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record. Darwin appealed to the limited collections then available, the extreme lengths of time involved, and different rates of change with some living species differing very little from fossils of the Silurian period. In later editions he added [...] "that the periods during which species have been undergoing modification, though very long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which these same species remained without undergoing any change." [...] The number of clear transitional fossils has increased enormously since Darwin's day, and this problem has been largely resolved with the advent of the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which predicts a primarily stable fossil record broken up by occasional major speciations.|$|E

500|$|After {{sitting out}} the 1949 season to allow {{time for his}} back to heal from the surgery, Fonville {{returned}} to competition in 1950. The 1950 U-M yearbook, Michiganensian, simultaneously lamented about and praised Fonville's comeback, noting his return to form with a [...] throw in the Michigan A.A.U. meet in January and describing how it would have earned {{second place in the}} 1948 Olympics. However, Fonville was not able to throw at the distances he reached in 1948. After a victory in a meet against Wisconsin, The Wisconsin State Journal said: [...] "Charlie Fonville, the former world recordholder in the shot put, heaved a creditable [...] to win the event. The Negro star, sidelined for 18months, returned to competition three weeks ago to heave more than 55feet." [...] He also won the Big Ten Conference indoor title for the third time. However, the AP noted that Fonville [...] "returned to competition this season after laying out last year and either has lost his terrific snap or is favoring the back." [...] Jim Fuchs of Yale broke Fonville's world record, and the AP reported: [...] "An injured back, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>is</b> all that stands in the way of boosting the world's record for the shot put to 60feet. Michigan's Charlie Fonville, the athlete with the bad back, was the world's best shot putter two years ago and still holds the official mark of [...]" [...] Though Fonville won the 1950 Drake relays, his winning throw of [...] was described as [...] "comparatively puny" [...] compared to the [...] throws of Jim Fuchs that year. In 1952, Michigan track coach (and future athletic director) Don Canham dedicated his book Field Techniques Illustrated to Fonville as follows: [...] "Dedicated to Charlie Fonville a world record holder who accepted disappointment as graciously as he did fame and success." ...|$|E
