40|$|Effects of {{recombinant}} tumour necrosis factor (TNF) on {{functional and}} structural vascular volumes in solid murine Meth A tumours were investigated by injection of Hoechst 33342 and staining for the vascular basement membrane component laminin, respectively. Systemic injection of 3 x 10 (4) U TNF caused an initial increase in functional volume in the tumour, but a strong decrease from 1 to 48 h after treatment. Early effects of intralesional treatment were more moderate. Systemic injection of 10 (4) U TNF or 0. 3 or 3 micrograms lipid A caused a fall in functional volume at 4 h, but a recovery was seen at 24 h. This recovery {{did not occur}} after treatment {{with a combination of}} 10 (4) U TNF and 0. 3 micrograms lipid A. Structural vascular volume was not markedly reduced until 24 h after treatment with the high doses of the separate agents and the combination. All effects appeared generally more prominent in the tumour centre than in the borders. Data suggest that TNF induces initially an active hyperaemia that rapidly converts to <b>passive</b> <b>hyperaemia.</b> A prolonged disturbance of tumour blood supply is probably necessary for therapeutic activity. Breakdown of laminin in the vascular basement membrane may be a cause of loss of vascular integrity...|$|E
