50|$|A typical type of {{temper mill}} {{installation}} includes entry equipment for staging and accepting hot rolled coils of steel {{which have been}} hot wound {{at the end of}} a hot strip mill or hot rolled plate mill. Also included in a typical temper mill installation are <b>pinch</b> <b>rolls,</b> a leveler (sometimes two levelers), a shear for cutting the finished product to pre-determined lengths, a stacker for accumulating cut lengths of product into a bundle.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} the temper mill is the cold rolling mill stand which {{produces}} the temper pass. It will include electric powered drive motors and speed reduction gearing suited to the process desired. The design of the rolling mill can be a 2-high or 4-high (even 6-high in some cases). The mill stand can be work roll driven or back up roll driven. The mill can be designed with hydraulic work roll bending or back up roll bending. Installations typically have a single rolling mill stand, but may have two. <b>Pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> provide back tension for the pay off reel in the entry section and entry and exit tension for the temper pass.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The back {{group of}} the <b>pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> of the 1880 Slab Size Press are wearing away seriously in some {{domestic}} steel mill, so based on the finite element software a sizing press mode 1 is established. The major reason of the back <b>pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> wearing away is the partly contact between the rolls and the “dog-bone ” of the pressed slab. The work condition of the new bank {{group of the}} <b>pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> is greatly improved in the production line {{and the cost of}} production is saved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem that}} the <b>pinch</b> <b>roll</b> of the Slab Size Press was worn away partly {{appeared}} in some domestic steel mill so based on the DEFORM finite element software a pressing mode 1 for Slab Sizing Press was established. After analyzing the deformation of dog bone by the modeling experiment finite element, {{a new kind of}} roll is brought forward. The contact condition between <b>pinch</b> <b>roll</b> and pressed slab is improved by it so that the use time of the <b>pinch</b> <b>roll</b> is extended...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in coiler pinch roll technology include alloying of Bemcalloy C- 1 {{gray cast iron}} with Niobium. The alloy additions promote increased wear resistance without negative effects on the pick-up resistance of Bemcalloy C- 1 <b>Pinch</b> <b>Rolls.</b> The new technology, known as Bemcalloy C- 141, has demonstrated {{a significant increase in}} lineal feet coiled per stock loss in the initial trial campaign...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} initiates a {{study of}} the mechanics of four roll plate bending and provides a methodology to investigate the process experimentally. To carry out the research a suitable model bender was designed and constructed. The model bender was comprehensively instrumented with ten load cells, three torquemeters and a tachometer. A rudimentary analysis of the four roll pre-bending mode considered the three critical bending operations. The analysis also gave an assessment of the model bender capacity for the design stage. The analysis indicated that an increase in the coefficient of friction in the contact region of the <b>pinch</b> <b>rolls</b> and the plate would reduce the pinch resultant force required to end a plate to a particular bend radius. The mechanisms involved in the four roll plate bending process were investigated and a mathematical model evolved to determine the mechanics of four roll thin plate bending. A theoretical and experimental investigation was conducted for the bending of HP 30 aluminium plates in both single and multipass bending modes. The study indicated that the multipass plate bending mechanics of the process varied according to the number of bending passes executed and the step decrement of the anticipated finished bend radius in any two successive passes (i. e. the bending route). Experimental results for single pass bending indicated that the rollers normally exert a higher bending load for the steady-continous bending with the pre-inactive side roll oper?tive. For the pre-bending mode and the steady-continous bending mode with the pre-active side roll operative, the former exerted the higher loads. The single pass results also indicated that the force on the side roll, the torque and power steadily increased as the anticipated bend radius decreased. Theoretical predictions for the plate internal resistance to accomplish finished bend radii of between 2500 mm and 500 mm for multipass bending HP 30 aluminium plates, suggested that there was a certain bending route which would effectively optimise the bender capacity...|$|E
50|$|During {{the roll}} bending process the pipe, extrusion, or solid is {{passed through a}} series of rollers (typically 3) that apply {{pressure}} to the pipe gradually changing the bend radius in the pipe. The pyramid style roll benders have one moving roll, usually the top <b>roll.</b> Double <b>pinch</b> type <b>roll</b> benders have two adjustable rolls, usually the bottom rolls, and a fixed top roll. This method of bending causes very little deformation in the cross section of the pipe. This process is suited to producing coils of pipe as well as long gentle bends like those used in truss systems.|$|R
40|$|Scrotal pain is {{frequently}} encountered in practice, as it affects 4 men in 1000, with {{a peak of}} incidence {{between the ages of}} 45 and 50. After excluding an urological or gastrointestinal cause, referred pain of musculoskeletal origin should be considered, {{even in the absence of}} back pain. Described by Dr. Robert Maigne, this referred pain originates from a minor intervertebral dysfunction of the thoracolumbar junction. Imaging of the spine is not helpful. Rather, the diagnosis is made by seeking pain triggered by the mobilization of the lumbar vertebrae; the <b>pinch</b> and <b>roll</b> skin manoeuvre will highlight this referred pain. Treatment is symptomatic, though manual therapies by spine specialists are also recommended...|$|R
50|$|Rolled pleats create tubular pleats which run {{the length}} of the fabric from top to bottom. A piece of the fabric to be pleated is <b>pinched</b> and then <b>rolled</b> until it is flat against the rest of the fabric, forming a tube. A {{variation}} on the rolled pleat is the stacked pleat, which is rolled similarly and requires at least five inches of fabric per finished pleat. Both types of pleating create a bulky seam.|$|R
40|$|A new {{instability}} in the convective roll structure of a nematic subjected to an AC electric field is presented. It brings a new structure characterized by a periodic <b>pinching</b> of the <b>rolls</b> along their axis. This structure has features {{similar to those of}} the so-called skewed varicose in the Rayleigh-Bénard convection of isotropic fluids. The study of the streamlines shows that the pinching creates a new rotation mode and that this is the first important step in the disorganization of a convective flow before the onset of chaos...|$|R

No one noticed it, and it quickly drew back into the shadow. Suddenly, Naomi fell back on her pillow, her lips blue, her face horribly <b>pinched,</b> her eyes <b>rolled</b> up in her head. Maggie started up, pushed Mr. Leonard aside, and proceeded to administer some remedy with surprising skill and deftness. Mr. Leonard, believing Naomi to be dying, went to the door, feeling sick and bruised in soul.|$|R

The shaft, however, rapidly rallies, {{and brings}} {{up its own}} {{peculiar}} decorations to its aid; and the intermediate archivolts receive running or panelled ornaments, also, until we reach the exquisitely rich conditions of our own Norman archivolts, and of the parallel Lombardic designs, such as {{the entrance of the}} Duomo, and of San Fermo, at Verona. This change, however, occupies little time, and takes place principally in doorways, owing to the greater thickness of wall, and depth of archivolt; so that we find the rich shafted succession of ornament, in the doorway and window aperture, associated with the earliest and rudest double archivolt, in the nave arches, at St. Michele of Pavia. The nave arches, therefore, are most usually treated by the chamfer, and the voussoirs are there defeated much sooner than by the shafted arrangements, which they resist, as we saw, in the south by color; and even in the north, though forced out of their own shape, they take that of birds' or monsters' heads, which for some time peck and <b>pinch</b> the <b>rolls</b> of the archivolt to their hearts' content; while the Norman zigzag ornament allies itself with them, each zigzag often restraining itself amicably between the joints of each voussoir in the ruder work, and even in the highly finished arches, distinctly presenting a concentric or sunlike arrangement of lines; so much so, as to prompt the conjecture, above stated, Chap. XX. § XXVI., that all such ornaments were intended to be typical of light issuing from the orb of the arch. I doubt the intention, but acknowledge the resemblance; which perhaps goes far to account for the never-failing delightfulness of this zigzag decoration. The diminution of the zigzag, as it gradually shares the defeat of the voussoir, and is at last overwhelmed by the complicated, railroad-like fluency of the later Gothic mouldings, is to me one of the saddest sights in the drama of architecture.|$|R
