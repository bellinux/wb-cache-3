5|$|Tibetan Buddhism {{would become}} a <b>pervasive</b> {{influence}} {{on the lives of}} the people.|$|E
5|$|Corruption in {{many forms}} {{has been one of}} the <b>pervasive</b> {{problems}} affecting India. For decades, the red tape, bureaucracy and the Licence Raj that had strangled private enterprise. The economic reforms of 1991 cut some of the worst regulations that had been used in corruption.|$|E
5|$|Iron is <b>pervasive,</b> but {{particularly}} rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and blackstrap molasses. Bread and breakfast cereals are sometimes specifically fortified with iron. Iron in low amounts {{is found in}} molasses, teff, and farina.|$|E
5|$|Many BART {{stations}} offer parking, however, under-pricing causes station {{parking lots}} to overflow in the morning. <b>Pervasive</b> congestion and under-pricing forces some {{to drive to}} distant stations in search of parking.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pervasive</b> {{exercise}} of Roman law throughout Western Europe {{led to its}} enormous influence on the Western legal tradition, reflected by the continued use of Latin legal terminology in modern law.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the market}} for fax {{software}} would shrink significantly {{as the use of}} email became more <b>pervasive,</b> WinFax brought in significant revenue for Symantec; a year after the merger sales of fax software accounted for 10% of Symantec's revenues.|$|E
5|$|Although {{archaeology}} {{shows that}} the myth reflects an actual custom, the placement of coins with the dead was neither <b>pervasive</b> nor confined to a single coin in the deceased's mouth. In many burials, inscribed metal-leaf tablets or Exonumia {{take the place of}} the coin, or gold-foil crosses during the early Christian period. The presence of coins or a coin-hoard in Germanic ship-burials suggests an analogous concept.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{dominant}} use of iron is in metallurgy, iron compounds are also <b>pervasive</b> in industry. Iron catalysts are traditionally {{used in the}} Haber-Bosch process {{for the production of}} ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch process for conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants. Powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the Bechamp reduction the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline.|$|E
5|$|Casablanca {{went on to}} {{win three}} Academy Awards – Best Picture, Director (Curtiz) and Adapted Screenplay (the Epsteins and Koch) – and {{gradually}} its reputation grew. Its lead characters, memorable lines, and <b>pervasive</b> theme song have all become iconic and the film consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films in history.|$|E
5|$|During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was {{a hotbed}} of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption. Several factors fed into {{resistance}} to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and <b>pervasive</b> corruption. The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained <b>pervasive,</b> {{as evidenced by the}} Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the Sudan. The move was intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E
5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were <b>pervasive,</b> specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{interviews}} Michelle Wilkes (Jennifer Clement), Betts's former partner, who recollects {{his ability}} to detect cancer. When an interior slice of Betts's polymerized head is examined, the agents discover that his frontal lobe displayed signs of <b>pervasive</b> cancer. Mulder has Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) subject the slice to a Kirlian photography test; the final image shows corona discharge that takes the appearance of human shoulders.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{is one of}} the Ojibwe dialects {{that has}} {{undergone}} the most language change, although it shares many features with other dialects. The most distinctive change is a <b>pervasive</b> pattern of vowel syncope that deletes short vowels in many words, resulting in significant changes in their pronunciation. This and other innovations in pronunciation, in addition to changes in word structure and vocabulary, differentiate Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so <b>pervasive</b> because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry is <b>pervasive</b> {{in living}} things. Animals mainly have {{bilateral}} or mirror symmetry, {{as do the}} leaves of plants and some flowers such as orchids. Plants often have radial or rotational symmetry, as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry {{is found in the}} echinoderms, the group that includes starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or <b>pervasive</b> developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and <b>pervasive</b> developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been {{described}} as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more <b>pervasive</b> form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would inherit the position of being the paramount power.|$|E
5|$|Two {{provisions}} require certain jurisdictions {{to provide}} election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) and Section 203(c). A jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials {{related to an}} election—such as voter registration materials, ballots, notices, and instructions—in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction. Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. Congress enacted the provisions to break down language barriers and combat <b>pervasive</b> language discrimination against the protected groups.|$|E
5|$|While most LARPs {{maintain}} {{a clear distinction}} between the real world and the fictional setting, <b>pervasive</b> LARPs mingle fiction with modern reality in a fashion similar to alternate reality games. Bystanders who are unaware that a game is taking place may be treated as part of the fictional setting, and in-character materials may be incorporated into the real world.|$|E
5|$|After the Norse occupation, the {{toponymy}} of Orkney {{became almost}} wholly West Norse. The Norse language changed {{into the local}} Norn, which lingered {{until the end of}} the 18th century, when it finally died out. Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots. This dialect is at a low ebb due to the <b>pervasive</b> influences of television, education, and the large number of incomers. However, attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing-song accent and many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use. The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie, meaning small, which may be derived from the French petit.|$|E
5|$|Ain't {{is found}} {{throughout}} the English-speaking world across regions and classes, and {{is among the most}} <b>pervasive</b> nonstandard terms in English. It is one of two negation features (the other being the double negative) that are known to appear in all nonstandard English dialects. Ain't is used throughout the United Kingdom, with its geographical distribution increasing over time. It is also {{found throughout the}} United States, including in Appalachia, the South, New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Upper Midwest. In its geographical ubiquity, ain't is to be contrasted with other folk usages such as y'all, which is confined to the South region of the United States.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>pervasive</b> {{developmental}} disorder, Asperger {{syndrome is}} distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society {{as quickly as possible}} in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become <b>pervasive</b> in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E
5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of <b>pervasive</b> developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Ledonne {{discovered}} {{a program called}} RPG Maker, which allows a developer to add images, text, story and objectives to design a game; RPG Maker creates the necessary programming automatically. Ledonne had always conceptualized video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge; with RPG Maker {{he was able to}} fulfill his ambition. Ledonne decided to make a game that would explore why the Columbine shootings occurred, as well as refuting <b>pervasive</b> myths about the shooters and the alleged role video games played in the massacre.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more <b>pervasive</b> in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are <b>pervasive</b> and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} <b>pervasive</b> {{influence}} on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and what he saw as a <b>pervasive</b> militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to be among the most pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Komnenoi of the Empire of Trebizond were {{famed for}} marrying their daughters to their {{neighbours}} as acts of diplomacy. Theodora Megale Komnene, daughter of John IV, {{was married to}} Uzun Hassan, lord of the Aq Qoyunlu, to seal an alliance between the Empire and the so-called White Sheep. Although the alliance failed to save Trebizond from its eventual defeat, and despite being a devout Christian in a Muslim state, Theodora did manage to exercise a <b>pervasive</b> influence both in the domestic and foreign actions of her husband.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and <b>pervasive</b> developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as of 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves is <b>pervasive</b> in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E
5|$|The liberal {{views of}} Wang Yangming were {{opposed by the}} Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of {{orthodox}} Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into <b>pervasive</b> factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pervasive</b> and ecologically devastating human {{encroachment}} {{of recent}} decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response {{the system of}} national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves, four of which {{are part of the}} World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a <b>pervasive</b> personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive individual, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the working class, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an authoritarian regime responsible for political repression and mass killings.|$|E
