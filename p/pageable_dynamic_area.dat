40|$|Today, {{capturing}} {{the behavior of}} a human eye is considered a standard method for measuring the information-gathering process and thereby gaining insights into cognitive processes. Due to the dynamic character of most task environments there is still a lack of a structured and automated approach for analyzing eye movement in combination with moving objects. In this article, we present a guideline for advanced gaze analysis, called IGDAI (Integration Guideline for <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Areas</b> of Interest). The application of IGDAI allows gathering <b>dynamic</b> <b>areas</b> of interest and simplifies its combination with eye movement. The first step of IGDAI defines the basic requirements for the experimental setup including the embedding of an eye tracker. The second step covers the issue of storing the information of task environments for the dynamic AOI analysis. Implementation examples in XML are presented fulfilling the requirements for most dynamic task environments. The last step includes algorithms to combine the captured eye movement and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>areas</b> of interest. A verification study was conducted, presenting an air traffic controller environment to participants. The participants had to distinguish between different types of dynamic objects. The results show that in comparison to static areas of interest, IGDAI allows a faster and more detailed view on the distribution of eye movement...|$|R

30|$|The average total {{fixation}} {{time was}} calculated {{during the most}} {{crucial part of the}} video clips (2  s), that is, from the onset of the possible infringement (1  s pre-contact) {{until the end of the}} interaction between the players on which the decision is based (1  s post-contact). Average total fixation time refers to the amount of time referees spent fixating various areas of interest within the display prior to making a decision. For the open play situations, a distinction was made between the attacking and defending player. For both players a contact zone (i.e., the body part which was involved in the possible infringement), and a non-contact zone (i.e., the body part which was not involved in the possible infringement) were defined, resulting in a total of four <b>dynamic</b> <b>areas</b> of interest (100 [*]×[*] 150  pixels) (Fig.  1). The contact zones of the attacker and defender partly overlap during the time period surrounding the moment of contact. A fixation could thus be counted in two areas of interest and the average total fixation times could sum to more than 2  s. For the corner kick situations, two <b>dynamic</b> <b>areas</b> of interest (300 [*]×[*] 300  pixels) were used: a contact zone (i.e., the area of the display which contained at least the two players who interacted for the possible infringement); and a non-contact zone (i.e., the area of the display which contained at least two players who were not involved during the possible infringement) (Fig.  2). The size of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>areas</b> of interest was kept constant within and across video clips.|$|R
