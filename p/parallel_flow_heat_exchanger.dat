It guarantees a good reliability and low maintenance cost as it does not involve any mechanical pump. Therefore, it can be used in many industrial applications such as refrigeration and air conditioning, electronic cooling, nuclear reactors, geothermal heat extraction, etc. But flow instabilities and loop configuration are the major problems in this system. Several previous researchers studied that stabilities can be suppressed by using nanofluids as loop fluid.

These streams will contain entrained solvent. A {{significant portion of the}} Strip Effluent (SE) pipeline (i. e., acid stream containing Isopar{reg_sign} L residues) length is within one inch of a sludge stream. Personnel envisioned the sludge stream temperature may reach 100 C during operation. The nearby SE stream may receive heat from the sludge stream and reach temperatures that may lead to flammability issues once the contents of the SE stream discharge into a larger reservoir. To this end, personnel used correlations from the literature to estimate the maximum temperature rise the SE stream may experience if the nearby sludge stream reaches boiling temperature. Several calculation methods were used to determine the temperature rise of the SE stream. One method considered a heat balance equation under steady state that employed correlation functions to estimate heat transfer rate. This method showed the maximum temperature of the acid stream (SE) may exceed 45 C when the nearby sludge stream is 80 C or higher.

Typically a zero gravity vent concept, termed a thermodynamic vent system (TVS), consists of a tank mixer to destratify the propellant, combined with a Joule-Thomson (J-T) valve to extract thermal energy from the propellant. Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) {{was used to test}} both spray-bar and axial jet TVS concepts.

Typically a zero gravity vent concept, termed a thermodynamic vent system (TVS), consists of a tank mixer to destratify the propellant, combined with a Joule- Thomson (J-T) valve to extract then-nal energy from the propellant. In a cooperative effort, Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (N 4 HTB) {{was used to test}} a unique "spray bar" TVS system developed by Boeing. A schematic of this system is included in Figure 1. The system consists of a recirculation pump, a <b>parallel</b> <b>flow</b> concentric tube, <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> and a spray bar positioned close to the longitudinal axis of the tank. In the mixing mode, the recirculation pump withdraws liquid from the tank and sprays it radially into the tank liquid, ullage, and exposed tank surfaces. When energy extraction is required, {{a small portion of the}} recirculated liquid is passed sequentially through the J-T expansion valve, the spray bar <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> element, and is vented overboard. The vented vapor cools the circulated bulk fluid, thereby removing thermal energy and reducing tank pressure. Figure 2 is a plot of ullage pressure (P 4) and liquid vapor pressure (PSAI) versus time. The pump operates alone, cycling on and off, to destratify the tank liquid and ullage until the liquid vapor pressure reaches the lower set point. At that point, the J-T valve begins to cycle on and off with the pump. Thus, for short duration missions, only the mixer may operate, thus minimizing or even eliminating boil-off losses. The primary advantage of the spray bar configuration is that pressure reduction is achieved independent of liquid and vapor location, thereby enhancing the applicability of normal gravity test data to zero gravity conditions. The in-tank components are minimized with the proposed TVS design. Because the recirculation pump is external to the tank, no electrical power penetration of the tank is required for pump or valve operation. This is especially desirable for L 02 tanks since the presence of an electrical ignition source in oxygen represents a critical failure mode. Also, since the critical components (pump, motor, valve, orifice) are external to the tank, system checkout and ground servicing/replacement are easier. For zero-g operation, component replacement external to the tank may be a significant benefit. In addition to satisfying the zero g TVS design objectives, the TVS concept tested offers additional benefits to the integrated subcritical cryogenic storage and launch system...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of two specific three fluid, cross <b>flow,</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> configurations have been determined; and then evaluated comparatively with other conceivable arrangements previously analyzed. Results {{have been presented}} {{in terms of the}} temperature effectiveness of two of the fluid streams as a function of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> size for sets of fixed operating conditions. These results are presented over a wide range of operating parameters for a single pass configuration, but only for selected two pass conditions. Where possible, general conclusions as to {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the configurations analyzed in this effort compared to those previously evaluated are presented. This comparative evaluation was conducted over the entire range of operating parameters analyzed for the single pass, three fluid, cross <b>flow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cross <b>flow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> {{when applied}} to cool data center rooms, use {{external}} air (process air) to cool the air stream coming from the data center room (primary air). However, an air–air <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> {{is not enough to}} cope with extreme high heat loads in critical conditions (high external temperature). Therefore, water can be sprayed in the process air to increase the heat dissipation capability (wet mode). Water evaporates, and the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> rate is transferred to the process air as sensible and latent heat. This paper proposes an analytical approach to predict the behavior of a cross <b>flow</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in wet mode. The theoretical results are then compared to experimental tests carried out on a real machine in wet mode conditions. Comparisons are given in terms of calculated versus experimental <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> rate and evaporated water mass flow rate, showing a good match between theoretical and experimental values...|$|R
