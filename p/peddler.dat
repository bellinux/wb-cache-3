5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato <b>peddler</b> and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from original sin, and may even be the Second Coming of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E

During the Great Depression, Specter's father was a fruit <b>peddler,</b> a tailor, and a junkyard owner. After graduating from Russell High School, Arlen Specter studied first at the University of Oklahoma. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, majored in international relations, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1951. While at Penn, Specter {{was a member of}} the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. Specter said the family moved to Philadelphia when his sister Shirley was of a marriageable age because there were no other Jews in Russell.|$|E

5|$|In September 1919, Quisling {{departed}} Norway {{to become}} an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in Helsinki, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time {{at the request of}} explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov to help with the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a <b>peddler.</b> Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never any question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{are called}} to {{investigate}} {{the shooting death of}} Charles Courtland Cox, a small-time drug <b>peddler</b> shot in the back shortly after a police raid of a crackhouse. When Pembleton suspects a police shooting, Lt. Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) explains Officer Hellriegel (Jeffrey Mandon) accidentally shot Cox after falling down and discharging his weapon. However, Hellriegel does not recall details and appears nervous by questioning from Pembleton. Gee is angry with Pembleton's inquiries into the police, and becomes even angrier when Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) and Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) say they will make Hellriegel a scapegoat if the media start suggesting racism or police brutality. Hellriegel is cleared when tests reveal the bullet does not match his gun, but Pembleton requests the firearms of the other officers be tested. Gee refuses to approve the tests, but Pembleton gets Barnfather to order them.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continues}} his {{investigation into the}} shooting death of small-time drug <b>peddler</b> Charles Courtland Cox, who he suspects was killed by police during a botched crackhouse raid. As the involved police officers turn over their guns for testing, the press reports heavily on the story, which results in pressure from the department heads to solve the case. Pembleton aggressively questions several officers, but none are cooperative. Gee (Yaphet Kotto) is angry with Pembleton's focus on the police and demands civilian suspects be pursued. Howard (Melissa Leo) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) canvas the neighborhood of the shooting and find most residents do not trust the police, who they feel are {{responsible for the death of}} one of their own. However, one woman named Dale (June Thorne) tells Bayliss her grandson, Lane Staley (Isaiah Washington) witnessed the shooting. Staley is brought in to the station for questioning and, while Pembleton plans to question him as an eyewitness, Gee demands he be treated as a suspect.|$|E

The series 'The Heart of All Things' appeared in the magazine between November 1904 and May 1905, before being published together in her first book 'The Soul Market'.

25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage.

25|$|Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848 as the {{beginning}} of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, reported that they had made contact with the spirit of a murdered <b>peddler.</b> What made this an extraordinary event was that the spirit communicated through audible rapping noises, rather than simply appearing to a person in a trance. The evidence of the senses appealed to practical Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. Demonstrations of mediumship (seances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable business, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Foxes earned a living this way, as did many others.|$|E
25|$|Samuel C. Williams {{believed}} that Gist fathered Sequoyah around 1775 {{by his mother}} Wurteh Watts. She {{was the daughter of}} John Watts and Wurteh Giyosikoyohe, and sister of Doublehead. Of a prominent clan, she was also related to Old Tassel. Williams dismissed the story that Sequoyah's father was an itinerant German <b>peddler</b> by the name of Guess. He noted that Sequoyah went by George Guess, Guest, and Gist, and that he finished the Cherokee alphabet in 1821 when he was about 40. This was much too young for a man born in 1761. Williams noted that a letter showed that in 1828, Sequoyah visited Gist relatives in Kentucky and was acknowledged as a family member.|$|E
25|$|Zeng entered {{politics}} in 1991, {{when he became}} a Workers' Party member; thereafter he renounced his affiliation to the group and has since become a perennial candidate in Singaporean elections, albeit often dropping out of contention at the last minute. Zeng was also an active acupuncturist who arranged for global meetings and operated an acupuncture centre in Singapore, later changing his focus to selling healthcare products after a string of molestation lawsuits initiated by his patients. Zeng was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014; this necessitated the excision of his entire nose, which led to significant facial disfigurement, and he became a tissue paper <b>peddler,</b> abandoning his previous jobs. Aspects of Zeng's life, including his court cases and unorthodox behaviour, have generated controversy and criticism.|$|E
