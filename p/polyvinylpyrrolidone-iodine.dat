40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Superficial {{infection}} at {{wire and}} pin insertions {{in the skin}} is a frequent disorder among patients utilizing the Ilizarov method. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of daily topical application of 10 % <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> solution against infections of the holes for Kirschner wires and Schanz pins among patients using Ilizarov external fixators, in comparison with cleaning these holes only with 0. 9 % sterile physiological saline solution. DESIGN AND SETTING: Controlled randomized clinical trial, in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Outpatient Clinic, Hospital São Paulo, and Orthopedics and Traumatology Center of Jundiaí. METHODS: 30 patients were treated using the Ilizarov technique: 15 were instructed to apply 0. 9 % physiological saline dressing on the wire and pin insertions and 15 to apply 0. 9 % physiological saline plus 10 % <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine.</b> Patients were evaluated at outpatient return visits for identification of signs and symptoms of superficial infection at wire and pin insertion sites. Samples were collected from cases of purulent exudate secretion, for culturing and clinical tests. RESULTS: The chi-squared and Fischer exact tests were applied, but no statistically significant association between the intervention of topical <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> solution and the prevention of infections at wire and pin insertions could be found. CONCLUSIONS: Topical 10 % <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> solution applied daily to Kirschner wire and Schanz pin insertions did not reduce the incidence of superficial infection at these holes, in comparison with mechanical removal of dirt using 0. 9 % physiological saline solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of seven disinfectant compounds used in dentistry for a rapid decontamination of 32 gutta-percha cones adhered with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli strains or Bacillus subtilis spores was compared. Cones {{were treated with}} 2 % glutaraldehyde, 1 % sodium hypochlorite, 70 % ethyl alcohol, 1 % and 0. 3 % iodine alcohol, 2 % chlorhexidine, 6 % hydrogen peroxide, and 10 % <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine,</b> for 1, 5, 10, and 15 minutes. After treatment, each cone was transferred to thioglycollate broth and incubated at 37 ºC for 7 days. The products were bactericidal after 1 to 5 minutes and, with exception of ethyl alcohol and iodine-alcohol, sporicidal after 1 to 15 minutes of exposure. Results suggest that chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite, <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine,</b> hydrogen peroxide, and glutaraldehyde were the most effective products in the decontamination of gutta-percha cones...|$|E
40|$|Com o presente trabalho, objetivou-se comparar o efeito bactericida do polivinilpirrolidona-iodo nas concentrações a 0, 1 % e 0, 5 % sobre a antissepsia do campo operatório oftálmico de cães. Foram utilizados 20 cães e soluções em concentrações diferentes para cada olho. No olho direito, utilizou-se solução de polivinilpirrolidona-iodo a 0, 1 % e no olho esquerdo a 0, 5 %. A colheita da amostra conjuntival de ambos os grupos foi realizada antes da antissepsia (0), após 30 minutos (1), 1, 5 horas (2) e 2, 5 horas (3) da irrigação e limpeza. Foi identificado crescimento bacteriano em 70 % das amostras oculares colhidas antes da antissepsia. Os agentes bacterianos encontrados nos diferentes tempos de colheita foram Staphylococcus intermedis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus sp., Difteróide, Enterobacter sp., Micrococcus sp. A solução de polivinilpirrolidona-iodo a 0, 1 % diminuiu em 64 % e 50 % o crescimento de bactérias após 30 min (1) e 90 min da antissepsia (2), respectivamente. Enquanto a concentração 0, 5 % reduziu em 86 %, houve crescimento bacteriano de 71 %, o que indicou um maior poder inibitório sobre o crescimento bacteriano. Dessa maneira, a solução de polivinilpirrolidona-iodo a 0, 5 %, em relação à solução a 0, 1 %, mostrou-se mais eficaz na redução da {{microbiota}} conjuntival até 90 min após a antissepsia. The {{objective of}} this study was to compare the bactericide effect of <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> at concentrations of 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % on antisepsis of dog ophthalmic region. Solutions with different concentrations were used on each eye of twenty dogs. On the right eye, the 0. 1 % solution was administered and, on the left eye, the 0. 5 % solution. Conjunctival sampling of both groups was performed before antisepsis (0), after 30 minutes (1), 1. 5 h (2) and 2. 5 h (3) of irrigation and cleaning. Bacterial growth was identified in 70 % of ocular sample collected before the antisepsis. The bacterial agents found on different times of sampling were Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus sp. Diphtheroids, Enterobacter sp., Micrococcus sp. The 0. 1 % solution of <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> decreased by 64 % and 50 % bacteria growth after 1 and 2, respectively. The group that used the concentration of <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> 0. 5 % showed greater bactericide power. Therefore, the solution of <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> to 0. 5 % compared to 0. 1 % solution was more effective in reduction of the conjunctival microbiota up to 90 min after antisepsis...|$|E

30|$|Various {{cleaning}} solutions {{have been}} advocated in the literature, including soap and water, sterile water, normal saline, peroxide, <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine,</b> isopropyl alcohol, polyhexamethylene biguanide and chorhexidine aqueous or alcoholic solutions [14, 17, 18, 38, 39, 40, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75]. It {{should be remembered}} that prolonged skin contact with strong antiseptic solutions may lead to dry skin, skin irritation or even a hypersensitive reaction [18]. Fortunately, such adverse effects can usually be resolved by substituting a strong antiseptic solution with a mild antiseptic soap and water. Once pin sites have healed and are clean, patients are allowed to shower, provided that the limb and its external fixator are carefully tested thereafter [18]. In accordance with the recommendations of most authors, we do not advise swimming, but swimming in a chlorinated pool may be permitted in specific cases if beneficial to bone healing.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT). MethodsThe antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. After unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30 seconds. Saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120 min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. ResultsOCT had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0. 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and 7. 5 % <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone–iodine</b> complex (PVP–I) from 15 min to 120 min following the application (p< 0. 01). The antiseptic efficacy of 0. 2 % CHX on total bacteria and Lactobacillus species was {{very similar to the}} efficacy observed with 7. 5 % PVP–I mouth solution from 15 min up to 120 min. Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0. 15 mg/ml PVP–I, 0. 5 mg/ml CHX, and 0. 1 mg/ml OCT concentrations, while Streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0. 15 mg/ml PVP–I, 2 mg/ml CHX, and 0. 8 mg/ml OCT concentrations. Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0. 00313 mg/ml OCT, 30 mg/ml PVP–I, and 0. 0063 mg/ml CHX concentrations. ConclusionsOCT compared favorably with CHX and PVP–I in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p< 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Incorporation of {{antibacterial}} agents into {{polymeric membrane}} is one the widely studied surface modification. Polyethersulfone (PES) membrane incorporated with <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> (PVP-I) were prepared using phase inversion and UV induced photo-grafting techniques. The modified PES-PVP-I membranes were characterized {{in term of}} gravimetric analysis, FT-IR analysis, FESEM analysis, water flux, contact angle, porosity measurement and antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). The high water flux indicated by PES- 4 and PES- 7 show an improvement {{by the addition of}} PVP-I by 52 % to 62 % higher compared to original PES membrane. For the UV method, the water flux decline with the increasing of irradiation time by 31 to 35 % compared to the commercial original PES membrane. PES-PVP-I membranes with 10 wt% of iodine concentration developed by phase inversion and UV photo-grafting show strong antibacterial properties using halo zone test. The highest inhibition zone of PES-PVP-I membranes produced using UV photo-grafting and phase inversions against E. coli were 2. 30 cm 2 and 1. 88 cm 2 and against B. subtilis were 0. 41 cm 2 and 0. 48 cm 2. The results indicated that both methods used were favorable towards antibacterial properties with high inhibition zone and {{as well as in the}} improvement in water flux, contact angle and porosity of PES-PVP-I membranes compared to the original PES. This study shows that PES-PVP-I membrane suitable to be used in wide variety of antibacterial applications...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> (PVP-iodine or povidone- iodine) {{enhances the}} {{treatment}} outcomes of initial periodontal treatment but {{the degree of}} benefit varies in the literature. A main reason might be the concentration of the dosage form and its contact time with the periodontal tissues. In this randomized pilot study the effect of repeated subgingival application of PVP-iodine during scaling and root planing (SRP) was assessed. Changes of clinical parameters and microbiotic taxa after 3 months were analyzed. METHOD AND MATERIALS: In a split-mouth design 12 patients with generalized, severe periodontitis were treated with SRP combined with subgingival application of either PVP-iodine or water. Test and control sides were isolated with a special rubber dam technique. Irrigations were reapplied during SRP. Periodontal probing depth (PD) and recessions were documented before treatment and after 3 months. Samples of subgingival bacteria before SRP and after 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months were analyzed. RESULTS: Three months after SRP, changes for PD and recession in deep pockets were significantly higher in the PVP-iodine group (P =. 012 and. 044 respectively). The number of these pockets was reduced from 73 at baseline to 8 in the test and 19 in the control group. In both groups, bacterial taxa were reduced after 1 week. One month after SRP only taxa of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the PVP-iodine group were lower than at baseline. After 3 months, all taxa regained baseline values. CONCLUSION: PVP-iodine reapplied frequently during SRP might enhance pocket depth reduction in initially deep pockets...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polyvinylpyrrolidone–iodine</b> (Povidone-iodine, PVP-I) {{is widely}} used as an {{antiseptic}} agent for lavation during joint surgery; however, the biological effects of PVP–I on cells from joint tissue are unknown. This study examined the biocompatibility and biological effects of PVP–I on cells from joint tissue, {{with the aim of}} optimizing cell-scaffold based joint repair. Cells from joint tissue, including cartilage derived progenitor cells (CPC), subchondral bone derived osteoblast and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) were isolated. The concentration-dependent effects of PVP–I on cell proliferation, migration and differentiation were evaluated. Additionally, the efficacy and mechanism of a PVP–I loaded bilayer collagen scaffold for osteochondral defect repair was investigated in a rabbit model. A micromolar concentration of PVP–I was found not to affect cell proliferation, CPC migration or extracellular matrix production. Interestingly, micromolar concentrations of PVP–I promote osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSC, as evidenced by up-regulation of RUNX 2 and Osteocalcin gene expression, as well as increased mineralization on the three-dimensional scaffold. PVP–I treatment of collagen scaffolds significantly increased fibronectin binding onto the scaffold surface and collagen type I protein synthesis of cultured BM-MSC. Implantation of PVP–I treated collagen scaffolds into rabbit osteochondral defect significantly enhanced subchondral bone regeneration at 6 weeks post-surgery compared with the scaffold alone (subchondral bone histological score of 8. 80 ± 1. 64 vs. 3. 8 ± 2. 19, p < 0. 05). The biocompatibility and pro-osteogenic activity of PVP–I on the cells from joint tissue and the enhanced subchondral bone formation in PVP–I treated scaffolds would thus indicate the potential of PVP–I for osteochondral defect repair...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Foram coletados dados pré-, trans- e pós-operatórios. O grupo A (n = 44) incluiu pacientes submetidos ao tratamento conservador-desbridamento associado a ressutura e/ou a irrigação contínua com solução de polivinilpirrolidona-iodo, ou ainda a cicatrização por segunda intenção (dados retrospectivos). O grupo B (n = 9) incluiu pacientes nos quais não houve resolução da infecção com o tratamento conservador e que, por isso, foram submetidos ao tratamento agressivo (fase intermediária). O grupo C (n = 28) incluiu pacientes submetidos primariamente ao tratamento agressivo (dados prospectivos). RESULTADOS: Identificou-se menor tempo de internação pós-operatória nos pacientes submetidos ao tratamento agressivo (p OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate the}} impact of an aggressive treatment approach using muscle flaps or omentopexy in infections of the sternum and anterior mediastinum following sternotomy on mortality, as {{compared to that of}} a conservative treatment approach. METHODS: Data were collected prior to, during and after the surgical procedures. Group A (n = 44) included patients submitted to conservative treatment-debridement together with resuture or continuous irrigation with <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine</b> solutions, or even with second-intention wound healing (retrospective data). Group B (n = 9) included patients in whom infection was not resolved with conservative treatment, and who therefore underwent aggressive treatment (intermediate phase). Group C (n = 28) included patients primarily submitted to aggressive treatment (prospective data). RESULTS: Postoperative hospital stays were shorter in the patients submitted to aggressive treatment (p < 0. 046). There were 7 deaths in group A, 1 in group B, and 2 in group C. However, the classical level of significance of &# 945; = 0. 05 was not reached. CONCLUSION: Aggressive treatment also proved to be effective when the infection was not resolved with conservative treatment. These findings demonstrate that the proposed treatment provides excellent results...|$|E
