Jelliffe felt that the pos-ture, the rigidity, and the initiation difficulties of the <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>patient</b> mirror the warp-ing restraint of intense unconscious hostility. On the basis of psychological tests, Shaskan, Yarnell, and Alper described the <b>parkinsonian</b> <b>patient</b> as a psychologically blanched, uncon-flicted personality who freely uses the arrest-ing symptoms of his illness to justify actual-ization of intense dependency needs. Booth thinks of this patient as an ambitious, domi-nant, and independent individual whose in-tense inner urge to goal-directed activity is in conflict with an equally intense morality and social conformism, and with a fear of failure.

Pressure values declined following treatment, the decline of pressure on strain-ing ending by week 12.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether <b>Parkinsonian</b> <b>patients</b> could modify {{the speed of}} a sit-to-stand (STS) task to the same extent as that of healthy subjects. Methods: Twenty <b>Parkinsonian</b> <b>patients</b> and 20 control subjects were instructed to stand up at a natural and fast speed. Kinematic data and kinetic data were recorded. Results: <b>Parkinsonian</b> <b>patients</b> were significantly slower than healthy individuals during STS at a natural speed. When required to perform STS task at a fast speed, these patients could increase both peak horizontal and vertical velocities of the task, by significantly increasing hip and ankle dorsiflexion torques and the rate of torque production, just as the control subjects did. In fact, no difference was found for the percentage changes in both peak velocities and movement time between the two groups, though similar between-group differences during STS at a natural speed still existed at a fast speed. Conclusions: <b>Parkinsonian</b> <b>patients</b> had problems in generating adequate lower limb joint torques and in the rate of torque production when performing STS at a natural speed. However, these patients were capable of increasing the speed of their STS with the same percentage changes as those of healthy subjects.

40|$|Evidence {{exists that}} action {{observation}} activates the same cortical motor {{areas that are}} involved in the performance of the observed actions. An untested idea is whether subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia {{play a role in the}} coding of other people's actions. This study used kinematics to examine how Parkinson's disease patients react to the observation of an action which they were subsequently requested to perform. In each trial a model and an observer, which could be either a <b>Parkinsonian</b> <b>patient</b> or a neurologically healthy participant, were seated facing each other. The model was requested to grasp a stimulus (action condition), to perform a kicking action towards the stimulus (control-action condition), and to not perform any action (control condition). The task for the observer was always to grasp the stimulus after having watched the model performing her task. Results show that Parkinson's disease patients did show facilitation effects only when the model was a <b>Parkinsonian</b> <b>patient.</b> Whereas, neurologically healthy participants’ movements were facilitated following the observation of either the Parkinsonian and the healthy model grasping the object. No facilitation effects were found for both the control and the control-action conditions. The fact that normal visuomotor priming takes place in PD patients when the observed action matches with what they can perform suggests that basal ganglia might not be necessary for it. However, damage to the basal ganglia might become relevant when such a match does not occur. In such circumstances, a damage to these structures might prevent the deployment of additional activity which might be necessary to influence cortical functions related to the representations of observed actions...|$|E

40|$|Various time-frequency {{methods have}} been used to study {{time-varying}} properties of non-stationary neurophysiological signals. In the present study, a time-frequency coherence estimate using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) together with its confidence intervals are proposed to evaluate the correlation between two non-stationary processes. The approach is based on averaging over repeat trials. A systematic comparison between approaches using CWT and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is carried out. Simulated data are generated to test the performance of these methods when estimating time-frequency based coherence. In contrast to some recent studies, we find that CWT based coherence estimates do not supersede STFT based estimates. We suggest that a combination of STFT and CWT would be most suitable for analysing non-stationary neural data. Tests are presented to investigate the time and frequency discrimination capabilities of the two approaches. The methods are applied to two experimental data sets: electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyogram (EMG) during wrist movements in a healthy subject, and local field potential (LFP) and surface EMG recordings during resting tremor in a <b>Parkinsonian</b> <b>patient.</b> Supporting software is available at [URL] and [URL] (c) 2006 Elsevier B.

The identity of the fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Quantitative analysis demonstrated a beta-NGF mRNA concentration exceeding 5 fg/micrograms of total adrenal RNA.

40|$|In a {{coincidence}} timing task, Parkinsonian patients and {{a control group}} were instructed to synchronise a keypress {{with the onset of}} a visual signal which had been preceded by a regular train of warning signals. Although the Parkinsonian group had previously exhibited slower reactions in a conventional simple reaction-time task, they were able to generate predictive responses that fell as close to the target onset as the controls' but showed greater variability. In a second experiment, Parkinsonian patients and controls made saccadic eye movements to a visual target that stepped at regular intervals between two fixed locations. After a few trials all the subjects tended to make predictive saccades that were initiated before the target excursion. However, the Parkinsonian group were slower to develop this strategy and when they did their saccades became considerably more hypometric than those of the controls. Both groups were able to maintain predictive responding even when the visual target disappeared and responses were paced by a buzzer.

One hundred sixteen consecutive outpatients with Parkinson's disease (77 men, 39 women; mean age +/- SD = 62. 5 +/- 9. 9) and {{the same number of}} spouses and neurological controls were interviewed about five environmental risk factors (cigarette smoking, well-water drinking, head trauma with loss of consciousness, strict diets, general anesthesia) and two genetic risk factors (family history of Parkinson's disease or of essential tremor).

Outcome measures were the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Sections II, III, and IV (UPDRS II, III, IV) and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). At the end of the IRT, levodopa dosage was significantly reduced (P= 0. 0035), passing from 1016 ± 327 to 777 ± 333 [*]mg/day. All outcome variables improved significantly (P< 0. 0005 all) by the end of IRT. At followup, all variables still maintained better values with respect to admission (P< 0. 02 all).
