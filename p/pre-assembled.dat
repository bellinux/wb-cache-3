The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a <b>pre-assembled</b> cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or <b>pre-assembled.</b> In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on {{to play a major role}} in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 was {{launched}} on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) – a <b>pre-assembled</b> machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble himself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex {{had not been}} an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis {{at the beginning of}} the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business.|$|E

5|$|This tactic proved highly successful, with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it {{had sold}} 250,000 ZX81s worldwide. 50,000 {{computers}} were sold each month, 60% outside the UK, despite Sinclair and W. H. Smith being the only distributors. When sales fell {{in the wake of}} the launch of its successor, the ZX Spectrum, Sinclair reduced the price of the <b>pre-assembled</b> version to £49.95 in May 1982. It was cut by another £10 the following April. Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers, the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30,000 units a month even as late as July 1983, more than two years after it had been launched. By that time, according to Sinclair Research, over 1.5 million ZX81s had been sold.|$|E

40|$|The Mason-Pfizer {{monkey virus}} (M-PMV) is the {{prototype}} of the type D retroviruses. In type B and D retroviruses, the Gag protein <b>pre-assembles</b> before association with the membrane, whereas in type C retroviruses (lentiviruses, BLV/HTLV group) Gag is targeted efficiently to the plasma membrane, where the particle formation occurs.

We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the M-PMV MA by heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance. The protein contains four alpha-helices that are structurally similar to the known type C MA structures.

40|$|Potential {{pathways}} {{that could}} account for observed rapid rates of transcription reinitiation were explored. A nuclear extract system was established in which reinitiation rates were observed to be kinetically facilitated and in which the rate was sensitive to TATA box mutation. Kinetic facilitation of functional complex formation could be mimicked by <b>pre-assembling</b> activator and certain general transcription factors on the promoter and then adding nuclear extract. The minimal activated complex with this characteristic contained general factors TFIID and TFIIA. The ability of the TFIID:TFIIA complex to complete assembly rapidly was reduced by the same TATA box mutation that reduced reinitiation rate. Band shift experiments also showed that this same mutation lowered {{the stability of the}} TBP:TFIIA complex on the DNA. The results suggest that TATA-dependent variations in retention of the TFIID:TFIIA complex after release of the polymerase could be a primary determinant of reinitiation rate, allowing diversity in promoter strength to be related to diversity in TATA element sequences...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} offers unparalleled {{precision and}} programmability for the bottom-up organization of materials. This approach relies on <b>pre-assembling</b> a DNA scaffold, typically containing hundreds of different strands, {{and using it}} to position functional components. A particularly attractive strategy is to employ DNA nanostructures not as permanent scaffolds, but as transient, reusable templates to transfer essential information to other materials. To our knowledge, this approach, akin to top-down lithography, has not been examined. Here we report a molecular printing strategy that chemically transfers a discrete pattern of DNA strands from a three-dimensional DNA structure to a gold nanoparticle. We show that the particles inherit the DNA sequence configuration encoded in the parent template with high fidelity. This provides control over the number of DNA strands and their relative placement, directionality and sequence asymmetry. Importantly, the nanoparticles produced exhibit the site-specific addressability of DNA nanostructures, and are promising components for energy, information and biomedical applications...|$|R

25|$|Though simply cast, promotional {{models were}} exquisitely {{detailed}} and proportioned, and by 1960, AMT became the main supplier of the <b>pre-assembled</b> model to American car companies. AMT worked most closely with Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation, but promo contracts among the model manufacturers seemed to alternate {{year to year}} (See Doty 2009a for a nice history of AMT's Ford Galaxie). Shapes of the vehicles were near perfect, though in the 1950s, cellulose acetate, the plastic of choice, was prone to serious warping. In 1960, AMT and some other manufacturers switched to styrene (the brand name being Cycolac) and by 1964, {{all of the major}} model car manufacturers had changed over to the new plastic. This solved the problem and styrene models 50 years later still maintain their form. 1961 was a key year for the switchover.

These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did something new in releasing <b>pre-assembled</b> and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer.

Well-defined block copolymers of maleic anhydride (MAn) and styrene [poly(styrene-alt-MAn) -b-polystyrene (P(S-alt-MAn) -b-PS) ] were prepared via a one-pot cascade approach by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a novel two phases rational scenario applied in constructing an offshore monopod platform; in which the two phases are the all-ground horizontal construction phase and the post-construction phase. Concerning the all-ground construction phase, a brief investigation of its different stages, i. e., pre-fabrication, fabrication, <b>pre-assembling,</b> positioning, assembling, and surface finishing is introduced. The important practical aspects of such construction phase are investigated without going into the nitty-gritty of the details involved therein. Concerning the post-construction phase, a clear investigation of its sequential stages, i. e., lifting, moving and up-righting is introduced. A finite element model (FEM) of the monopod platform is created to perform the structural analysis necessary to decide the suspension points/devices and the handling scenario during the various stages of the post-construction phase on a rational wise. Such structural analysis is performed within the framework of the three dimensional quasi-static modeling and analysis aiming at simulating the realistic handling condition, and hence introducing a reliable physical interpretation of the numerical results. For the whole effort to be demonstrated efficiently, the results obtained are analyzed, the conclusions are presented, and few related recommendations are suggested...|$|R
