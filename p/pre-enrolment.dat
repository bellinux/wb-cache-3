40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that insufficient research {{attention has been paid to}} the teaching of academic register to English as a Second Language students studying in Australia (Weger, 2009). Register is important since acquiring a language includes an understanding of the subject matter, relationships between participants, and the channel of communication as well as merely grammar and syntax. It is therefore relevant to discover whether this is in fact the case in Australian <b>pre-enrolment</b> English programs and bridging programs. Research on register should inform its teaching in academic contexts. A number of studies such as those by Martin, Matthienssen and Painter (1997) and Aguirre-Muñoz and colleagues (2006) have explored register in written academic discourse. Far fewer have looked at register in spoken discourse. In addition, these isolated studies have not explored formal spoken discourse. For instance, Sattar and colleagues (2009) focused on informal spoken discourses in the classroom. In order to address the issue of Iraqi students learning spoken register in Australia, this study explores the literature related to the issue, identifies gaps in the knowledge-base, and defines a theoretical framework and methodology for exploring the complex, real-life content-based classroom interactions related to register. This framework will enable the exploration of materials, curricula, teaching practices and perceptions of what is learnt, in <b>pre-enrolment</b> programs and bridging programs. It will also facilitate the exploration of whether appropriate register is achieved by these learners. Hayder Al Hamdany, Michelle Picard and Nina Maadad[URL]...|$|E

Through the exploration of the narratives of both parents and managers, the article finds that parental planfulness, qualification-based differences in demand for full-time places and formal rules of access are insufficient to explain clear-cut qualification- and income-based differences in access. The article describes the crucial importance of hidden, informal cream-skimming strategies that daycare and preschool managers employ in the <b>pre-enrolment</b> phase and of the informal tactics of relying on ‘interventions’ with which unsuccessful parents respond to managers' refusals to enrol. In the context of full-time place shortages, managerial autonomy in enrolment and insufficient institutional budgets, public ECEC institutions engage in hidden processes of redistribution through selective access, favouring well-educated, high-income parents and their children...|$|E
40|$|This study {{identifies}} and explores a {{range of}} themes, issues and questions that commonly confront adults contemplating enrolment in university, and why they persist. The study focuses particularly on issues facing prospective adult distance education learners. From {{a range of}} interviews, six themes were identified including fears, motivation, support from home, academic preparedness, suitability of programs, and identity change. It is argued that the more effective we become at information provision, guidance and preparation of adult pre-entry open and distance learners, the more likely students will experience a smooth transition to study, thus improving both student satisfaction and retention rates. Successful intervention with prospective distance education learners at this early point should aim to assist the process of informed decision making, which could result equally in an individual deciding not to pursue university study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{highlight}} the extent to which support for first years, such as an academic peer mentoring programme can play a positive role in studying successfully. The article also focuses on the many factors influencing student success in completing their studies. Factors such as academic unpreparedness (as a <b>pre-enrolment</b> factor) and adjustment at university (as a post-enrolment factor) are discussed as valid reasons to implement support structures in Higher Education (HE) in order to enhance success rates. A brief profile of first year student experiences and expectations is offered against the background of a literature review. A voluntary group of students were accommodated in a peer mentoring programme with the dual purpose of academic and psychosocial support. The findings indicate that there are at least three identifiable issues that can be addressed, namely enjoying support from significant others, feelings of being academically unprepared and feelings of isolation. Findings also indicate that student performance is enhanced by peer support, fostering both academic and social integration. © Unisa Press. Articl...|$|E

40|$|Higher {{education}} institutions are increasingly involved in measuring students' satisfaction and communicating messages to prospective, current, and previous students. A {{review of the}} literature suggests that institutions have traditionally focused on cognitive rather than affective measures, and have communicated messages in a media environment that could be dominated by the institution. This paper seeks to contribute by investigating the role of peer-to-peer social network media in evoking emotions about attending university prior to enrolment and subsequent satisfaction with it. A two-stage study involving 519 prospective students from a UK higher education institution were asked about their cognition and emotions one month prior to enrolment and again one month after. Hypotheses related their involvement in online peer-to-peer media to their perceived level of satisfaction, emotions evoked, and likelihood of recommending the institution. It was found that emotions were a better predictor of likelihood of recommendation than cognitive measures of satisfaction. Positive emotions evoked during the <b>pre-enrolment</b> phase led to positive emotions post-enrolment. There was an association between prospective students' level of involvement with online communities prior to enrolment and their level of evoked positive emotions...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the number of applicants seeking admission into architecture programmes. As expected, prior academic performance (also referred to as <b>pre-enrolment</b> requirement) is a major factor considered during the process of selecting applicants. In the present study, machine learning models were used to predict academic success of architecture students based on information provided in prior academic performance. Two modeling techniques, namely K-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and linear discriminant analysis were applied in the study. It was found that K-nearest neighbour (k-NN) outperforms the linear discriminant analysis model in terms of accuracy. In addition, grades obtained in mathematics (at ordinary level examinations) had a significant impact on the academic success of undergraduate architecture students. This paper makes a modest contribution to the ongoing discussion on the relationship between prior academic performance and academic success of undergraduate students by evaluating this proposition. One of the issues that emerges from these findings is that prior academic performance can be used as a predictor of academic success in undergraduate architecture programmes. Overall, the developed k-NN model can serve as a valuable tool during the process of selecting new intakes into undergraduate architecture programmes in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|Background: School health {{services}} are geared at preventing, protecting {{and improving the}} health status of the school population to enable them benefit fully from the school system. The year 2015 is the target date for the attainment of the eight Millennium Development Goals adopted by world leaders at the Millennium Summit in September 2000. Coverage of immunisation against measles and prevalence of underweight children under five years are both indicators for tracking attainment of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1 and 4 – eradicate extreme hunger and poverty and reduce child mortality. Aims and Objectives: The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the immunization and nutrition status as well as general well-being of primary school children through <b>pre-enrolment</b> medical examination. Methods/Study Design: A rural community in southern Nigeria was chosen for this pilot study, which was cross-sectional in design and conducted in 2010. The study instrument was a <b>pre-enrolment</b> medical examination form adopted from that provided by the State Ministry of Health. All newly enrolled school children in all three primary schools in the community were examined by medical doctors who completed the section on physical examination of the form. Nurses and volunteer assistants took the heights and weights of the children. Personal details and medical history of the examined children were thereafter obtained from the parents/guardians who were requested to give the dates their children received routine immunization, with photocopies of the immunization record where available. The heights and weights of the children were used to assess nutritional status by comparing with growth standards from the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study. Data were analysed using Epi Info version 3. 5. 1. Results/Findings: A total of 95 children were examined males being 54. 7 % while females were 45. 3 %. Medical history was provided for 46 children, 54. 3 % of which had evidence of completing routine immunization including measles. Calculation of height-for-age revealed stunting and severe stunting in 16. 3 % and 18. 6 % of children respectively. Of those whose weights-for-age were calculated, 2. 6 % were underweight while 7. 9 % were severely underweight. Scarification marks were found on the abdomen of 34. 7 % of the children examined, denoting traditional treatment for a previous episode of severe febrile illness such as malaria. Splenomegaly was detected in 9. 5 %. Study Limitation: The study was limited by the poor response from parents and guardians in providing personal details and medical history from examined children. Conclusion: School {{health services}} can provide data for monitoring, evaluating and improving child survival strategies beginning at the community level...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. N.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2010. Background: Literature on {{postgraduate}} student throughput and success suggests a mismatch between registration, throughput and success rates among {{postgraduate student}}s. Purpose of the Study: This study aimed at exploring and describing mechanisms used to increase throughput and success rates in Postgraduate Nursing Programmes at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Conceptual Framework: The theoretical framework {{used in this}} study was derived from Tinto's proposed Theory ofInstitutional Action (2005). This theory {{is based on the assumption}} that learners' behaviour which is manifested in persistence or departure is never fully understood because only the act of leaving or staying is observed, not the underlying intentions behind the action. Research Methodology: Using a mixed methods paradigm, the whole target population of 83 participants was sampled for the quantitative aspect and 2 focus groups each consisting about 12 participants for the qualitative aspect were used. Data were collected using a questionnaire and an interview guide. Descriptive statistics and were used for quantitative data, while thematic content analysis was used for qualitative data. Results: This study revealed that the support mechanisms for increasing student throughput and success rates are structured in three phases: the <b>pre-enrolment</b> phase, the integration phase, and the engagement phase. During the <b>pre-enrolment</b> phase, support is offered in form of information to help students understand what is expected of them, inform students about the programmes offered, the cost of the programmes, duration of the programs and the available support services. During the integration phase, the support provided includes guidance about the registration process, information about programmes and disciplines offered, counselling regarding curriculum design, modules to select and required credits for completion, orientation, and helping international students with visa extension with repatriation issues. During the engagement phase, the support provided includes academic, psychosocial and financial services. Facilitating factors reported include: student interaction with academic staff to monitor and provide feedback, a responsive curriculum to learning needs through the teaching and assessments methods utilised, active student involvement, personal effort, prior learning and working experience, and enough learning resources. Barriers reported were inadequate information, insufficiency of student-lecturer interaction time, unsuitable psychosocial support for adult learners, lack of mentorship and academic advising services, lack of time to participate in co-curricular activities, limited time for studying, ineffective use of learning resources, and language barrier. Recommendations: The study revealed a need to provide a balance mixture the available support mechanisms because academic support dominated the support services offered. Findings also showed the necessity to adapt the psychosocial support to the needs of all categories of students including adult postgraduate students...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to: {{investigate}} doctors' experiences of support during GP advanced rural skills training, and identify strategies to improve support. Design: The qualitative responses from a cross-sectional, postal survey are reported. Setting: Rural vocational training sector. Participants: Sixty-one doctors who had completed GP advanced rural skills training (procedural or non-procedural) in Queensland between 1995 and June 2009 participated in the study. Main outcome measure: Advanced trained doctors' experiences of support and their strategy recommendations to improve support. Results: Experiences and strategies to improve support were developed into a framework of support, consisting of three theme areas. Strategies included: provision of training and career advice to allow immediate use of advanced skills; introduction of rural attachments and rural case studies during training to ensure rural orientation; development of GP mentor and peer networks for clinical and non-clinical support; advocacy to improve understanding and recognition of advanced rural skills training. Conclusions: Expanded support is required across the <b>pre-enrolment,</b> training, early practice continuum. A holistic approach to support is required.

Aim: The aim {{of this research was}} to collect records of OAPS and OMAPS cases in order to have valuable information about their clinical features, laboratory, treatment, preg-nancy outcomes and long-term follow-up. Methods: EUROAPS/EUROMAPS is a registry in the frame of the European Forum on Antiphospholipid Antibody projects. Its own website has been available since June 2010 : www. euroaps. org. Results: This registry comprises 211 women including 304 <b>pre-enrolment</b> pregnancies, and 226 prospective cases, 194 of OAPS and 32 of OMAPS. OM was more frequent in OAPS than in OMAPS, independent of treatment. In the prospective cohort, standard aPL data was available in 202 cases and treatment data in all 226 cases. Good fetal outcomes were obtained when low dose aspirin plus low molecular weight heparin were administered. Prevalence of thrombotic events and/or cases evolving into full-blown systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was low. Conclusions: OAPS could be a dif-ferent form of APS.

We examine {{the introduction of a}} regular online assessment tool ('e-quiz') delivered by the WebCT Vista content management system to a large first-year quantitative methods course at UNSW, Sydney (Australia). Unique aspects of this study include the quantitative (mathematical) nature of the online learning, the larger than usual sample size (n> 1500 in toto), the inclusion of several difficult-to-obtain explanatory variables, and the high diversity in sub-population attributes. We principally measure the effectiveness of the e-quiz tool from the perspective of student performance in an end of semester closed-book examination. We also consider student opinions and attitudes to the introduction of the online tool. Data taken on attendance at voluntary peer-assisted learning classes, used as a proxy for student effort, along with <b>pre-enrolment</b> mathematical aptitude data are used to identify the specific contribution of the e-quiz tool to student learning. We find support for the hypothesis that regular usage of online learning tools (not grade) significantly and positively contributes to student performance. Furthermore, we find that the hypothesis that this improvement is due mainly to improving student feedback is supported by an analysis of student surveys. Finally, in an extension, we consider the use of such low-cost, online quizzes as a possible identifier for 'at-risk ' students. ...|$|E

40|$|Within Higher Education, e-portfolios are {{associated}} with capturing Personal Development Planning (PDP) activity, progression, reflection, articulation of learning and achievement (JISC, 2008). Clegg and Bradley (2006) recognise three distinct PDP modes: academic, professional and employability, which have been applied within an e-portfolio context (Frith, 2010). Other researchers (Barnett, 2000; Moore, 2001) characterise e-portfolios as inward or outward facing whilst Barrett (2011) considers the “two faces” of an e-portfolio (process and product) and the balance between them. Multiple, often dichotomous, models are prevalent and achieving a single definition {{has been described as}} “fraught with difficulty“(Strivens & Ward, 2010), together with the added complexity of discipline specific requirements. Informed by case studies and focus group analysis of academic and student practices and perceptions, this presentation introduces a progressive visual model, depicting integration of an eportfolio within the student journey from <b>pre-enrolment</b> to graduation and beyond. Hinged upon the idea of ownership, identity formation and the ‘curated showcase’, the e-portfolio moves from a predominately academically-focused, private space to become increasingly outward facing and employability focused, with different inputs, influences, audiences and purposes at different points in time. This model was developed within the creative arts, which offers an additional perspective based upon the long established tradition of a physical portfolio of work; however, it can translate and be adapted to other subject disciplines.

40|$|As {{transnational}} {{education is}} becoming firmly embedded {{as a part}} of the distance education landscape, governments and universities are calling for meaningful research on transnational education. This study involved the development and validation of a model for effective transnational education programs. The study used student experience as a key indicator of program effectiveness and, following a holistic approach, took into consideration various dimensions of the transnational education context including student, instructor, curriculum and instruction design, interaction, evaluation and assessment, technology, and program management and organisational support. This selection of dimensions, together with their attributes, formed the proposed model for transnational education programs. The model was applied for validation against three transnational computing education programs currently offered by Australian universities in Hong Kong. Two methods of data collection - a survey, and group interviews with students - were used to validate the model; data was obtained from approximately three hundred subjects. The model was evaluated in terms of the perceived importance, to the students, of the various attributes of each program dimension on program effectiveness. The results of the validation indicated that the students in all the programs participating in the evaluation were in agreement as to the factors they consider most important to the effectiveness of transnational programs. The validation of the model led to its refinement; first, the least important attributes were removed from dimensions; second, a new dimension, <b>pre-enrolment</b> considerations, was introduced to the model; and finally, the attributes within each of the dimensions were ordered in terms of their perceived importance...|$|E
40|$|Learning to Research Researching to Learn {{explores the}} {{integration}} of research into teaching and learning {{at all levels of}} higher education. The chapters draw on the long and ongoing debate about the teaching research nexus in universities. Although the vast majority of academics believe that there is an important and valuable link between teaching and research, the precise nature of this relationship continues to be contested. The book includes chapters that showcase innovative ways of learning to research; how research is integrated into coursework teaching; how students learn the processes of research, and how universities are preparing students to engage with the world. The chapters also showcase innovative ways of researching to learn, exploring how students learn through doing research, how they conceptualise the knowledge of their fields of study through the processes of doing research, and how students experiment and reflect on the results produced. These are the key issues addressed by this anthology, as it brings together analyses {{of the ways in which}} university teachers are developing research skills in their students, creating enquiry-based approaches to teaching, and engaging in education research themselves.

We determined {{the effect of adding}} HFO-TGI sessions to lung-protective CMV on early/severe ARDS outcome. We conducted a prospective clinical trial, subdivided into a first single-centre period and a second two-centre period. We enrolled 125 (first period, n= 54) patients with arterial oxygen tension (Pa,O- 2) /inspiratory oxygen fraction (FI,O- 2) of 12 consecutive hours at an end-expiratory pressure of >= 8 cmH(2) O. Patients were randomly assigned to an HFO-TGI group (receiving HFO-TGI sessions with RMs, interspersed with lung-protective CMV; n= 61) or CMV group (receiving lung-protective CMV and RMs; n= 64). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. <b>Pre-enrolment</b> ventilation duration was variable. During days 1 - 10 post-randomisation, Pa,O- 2 /FI,O- 2, oxygenation index, plateau pressure and respiratory compliance were improved in the HFO-TGI group versus the CMV group (p < 0. 001 for group x time). Within days 1 - 60, the HFO-TGI group had more ventilator-free days versus the CMV group (median (interquartile range) 31. 0 (0. 0 - 42. 0) versus 0. 0 (0. 0 - 23. 0) days; p < 0. 001), and more days without respiratory, circulatory, renal, coagulation and liver failure (p <= 0. 003).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} {{the dimensions of}} the aortic root in a selected population of young males with isolated normally functioning bicuspid aortic valve.  DESIGN AND SETTING—Echocardiographic and Doppler evaluation of conscripts with bicuspid aortic valve at the time of military <b>pre-enrolment</b> screening in two military hospitals.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS— 66 consecutive young men with a normally functioning bicuspid aortic valve were studied to assess aortic size at four aortic levels: annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, supra-aortic ridge, and proximal ascending aorta; 70  consecutive normal young subjects, matched for age and body surface area, were used as controls.  RESULTS—In men with a bicuspid aortic valve, the diameter of the aortic root was significantly larger than in controls at the sinuses (3. 16  (0. 37) v 2. 87  (0. 31) cm, p <  0. 001), at the supra-aortic ridge (2. 64  (0. 46) v 2. 47  (0. 28) cm, p =  0. 01), and {{at the level of the}} proximal ascending aorta (3. 12  (0. 48) v 2. 69  (0. 28) cm, p <  0. 001). The prevalence of aortic root dilatation was 7. 5 % at the annulus (5 / 66), 19. 6 % at the sinuses (13 / 66), 15 % at the supra-aortic ridge (10 / 66), and 43. 9 % at the ascending aorta (29 / 66); 32  subjects (48 %) had aortic root dimensions comparable with controls, while 34  (52 %) had definitely abnormal aortic root dimensions.  CONCLUSIONS—Aortic root enlargement in people with a bicuspid aortic valve occurs independently of haemodynamic abnormalities, age, and body size. However, there appear to be different subgroups of young adults with bicuspid aortic valves, one of which is characterised by aortic dilatation, possibly caused by a congenital abnormality of the aortic wall.    Keywords: bicuspid aortic valve; aortic root dilatatio...|$|E
40|$|At Plymouth University {{international}} student {{numbers are}} rising. Basic library skills sessions were offered to small groups before <b>pre-enrolment</b> into a standard degree programme. For Library staff this was time intensive and became increasingly unsustainable. They were unconvinced {{that this approach}} was effective either, in part, due to cultural and language barriers, but also {{because there was no}} opportunity no build up a relationship. It was also difficult to ascertain whether the students acquired any real IL skills. ‘Teaching the teachers’ was devised to try and bridge this gap and to better utilise the professional skills of the international students’ tutors. They see their students regularly, and can build up a relationship based on an individual’s language skills, confidence and personality. We wished to harness this and empower the tutors with the basic skills and knowledge to teach their students. Managers overseeing the induction of international students were supportive and enthusiastic to this suggested approach. A range of online tutorials and short quizzes were devised. After a training session tutors were happy cascading this information and had time to skill themselves before the international students arrived. Various forms of feedback were requested. Some positive outcomes included freeing up librarians’ time to produce relevant interactive materials that could be used by experienced tutors in a timely and effective manner. A negative aspect was the difficulty to gauge how successful this approach had been. Were tutors using the materials or bringing students to the Library? There is also quite a leap of faith by expecting non library professionals to teach library skills effectively! The future is to continue with this approach but to incorporate the comments and ideas received into improving our support materials. We need to continue ‘road testing’, using international students input wherever possible...|$|E
40|$|In Japan the {{academic}} year starts in early April. Standard entrance exams are held each January and February, however some universities offer {{a limited number of}} students an opportunity to apply earlier. Depending on the university, provisional acceptance through this alternative is given up to ten months before lectures start. With no university entrance exams to prepare for, it is possible for students to experience a decline in study skills and knowledge during this interim period. To address this, it is common for universities to offer a <b>pre-enrolment</b> course, typically in the form of irregular on-campus events, paper-based correspondence courses or quiz-based online courses with little-to-no interaction with other students. However, the affordances of modern e-learning systems allow {{for the creation of a}} more engaging online environment. Students at the authors' university major in design and computer science-related fields. Computer literacy is essential; e-learning is part of their daily routine and they have to complete numerous tasks using computers. Three years ago, the authors designed a pre- enrolment English course with these students in mind. It has been created using the Moodle LMS for an annual cohort of 100 students who come from all over Japan. They generally have low technology skills, low English skills (CEFR A 2 to B 1), and no e-learning experience. The aims of the course are not only to improve their English, but to introduce them to e-learning, their future classmates, and university life. Analysis of activity logs and end-of-course surveys tells us what students thought of the course, and how they engaged with it, leading to suggestions for change. Generally, it proved to be a very positive experience for motivated students, but less so for those with lower motivation, the main target of the course...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the survey results of a {{longitudinal}} study over the period of {{a year and a}} half into the perceptions of and use of academic register in spoken discourse by 52 Iraqi students at an Australian university in two English for academic purposes (EAP) programs. The results of this study indicate that the participants valued the <b>pre-enrolment</b> course, and believed that it assisted them in the development of spoken register due to its content and explicit focus on register. The participants appeared to value the English for academic purposes component of their bridging course less in terms of satisfaction with content and instruction in general. However, the explicit focus on register in the bridging English curriculum appeared to affect satisfaction levels with this component of the instruction positively. There was also a clear correlation among variables related to satisfaction with content, satisfaction with instruction, motivation to use spoken register and perceived proficiency in relation to native and non-native speakers. The qualitative data in the survey and interviews indicate that the respondents came to a greater understanding of the varieties of register possible when speaking, and how to use those registers appropriately. They describe how the use of appropriate register is related to daily tasks as well as specific academic tasks and genres. This data supports content-based instruction around specific tasks and activities when teaching spoken register and other EAP content. It also supports the literature which suggests that adults tend to favor practical learning activities and materials. We therefore suggest that EAP courses that consist of various stages should be carefully designed to become sequentially more disciplinarily and practically focused to provide the students with the disciplinary and generic academic English skills and content they require.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{experience}} of studying taught music master’s degrees by observing both student and higher education perspectives. Little is currently known about the career transitions of taught postgraduate students, as until recently research has tended to focus upon undergraduates and research postgraduates. Additionally, {{much of the research}} on musicians’ career transitions has considered music education and performance students. The current thesis focuses upon musicology and music psychology degrees which were non-vocational and lacked compulsory music-making course content. A two stage study was conducted. Stage one involved longitudinal interviews with sixteen student participants who were all enrolled at three English institutions {{at the beginning of the}} study. Participants took part in four semi-structured interviews at six month intervals. The aim of these interviews was to observe the students’ experiences during and after their master’s study. Alongside this, stage two aimed to explore the higher education perspective by interviewing course tutors and careers advisors attached to each of the students’ courses. Qualitative analytical methods were used and a social psychology perspective was taken when considering the student experience. This approach highlights the reciprocal interaction between the self and the social environment. The career transition involved a period of personal and vocational development during which individuals were transformed through learning. Participants were motivated to realise a greater sense of personal fulfilment by pursuing their interests and achieving personal goals. The participants’ confidence in their professional practice increased and they developed greater self-awareness which was beneficial when deciding upon career plans. However, students’ coping methods and the extent of their exploration impacted upon their experiences of studying and the career transition. The results highlight the need for clear <b>pre-enrolment</b> information and flexible course structures in order to support students’ developing professional identities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Primary care medical homes {{may improve}} health {{outcomes}} {{for children with}} special healthcare needs (CSHCN), by improving care coordination. However, community-based primary care practices may be challenged to deliver comprehensive care coordination to complex subsets of CSHCN such as children with medical complexity (CMC). Linking a tertiary care center with the community may achieve cost effective and high quality care for CMC. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the outcomes of community-based complex care clinics integrated with a tertiary care center. Methods A before- and after-intervention study design with mixed (quantitative/qualitative) methods was utilized. Clinics at two community hospitals distant from tertiary care were staffed by local community pediatricians with the tertiary care center nurse practitioner and linked with primary care providers. Eighty-one children with underlying chronic conditions, fragility, requirement for high intensity care and/or technology assistance, and involvement of multiple providers participated. Main outcome measures included health care utilization and expenditures, parent reports of parent- and child-quality of life [QOL (SF- 36 ®, CPCHILD ©, PedsQL™) ], and family-centered care (MPOC- 20 ®). Comparisons were made in equal (up to 1 year) pre- and post-periods supplemented by qualitative perspectives of families and pediatricians. Results Total health care system costs decreased from median (IQR) $ 244 (981) per patient per month (PPPM) <b>pre-enrolment</b> to $ 131 (355) PPPM post-enrolment (p=. 007), driven primarily by fewer inpatient days in the tertiary care center (p=. 006). Parents reported decreased out of pocket expenses (p © domains [Health Standardization Section (p=. 04); Comfort and Emotions (p=. 03) ], while total CPCHILD © score decreased between baseline and 1 year (p=. 003). Parents and providers reported the ability to receive care close to home as a key benefit. Conclusions Complex care can be provided in community-based settings with less direct tertiary care involvement through an integrated clinic. Improvements in health care utilization and family-centeredness of care can be achieved despite minimal changes in parental perceptions of child health. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} influences on the retention of Māori students, and adult students in general within Te Wānanga o Aotearoa. Te Wānanga o Aotearoa is a Māori-led tertiary institution in New Zealand. A mixed method research design was employed and data were collected by qualitative methods (focus group) and quantitative methods (72 -item questionnaire). Inductive and deductive analytic techniques were employed including Rasch Rating Scale model estimations (Andrich, 1978). Seven retention variables were identified. These were student retention attitudes and behaviours, kaiako (teacher) characteristics, whānau (family) features, integration processes and institutional culture, employment and financial situation, student motivation, and <b>pre-enrolment</b> and induction processes. The variables were qualified and quantified by plotting item difficulty measures and person ability measures on the same scale. Additionally, associations between variables were examined by a multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance. Student retention attitudes and behaviours were shown to be positively associated with kaiako (teacher) characteristics and student motivation. Also the ethnicity of the student (Māori or non-Māori) was shown to weakly account for variance in integration processes and institutional culture. After highlighting the key factors affecting the retention of students at Te Wānanga o Aotearoa, four propositions were made regarding ways to improve their retention. These were: Kaiako (teachers) need retention related training; External motivation for kaiako (teachers) will improve student retention; Improved student retention requires a change in institutional culture; The measurement of retention attitudes and behaviours could provide data essential for increasing retention. The study has led the way for future research in the following areas: Using the student voice to provide a grounded view of retention; Researching the area of kaiako (teachers) and pedagogy with regards {{to their ability to}} positively affect retention; Researching the role of whānau (family) features to effectively configure support programmes to positively affect retention; Identifying significant factors that contribute to adult students feelings of pressure, negatively affecting their retention...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The Medication Use Patterns, Treatment Satisfaction, and Inadequate Control of Osteoporosis Study (MUSIC-OS) is a prospective, {{observational}} study {{of women with}} osteoporosis in Europe and Canada. At baseline, patients with gastrointestinal symptoms reported lower adherence to osteoporosis treatment, treatment satisfaction, and health-related quality of life, than those without gastrointestinal symptoms. Introduction: The aim {{of the study was}} to examine gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the association between GI symptoms and treatment adherence, treatment satisfaction, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among osteoporotic women in Europe and Canada. Methods: Baseline results are reported here for a prospective study which enrolled postmenopausal, osteoporotic women who were initiating (new users) or continuing (experienced users) osteoporosis treatment at study entry (baseline). A patient survey was administered at baseline and included the occurrence of GI symptoms during 6 -month <b>pre-enrolment,</b> treatment adherence (adherence evaluation of osteoporosis (ADEOS), score 0 – 22), treatment satisfaction (Osteoporosis Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medications (OPSAT-Q), score 0 – 100) and HRQoL (EuroQol- 5 dimension (EQ- 5 D) utility, score 0 – 1; OPAQ-SV, score 0 – 100). The association between GI symptoms and ADEOS (experienced users), OPSAT-Q (experienced users), and HRQoL (new and experienced users) was assessed by general linear models adjusted for patient characteristics. Results: A total of 2959 patients (2275 experienced and 684 new users) were included. Overall, 68. 1  % of patients experienced GI symptoms in the past 6  months. Compared with patients without GI symptoms, patients with GI symptoms had lower mean baseline scores on most measures. The mean adjusted differences were ADEOS, − 0. 43; OPSAT-Q, − 5. 68; EQ- 5 D, − 0. 04 (new users) and − 0. 06 (experienced users), all P < 0. 01. GI symptoms were also associated with lower OPAQ-SV domain scores: physical function, − 4. 17 (experienced users); emotional status, − 4. 28 (new users) and − 5. 68 (experienced users); back pain, − 5. 82 (new users) and − 11. 33 (experienced users), all P < 0. 01. Conclusions: Patients with GI symptoms have lower treatment adherence and treatment satisfaction and worse HRQoL than patients without GI symptoms...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, {{in a pilot}} study, the {{efficacy}} of a short term cyclophosphamide (CYC) pulse regimen on alveolitis in a cohort of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). METHODS: Twenty-three patients with SSc (17 diffuse SSc and 6 limited SSc) were selected in 5 centers in Italy, {{based on the findings}} of an abnormal bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell analysis in association with altered pulmonary function tests (PFT) or recent deterioration in flow volume curve (FVC). Patients were also evaluated by skin score (Rodnan), esophageal manometry and barium swallow radiography, and electrocardiography and 2 -mode echocardiography. The <b>pre-enrolment</b> pulmonary evaluation and after 6 months of therapy included evaluation of the clinical status, PFT (FVC, FEV 1, DLCO), BAL. standard chest radiograph, and chest high resolution computed tomography. All patients received i. v. CYC (1000 mg/m 2 of body surface monthly for 6 mo) and oral prednisone (25 mg daily for the first month and subsequently 5 mg daily of maintenance dosage for the remaining 5 mo). A complete blood count and urinalysis were obtained at monthly intervals. RESULTS: After 6 months of therapy the values for FVC did not change significantly. Individually, 8 of 23 patients showed an improvement (> 15 % increase) in FVC after 6 months, while FVC in 13 cases remained stable. Only 2 patients had an important decline in FVC after 6 months of therapy (17 and 24 % decrease). Improvement in DLCO was noted in 15 of 23 patients after 6 months of therapy. Four patients were stable and 4 patients had a worsened DLCO {{at the end of the}} study. After therapy the mean value of BAL fluid recovery did not change. There was a reduction in total cell number although this value did not reach statistical significance. The levels of neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages did not change significantly. Scans for patients with grades 1, 2, and 3 did not differ significantly after 6 months of therapy, and 14 patients were stable. Changes in appearance, in relation to changes in extent of disease, were seen in 8 patients and consisted of an extension of reticular pattern and transformation from grade 1 to 2 (6 / 8 patients). All patients showed a ground-glass appearance indicating an acute alveolitis. Improvement in ground-glass was noted in 10 of 23 patients after 6 mo therapy. At the end of the study, 8 patients were stable and 5 patients had a diffusion of the ground-glass to other segments. No side effects were experienced during the treatment except for mild nausea in 4 patients; no patients discontinued therapy during the study. CONCLUSION: CYC pulse regimen seems to stabilize alveolitis in the majority of cases. The association of CYC pulsed modality with prednisone may be useful in SSc patients to control disease evolution in the lung...|$|E
