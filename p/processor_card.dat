40|$|The LEP tune meters {{have been}} {{upgraded}} by replacing the original Motorola 68020 <b>processor</b> <b>cards</b> by Texas Instruments TSM 320 C 30 Digital Signal <b>Processor</b> <b>cards</b> with {{floating point arithmetic}} and by creating an optional connection to a more sensitive beam position monitor. This upgrade has lead to a considerable increase in speed and accuracy. The new instrument can generate a continuous real time display of the beam motion in the frequency domain which is well suited to monitor dynamic phenomena occurring during injection and acceleration of the LEP collider. The dynamic phenomena can also be stored for off line analysis. The paper describes the functionality of the instrument in terms of user interface and covers some aspects of code debugging and process synchronization for DSP's connected to the standard control system of an accelerator...|$|R
50|$|Throughout its lifecycle, the GTD-5 EAX {{incorporated}} a quad-redundant processor architecture. The main processor complex of the APC, TPC, TCU, RLU, and RSU all {{consisted of a}} pair of <b>processor</b> <b>cards,</b> and each of those <b>processor</b> <b>cards</b> contained a pair of processors. The on-card pair of processors executed precisely the same sequence of instructions, and the output of the pair were compared each clock cycle. If the results were not identical, the processors were immediately reset, and the pair of processors on the other card were brought online as the active processor complex. The active processor always kept memory up-to-date so that when these forced switches occurred, little data loss was suffered. When the switch was requested as a part of routine maintenance, the switch could be accomplished with no data loss at all.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{processor}} {{being located}} on a detachable daughter card, the PowerBook 2400c saw {{a small number of}} PowerPC G3 <b>processor</b> <b>cards</b> created for it.
