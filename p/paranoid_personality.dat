25|$|Aggression can be {{the result}} of both {{internal}} and external factors that create a measurable activation in the autonomic nervous system. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the clenching of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to psychiatric emergency service settings are homicidal in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide. Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute intoxication, acute psychosis, <b>paranoid</b> <b>personality</b> disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc. Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background and Objectives: Considering that {{paranoid}} thought has one-dimensional approach, use of long questionnaires has no {{clinical and}} research application, therefore use of short questionnaires seems necessary. The Green et al. paranoid thought scale {{is a short}} self-assessment tool for assessing paranoid thought in non-clinical and clinical group. This research was conducted to validate this questionnaire in Iranian population. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, 356 students were selected using stratified sampling method and assessed by GPTS and Minnesota multiphasic paranoid inventory (MMPI) in 2015. Validity was assessed simultaneously with MMPI testing. Results: The correlation coefficient of GPTS and MMPI scores was α= 0. 71 and significant (p< 0. 001). Internal consistency value {{was estimated to be}} 0. 81 according to Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Conclusion: GPTS is an appropriate and short tool for screening in paranoid thought-related researches. Keywords: <b>Paranoid</b> disorders; <b>Personality</b> tests; Validation studies...|$|R

Mollath's forensic incarceration for seven years and the surrounding legal judgments became the basis of a public controversy in Bavaria and the whole of Germany when at least some underlying elements of his supposedly fabricated paranoid story about money-laundering activities at a major bank turned out to be true after all. Mollath himself had consistently claimed there was a conspiracy to have him locked up in a psychiatric care ward because of his incriminating knowledge; evidence turned up in 2012 made his claims appear plausible.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to establish a clinical/personality profile of Turkish patients with treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (TR-OCD). Methods. A neurocognitive/clinical test battery was administered to 17 patients with TR-OCD. Results. TR-OCD patients presented with major psychiatric syndromes (especially mood and generalized anxiety disorders) and <b>personality</b> disorders (particularly <b>paranoid,</b> avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, histrionic), and obtained higher scores on measures of core OCD symptoms (i. e., obsessional ideation, compulsive cleaning/washing, mental neutralizing), depressive symptoms, schizotypal personality features, and impulsiveness relative to normative controls. TR-OCD patients did not differ significantly from normative controls on checking, doubting, ordering, and hoarding subscales, and on measures of venturesomeness and empathy. Conclusions. Lack of insight, suspiciousness, and rigidity associated with schizotypal, <b>paranoid,</b> and obsessive-compulsive <b>personality</b> features may have contributed to treatment failure...|$|R

5000|$|Simon Bonesteel (portrayed by Scott McNeil) - A {{deranged}} {{big game}} hunter {{who specializes in}} hunting endangered animals. He has collected things off of endangered animals like elephant ivories, baby seal pelts, dolphin hides, and mountain gorilla skulls. He considers the Ninja Turtles endangered species as well since there are only five of them as he quotes [...] "I have found a species that will make others seem downright plentiful". Bonesteel possesses a <b>paranoid,</b> anti-social <b>personality</b> and is known to give his weapons female names; he even talks to his weapons, and can be tricked with enough word play. Bonesteel is revealed to have made his home {{on the roof of}} an abandoned building. As the series progressed, Bonesteel grew craftier where he logged all the Turtles habits and set traps for them. One such instance is when he attempted to capture Mikey at a pizzeria; another is when the Turtles' instincts have them go out to play frisbee during a full moon. However, Leo also began learning about hunting to counter the traps. In the four-part episode [...] "Unchain My Heart", Simon Bonesteel is also known for hunting supernatural creatures when it came to Vam-Mi and her vampire henchmen; he twice tries forging alliance with them, succeeding with capture and threat of sunlight.|$|R

2500|$|No {{medications}} {{are indicated}} for directly treating schizoid personality disorder, but certain medications {{may reduce the}} symptoms of SPD as well as treat co-occurring mental disorders. The symptoms of SPD mirror the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anhedonia, blunted affect and low energy, and SPD {{is thought to be}} part of the [...] "schizophrenic spectrum" [...] of disorders, which also includes the schizotypal and <b>paranoid</b> <b>personality</b> disorders, and may benefit from the medications indicated for schizophrenia. Originally, low doses of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone or olanzapine were used to alleviate social deficits and blunted affect. However, a recent review concluded that atypical antipsychotics were ineffective for treating personality disorders. In contrast, the substituted amphetamine Bupropion may be used to treat anhedonia. Likewise, Modafinil may be effective in treating some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which are reflected in the symptomatology of SPD and therefore may help as well. Lamotrigine, SSRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and Hydroxyzine may help counter social anxiety in people with SPD if present, though social anxiety may not be a main concern for the people who have SPD. However, it is not general practice to treat SPD with medications, other than for the short term treatment of acute co-occurring Axis I conditions (e.g. depression).|$|E
2500|$|On December 18, 1993 Ferguson asked a {{judge to}} let him replace Falanga with Colin A. Moore, a Brooklyn-based {{attorney}} {{with a reputation for}} pursuing allegations of racism in the criminal-justice system. Moore offered to represent Ferguson pro bono. Before a ruling was even made on the request, Moore held a press conference announcing he would seek a change of venue to Brooklyn, claiming it was impossible for Ferguson to receive a fair trial in a Nassau court due to a [...] "severe underrepresentation of African-Americans on the Nassau County jury panel". Later, Moore withdrew his offer to represent Ferguson, citing conflicts he did not explain. Ferguson told a judge he questioned Falanga's integrity, disagreed with his handling of the case and had no intention of cooperating with him. Dr. Allen Reichman, a psychiatrist who interviewed Ferguson, indicated in his report that Ferguson may have been feigning mental illness when he spoke of conspiracies against him. Reichman said Ferguson's assertions were [...] "vague and somewhat evasive", in contrast to the normally detailed and highly focused nature of systematized paranoid delusional thinking. On January 5, 1994, a report by a court-appointed psychologist and psychiatrist concluded Ferguson was suffering from <b>paranoid</b> <b>personality</b> disorder but was competent to stand trial.|$|E
40|$|The {{associations}} between personality disorders and adult attachment dimensions were assessed {{in a sample}} of 487 consecutively admitted psychiatric subjects. Canonical correlation analysis showed that two sets of moderately correlated canonical variates explained the correlations between personality disorders and adult attachment patterns. The first and second attachment variates closely resembled the avoidance and anxiety attachment dimensions, respectively. The first personality disorder variate was mainly characterized by avoidant, depressive, <b>paranoid,</b> and schizotypal <b>personality</b> disorders, whereas dependent, histrionic, and borderline personality disorders loaded on the second canonical variate. However, these linear combinations of personality disorders were different from those obtained from principal component analysis. The results extend previous studies linking personality disorders and attachment patterns and suggest the importance of focusing on specific constellations of symptoms associated with dimensions of insecurity...|$|R

2500|$|Service {{stated that}} Stalin [...] "derived deep satisfaction" [...] from {{degrading}} and humiliating people, {{and that he}} [...] "delighted" [...] in keeping even close associates {{in a state of}} [...] "unrelieved fear". He was capable of self-righteous indignation, and was both resentful, and vengeful, holding onto grievances against others for many years. He was also suspicious and conspiratorial, prone to believing that people were plotting against him and that there were vast international conspiracies behind acts of dissent. Montefiore thought that Stalin's brutality marked him out as a [...] "natural extremist"; Service suggested that he had a <b>paranoid</b> or sociopathic <b>personality</b> disorder, with this [...] "dangerously damaged" [...] personality supplying [...] "the high-octane fuel for the journey to the Great Terror". Other historians have argued that Stalin's brutality should be seen not as a result of any personality traits, but through his unflinching commitment to the survival of his socialist state and the cause of international socialism. By the period of glasnost and perestroika, Soviet psychologists were openly debating whether Stalin had been insane.|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} 20 {{patients with}} late-onset schizophrenia, 7 with delusional disorder with halluci-nations (paraphrenia), and 13 with delusional disorder without hallucinations (late-onset para-noia). We {{found that these}} three categories could be distinguished from each other on some clinical parameters. Late-onset schizo-phrenia was characterized by bi-zarre delusions; auditory hal-lucinations; to a lesser degree, first-rank and negative symp-toms; and premorbid <b>personality</b> of the <b>paranoid</b> or schizoid type. Paraphrenia was associated with predominantly nonbizarre delu-sions, auditory hallucinations, earlier onset of symptoms, and <b>paranoid</b> or schizoid <b>personality.</b> Paranoia (late-onset) was charac-terized by late onset of symp-toms, nonbizarre delusions, relatively intact premorbid per-sonality, and an underlying physical stratum. Kraepelin (1919 / 1971) applied the diagnosis "paraphrenia " to schizo-phrenia patients who developed psychosis in later life 0 este et al. 1991). Paraphrenic patients were characterized by delusions and hal-lucinations of a paranoid nature. Kraepelin introduced the term "paranoia " to describe a chronic illness characterized by well-organized delusions without hallu-cinations, formal thought disorder, or personality deterioration (Flint et al. 1991). Since Kraepelin's time, these two diagnostic categories have been poorly studied and their concep-tual boundaries blurred. ICD-...|$|R

40|$|Background:   This study {{investigated}} the relationship between parental personality patterns and internalising and externalising behaviour problems in a clinically referred sample of children (aged 4 – 8) and adolescents (aged 12 – 18). Methods:   Data from families involved in two clinical trials in Victoria, Australia were analysed (n = 59). Families were administered the Millons Clinical Multiaxial Inventory—III (MCMI-III) which reports personality patterns consistent with Axis II disorder and an Achenbach measure of mental health as appropriate to child 2 ̆ 7 s age (Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Youth Self-Report (YSR), or Adult Self-Report (ASR)). Relationships between internalising and externalising behaviour problems, and parental personality patterns were examined via correlation and regression analyses. Results:   The study found {{a positive correlation between}} parental borderline, <b>paranoid,</b> and avoidant <b>personality</b> patterns, and child and adolescent externalising behaviour problems. The relationships were generally stronger for adolescents than for children. However, no relationship was observed between parental personality patterns and internalising behaviour problems. Conclusions:   These findings underline the importance of clinical assessment of the family ecology as a whole—including the interaction between parental personality patterns and child and adolescent behaviour and emotional problems. These findings contribute to the understanding of developmental risk factors for child and adolescent mental health and the transmission of psychopathology across generations...|$|R
