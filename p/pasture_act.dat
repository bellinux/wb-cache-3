40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that populations in small habitat fragments remaining in agricultural landscapes are maintained by repeated immigration, using three grassland butterflies (Aphantopus hyperantus, Coenonympha pamphilus and Maniola jurtina). Transect counts in 12 matched sets of semi-natural pastures, and linear habitat elements proximate and isolated from the pastures showed that population densities of M. jurtina and C. pamphilus were significantly higher in pastures and in linear habitats adjacent to these than in isolated linear elements. A mark-recapture study in a 2 x 2 km landscape indicated that individuals of all three species are able to reach even the isolated linear elements situated at least 1 km from the grasslands. For two of the species, A. hyperantus and C. pamphilus, analysis of the mark-recapture data revealed higher daily local survival rates in the semi-natural pastures and more individuals dispersing from pastures to linear habitat elements. The proportion of old compared to young individuals of C. pamphilus and M. jurtina were significantly higher in linear elements than in semi-natural pastures, which suggests that butterflies emerging in pastures subsequently dispersed to the linear elements. In combination, {{these results suggest that}} semi-natural <b>pastures</b> <b>act</b> as population sources, from which adult butterflies disperse to surrounding linear elements. Hence, preservation of the remaining fragments of semi-natural grassland is necessary to keep the present butterfly abundance in the surrounding agricultural landscape...|$|R
40|$|The Tibetan {{highlands}} {{host the}} largest alpine grassland ecosystems worldwide, bearing soils that store substantial stocks of carbon (C) {{that are very}} sensitive to land use changes. This study focuses on the cycling of photoassimilated C within a Kobresia pygmaea pasture, the dominating ecosystems on the Tibetan highlands. We investigated short-term effects of grazing cessation {{and the role of the}} characteristic Kobresia root turf on C fluxes and belowground C turnover. By combining eddy-covariance measurements with (CO 2) -C- 13 pulse labeling we applied a powerful new approach to measure absolute fluxes of assimilates within and between various pools of the plant-soil-atmosphere system. The roots and soil each store roughly 50 % of the overall C in the system (76 Mg Cha(- 1)), with only a minor contribution from shoots, which is also expressed in the root:shoot ratio of 90. During June and July the <b>pasture</b> <b>acted</b> as a weak C sink with a strong uptake of approximately 2 g C m(- 2) d(- 1) in the first half of July. The root turf was the main compartment for the turnover of photoassimilates, with a subset of highly dynamic roots (mean residence time 20 days), and plays a key role for the C cycling and C storage in this ecosystem. The short-term grazing cessation only affected aboveground biomass but not ecosystem scale C exchange or assimilate allocation into roots and soil. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 20 century Patagonian arid steppes have been {{subjected}} to overgrazing that led to the degradation of plant communities. We hypothesized that the interplay among grazing history, plant-plant spatial interactions and species traits affects recovery and assemblage of shrub community after short-term abandonment in north-eastern Patagonian arid steppe (Peninsula Valdés, Argentina). We compared six sites (two in grazed pastures, and four in short-term ungrazed pastures, two of which intensively grazed, while the other two low intensity grazed in the past) with regard to: shrub cover percentage (10 m × 10 m plots); shrub patch dimension, species richness, and spatial interactions among shrub species depending on patch dimension (patches sampled along transects); species richness and composition, vertical relations among species, and traits related to avoidance strategies and disturbance (1 m × 1 m plots sampled along transects). Our results indicated that recovery processes in abandoned <b>pastures</b> <b>act</b> through the increase in shrub patch size, formation of new patches, change in patch composition and richness, and in within-patch relations among shrub species. No {{significant differences were found between}} sites subjected to different past grazing intensities. The increase in shrub cover was due to a significant expansion of the dominant shrub Chuquiraga avellanedae. The mechanism of new patch formation and spread was mainly based on facilitative processes acting between the dwarf shrubs, poorly palatable and disliked by wild herbivores, and young individuals of the dominant species emerging from their canopy. As patch size increased, dwarf shrubs were covered by taller ones or grew at the edge of the patch, indicating a phase of competitive exclusion. Plant-plant spatial interactions involved changes in the composition of plant traits linked to avoidance strategies, which were indicators of grazed conditions and of plots with shrub cover lower than 50...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of BiologyJack F. Cully, Jr. Dispersal {{remains one}} of the most important, yet least understood, life history traits. As the vehicle of gene flow among populations, {{dispersal}} can both relieve inbreeding depression and prevent local adaptation. Regionally, dispersal can stabilize or destabilize metapopulations, given its critical roles in disease transmission among populations as well as recolonization following local extinction events. Furthermore, in light of climate change and increasing habitat loss and fragmentation, the ability to navigate through unfamiliar, unsuitable habitat between populations is essential to the long-term survival of a species across its range. In my dissertation, I present a multi-scale investigation of factors affecting gene flow and disease transmission among populations of a keystone species and an agricultural pest of the North American prairie: the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Black-tailed prairie dogs are social, ground-dwelling squirrels that live in spatially isolated populations called colonies. First, we conducted a landscape genetic analysis of black-tailed prairie dogs throughout a large portion of their current range. Our estimates of gene flow indicate that the genetic neighborhood size of both male and female prairie dogs reaches 40 - 60 km within short-grass prairie, whereas colonies within mixed-grass prairie are more isolated. At a broad scale, we observed isolation-by-distance among colonies and great influence of grassland productivity on genetic connectivity; however, neither distance nor landscape characteristics greatly explained observed genetic differentiation among colonies separated by < 50 km. Last, we investigated whether landscape features could predict disease transmission patterns of sylvatic plague among colonies in short-grass prairie and found evidence that <b>pastures</b> <b>act</b> as corridors for plague transmission. Our results indicate that black-tailed prairie dogs are more resilient to habitat loss and fragmentation than other obligate grassland species and likely capable of transmitting sylvatic plague over long distances. Taken together, these studies illustrate how a multi-scale approach can reveal complexities of dispersal dynamics that would otherwise remain undetected...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} quantified {{the effectiveness}} of agricultural riparian buffers to protect stream health in Maryland's Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic regions. Easily-obtainable data were used to develop scientific guidance for buffer management strategies. Three data sets were used: the 1998 University of Maryland Agricultural Buffer Survey, the 1996 Smithsonian Environmental Research Center Water Quality Survey, and the 1995 - 1997 Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Collectively, these data were used to represent baseflow water quality and landscape conditions in agricultural catchments. A set of landscape characteristics describing the agricultural riparian landscape was developed, from which a classification system for agricultural riparian landscapes was developed. The Agricultural Riparian Classification System can identify a subset of sites for targeted research. Additionally, the distribution of agricultural riparian buffers was characterized. Although over 70 % of sites were buffered, because the statewide average buffer width was approximately 49 meters, almost 50 % of buffers could not be detected by remotely sensed data with a resolution of 30 meters. Models were developed to predict measures of stream health at a site. Buffers acted differently on instream nitrate concentration, fish IBI (FIBI), benthic IBI (BIBI), and instream physical habitat (PHI). All models indicated that nitrate source terms overshadowed any on-site buffer effects and that Confined Animal Feeding Operations and <b>pastures</b> <b>acted</b> as point sources, overwhelming non-point-source effects. Therefore, livestock best managements practices are critical for the reduction of nitrate to streams. Fish IBI, benthic IBI and physical habitat index (PHI) in the Piedmont region were unaffected by buffer presence, but benthic IBI and PHI in the Coastal Plain were affected by buffer presence, type and width. Regression tree modeling was able to delineate a range of minimum effective buffer width between 22 - 38 meters. All measures of stream health in Piedmont systems were controlled by hydrology and geomorphology. Therefore, insofar as buffers can mediate hydrologic effects on flow conditions in a stream, they may indirectly affect FIBI, and BIBI and PHI in Piedmont systems. Use of fish IBI to measure success of buffer installation or restoration would give false results...|$|R

As the density of herbivores is recognized as the key factor in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem recovery, management plans devoted to conservation of biodiversity and forage resources should work to recreate grazing conditions close to the wild ones or to impose a short-term period of ecosystem rest that allows the plant community to recover...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} soil organic phosphorus (P) mineralization observed under trees {{compared to}} pasture has {{been attributed to}} the contrasting mycorrhizal associations of the two systems but to date, little work has been conducted comparing P dynamics under different tree species with contrasting mycorrhizal associations. This study investigated rhizosphere P dynamics and P acquisition of three tree species with contrasting mycorrhizal associations (ectomycorrhizal Pinus radiata, arbuscular mycorrhizal Cupressus macrocarpa and tripartite Ecualyptus nitens) using a combination of field and controlled environment studies. Short-term field studies revealed greater acid phosphomonoesterase activity and therefore greater potential organic P mineralization under radiata pine and eucalypt compared with macrocarpa, which correlated with ectomycorrhizal colonization. Related field work revealed that the presence of pasture understory and litter {{had a significant impact on}} P dynamics. <b>Pasture</b> <b>acts</b> to increase phosphatase activity and microbial activity within the soil but with a litter layer, the increased activities are mainly above the soil in the overlying litter. A glasshouse study investigated the separate influence of mycorrhizal hyphae and roots and results showed that ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with radiata pine and eucalypt stimulated microbial activity and increased rhizosphere phosphatase activity with a concomitant decline in soil organic P. Macrocarpa and eucalypt roots exuded higher concentrations of low molecular weight organic anions compared with radiata pine which stimulated microbial activity, increased rhizosphere phosphatase activity and decreased soil organic P. A series of experiments were then conducted to further investigate the precise role of mycorrhizae in P dynamics and results showed that ectomycorrhizal colonization increased rhizosphere acid phosphomonoesterase to a greater extent than arbuscular mycorrhizae. Fluorescent staining revealed that the mycorrhizae associated with all three species had similar phosphatase production capacities. The ability of the three species to utilize organic P was investigated in two exhaustive pot experiments. Radiata pine was shown to be the best adapted to utilize organic P, especially in soils with high relative organic P contents. Eucalypt appeared to enhance soil organic P mineralization but did not take up the released inorganic P, while macrocarpa caused limited organic P mineralization compared with radiata pine and eucalypt. This work shows that ectomycorrhizal trees are best adapted to utilize organic P through increased rhizosphere phosphatase activity and stimulated microbial activity. Root exudation of LMWOAs is of higher relative importance to arbuscular mycorrhizal trees to increase microbial activity and consequently phosphatase activities when fewer hyphae are in the rhizosphere are present to produce them...|$|R
