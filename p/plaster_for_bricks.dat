40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{potential}} of using cereal ash and bottom ash waste generated from biomass combustion plants for the manufacture of stabilised bricks and sustainable masonry mortar <b>for</b> <b>brick</b> joints and <b>plaster.</b> <b>For</b> the stabilised <b>brick</b> production, the cereal ash waste and bottom ash waste were used as full substitutes for primary clay, while magnesium oxide ash {{was used as a}} partial substitute for conventional stabilisers. The blending for the production of the masonry mortar was accomplished by the partial replacement of Portland cement, quicklime or hydraulic lime with large volumes (up to 70 %) of cereal ash waste. The properties investigated under this study include material characterisation and compressive strength and durability using freeze–thaw tests. The results obtained suggest that there is potential for the manufacture of sustainable construction materials such as bricks and mortar from cereal ash, bottom ash and magnesium oxide ash waste streams...|$|R
5000|$|The museum, set in {{a medieval}} castle {{in the village of}} Castelbosco, was created by a local dairy farmer whose herd of 2,500 (some reports say 3,500) cows produce 30,000 L of milk a day, which is used to make Grana Padano cheese. The cows also produce around 100,000 kg of dung, which is {{transformed}} into methane, fertiliser for the fields, as well as raw material <b>for</b> <b>plaster</b> and <b>bricks.</b> [...] The dung is used to generate power to run the operation. The museum has a symbiotic relationship with the farm and cheesemaking facility. It is an eccentric byproduct of the huge aggregation of cows and their prodigious output of cow manure.|$|R
