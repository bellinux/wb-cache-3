However, since the late 1990s, a number of <b>positive</b> <b>changes</b> have come about and the level of combat readiness is growing greatly; since 1996, the military budget has grown more than four times - rising from 636 million dollars to 2.8 billion dollars in 2007.

40|$|<b>Positive</b> {{organizational}} <b>change</b> is a paradox. On one hand, natural human inclinations {{toward the}} positive and heliotropic tendencies foster a proclivity toward <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> in human systems. On the other hand, human beings react more strongly to negative than to positive stimuli, so the presence of negative events overshadows positive events. Paradoxically, both tendencies—toward {{the positive and}} in response to the negative— are important enablers of <b>positive</b> <b>change,</b> but because the negative usually dominates, positive factors have to be given extra emphasis for <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> to occur. The con-cept of “positive ” has created a great deal of controversy and confusion in organizational studies, spawning critics as well as promoters. The major connotations of this concept in organizational scholarship are clarified, and a way to reconcile the paradox of <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> is proposed.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to reconcile two {{perspectives on the}} impact of <b>positive</b> trait <b>change.</b> The first perspective views <b>positive</b> trait <b>change</b> as salubrious because it reflects the process of self-enhancement, whereas the second perspective views <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> as costly because it disrupts the self-verification process. We propose that benefits and costs accrue at discrete rates, such that moderate <b>positive</b> trait <b>change</b> is more beneficial than too little and too much <b>positive</b> <b>change.</b> This constitutes a Goldilocks hypothesis. Using the MIDUS longitudinal dataset (N = 1, 725) we test this hypothesis on four traits, namely, social extraversion, agentic extraversion (agency), conscientiousness, and neuroticism. The Goldilocks hypothesis was supported for social extraversion, agentic extraversion (agency), and conscientiousness. Reduction in neuroticism seemed uniformly predictive of higher well-being. Thus, not all amounts of <b>positive</b> trait <b>change</b> are beneficial. While we find no evidence for a limit to the benefits of reduced neuroticism, there is a "just right" amount of <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> in extraversion and conscientiousness that results in the highest level of well-being. Our findings suggest that non-monotonic models may be more valid in investigations of personality change and well-being...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Data on quit {{rates among}} {{diabetes}} patients are limited. PURPOSE: To find whether <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> in knowledge on smoking-related complications {{is associated with}} increased quit rates among diabetes patients. METHODS: We randomized 224 male diabetes patients into intervention groups 1 and 2. Both groups received a standard diabetic-specific smoking cessation message from a doctor. Intervention group 2 additionally received counseling. We compared the <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> in knowledge and the quit rates {{between the two groups}} at 6 months. RESULTS: <b>Positive</b> <b>change</b> in knowledge in group 2 was two times higher than that in group 1. The odds of quitting among patients who reported a posi-tive change in knowledge was 2. 65 times higher compared to those who reported no <b>positive</b> <b>change</b> in knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the knowledge of persons with diabetes about the risks of developing severe complications if they continue smoking lead...|$|R
