40|$|The Magsat {{optical bench}} has been {{designed}} and built to hold the alignment of five optical elements to deflections of 1 - 2 arcsec during orbital operation. The bench {{has been designed}} to withstand alignment changes during the launch and <b>prestabilization</b> phases of the mission. Severe weight constraints, in conjunction with the thermal and structural requirements, led to the choice of graphite-fiber-reinforced epoxy egg crate core and face sheets for the bench construction. Active temperature control was necessary to meet thermal deflection objectives, and novel kinematic mountings were required to prevent spacecraft bending from deflecting the bench...|$|E
40|$|A temperature-compensated {{resistance}} {{static strain}} gage with {{potential to be}} used to 600 C was recently developed. Gages were fabricated from specially developed palladium- 13 w/o chromium (Pd- 13 Cr) wire and platinum (Pt) compensator. When bonded to high temperature Hastelloy X, the apparent strain from room temperature to 600 C was within 400 microstrain for gages with no preheat treatment and within 3500 microstrain for gages with 16 hours <b>prestabilization</b> at 640 C. The apparent strain versus temperature relationship of stabilized PdCr gages were repeatable with the reproducibility within 100 microstrain during three thermal cycles to 600 C and an 11 hours soak at 600 C. The gage fabrication, construction and installation is described. Also, the coating system used for this compensated resistance strain gage is explained. The electrical properties of the strain sensing element and main characteristics of the compensated gage including apparent strain, drift and reproducibility are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Low-frequency high-precision laser {{interferometry}} {{is subject to}} excess laser-frequency-noise coupling via arm-length differences which is commonly mitigated by locking the frequency to a stable reference system. This approach is crucial to achieve picometer-level sensitivities in the 0. 1 -mHz to 1 -Hz regime, where laser-frequency noise is usually high and couples into the measurement phase via arm-length mismatches in the interferometers. Here we describe the results achieved by frequency stabilizing an external cavity diode laser to a quasimonolithic unequal arm-length Mach-Zehnder interferometer readout at midfringe via balanced detection. We find this stabilization scheme to be an elegant solution combining a minimal number of optical components, no additional laser modulations, and relatively low-frequency-noise levels. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is designed and constructed to minimize the influence of thermal couplings and to reduce undesired stray light using the optical simulation tool ifocad. We achieve frequency-noise levels below 100 [*][*]Hz/Hz at 1 Hz {{and are able to}} demonstrate the LISA frequency <b>prestabilization</b> requirement of 300 [*][*]Hz/Hz down to frequencies of 100 mHz by beating the stabilized laser with an iodine-locked reference.

40|$|This chapter {{recounts the}} {{evolution}} of the de jure independence of the Bank of Israel (BOI) since it was established in 1954, provides an international comparison, and assesses year-by-year changes in the bank’s de facto independence since the economic stabilization in 1985. Although no attempt is made to evaluate the year-by-year evolution of de facto independence in the pre- 1985 period, an estimate of its average level is provided as a benchmark for the latter period. Since the variability of de facto independence in the <b>prestabilization</b> era was substantially lower than following it, the average level of de facto independence before 1985 provides a reasonable summary statistic for this variable during the thirty years that culminated in the 1985 stabilization. Comparison of the average levels of de facto independence before and after 1985 reveals a quantum leap in this variable between these two broad periods. The chapter also estimates the level of de jure independence embedded in the recommendations of the 1998 Levin Commission on reform of the Bank of Israel law. A section {{near the end of the}} chapter discusses factors related to th...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{proteins}} with desired properties through genetic engineering is generally restricted by the mutations tolerance of the starting scaffold. Gain in thermostability {{is known to}} increase the robustness of proteins toward substitutions. With the aim of generating allosteric enzymes selectable by phage display, we managed to highly improve the tolerance of a TEM- 1 β-lactamase toward loop insertional mutagenesis upon stabilization. A highly diverse collection of mutants endowed with complex potential binding sites was built by insertion of random peptides and mutations in three contiguous surface loops near the active site. Stabilization {{increased the number of}} active triple mutants (6. 6 x 107) by 70 fold. The gain in stability also abolished the requirement for a stabilizing disulfide bridge in the degenerated N-terminal loop. This increase in diversity is believed to promote the selection of clones with new binding abilities that might predispose the protein to exhibit allosteric effects. Twelve clones recognizing nickel were selected by phage display and 25 % of them showed allosteric regulation upon metal ions binding. The enzyme <b>prestabilization</b> along with a possible stiffening of the scaffold did not seem to alter the selection of allosteric clones. Besides, the insertions of the stabilizing mutations in a previously described allosteric clone activated by aminoglycosides had no impact on the regulation properties of the enzyme. These results validate the choice of the stabilized TEM- 1 β-lactamase as a scaffold for engineering allosteric enzymes. (BIOL 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
40|$|Since 1987, a very {{substantial}} amount of R&D has been conducted {{in an attempt to}} develop reliable strain sensors for the measurements of structural strains during ground testing and hypersonic flight, at temperatures up to at least 2000 deg F. Much of the effort has been focused on requirements of the NASP Program. This presentation is limited to the current sensor development work and characterization studies carried out within that program. It is basically an assessment as to where we are now and what remains {{to be done in the}} way of technical accomplishments to meet the technical challenges posed by the requirements and constraints established for the NASP Program. The approach for meeting those requirements and constraints has been multi-disciplinary in nature. It was recognized early on that no one sensor could meet all these requirements and constraints, largely because of the large temperature range (cryogenic to at least 2000 deg F) and many other factors, including the most challenging requirement that the sensor system be capable of obtaining valid 'first cycle data'. Present candidate alloys for resistance-type strain gages include Fe-Cr-Al and Pd-Cr. Although they have superior properties regarding withstanding very high temperatures, they exhibit large apparent strains that must either be accounted for or cancelled out by various techniques, including the use of a dual-element, half-bridge dummy gage, or electrical compensation networks. A significant effort is being devoted to developing, refining, and evaluating the effectiveness of those techniques over a broad range in temperature and time. In the quest to obtain first-cycle data, ways must be found to eliminate the need to prestabilize or precondition the strain gage, before it is attached to the test article. It should be noted that present NASP constraints do not permit <b>prestabilization</b> of the sensor, in situ. Gages are currently being 'heat treated' during manufacture in both the wire- and foil-type resistance strain gages, and evaluation is in progress. In addition, the 'gage-on-shim' concept is being revisited. That concept will permit heat treatment of the gage during manufacture, before attachment on the test article. Also, it may permit the individual calibration of each gage regarding gage factor and apparent strain. Candidate alloys for the NASP include titanium metal-matrix and carbon-carbon composites. Although those materials have very attractive properties at elevated temperatures in terms of strength and weight, they pose significant attachment problems. Methods for making reliable strain gage and thermocouple attachments to them are currently under development. Experience to date indicates that Rokide attachment of the sensor directly to the protective coating is easier than to the base material itself. However, interpreting strain data from gages attached in this way may prove difficult because of possible cracks in the coating that form 'islands' and the mobility of those 'islands'. It is concluded, therefore, that major technical challenges lie ahead as we proceed to meet the stringent strain sensor requirements and constraints of the NASP Program...|$|E
