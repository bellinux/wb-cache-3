40|$|The {{increasing}} {{world population}} with their growing consumption of goods escalates {{the issue of}} sustainability concepts with increasing demands in recycling technologies. Recovery of <b>post-consumer</b> packaging <b>waste</b> is a major topic in this respect. However, contamination with odorous constituents currently curtails the production of recycling products that meet the high expectations of both consumers and industry. To guarantee odor-free recyclates, the main prerequisite is to characterize the molecular composition of the causative odorants in <b>post-consumer</b> plastic packaging <b>waste.</b> However, targeted characterization of odorous trace contaminants among an abundance of volatiles is a major challenge and requires specialized and high-resolution analytical approaches. For this aim, <b>post-consumer</b> packaging <b>waste</b> was characterized by sensory analysis and two-dimensional high resolution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and olfactometry. The 33 identified odorants represent various structural classes {{as well as a}} great diversity of smell impressions with some of the compounds being identified in plastics for the first time. Substances unraveled within this study provide insights into sources of odorous contamination that will require specific attention in the future in terms of screening and prevention in recycling products...|$|R

40|$|<b>Post-consumer</b> <b>wastes,</b> such as WEEE (Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment), HW (Household Waste) and ASR (Automotive Shredder Residue), can be {{considered}} an important resource of polyolefins. Such wastes are composed of a complex mixture of different materials. Recoverable high purity polyolefins are difficult to select mainly for two reasons: i) {{the complexity of the}} waste mixtures, characterized by the presence of different polymers and other polluting materials (wood aluminium, copper, stone, glass, etc), ii) the similar physical attributes (density) of potypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). A new quality control strategy has been developed, based on the different melting points of the two target polyolefin's (PP and PE). In particular, an innovative and specialized device has been designed and realized. Several tests have been carried out according to different process parameters in order to define the best operative conditions to realize PE and PP recognition and separation.

Two Scottish collection schemes are utilised as case studies throughout. The thesis summarises current practice in post-consumer plastics recycling and describes the processes associated with it. It also presents a summary of legislation relevant to plastics recycling in the UK, EC and US in particular. The thesis includes a quantitative survey of 500 members of the public that analyses their recycling behaviour and factors that affect motivation. It also looks at public perceptions of plastics. This is complemented by a qualitative study of plastics recyclers that examines recycling routines in more detail, and explores issues that affect the participation, and quality of donation, of individuals. The evaluation of post-consumer plastics recycling schemes is discussed, and models are developed in order to assessth eir financial viability. The lessons gained from this programme of research are then summarised in a policy framework...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines <b>post-consumer</b> textile <b>waste</b> {{from the}} fashion industry's perspective, and addresses how business model innovation can facilitate reuse and recycling of garments and a transition towards a circular economy of fashion. Focusing on the emerging reuse and recycling practices of fashion brands the study builds upon one explorative and two in-depth {{case studies of}} industry pioneers and their endeavors of integrating reuse and recycling activities in their business models. Theoretically the study rests on business models, business model innovation for sustainability and circular economy. The study seeks to provide a unique contribution as it synthesizes the theoretical and empirical insights {{from the field of}} business model innovation and circular economy in the context of <b>post-consumer</b> textile <b>waste.</b> By highlighting and extending the idea of business model innovation for circular economy it makes a justification that product end-of-life phases require attention and can include new value propositions that companies can create, deliver and capture. This dissertation contains three articles, each of which contributes to an improved understanding of <b>post-consumer</b> textile <b>waste</b> management {{in the context of the}} fashion industry and its related opportunities and challenges. The findings cover both broad industry-level and more specific company-level discoveries. The industry-level findings provide a general understanding of existing practices among fashion companies while the company specific findings identify key issues and challenges of integrating a productâ€™s end-of-life aspects in an existing business model. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that end-of-life management of products is an emerging field among fashion companies and used garments can provide new value propositions for fashion brands. The findings also illustrate that the field is in its infancy and lacks best practices within business models, supply chain infrastructure, technological solutions and consumer engagement. Transition towards a circular economy implies full systemic change, and innovation not only in business models, but also in technologies, society, policies and finance methods as well as consumer behavior. None of these aspects can work in isolation and require that different stakeholders work in tandem...|$|R

40|$|More than 12 {{billion tons}} of {{industrial}} waste (wet basis) are generated annually in the United States (EPA, 1988 a,b; Allen and Jain, 1992). Municipal solid <b>waste,</b> which includes <b>post-consumer</b> <b>wastes,</b> is generated {{at a rate of}} 0. 2 billion tons per year (EPA, 1990). When these material flows are compared to the annual output of the top 50 commodity chemicals (0. 3 billion tons per year; Chemical and Engineering News, 1993), it is apparent that wastes should not be ignored as a potential resource. As a potential resource, however, industrial waste streams are significantly underutilized. Virtually all industrial waste that is designated as non-hazardous is sent to surface impoundments or landfills. Recycling rates for hazardous wastes are also quite low and tend to focus on solvents and metals (Baker et al., 1992). It could be argued that these low rates of material reuse are due to the inherently low value of the materials in the waste streams, however, after examining detailed data on the composition of industrial hazardous waste streams, my research group has concluded that many waste streams really are potential raw materials that are significantly underutilized. In a study focussed primarily on metals, we determined that many materials are present in waste stream at concentration levels that should allow near complete recovery. Yet, as shown in Table 1...|$|R
40|$|Polyolefins can be {{considered}} {{as one of the most}} important polymers for consumer goods being polyethylene (PE) and polyropylene (PP) the most commonly utilized. Even if <b>post-consumer</b> <b>wastes</b> could {{be considered}} as a good resource of polyolefins, their recovery and recycling is very low. The reason can be mainly attributed to the complexity of these wastes according to different polymers (rubber, foam, etc) and polluting (not polymers) materials (wood, aluminium, copper, stones, glass, etc) commonly present in plastic waste streams. In this paper two innovative sensing technologies, and related detection architectures, in order to develop new sorting strategies for pure PP and PE recovery from mixed waste, are presented and discussed. The first one based is on an hyperspectral imaging (HSI) approach and the second one is based on differential melting point (DMP) approach. HSI was investigated to evaluate the possibilities of this technology to determine the quality of waste plastic feed (in terms of presence and characteristics of polyolefin and contaminants). The DMP technology was developed to utilize the different PE and PP particles melting characteristics to perform their quality control as resulting from magnetic density separation (MDS), Results showed as both the approaches can be profitably utilized to develop reliable detection and/or processing architectures and related quality control strategies to implement inside the different sections of a plastic waste recycling plant...|$|R
