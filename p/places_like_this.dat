500|$|On December 3, 2009, Rollins {{wrote of}} {{his support for}} the victims of the Bhopal {{disaster}} in India, in an article for Vanity Fair 25 years–to the day–after the methyl isocyanate gas leak from the Union Carbide Corporation's pesticide factory exposed {{more than half a million}} local people to poisonous gas and resulted in the death of 17,000. He spent time in Bhopal with the people, to listen to their stories. In a later radio interview in February 2010 Rollins summed up his approach to activism, [...] "This is where my anger takes me, to <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> not into abuse but into proactive, clean movement." ...|$|E

Investigation and experiment cannot be carried on without more appliances than one has here--though I have attempted it a little." ...|$|E

60|$|Depression returned. It was {{impossible}} to fight against it in this beast of a barn. The place was like a sepulchre. No one but a fool of a butler would have suggested it as a trysting-place. He wondered irritably why <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> were allowed {{to get into this}} condition. If people wanted a barn earnestly enough to take the trouble of building one, why was it not worth while to keep the thing in proper repair? Waste and futility! That was what it was. That was what everything was, if you came down to it. Sitting here, for instance, was a futile waste of time. She wouldn't come. There were a dozen reasons why she should not come. So what was the use of his courting rheumatism by waiting in this morgue of dead agricultural ambitions? None whatever--George went on waiting.|$|E
6000|$|She {{took him}} to the obvious [...] "sights"--the Treasury, the Monument, the Corcoran Gallery, the Pan-American Building, the Lincoln Memorial, with the Potomac beyond it and the Arlington hills and the columns of the Lee Mansion. For all his {{willingness}} to play there was over him a melancholy which piqued her. His normally expressionless eyes had depths to them now, and strangeness. As they walked through Lafayette Square, looking past the Jackson statue at the lovely tranquil facade of the White House, he sighed, [...] "I wish I'd had a shot at <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> When I was in the U., I had to earn part of my way, and when I wasn't doing that or studying, I guess I was roughhousing. My gang were a great bunch for bumming around and raising Cain. Maybe if I'd been caught early and sent to concerts and all that----Would I have been what you call intelligent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I heard a faint clear rifle shot. Then another, and a fainter yell. We {{stood there}} and counted eleven more shots. Then the bay of the hounds seemed to grow closer. We had little time {{to pick and choose}} stands. I had yet to reach the end of the ridge--a task {{requiring}} seven-league boots. But I took time to choose the best possible stand for R.C. and that was one where a bear approaching from only the east along under the ridge could surprise him. In bad <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> we always tried to have our minds made up what to do and where to get in case of being charged by a wounded grizzly. In this instance there was not a rock or a tree near at hand. [...] "R.C. you'll have to stand your ground and kill him, that's all," [...] I declared, grimly. [...] "But it's quiet. You can hear a bear coming. If you do hear one--wait--and make sure your first shot lets him down." ...|$|E
