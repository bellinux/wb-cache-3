40|$|An {{extraction}} {{technique of}} the small signal equivalent circuit parameters of GaAs MESFET packaged transistor and their dependence on both bias and temperature are presented. This method is based on four steps which are: 1) extrinsic elements (package elements not included) are extracted from S parameters measurements of the transistor biased under cold and <b>pinch-off</b> <b>condition,</b> 2) package effects parameters are then determined through optimisation from S parameters measurements of the transistor under <b>pinch-off</b> <b>condition,</b> 3) the optimal extrinsic parameters, including package parameters, are searched through optimization algorithm from S parameters measurements of the transistor biased at normal condition (hot transistor) using the starting values already obtained. This step allows us to obtain independent intrinsic elements of frequency and finally 4) the temperature and bias-dependent intrinsic elements are directly extracted from multi-bias S parameters measurement over a wide rang of temperature (from - 30 ºC to + 70 ºC). The validity of the proposed method and the small signal model is verified by comparing the simulated wide band S parameters, over a wide bias and temperature range, with measured data of a GaAs MESFET transistor...|$|E
40|$|The {{extrinsic}} {{input and}} output capacitances of the field effect transistor small-signal equivalent circuit are typically extracted from the low frequency admittance parameters under ‘‘cold’’ <b>pinch-off</b> <b>condition.</b> Despite that, these two capacitances {{play a significant role}} also at high frequencies. Intuitively, a first hint of explanation stems from the high frequency reduction of their admittance values connected in parallel to the input and the output {{of the rest of the}} equivalent circuit. In particular, the extrinsic capacitances can cause an increase of the real parts of the impedance parameters at high frequencies. This article is aimed at developing an extensive experimental and mathematical analysis based on a comparative study of this behavior for GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) devices up to the millimeter-wave range. The results of this analysis can be applied for estimating the extrinsic capacitances. The main benefit of this modeling technique is that the extrinsic output capacitance can be separated from the intrinsic output capacitance, which can play a significant role especially in case of large devices...|$|E
40|$|With {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the electrical and optical properties of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs in the breakdown regime. By means of a wide set of measurements carried out at different voltage and current conditions, we show that: (i) when HEMTs are biased in <b>pinch-off</b> <b>conditions,</b> and in current-controlled mode, they can reach a non-destructive breakdown condition; (ii) during non-destructive breakdown devices emit a weak luminescence signal, in proximity of the drain edge; (iii) breakdown voltage (BDV) has a non-monothonic dependence on the gate voltage level and on temperature...|$|R
40|$|Degradation {{mechanisms}} in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors {{have been studied}} under <b>pinch-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> Sites of localized emission of electroluminescence (EL) {{in the form of}} hotspots, known to be related to gate leakage currents, are shown {{to be the result of}} the generation of non-radiative recombination centers in the AlGaN device layer during device stress. EL from the hotspot site contains both hot-carrier emission from the acceleration of charge carriers in the device channel and defect-related transitions. Gate leakage through the generated centers is the most likely mechanism for the observation of EL hotspots...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} device {{performance}} {{and reliability of}} our 3 " GaN HEMT technology. AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures are grown on semi-insulating SiC substrates by MOCVD with sheet resistance uniformities better than 3 %. Device fabrication is performed using standard processing techniques involving both e-beam and stepper lithography. The process technology exhibits an excellent uniformity across a single wafer as well as high reproducibility between individual wafers of the same or a different batch. Loadpull mapping of 8 x 400 µm gate periphery devices with 0. 5 µm gate length across all 21 cells on entire 3 -inch wafers yields a PAE of (60 ± 2) % with only 2 % scatter of the mean PAE from wafer to wafer. AlGaN/GaN HEMT's demonstrate superior high-voltage stability and large efficiencies. Devices with 0. 5 µm gate length exhibit two-terminal gate-drain breakdown voltages in excess of 160 V and drain currents well below 1 mA/mm when biased at 80 V drain bias under <b>pinch-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> Load-pull measurements at 2 GHz return both a linear relationship between drain bias voltage and output power as well as power added efficiencies beyond 60 % up to 80 V drain bias. At 88 V an output power density of 15 W/mm with 24 dB linear gain is obtained. Reliability tests indicate a promising device stability under both radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) stress conditions...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, AIGaN/GaN high {{electron}} mobility transistors (HEMTs) have been intensively studied for high frequency high power applications. In spite of this great interest, device reliability is still an important challenge for the wide deployment of AIGaN/GaN HEMT technology. To fully understand reliability in these devices, {{it is necessary to}} consider the electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of the operating AIGaN/GaN transistors. Since AIGaN and GaN are both piezoelectric materials, the coupling among electric field, lattice heating and mechanical characteristics gives rise to large changes in strain field and elastic energy density in the transistors under the <b>pinch-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> Most previous work have studied the inverse piezoelectric effect on device degradations, however, quantitative analysis of this failure mechanism is still needed. In this thesis, we have developed the first fully-coupled electro-thermo-mechanical simulation of AIGaN/GaN HEMTs to study the correlation between the critical voltages of the gate current degradation and the lattice temperature distributions of these devices under the reverse-gate-bias reliability testing. In addition, we have compared the numerical results of our simulations with DC measurements and high resolution thermo-reflectance images, obtaining excellent agreement for both of them. Moreover, our studies suggest a covenient and low-cost way to obtain the reliability characteristics of AIGaN/GaN HEMTs by using the thermo-reflectance measurements of the lattice temperature distributions for those devices. by Feng Gao.

40|$|International audienceGaN based {{technologies}} are promising {{in terms of}} electrical performances for power and high frequencies applications and their reliability assessment remains a burning issue. Thus, {{a good understanding of}} their degradation mechanisms is required to warranty their reliability. In this paper, an electrical parasitic effect has been observed on the gate-source diode forward characteristics of a set of devices under HTRB stress carried out at 175 °C up to 4000 h. This parasitic effect has been attributed to lateral surface conduction and correlated with EL signature under diode forward biasing conditions but not under transistor <b>pinch-off</b> biasing <b>conditions.</b> Then, physical analyses have pointed out the formation and growing over time of pits and cracks at the gate edge on the drain sid...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} study of epitaxial growth, processing technology, device performance {{and reliability of}} our GaN HEMTs and MMICs manufactured on 3 inch SiC substrates. Epitaxy and processing are optimized for both performance and reliability. The deposition of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT epitaxial structures is designed for low background carrier concentration and a low trap density in order to simultaneously achieve a high buffer isolation and low DC to RF dispersion. Device fabrication is performed using standard processing techniques involving both electron-beam and stepper lithography. Gate lengths of 250 nm and 500 nm are employed for 10 GHz and 2 GHz applications, respectively. The developed HEMTs demonstrate excellent high-voltage stability, high power performance and large power added efficiencies. Devices exhibit two-terminal gate-drain breakdown voltages in excess of 160 V (current criterion 1 mA/mm) across the entire 3 inch wafer with parasitic gate and drain Currents well below 1 mA/mm when biased up to 80 V drain bias under <b>pinch-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> Load-Pull measurements at 2 GHz on 800 pm gate width devices return a well-behaved relationship be-tween bias-voltage and output-power as well as power-added-efficiencies beyond 60 % up to U-DS = 100 V. For a drain bias of 100 V an output-power-density around 22 W/mm with 26 dB linear gain is obtained. On large devices (32 mm ate width packaged in industry-standard ceramic packages) an output power beyond 100 W is achieved with a PAE above 50 % and a linear gain around 15 dB. Dual-stage MMICs in microstrip transmission line technology yield a power added efficiency of 40 % at 8. 56 GHz for a power level of I I W. A single-stage MMIC yields a PAE of 46 % with 7 W of output power at V-DS = 28 V. Reliability is tested on HEMT devices having a gate periphery of 8 x 60 pin as an operating bias of 50 V under both DC and RF conditions. About 10 % drain-current change under DC-stress (50 mA/mm) is observed after more than 1000 h of operation with an extrapolated drain-current degradation below 20 % after 200000 h (more than 20 years) of operation. Under RF stress (2 GHz, I dB compression) the observed change in output power density is below 0. 2 dB after more than 1000 It...|$|R
40|$|The electromigration-induced shape {{evolution}} of two-dimensional vacancy islands on a crystal surface is studied using a continuum approach. We consider the regime where mass transport {{is restricted to}} terrace diffusion {{in the interior of}} the island. In the limit of fast attachment/detachment kinetics a circle translating at constant velocity is a stationary solution of the problem. In contrast to earlier work [O. Pierre-Louis and T. L. Einstein, Phys. Rev. B 62, 13697 (2000) ] we show that the circular solution remains linearly stable for arbitrarily large driving forces. The numerical solution of the full nonlinear problem nevertheless reveals a fingering instability at the trailing end of the island, which develops from finite amplitude perturbations and eventually leads to <b>pinch-off.</b> Relaxing the <b>condition</b> of instantaneous attachment/detachment kinetics, we obtain non-circular elongated stationary shapes in an analytic approximation which compares favorably to the full numerical solution.
