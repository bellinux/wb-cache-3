6000|$|On Sundays {{he would}} {{sometimes}} preach before such Unitarian congregations, within walking distance, as cared to hear him. But {{as he would}} take no pay for his services his preaching contributed nothing toward {{the support of his}} family. Lloyd, who was epileptic and subject to moody variation in his attachments, was but an irregular housemate after the first few months, and his contribution to the household expenses was correspondingly uncertain. The future looked so dark in October, 1797, that in spite of misgivings and former scruples he had concluded that he [...] "must become a Unitarian minister, as a less evil than starvation." [...] Accordingly he was in Shrewsbury in January, 1798, preaching in the Unitarian church and on the point of accepting the pastorate at a salary of £150 a year, when the sky brightened in another quarter. Thomas and Josiah Wedgwood, sons of the famous potter and friends of Thomas Poole, offered him an equal sum annually as a free gift. They were wealthy men, well able to afford it; they attached no condition to the gift except that he should devote himself entirely to the study of poetry and philosophy, which was precisely what he wanted to do; and he was not long in determining to accept the offer. [...] "I accepted it," [...] he wrote to Wordsworth while still at Shrewsbury, [...] "on the presumption that I had talents, honesty, and propensities to <b>perseverant</b> effort." [...] The propensities, alas, remained propensities, never acquiring the force of habit. The pension, however, continued to be paid in full until 1812, when Josiah Wedgwood withdrew his half of it. The other half, upon the death of Thomas Wedgwood in 1805, had been secured to Coleridge for life; and this annuity must have constituted the chief reliance of Mrs. Coleridge for many years.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after my}} return from Germany I was {{solicited}} {{to undertake the}} literary and political department in the Morning Post; and I acceded to the proposal {{on the condition that}} the paper should thenceforwards be conducted on certain fixed and announced principles, and that I should neither be obliged nor requested to deviate from them in favour of any party or any event. In consequence, that journal became and for many years continued anti-ministerial indeed, yet with a very qualified approbation of the opposition, and with far greater earnestness and zeal both anti-Jacobin and anti-Gallican. To this hour I cannot find reason to approve of the first war either in its commencement or its conduct. Nor can I understand, with what reason either Mr. Perceval, (whom I am singular enough to regard as the best and wisest minister of this reign,) nor the present Administration, can be said to have pursued the plans of Mr. Pitt. The love of their country, and <b>perseverant</b> hostility to French principles and French ambition are indeed honourable qualities common to them and to their predecessor. But it appears to me as clear as the evidence of the facts can render any question of history, that the successes of the Perceval and of the existing ministry have been owing to their having pursued measures the direct contrary to Mr. Pitt's. Such for instance are the concentration of the national force to one object; the abandonment of the subsidizing policy, so far at least as neither to goad nor bribe the continental courts into war, till the convictions of their subjects had rendered it a war of their own seeking; and above all, in their manly and generous reliance on the good sense of the English people, and on that loyalty which is linked to the very [40] heart of the nation by the system of credit and the interdependence of property.|$|E

5000|$|Bamboo, {{one of the}} [...] "Four Gentlemen" [...] (bamboo, orchid, plum blossom and chrysanthemum), plays such an {{important}} role in traditional Chinese culture that it is even regarded as a behavior model of the gentleman. As bamboo has features such as uprightness, tenacity, and hollow heart, people endow bamboo with integrity, elegance, and plainness, though it is not physically strong. Countless poems praising bamboo written by ancient Chinese poets are actually metaphorically about people who exhibited these characteristics. According to laws, an ancient poet, Bai Juyi (772-846), thought that to be a gentleman, a man {{does not need to be}} physically strong, but he must be mentally strong, upright, and <b>perseverant.</b> Just as a bamboo is hollow-hearted, he should open his heart to accept anything of benefit and never have arrogance or prejudice.Bamboo is not only a symbol of a gentleman, but also plays {{an important}} role in Buddhism, which was introduced into China in the first century. As canons of Buddhism forbids cruelty to animals, flesh and egg were not allowed in the diet. The tender bamboo shoot (sǔn筍 in Chinese) thus became a nutritious alternative. Preparation methods developed over thousands of years have come to be incorporated into Asian cuisines, especially for monks. A Buddhist monk, Zan Ning, wrote a manual of the bamboo shoot called [...] "Sǔn Pǔ筍譜" [...] offering descriptions and recipes for many kinds of bamboo shoots.Bamboo shoot has always been a traditional dish on the Chinese dinner table, especially in southern China.In ancient times, those who could afford a big house with a yard would plant bamboo in their garden.|$|E

At noon, Jia ate steamed buns and drank two mouthfuls of tap water and had a short break lying on a wooden board cushioned with two pieces of newspapers, and resumed interviews in the afternoon. The most miserable case was that one day in order to find a witness, Jia set out at 6:00 A.M. and rode bicycle from Bawangfen to Summer Palace, and to Xiang Mountain, and returned to Shichahai in downtown Beijing. When he finally caught that witness, it was over 20:00 P.M Liu Bao'an (...) was a coworker of Pu Yi in Beijing Botanical Garden. In order to find Liu, Jia walked two circles around the county of Penglai in Shandong Province and finally arrived at the geracomium where Liu was living. Liu once served in the Korean War and got quite excited when meeting Jia, saying that Jia {{was the first person to}} see him in the geracomium. Liu gave Jia a lot of original letters (including the precious envelopes) written by Pu Yi. These letters were strong proof that Chairman Mao did meet with Pu Yi. The exact date and time of their meeting could be found in the letters, thus solving a long disputable question in the research of Pu Yi. Jia Yinghua was quite <b>perseverant.</b> In 40 years, he never stopped interviewing all witnesses who stayed with Pu Yi and kept audio records of most interviews.

5000|$|During {{the nine}} plague {{outbreaks}} in Kurdistan and Azerbaijan between 1946 and 1965, many infected people survived {{from the disease}} by {{the efforts of the}} dispatched teams of Pasteur Institute of Iran; however, 156 died. In 1952, the first plague laboratory was founded in Akanlu village, near the epicenter of plague in Kurdistan, Iran, on a piece of land bestowed by Manuchehr Gharagozlou, an Iranian friend of Dr. Baltazard. At this research center, currently called [...] "The Research Center for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases", Dr. Baltazard and his <b>perseverant</b> colleagues conducted extensive research on plague and established this center as one of the international references for plague. Since 1952, research teams could base themselves in the area {{for months at a time}} and conduct detailed research on rodents under more favorable conditions. They were no longer required to carry their equipment throughout their missions. During those years, the integration of field and laboratory collaborations was a key to effective epidemiological actions and led to great research hypotheses. The extensive research by the teams of Pasteur Institute of Iran showed that rodents of the two types Meriones Persicus and Meriones libycus were the main natural reservoirs, unlike their resistance to plague; accordingly, they first proposed that the main reservoir of a disease should be sought amongst the most resistant, not the most sensitive, and such a theory is now accepted as a scientific fact. They also presented their scientific qualifications by publishing several scientific articles. During the development of this research center, many international scientists visited the center, lecturing, studying and/or researching in their fields. In particular, Dr. Xavier Misonne, a Belgian rodentologist who investigated rodent life in Iran [...] and Dr. Jean Marie Klein, an entomologist, who conducted extensive research on fleas in the Akanlu center, played important roles. In addition, the aerial photographs of Kurdistan and Hamadan were obtained from Iran's army and rodents' locations and the infection were mapped and reported and the first foundations of GIS were set.
