5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in <b>Paris</b> <b>for</b> almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus {{stayed with}} Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), {{when he left}} the house to return to Sweden.

On the way home, he stayed in <b>Paris</b> <b>for</b> about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year Ingres sought to capitalise {{on the success}} of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in <b>Paris</b> <b>for</b> Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.|$|E

The couple were married the following year, and would remain together until Leonard's death in 1997. Following their marriage, the pair moved to Washington, D.C. for Leonard's work. Sagan also worked part-time teaching cooking classes to the wives of US Congressmen.|$|E

Becket had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There {{is some evidence that}} Pope Alexander III had a hand in Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E
