5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{close-up}} imaging and mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries were made during Galileos <b>primary</b> <b>mission.</b> Galileo observed {{the effects of a}} major eruption at Pillan Patera and confirmed that volcanic eruptions are composed of silicate magmas with magnesium-rich mafic and ultramafic compositions. Distant imaging of Io was acquired for almost every orbit during the <b>primary</b> <b>mission,</b> revealing large numbers of active volcanoes (both thermal emission from cooling magma on the surface and volcanic plumes), numerous mountains with widely varying morphologies, and several surface changes that had taken place both between the Voyager and Galileo eras and between Galileo orbits.|$|E
5|$|From 2004 to 2 November 2009, {{the probe}} {{discovered}} and confirmed eight new satellites. Its <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> ended in 2008 when the spacecraft had completed 74orbits around the planet. The probe's mission {{was extended to}} September 2010 and then extended again to 2017, to study a full period of Saturn's seasons.|$|E

5|$|The 27th Special Operations Wing (27 SOW) {{is located}} at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. Its <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> {{includes}} infiltration, exfiltration and re-supply of special operations forces; air refueling of special operations rotary wing and tiltrotor aircraft; and precision fire support. These capabilities support a variety of special operations missions including direct action, unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, personnel recovery, psychological operations and information operations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> of a {{loitering}} munition {{is reaching}} the suspected target area, target acquisition during a loitering phase, {{followed by a}} suicide strike, and the munition is optimized in this regard in terms of characteristics (e.g. very short engine life time, silence in strike phase, speed of strike dive, optimization toward loitering time instead of range/speed) and unit cost (appropriate for a one-off strike mission).|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{completion}} of its <b>primary</b> <b>mission,</b> proposals were made to further utilize the spacecraft.

5|$|According to Russian sources, the {{official}} decision to launch Sputnik 2 {{was made on}} 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft. Sputnik 2, therefore, {{was something of a}} rush job, with most elements of the spacecraft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar irradiance and cosmic rays.|$|E

5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E
5|$|As {{the program}} (and PAVN air defences) evolved, {{so did the}} relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> equipment and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{stood out}} of Hampton Roads on 11 September 1952 and arrived at Yokosuka on 17 October. Vice Admiral Joseph J. Clark, {{commander}} of the 7th Fleet, brought his staff onboard on 19 October. Her <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> was to provide seagoing artillery support by bombarding enemy targets in the Chaho-Tanchon area, at Chongjin, in the Tanchon-Sonjin area, and at Chaho, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Hungnam during the period 25 October through 2 January 1953.|$|E

5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company had {{defeated}} {{the vanguard of}} Nakai's force and stopped his advance down the Markham Valley dead in its tracks. The Battle of Kaiapit accomplished Vasey's <b>primary</b> <b>mission,</b> for the Japanese could no longer threaten Nadzab. It opened {{the gate to the}} Ramu Valley for the 21st Infantry Brigade, provided new forward fighter airstrips for the air war against the Japanese, and validated the Australian Army's new training methods and the organisational emphasis on firepower.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{victory at}} Kaiapit enabled the Australian 7th Division to be flown {{in to the}} upper Markham Valley. It {{accomplished}} the 7th Division's <b>primary</b> <b>mission,</b> for the Japanese could no longer threaten Lae or Nadzab, where a major airbase was being developed. The victory also led to the capture of the entire Ramu Valley, which provided new forward fighter airstrips for the air war against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and remote control features, their <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|... 1 September 1945: Detachments were {{maintained}} at Peleliu Airfield, Falalop Airfield and NAS Agana. <b>Primary</b> <b>missions</b> conducted consisted of air-sea rescue work, anti-mine sweeps and leaflet drops on bypassed Japanese held islands.|$|R
50|$|Long Range Surveillance Units (LRSU) {{have four}} <b>primary</b> <b>missions</b> and five {{secondary}} missions as per FM 3-55.93 Long Range Surveillance Unit Operations. The five <b>primary</b> <b>missions</b> are surveillance, zone and area reconnaissance, target acquisition, and target interdiction. Combat assessment/battle damage assessment is mentioned as not a standalone LRSU mission but inherent to all LRSUs. The five secondary missions {{are able to}} be completed if given the proper training and time to coordinate. The secondary missions include route reconnaissance, emplacement and recovery of sensors, pathfinder operations, personnel recovery and combat search and rescue, and chemical detection and radiological surveillance and monitoring operations.|$|R

5|$|IGN {{wrote that}} the game's story and environments {{remained}} {{in the background and}} were ultimately forgettable, {{or in the case of}} the former, a hindrance, especially when the scenes could not be skipped on later replays. By the same token, predecessors such as Lara Croft Go hid treasures in its background such that players would revisit its levels, but Deus Ex Go had little to interest players besides its <b>primary</b> <b>mission.</b> The game's sole challenge of completing the puzzle in the fewest moves, GameSpot explained, quickly became uninteresting. Gamezebo reviewer instead faulted the series and wrote that after three games, its formula felt repetitive. TouchArcade concluded that, unlike the other Go games, Deus Ex Go was less creative overall and did not subvert the themes of its parent series quite like the others.|$|E
5|$|In late October, the 102d {{departed}} Logan for Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base, Phalsbourg, France. The wing had 82 Sabres, {{plus two}} C-47 Skytrains and six T-33 Shooting Stars for support and training purposes. During the crisis, the wing controlled the 102d Tactical Fighter Group, the 104th Tactical Fighter Group, and the 174th Tactical Fighter Group from New York. The 102d's <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> {{was to provide}} close air support to NATO ground forces, including the Seventh Army, and air interdiction. During the blockade, the 102d did not incur any losses. Starting on 5 December 1961 the 102d began deploying to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for gunnery training.|$|E
5|$|In the South West Pacific, a {{conventional}} strategic bombing campaign {{was out of}} the question, as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the <b>primary</b> <b>mission</b> of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.|$|E
