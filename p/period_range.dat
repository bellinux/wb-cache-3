5|$|Blacktip reef sharks have {{extremely}} small home ranges and exhibit strong site fidelity, remaining {{within the same}} local area for up to several years at a time. They are active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and have also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation <b>period</b> <b>range</b> from 7–9, through 10–11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.|$|E

500|$|During mating, {{the male}} {{grey reef shark}} will bite at the female's body or fins to hold onto her for copulation. Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac develops into a placental connection that sustains them to term. Each female has a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteruses. One to four pups (six in Hawaii) are born every other year; {{the number of young}} increases with female size. Estimates of the gestation <b>period</b> <b>range</b> from 9 to 14 months. Parturition is thought to take place from July to August in the Southern Hemisphere and from March to July in the Northern Hemisphere. However, females with [...] "full-term embryos" [...] have also been reported in the fall off Enewetak. The newborns measure [...] long.
