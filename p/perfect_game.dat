5|$|Humber {{finished}} {{the game with}} nine strikeouts; the other batters were retired with five groundouts and 13 flyouts. Humber threw only 96 pitches, making this the first <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> thrown in under 100 pitches since David Cone's <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> on July 18, 1999. Humber had only started 29 Major League games prior to throwing his <b>perfect</b> <b>game,</b> making him the pitcher with the second fewest starts prior to throwing a <b>perfect</b> <b>game,</b> behind fellow White Sox player Charlie Robertson. MLB.com has made available the video of the last out.|$|E
5|$|It was the 21st <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in MLB {{history and}} the first since Roy Halladay's <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> on May 29, 2010. It was the third <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in White Sox history (tying them with the Yankees for most perfect games) after Charlie Robertson's (who threw the only other <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in April in MLB history) on April 30, 1922 and Mark Buehrle's on July 23, 2009, and the 18th no-hitter in White Sox history (tying them with the Red Sox for second most no-hitters). It was Humber's second start of the 2012 season and first career {{complete}} game.|$|E
5|$|Only {{four days}} before Galarraga's near-perfect outing, Roy Halladay pitched a <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> for the Philadelphia Phillies, and just twenty days prior to that, Dallas Braden threw a <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> for the Oakland Athletics. Halladay's and Braden's perfect games {{had been the first}} pair of such games to occur in the same season during the modern era, let alone the same month.

5|$|This {{would have}} also {{marked the first}} <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in the Tigers' 110-year history. The 83 pitches thrown before the blown call {{would have been the}} fewest pitches in a <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> since 1908. Galarraga's near-perfect game was the first such game since Mike Mussina's bid for a <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> on September 2, 2001, which was broken up by 27th batter Carl Everett. It was also the third time for a Tigers pitcher to come so close to a <b>perfect</b> <b>game,</b> as Milt Wilcox also missed getting the 27th {{straight}} batter out on April 15, 1983, and Tommy Bridges missed the 27th batter on August 5, 1932.|$|E

5|$|In Humber's 30th career {{start in}} MLB, he pitched the 21st <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in MLB history against the Seattle Mariners on April 21, 2012. It {{was the third}} <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in White Sox history after those thrown by Charlie Robertson and Mark Buehrle, and the 18th no-hitter in White Sox history.

5|$|Bunning's <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the <b>perfect</b> <b>game.</b> Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not have come at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E

5|$|On September 9, 1965, Koufax {{became the}} sixth pitcher {{of the modern}} era, and eighth overall, to throw a <b>perfect</b> <b>game,</b> the first by a {{left-hander}} since 1880. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, setting a Major League record (subsequently broken by Nolan Ryan). Koufax struck out 14 batters, {{at the time the}} most recorded in a <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> (now tied by Matt Cain). The game also featured a quality performance by the opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley of the Cubs. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning.|$|E
5|$|Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox {{pitched a}} <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> against the Seattle Mariners by {{retiring}} all 27 batters he faced on April 21, 2012, as the White Sox defeated the Mariners 40. It was the 21st <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{history and the}} third {{by a member of}} the White Sox. It was Humber's first career complete game, although he had come close to achieving no-hitters on several occasions at several levels of organized baseball. The game was played in Seattle and broadcast regionally by Fox Sports in the two teams' metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners went hitless for {{the third}} time in {{franchise}} history and this was the first time that no Mariner reached base. However, they went on to pitch two no-hitters in 2012, both of which took place at Safeco Field and winning both games 1-0. One of them was the first <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in franchise history, by Félix Hernández, making them the first team to be on both the losing and winning end of a <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in the same season, and marking the first time two perfect games were thrown in the same park in the same season.|$|E

5|$|The twenty days between Braden's <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> and Halladay's was the {{shortest}} span between two perfect games since 1880 {{and there was}} a chance {{that for the first time}} in MLB history there would be three perfect games in such short succession. Had Galarraga's game been correctly called, the four-day span since Halladay's <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> would have broken that 130-year-old record, and marked the only time that three consecutive no-hitters had been perfect games, the only time that three perfect games had occurred in one season (since done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain and Félix Hernández), the only time that three perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a month, the only time four perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a year (as Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in July 2009), and the only time that four perfect games had occurred within a stretch of five no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox. It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw a <b>perfect</b> <b>game,</b> in 1999.|$|E

5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the ninth}} inning, Tigers' center fielder Austin Jackson {{executed}} an over-the-shoulder catch on the run to retire Cleveland's Mark Grudzielanek for the first out and preserve the <b>perfect</b> <b>game,</b> a play that has been compared to DeWayne Wise's leaping catch at the wall in the ninth-inning that preserved Mark Buehrle's <b>perfect</b> <b>game</b> in 2009. Mike Redmond grounded out to make the second out of the inning. Jason Donald then hit a soft ground ball that first baseman Miguel Cabrera had to range far to his right to retrieve. Donald was ruled safe, giving him an infield single, but video replay showed that Cabrera's throw to Galarraga, who was covering first base, beat Donald to the bag. Donald advanced to second and third base on defensive indifference during Trevor Crowe's at-bat, until Crowe grounded out to Brandon Inge, ending the game in a 3–0 victory for the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, and {{attended}} Brownwood High School in Brownwood, Texas. He played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher.
