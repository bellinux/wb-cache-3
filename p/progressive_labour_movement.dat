5|$|Bird, {{the eldest}} son of Premier Vere Bird, first entered {{politics}} in 1981 when he served as an unelected security official during the general election. In the following election in 1984, Bird and his brother Lester were both elected to the House of Representatives after the Antigua Labour Party, led by their father, took 16 of the 17 House seats. Bird himself was victorious over George Walter, leader of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Movement</b> and former Premier of Antigua and Barbuda, gaining 912 votes to Walter's 358. Upon election, with his father as Prime Minister, {{he was given the}} Ministry of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities. As Minister he visited Dominica {{at the head of a}} four-person delegation that was dispatched to reach a deal on selling Antigua and Barbuda, a country lacking natural supplies, water. This business was concluded on 16 July 1984, when it was announced that Dominica would sell Antigua and Barbuda 2 million gallons of water every 10 days, at a cost of around 3 US dollars per thousand gallons.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{applicability}} of Peter Waterman’s model of global social movement unionism as an emancipatory labour strategy in Bangladesh, an important site for the manufacture of ready-made garments in the neo-liberal era. Our main conclusions are that Waterman’s North Atlanticist model fails to comprehend the present-day necessities and struggles of the Bangladesh working class; ignores the impacts of colonialism, militarism and imperialism on Bangladesh’s socio-economic development and labour movement; and privileges democratic dialogue {{as a means of}} action when militant collective mobilization {{has been shown to be}} the only effective way to get action on workers’ issues in countries like Bangladesh. Our recommendation is for Waterman and others to abandon the quest for a universal model of <b>progressive</b> <b>labour</b> unionism and instead come up with a variety of models that apply to different typical patterns of socio-economic and <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> development in the globalized world...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the modern <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> is utilising social movement unionism as a form of organisation in the modern political economy. A multi-level analytical approach utilises a Gramscian inspired theoretical framework to look at developments at the national, regional, and global levels of the <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> in the modern global political economy. Issues at stake are i) understanding the issues affecting the <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> in the age of globalisation; ii) the degree to which social movement unionism presents the <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> a framework for renewal; iii) {{the extent to which}} key themes of social movement unionism are being implemented by those within the <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> at all levels; and iv) whether there exists at present a form of labour organisation that presents a true test for social movement unionism. This thesis adds to contemporary literature by combining analysis of existing academic debates with original primary material (a series of interviews with several key figures within the <b>labour</b> <b>movement),</b> in order that the relevancy of contemporary academic arguments for tangible developments surrounding the <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> is determined. The insights gained from these interviews are incorporated into the body of this thesis. After an outline of initial points of contextualisation in chapter one, chapter two moves to provide the theoretical framework for this research. Chapter three discusses issues of globalisation that affect the <b>labour</b> <b>movement.</b> The thesis then moves to analyse tangible issues surrounding the <b>labour</b> <b>movement,</b> with chapter four outlining the British <b>labour</b> <b>movement's</b> experiences and responses to challenges faced. Chapter five analyses the degree to which the European level presents a viable framework for the internationalisation of the <b>labour</b> <b>movement,</b> whilst chapter six shifts focus to the global level. At this point it will be argued that non-traditional labour organisations and social forums provide potential catalysts for the widespread adoption of social movement unionism. The final chapter provides concluding arguments and a revisiting of the researches main points. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceESRCGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|It had {{roots in}} a 1930s {{informal}} oppositional group within the Norwegian <b>labour</b> <b>movement.</b> The informal group {{was led by}} Håkon Meyer, and was more radical than the mainstream <b>labour</b> <b>movement.</b> On 9 April 1940 Germany invaded Norway, and subsequently occupied the country. The mainstream <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> was now engaged in fighting and opposing a German rule. However, the grouping around Håkon Meyer wanted to steer the <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> in another direction; {{taking advantage of the}} occupation to make conditions for laborers more favourable. The grouping was soon supported by some members of the radical Communist Party of Norway, and by non-partisan trade unionists such as Halvard Olsen.|$|R

40|$|This PhD Research {{examines}} the basic precept of postindustrial/ post-materialist theory, exploring {{the relationship that}} <b>labour</b> <b>movements</b> have historically played in shaping contentious politics as well as exploring the wider organizational framework upon which much of socially organized contention is arrayed today. Chapter one will seek to provide the context within which the debates of social movement and post-materialist theories are conducted today. Chapter two will take a more considered historical overview of <b>labour</b> or proletarian <b>movements</b> looking at {{the ways and means}} by which <b>labour</b> <b>movements</b> became concretized in society. Chapter three explores specific historical events that have been driven principally by working class dissent in order to determine what values and ideals drove these movements. Chapter four looks at specific examples of supervalue- laden <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> activity in the 20 th century. Chapter five investigates <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> activities under the most extreme forms of dictatorships in order to ascertain their primary motivations. Chapter six analyses some of the material and theoretical problems for the greater development of postmaterialist values within the wider <b>labour</b> <b>movements.</b> This thesis concludes with an overall assessment of the significance and utility of <b>labour</b> <b>movements</b> in the 21 st century.

50|$|The Antigua People's Party {{was a minor}} {{political}} party in Antigua and Barbuda. It began as a faction within the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Movement,</b> an opposition party founded in 1968. This faction, called the Antigua Progressive Movement, believed that the state's political parties should be separate from the trade unions. In 1969, the faction left the PLM to campaign independently. It attracted few votes at the 1971 general election, and it soon folded into the Antigua Labour Party.|$|E
50|$|Hall {{assumed the}} {{leadership}} of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Movement</b> for a second time in time for the 1980 general election, due to the electoral defeat and subsequent imprisonment of his predecessor, George Walter, on false corruption charges relating to PLM economic mismanagement. Though a free man by 1980, Walter had been barred from participating in the election. This oppression diminished the appeal of opposition parties, and Hall left the legislature in 1984, three years after the full independence of Antigua and Barbuda.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s, Hall led the Antigua and Barbuda Democratic Movement. This very loose {{political}} organisation was most {{significant for the}} role it allowed Hall {{to play in the}} creation of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Movement</b> (PLM) in 1968. After the party won four by-elections, it became Antigua and Barbuda's first parliamentary opposition party. Hall was the first leader of this party and the first Leader of the Opposition in the state, but he relinquished this role to George Walter before the 1971 general election.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{relations between}} the French Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and the <b>labour</b> <b>movements</b> of {{other countries in the}} years leading up to the First World War. The aim of the study is to examine the CGT's policy of internationalism in practice, both in relations with other <b>labour</b> <b>movements</b> and in its membership of the International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centres (between 1900 and 1914). In particular, the relationship between the French and German <b>labour</b> <b>movements</b> is explored {{in the light of the}} events of August 1914. This study shows that the relationship was a reflection of the respective positions of the French and German <b>labour</b> <b>movements</b> in the international movement. It also subjects to close scrutiny the assumption, widely made before 1914, that workers had more in common with each other than with the ruling classes of their own country, by analysing the extent of, and the reasons for internationalism and international cooperation in the <b>labour</b> <b>movement.</b> As a study of the International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centres, an organisation about which very little has previously been written, this thesis complements existing work on the international <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> prior to 1914. It also provides new insights into the French CGT by concentrating on the fundamental areas of internationalism and opposition to war, and offers fresh contributions to the continuing debate on the international <b>labour</b> <b>movement</b> and its response to the outbreak of war...|$|R
