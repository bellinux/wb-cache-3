5000|$|PlusEnergy {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Rolf Disch that {{indicates}} a structure’s extreme energy efficiency so that it holds a positive energy balance, actually producing more energy than it uses. With the completion of his private residence, the Heliotrope, in 1994, Disch had created the first PlusEnergy house. His next goal in its development was thus the mass application of the concept to residential, commercial and retail space. As the concept further developed and gained financial backing as well, Disch built several more projects with PlusEnergy certifications. “PlusEnergy is a fundamental environmental imperative,” Disch claims. [...] Disch believes that <b>passive</b> <b>building</b> is not enough because passive homes still emit CO2 into the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|PlusEnergy is a coined concept {{developed}} by Rolf Disch that indicates a structure’s extreme energy efficiency {{so that it}} holds a positive energy balance, actually obtaining more energy than it uses. With the completion of his private residence, the Heliotrope, in 1994, Disch had created the first PlusEnergy house in the world. The sheer logic of a home that captures more energy than it consumes made perfect sense to Disch. His next goal in its development was thus the mass application of the concept to residential, commercial and retail space. As the concept further developed and gained financial backing as well, Disch built several more projects with PlusEnergy certifications. PlusEnergy is a simple concept that has been materialized in a technical design. “PlusEnergy is a fundamental environmental imperative,” Disch claims. Disch believes that <b>passive</b> <b>building</b> isn’t enough because passive homes still emit CO2 into the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The energy {{consumption}} {{of a building}} not only relies on {{the way it has}} been built, but also mainly on the occupant behaviour. This idea is all the more true for buildings being constructed based on passive designs. Indeed, making ENERPOS a <b>passive</b> <b>building</b> implies that people need to be active to use it to its full capacity. For example, before turning on the ceiling fans of a classroom, the students have to open the louvres first. It seems to be common sense but as a matter of fact, people do not think about that most of the time. That is why signs are displayed in the rooms explaining how to use a classroom properly to avoid wasting energy. The purpose is to educate students (and teachers) about the way to behave and to make them realize the environmental issues at stake on Reunion Island.|$|E
