5|$|Between 1940 and 2005, the {{population}} of Juniata County was proportionally the third fastest-growing population of any county in Pennsylvania, with only Snyder County's and Perry County's populations growing faster. In this time period, the county's population has increased by 50.69%, or 7,792 people. In the 1980s, the county's rate of population growth was more than 50 {{times higher than the}} rate of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania. The county's rate of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s was even higher.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 {{the first}} railway line reached Richmond. Richmond Gasworks opened in 1848, and Richmond {{began to develop}} into a {{significant}} town. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting it to the London Underground. Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.|$|E
5|$|Somerset has few {{industrial}} centres, but it {{does have}} a variety of light industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector, resulting in an unemployment rate of 2.5%. Unemployment is lower than the national average; the largest employment sectors are retail, manufacturing, tourism, and health and social care. <b>Population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the county is higher than the national average.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, the 1950 Census showed {{growth in}} Teaneck (33.6%) pacing Bergen County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a {{substantial}} {{decline in the}} rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached the limits of developable land, and the township neared its peak population. <b>Population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) was smaller than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).|$|E
5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in urban areas. Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, {{from the beginning of the}} 21st century, the <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> urban areas is higher than in the countryside.|$|E

5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} by war, diseases and <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in the U.S. are {{estimated}} to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000. A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1989 {{there were}} four local trains in each {{direction}} from Oslo to Hønefoss; followed by on rush hour service each, but this single service has since been terminated; mainly due to quicker travel times by coaches. The Ringerike Line would allow the Oslo Commuter Rail once again to serve Ringerike; other places served usually have one hourly service, with additional services in rush hour. Reducing travel time from Hønefoss to Oslo to 30 minutes would probably cause larger <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> Ringerike.|$|E

5|$|The name King was {{not used}} again after the season, {{although}} {{it was on the}} naming list for 1951 and 1952 due to being part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. The Phonetic Alphabet was decommissioned in 1953 in favor of using female names. Based on <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> south Florida, it is estimated that a storm identical to Hurricane King would cause $2.8billion in insured damage if it struck in 2001, with the total roughly split between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.|$|E
5|$|The other {{theory to}} gain support {{was that it}} was viral {{marketing}} to promote an upcoming movie or video game.

5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, 60% of Gulfton {{residents}} were not native born and represented citizenship from forty two countries. Many {{residents were}} illegal immigrants. More than 20% of the households did not own cars. Starting in the mid-1980s, the Gulfton population experienced increases in female and children populations. Peg Purser, an urban planner who directed a 1991 University of Houston Center for Public Policy study {{commissioned by the}} Houston Chronicle, identified that the Hispanic <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the Gulfton area was almost entirely from Central American countries. According to the study, between the 1980 and 1990 U.S. Censuses, Hispanic population density increased by 3,500 persons per square mile.

5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E
5|$|Dallas and Fort Worth {{experienced}} one {{of their}} greatest oil-related construction booms in 1930 and 1931, when {{the opening of the}} East Texas oil field helped establish Dallas as the financial center for the oil industry in Texas and Oklahoma. New business offices and municipal buildings appeared in the city, including the Highland Park Village shopping center, one of the nation's earliest shopping malls. The Depression slowed <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>in</b> the Dallas area somewhat during the later 1930s, but rapid growth patterns returned again during the 1940s. By this time, though, Dallas had already begun to rediversify, becoming a center for aircraft manufacturing and electronics technology in addition to a variety of other industries.|$|E
5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain <b>population</b> <b>growth.</b> <b>In</b> 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people moving into the area, has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24. In England this age group accounts for only 7%.|$|E
