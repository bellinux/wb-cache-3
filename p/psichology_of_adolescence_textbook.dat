40|$|Historians {{agree that}} around 1900 the concept <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> was reworked, valorized, and given {{scientific}} legitimacy. In Western political, pedagogical, philanthropic, and literary circles, an understanding <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> {{as a distinct}} and universal stage of life achieved currency. However, broad studies have glossed over local differences in provision for and representations <b>of</b> <b>adolescence.</b> By comparing representations <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> drawn from voluntary provision and the workplace in two cities, Nottingham (England) and Saint-Etienne (France), this article highlights the cultural relativity of this construct, the different rhythms of its institutionalization, and the motives that led local interest groups to emphasize or underplay its significance. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

I argue that, regardless of their relative popularity and success, both Satrapi and Saroyan have not been identified in context <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> because ethnic identification continues to be a problematic issue for most American audiences, and, in particular, the non-Western portrayals <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> described by these authors interrogate Western notions <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> particularly deeply rooted concepts of teen individuality and identity...|$|R

One conspicuous property <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> is the apparently unsaturable capacity to stay up late and to sleep in.

2500|$|Adolescence (...) is a {{transitional}} stage {{of physical and}} psychological development that generally occurs {{during the period from}} puberty to legal adulthood (age <b>of</b> majority). <b>Adolescence</b> is usually associated with the teenage years, but its physical, psychological or cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later. For example, puberty now typically begins during preadolescence, particularly in females. Physical growth (particularly in males), and cognitive development can extend into the early twenties.

50|$|According to Sexual Teens, Sexual Media: Investigating Media's Influence on Adolescent Sexuality, {{adolescence}} can {{be divided}} into three different stages; early (ages 8-13 years), middle(ages 13-16 for girls, 14-17 for boys) and late (16 and older for girls, 17 and older for boys). Each stage focuses on different aspects of cognitive, physical, social and psychological development. Although not all teens develop through adolescence at the same rate the stages usually follow a specific pattern. For a teen in the early stages <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> they are in the beginning stages of puberty. In this stage <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> relationships begin to become important as well as their physical appearance. Middle adolescence is characaterized by independence from their family and increased activity with their peers. This is the stage where sexual activity may begin to occur. The last stage <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> the teenager begins to feel more secure in their bodies and their sexual behavior. With these aspects <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> in mind, media can {{play an important role in}} how teen shape their views about sexuality.|$|R
40|$|Adolescence, in {{a general}} sense, has been {{understood}} as a linear phase in human development. In this paper, we question this conception and work out the understanding <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> psyche, and human development mediated by the assumptions of cultural-historical theory. For this reflection, we adopted as a reference the theoretical and interpretive framework developed from a qualitative research carried out with health professionals on the senses and meanings <b>of</b> <b>adolescence.</b> The data analysis showed the prevalence of a naturalizedview <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> contributing to the invisibility of the concrete adolescent subjects in the educational practices in health care. As the National Adolescent and Youth Health Care Policy (2007) states on the need of educational and preventive practices with regard to this population, one understands the actions must be provided through a reflective process on adolescence and human development. Thus, these actions will be more effective if opportunities for reflection are created, taking into account multiple variables in the understanding <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> allowing us, this way, to conceive it as a social construct rather than a natural stage in human development...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an interdisciplinary}} {{examination of the}} history and theory <b>of</b> <b>adolescence.</b> I draw {{on a variety of}} materials, from both Britain and the United States, including nineteenth- and early twentieth-century newspapers and periodicals, literary texts, educational treatises, advertisements, pamphlets, and medical discourse which reveal the term and the category <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> as it has been put into service by fields like medicine, psychology, education, and public policy. Methodologically, I use this range of materials to look for patterns, tracing not only the word and concept <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> but the construction and circulation of social meanings associated with adolescence. Queer theory understands categories of gender and sexuality as unstable, shifting, malleable, contextual—and this project understands that theorized complexity as belonging to the past as well as the present, in the movement <b>of</b> <b>adolescence</b> as a term and a concept. Among constructivist studies <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> scholars often cite G. Stanley Hall's exhaustive two-volume work Adolescence (1904) as a point of origin, the beginning of what we recognize today as adolescence. This project maps out a trajectory of fragmented, multi-purposed conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> one that precedes Hall and continues after him, a mapping that brings to light the surprising movement and instability of this trajectory over time. If we understand language and meaning as having a certain flexibility, as moving with each iteration and reiteration, then my framing historical question is not whether adolescence existed in earlier centuries, but how the concept existed, and more specifically, how it existed in shifting and interconnected discourses, such as nineteenth-century American newspapers and British sex education pamphlets from the 1930 s and 40 s. This methodology allows me to speak to the perplexing question of how language constitutes social realities and modes of knowledge. My research encompasses a wide range of materials and historical moments to explore the ideological dimensions <b>of</b> <b>adolescence,</b> ones that circulate and reappear in very specific, located contexts. This project brings to light a nonlinear history that reframes present assumptions about adolescence and opens up the category as a powerful site for work in queer theory, cultural studies, and literary studies...|$|R
