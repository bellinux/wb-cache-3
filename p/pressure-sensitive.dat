5|$|Dance Dance Revolution, {{released}} in 1998, is a rhythm {{game in which}} players dance on <b>pressure-sensitive</b> pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful both in and outside Japan, unlike games such as GuitarFreaks, DrumMania and Beatmania, though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix's Bust a Groove features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional input method. The game contains competitive one-on-one battles, and grants the player more freedom than typical rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on <b>pressure-sensitive</b> nerves.|$|E
5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on <b>pressure-sensitive</b> pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius uses {{custom-made}} spike pads on the blades. Before {{development of}} the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.|$|E
5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads {{may be used as}} input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with <b>pressure-sensitive</b> pads acting as the input device.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pressure-sensitive</b> tape, PSA tape, {{adhesive}} tape, self-stick tape, or sticky tape {{consists of}} a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive coated onto a backing material such as paper, plastic film, cloth, or metal foil. The first <b>pressure-sensitive</b> tape {{took the form of}} surgical tape, invented by Dr. Horace Day in 1845.|$|E
25|$|Masking tape is a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> tape {{made with}} an easy-to-tear thin paper, and fly {{back and a}} {{removable}} <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive. In 1925, Richard G. Drew, {{an employee of the}} Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), invented the first masking tape, a two-inch-wide tan paper strip backed with a light, <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive. Drew filed U.S. patent #1,760,820 on May 28, 1928 and was issued to him on May 27, 1930.|$|E
25|$|Filament tape or {{strapping}} tape is a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> tape {{used for}} several packaging {{functions such as}} closing corrugated fiberboard boxes, reinforcing packages, bundling items, pallet utilizing, etc. It consists of a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film and fiberglass filaments embedded to add high tensile strength. Filament tape was invented in 1946 by Cyrus Woodrow Bemmels. In 1949, it {{was placed on the}} market and was an immediate success.|$|E
25|$|Adhesives and {{solvents}} {{are rarely}} used because polyethylene is nonpolar {{and has a}} high resistance to solvents. <b>Pressure-sensitive</b> adhesives (PSA) are feasible if the surface is flame treated or corona treated.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} distributions {{across the}} test model {{have historically been}} measured by drilling many small holes along the airflow path, and using multi-tube manometers to measure the pressure at each hole. Pressure distributions can more conveniently be measured {{by the use of}} <b>pressure-sensitive</b> paint, in which higher local pressure is indicated by lowered fluorescence of the paint at that point. Pressure distributions can also be conveniently measured by the use of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> pressure belts, a recent development in which multiple ultra-miniaturized pressure sensor modules are integrated into a flexible strip. The strip is attached to the aerodynamic surface with tape, and it sends signals depicting the pressure distribution along its surface.|$|E
25|$|A {{decrease}} in arterial blood pressure (that could {{be related to}} a {{decrease in}} blood volume) as detected by baroreceptors (<b>pressure-sensitive</b> cells). This is the most direct causal link between blood pressure and renin secretion (the other two methods operate via longer pathways).|$|E
25|$|Thermally {{conductive}} tape {{is one of}} the most cost-effective heat sink attachment materials. It is suitable for low-mass heat sinks and for components with low power dissipation. It consists of a thermally conductive carrier material with a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive on each side.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used as}} a film {{interface}} patch {{for sports}} and medical applications, featuring a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive backing, which is installed in strategic high friction areas of footwear, insoles, ankle-foot orthosis, and other medical devices to prevent and relieve friction-induced blisters, calluses and foot ulceration.|$|E
25|$|Edgar Allan Poe's {{birth was}} celebrated on its 200th anniversary with a 42-cent stamp on January 16, 2009, in Richmond, Virginia. Poe is {{recognized}} as one of America’s notable poets and fiction writers. Carl T. Herrman designed the stamp, Avery Dennison (AVR) printed 30 million stamps by the gravure process in <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive panes of twenty stamps.|$|E
25|$|Helicopters {{dragging}} a plow to overturn or detonate mines. This has {{the problem of}} bringing down the helicopter when the plow snags onto objects such as large rocks, but has been corrected by use of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> plow rakes which release when over-pressured. This does, however, affect its effectiveness as mines planted in hard ground or near rocks will not be detonated.|$|E
25|$|Short {{nanosecond}} {{bursts of}} X-rays peaking at 15-keV in energy may be reliably produced by peeling <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive tape from its backing {{in a moderate}} vacuum. This {{is likely to be}} the result of recombination of electrical charges produced by triboelectric charging. The intensity of X-ray triboluminescence is sufficient for it to be used as a source for X-ray imaging.|$|E
25|$|A {{method of}} {{external}} (noninvasive) fetal monitoring (EFM) during childbirth is cardiotocography, using a cardiotocograph {{that consists of}} two sensors: The heart (cardio) sensor is an ultrasonic sensor, similar to a Doppler fetal monitor, that continuously emits ultrasound and detects motion of the fetal heart by the characteristic of the reflected sound. The <b>pressure-sensitive</b> contraction transducer, called a tocodynamometer (toco) has a flat area that is fixated to the skin by a band around the belly. The pressure required to flatten {{a section of the}} wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of contraction.|$|E
25|$|FreeHand 3.0 {{sold for}} $595 in 1991. New {{features}} included resizable color, style, and layer panels including an Attributes menu. Also tighter precision {{of both the}} existing tools and aligning of objects. FH3 created compound Paths. Text could be converted to paths, applied to an ellipse, or made vertical. Carried over from version 1.0, FreeHand 3 suffered by having text entered into a dialog box instead of directly to the page. In October 1991, a 3.1 upgrade made FreeHand work with Mac OS 7 but additionally, it supported <b>pressure-sensitive</b> drawing which offered varying line widths with a users stroke. It improved element manipulation and added more import/export options.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana Purchase Bicentennial was commemorated with a 37-cent stamp {{issued on}} April 30, 2003 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Purchase doubled {{the size of}} the United States, it became one of the largest {{countries}} in the world, and the most fertile lands of the continent were opened to American settlement. It is often called the greatest real estate deal in history, “with a stroke of a pen”. The stamp was designed by Richard Sheaff and illustrated by Garin Baker. Sennett Security Products printed the stamp in gravure process in <b>pressure-sensitive</b> panes of twenty; 54 million were issued.An image of the stamp is available at Arago online at the link in the footnote.|$|E
25|$|Day-to-day {{operations}} will {{be handled}} rather {{like those of}} Docklands Light Railway, with service employees riding in some trains {{to watch out for}} disruptive passengers and unusual occurrences and to supply information to passengers. Unlike the DLR however, not every train will be accompanied by a service employee, and again unlike the DLR, service employees have no task in the actual operation of the train. Hence the grade of automation is mixed between GoA 3 - Driverless, and GoA 4 - Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Doors close automatically, supervised by light barriers and <b>pressure-sensitive</b> door edges. Only in the case of service disruptions will a service employee take over the task of driving the train. For this purpose, all service employees are fully trained drivers.|$|E
25|$|Toon Boom Animation's Toon Boom Harmony {{software}} {{was used as}} the main software package for the production of the film, as the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) system that Disney developed with Pixar in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become outdated. The Harmony {{software was}} augmented with a number of plug-ins to provide CAPS-like effects such as shading on cheeks and smoke effects. The reinstated traditional unit's first production, a 2007 Goofy cartoon short entitled How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, was partly animated without paper by using Harmony and Wacom Cintiq <b>pressure-sensitive</b> tablets. The character animators found some difficulty with this approach, and decided to use traditional paper and pencil drawings, which were then scanned into the computer systems, for The Princess and the Frog.|$|E
500|$|Reagent-grade {{potassium}} metal {{costs about}} $10.00/pound ($22/kg) in 2010 when {{purchased by the}} tonne. Lower purity metal is considerably cheaper. The market is volatile because long-term storage of the metal is difficult. It must be stored in a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent {{the formation of a}} surface layer of potassium superoxide, a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> explosive that detonates when scratched. [...] The resulting explosion often starts a fire difficult to extinguish.|$|E
500|$|A pitot-static {{system is}} a system of <b>pressure-sensitive</b> {{instruments}} that is most often used in aviation to determine an aircraft's airspeed, Mach number, altitude, and altitude trend. [...] A pitot-static system generally consists of a pitot tube, a static port, and the pitot-static instruments. Other instruments that might be connected are air data computers, flight data recorders, altitude encoders, cabin pressurization controllers, and various airspeed switches. [...] Errors in pitot-static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system, such as altitude, is potentially safety-critical. [...] Several commercial airline disasters have been traced to {{a failure of the}} pitot-static system.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{stealing}} the 'T' is prohibited and is officially punishable with expulsion, although {{this has not}} happened in practice. After a Georgia Tech visitor was accidentally killed while climbing the Alexander Memorial Coliseum in 1999, Institute President G. Wayne Clough banned stealing of the 'T' and the climbing of any Institute building, due {{to the risk of}} fatal falls and the potential for damage to the building. Clough also expressed concern over the [...] "incredibly expensive liability litigation" [...] Georgia Tech could face {{in the event of an}} accident. To discourage climbing, security features such as <b>pressure-sensitive</b> roof tiling, fiber optic cabling running throughout the letters, and an audible alarm have been added to the 'T' to help prevent its theft.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogen {{can be used}} as a replacement, or in {{combination}} with, carbon dioxide to pressurise kegs of some beers, particularly stouts and British ales, due to the smaller bubbles it produces, which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier. A <b>pressure-sensitive</b> nitrogen capsule known commonly as a [...] "widget" [...] allows nitrogen-charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles. Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns. Nitrogen must be kept at higher pressure than CO2, making N2 tanks heavier and more expensive. Nitrogen gas has become the inert gas of choice for inert gas asphyxiation, and is under consideration as a replacement for lethal injection in Oklahoma. Nitrogen gas, formed from the decomposition of sodium azide, is used for the inflation of airbags.|$|E
500|$|The ZX81 was {{designed}} to be small, simple, and above all cheap, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down. Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data were loaded and saved onto audio tape cassettes. It had only four silicon chips on board and a mere 1KB of memory. The machine had no power switch or any moving parts (with the exception of a VHF TV channel selector switch present on early [...] "ZX81 USA" [...] models and the Timex-Sinclair 1000) and used a <b>pressure-sensitive</b> membrane keyboard for manual input. The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought its designer, Rick Dickinson, a Design Council award.|$|E
500|$|The Arrow's thin wing {{required}} aviation's first [...] {{hydraulic system}} to supply enough {{force to the}} control surfaces, while using small actuators and piping. A rudimentary fly-by-wire system was employed, in which the pilot's input was detected {{by a series of}} <b>pressure-sensitive</b> transducers in the stick, and their signal was sent to an electronic control servo that operated the valves in the hydraulic system to move the various flight controls. This resulted in a lack of control feel; because the control stick input was not mechanically connected to the hydraulic system, the variations in back-pressure from the flight control surfaces that would normally be felt by the pilot could no longer be transmitted back into the stick. To re-create a sense of feel, the same electronic control box rapidly responded to the hydraulic back-pressure fluctuations and triggered actuators in the stick, making it move slightly; this system, called [...] "artificial feel", was also a first.|$|E
500|$|Video game {{publications}} and developers praised Super Mario 64 for its design {{and use of}} the 3D gameplay. The game is counted by 1UP.com {{as one of the first}} games to have brought a series of 2D games into full 3D. Maximum commented that [...] "The old 2D platform genre is essentially dead with the arrival of this game. The limitations inherent with the genre have been swept away in the wake of Mario 64." [...] In the transition to 3D, many of the series conventions were rethought drastically, placing an emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping, or [...] "hop and bop" [...] action. While its quality was disputed by some, it has been argued that it established an entirely new genre, different from that of previous games in the series. Time Magazine focused on the realistic kinetic animation and the controls provided by the integration of the new <b>pressure-sensitive</b> controller into the game, calling it the [...] "fastest, smoothest game action yet attainable via joystick at the service of equally virtuoso motion", where [...] "or once, the movement on the screen feels real".|$|E
500|$|The team quickly {{recognized}} that [...] "the controller {{really was the}} kind of magic sauce for what we wanted to do". [...] They identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made the game stand out. These aspects included the note-matching aspect and the showmanship created by the use of the whammy bar and tilting of the guitar within the game. The third key aspect was the use of Star Power [...] "to provide a little more depth to the game— some replay value, some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting the notes". Harmonix used third party controllers made for GuitarFreaks that were already on the market for development of the game until RedOctane had prepared prototypes for the Guitar Hero controller. [...] The controller initially had <b>pressure-sensitive</b> fret buttons to mimic the playing of a real guitar, but the idea was dropped as it made the gameplay too complex. [...] The idea of using the whammy bar to boost Star Power, in addition to altering the pitch of sustained notes was only realized about a month before the completion of the game. The team had spent [...] "precious development time and resources" [...] into creating a free-style model that would have allowed players to improvise during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work the feature into the existing gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Both Karate Champ and Yie Ar Kung Fu later {{provided}} {{a template for}} Capcom's Street Fighter in 1987. Street Fighter found its own niche in the gaming world, partially because many arcade game developers in the 1980s focused more on producing beat-em-ups and shoot 'em ups. Part of the game's appeal {{was the use of}} special moves that could only be discovered by experimenting with the game controls, which created a sense of mystique and invited players to practice the game, although similar controller motions used for grappling maneuvers in the earlier Brian Jacks Uchi Mata were deemed too difficult. Following Street Fighter's lead, the use of command-based hidden moves began to pervade other games in the rising fighting game genre. Street Fighter also introduced other staples of the genre, including the blocking technique as well as the ability for a challenger to jump in and initiate a match against a player at any time. The game also introduced <b>pressure-sensitive</b> controls that determine the strength of an attack, though due to causing damaged arcade cabinets, Capcom replaced it soon after with a six-button control scheme offering light, medium and hard punches and kicks, which became another staple of the genre. In 1988, Home Data released Reikai Dōshi: Chinese Exorcist, also known as Last Apostle Puppet Show, the first fighting game to use digitized sprites and motion capture animation. Meanwhile, home game consoles largely ignored the genre. [...] was one of few releases for the Sega Genesis but was not as popular as games in other genres. Technical challenges limited the popularity of early fighting games. Programmers had difficulty producing a game that could recognize the fast motions of a joystick, and so players had difficulty executing special moves with any accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|... iPhone 7's {{home button}} uses a {{capacitive}} mechanism for input {{rather than a}} physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device. Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also <b>pressure-sensitive.</b> iPhone 7 retains the [...] "3D Touch" [...] display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing <b>pressure-sensitive</b> touchscreen input.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wavelength}} of sound at 10kHz is 1.4" [...] (3.5cm). The smallest measuring microphones are often 1/4" [...] (6mm) in diameter, which practically eliminates directionality even {{up to the}} highest frequencies. Omnidirectional microphones, unlike cardioids, do not employ resonant cavities as delays, and so can be considered the [...] "purest" [...] microphones in terms of low coloration; they add very little to the original sound. Being <b>pressure-sensitive</b> they can also have a very flat low-frequency response down to 20Hz or below. <b>Pressure-sensitive</b> microphones also respond much less to wind noise and plosives than directional (velocity sensitive) microphones.|$|E
2500|$|Carpet tiles {{are also}} available, {{typically}} [...] square. These are usually only used in commercial settings and are affixed using a special <b>pressure-sensitive</b> glue, which holds them into place while allowing easy removal (in an office environment, for example) or to allow rearrangement {{in order to}} spread wear.|$|E
2500|$|Biaxially {{oriented}} PET film (often {{known by}} one of its trade names, [...] "Mylar") can be aluminized by evaporating a thin film of metal onto it to reduce its permeability, {{and to make it}} reflective and opaque (MPET). These properties are useful in many applications, including flexible food packaging and thermal insulation (such as space blankets). Because of its high mechanical strength, PET film is often used in tape applications, such as the carrier for magnetic tape or backing for <b>pressure-sensitive</b> adhesive tapes.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1996, Next Generation {{magazine}} called the Nintendo Ultra 64 the [...] "best kept secret in videogames" [...] and the [...] "world's most powerful game machine". It called the system's November 24, 1995 unveiling at Shoshinkai [...] "the most anticipated videogaming {{event of the}} 1990s, possibly of all time". Previewing the Nintendo 64 shortly prior to its launch, Time magazine praised the realistic movement and gameplay provided by the combination of fast graphics processing, <b>pressure-sensitive</b> controller, and the Super Mario 64 game. The review praised the [...] "fastest, smoothest game action yet attainable via joystick {{at the service of}} equally virtuoso motion", where [...] "or once, the movement on the screen feels real".|$|E
2500|$|The MEMS (MicroElectrical-Mechanical System) {{microphone}} is {{also called}} a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A <b>pressure-sensitive</b> diaphragm is etched {{directly into a}} silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Wolfson Microelectronics (WM7xxx) now Cirrus Logic, InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices [...] ), Akustica (AKU200x), Infineon (SMM310 product), Knowles Electronics, Memstech (MSMx), NXP Semiconductors (division bought by Knowles [...] ), Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies, and Omron.|$|E
