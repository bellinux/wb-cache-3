40|$|Parliamentarians have an incessant need far timely, authoritative, {{and current}} {{information}} {{because of the}} enormous social responsibility bestowed on them by the electorates or society. A strong information accessibility that empowers them to fulfill this responsibility effectively is therefore very significant. Essentially and traditionally, <b>parliamentary</b> <b>libraries</b> are expected to provide legislators {{with most of the}} information they need. The study aimed at determining the information sources, service and systems used in South Africa by the parliamentarians, and also to investigate the role of the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>libraries</b> in the information provision process. A survey was conducted by use of questionnaires targeting all parliamentarians in South Africa and a response rate of 23 % (167) was received. This study has revealed that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>libraries</b> are underutilized because parliamentarians use other equally competing information sources largely accessed through the internet. Further, South Africa has enormous information sources and services that legislators can access and exploit and the use of electronic sources of information is gr. owing rapidly, almost reaching the level of use of print sources. Unexpectedly, oral sources of information are used less. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>libraries</b> have a potential to offer a variety of services to parliamentarians, yet they are not well-utilized, perhaps because of reasons such as poor marketing and innovative information services. Wilson's model on information seeking has been extended by a new model proposing and explaining information-seeking strategies popular to parliamentarians in South Africa...|$|R

25|$|Many key {{leaders of}} the Rebellions would play focal roles in the {{development}} of the political and philosophical foundations for an independent Canada, something achieved on July 1, 1867. Opposition to this movement was principally represented by the somewhat aristocratic British colonial administration and their extended community, in addition to organized fraternal associations, such as the Scotch-Irish Orange Order and the Anglo-Montreal bourgeoisie of the era. The Rebellion Losses Bill was intended to both offer amnesty to former rebels (permitting them to return to Canada) and an indemnity to individuals who had suffered financial losses as a consequence of the rebellions. Though the bill was passed by the majority of those sitting in the Legislative Assembly, it remained unpopular with the Loyalist population of Montreal, who decided to use violence to demonstrate their opposition. As such, the Parliament was destroyed amidst considerable mob violence, and an invaluable collection of historical records kept in the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>library</b> lost forever.|$|E

40|$|Britain’s House of Commons and House of Lords Libraries have {{a lengthy}} history {{beginning}} with small collections {{of books and}} papers {{in the eighteenth century}} and evolving into today’s large organizations offering a sophisticated range of services. The central theme of this article is the conservatism of these institutions over most of their history, with the creation of modern library facilities only beginning in 1945 for the Commons Library (a process that did not accelerate until some three decades later) and in 1976 for the Lords. By way of comparison I will discuss: the U. S. Library of Congress (founded in 1800); Japan’s National Diet Library (created in the postwar reconstruction in 1948); and, to offer an example of a smaller country, Ireland’s Oireachtas Library.
