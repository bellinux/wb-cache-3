40|$|In recent Canterbury earthquakes, {{structures}} {{have performed}} well {{in terms of}} life safety but the estimated {{total cost of the}} rebuild was as high as $ 40 billion. The major contributors to this cost are repair/demolition/rebuild cost, the resulting downtime and business interruption. For this reason, the authors are exploring alternate building systems that can minimize the downtime and business interruption due to building damage in an earthquake; thereby greatly reducing the financial implications of seismic events. In this paper, a sustainable and demountable precast reinforced concrete (RC) frame system in which the precast members are connected via steel tubes/plates or steel angles/plates and high strength friction grip (HSFG) bolts is introduced. In the proposed system, damaged structural elements in seismic frames can be easily replaced with new ones; thereby making it an easily and quickly repairable and a low-loss system. The column to foundation connection in the proposed system can be designed either as fixed or pinned depending on the requirement of strength and stiffness. In a fixed base frame system, ground storey columns will also be damaged along with beams in seismic events, which are to be replaced after seismic events; whereas in a <b>pin</b> <b>base</b> frame only beams (which are easy to replace) will be damaged. Low to medium rise (3 - 6 storey) precast RC frame buildings with fixed and pin bases are analyzed in this paper; and their lateral capacity, lateral stiffness and natural period are scrutinized to better understand {{the pros and cons of}} the demountable precast frame system with fixed and <b>pin</b> <b>base</b> connections...|$|E

40|$|A {{steady state}} {{model of a}} {{thermoelectric}} heat pump fitted with pin fin heat exchange surfaces is developed from the equations governing the operation of a thermoelectric device and pressure drop/ heat transfer correlations for staggered tube banks in cross flow. The model computes current draw, heat pumped at the cold side, heat rejected at the hot side, hot and cold side exhaust temperatures, and hot and cold side <b>pin</b> <b>base</b> temperatures when given the following parameters: ambient temperature, thermoelectric geometry factor, number of thermocouple junctions, input voltage, pin diameter, pin height, transverse pin stagger, longitudinal pin stagger, contact resistance between the thermoelectric modules and the heat ex change surfaces, and fan performance curves for the hot and cold sides. Results of a FIDAP numerical model of a 4 row heated pin system are presented and compared to the heat transfer and pressure drop correlations chosen {{for use in the}} model. Nine tests were run with a working thermoelectric heat pump unit under various air flow and voltage input to collect data for the purpose of comparison with the model. Using empirically determined contact resistance values, the model predicted Qc (heat pumped from the cold side) values that agreed with experiment within about 10 %, Qh (heat rejected from the hot side) values that agreed with experiment within about 5 %, and current draw values that agreed with experiment with in about 5 %. Further examination of the contact resistance values suggested the presence of an undesirable air gap at the heat sink/thermoelectric module interface. The presence of this air gap was confirmed by examining the contact patterns left on pressure sensitive films that were placed between the thermoelectric modules and the heat sinks. An optimization exercise was performed with the model in an effort to maximize Qc. Pin geometry was varied to achieve minimum values of heat sink thermal resistance for both the hot and cold side heat exchange surfaces. Using these minimized thermal resistance values, input voltage, thermo electric geometry factor, and number of thermocouple junctions were varied to achieve maximum Qc. Using the empirically determined thermal contact resistance values, a 29 % increase in Qc was achieved over the stock case. The model predicted a 79 % improvement over the stock case when utilizing thermal contact resistance values corresponding to the elimination of the air gaps at the thermoelectric module/heat sink interfaces...|$|E
