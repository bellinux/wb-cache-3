40|$|Ponds are {{biodiversity}} hotspots, but pond {{conservation is}} hampered by problems auditing these small, often temporary, habitats. Data on temporal {{changes to the}} number of <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> response to weather variations are lacking. Annual and seasonal changes to the numbers and area of wetted <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> a lowland farm in England were surveyed by field walks between November 2010 and November 2013. Plant communities were recorded to identify variations <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> type between land uses. The study period coincided with severe drought up until April 2012 followed by record breaking precipitation. The wetted areas of <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> wetlands and dune slacks showed the strongest relationship with rainfall over the preceding 4 to 6 months, whilst the areas of <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> arable or pasture fields varied more with rainfall in the previous month. Ponds from different land uses supported different plant communities and all types added to the overall total site biodiversity. Plant communities of <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> arable fields benefitted from the extreme wet summer of 2012. The results show that the number and area of ponds varied significantly between years and seasons and that different <b>pond</b> types <b>in</b> different land uses may vary in their response to extreme weather...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Agricultural ponds {{are exposed}} to many {{contaminants}} that can negatively affect breeding amphibians. Despite therisks, such ponds are important amphibian breeding habitat if natural wetlands are scarce. We compared the survival ofXenopus laevis larvae reared in water from natural and constructed <b>ponds.</b> Agricultural (<b>in</b> the form of row-crop) and grazedponds had higher nutrient levels (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) than ungrazed or natural <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> 2000, but weobserved no differences between agricultural ponds and natural <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> 2001. All treatments had high survival rates (74 - 91 %) in both years and we detected {{no significant differences in}} survival among treatments. These results support previousresearch on the same test ponds; thus we conclude that certain constructed agricultural <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> the Driftless Area ecoregionof the Upper Midwest may be suitable for anuran larval survival. However, {{it is difficult to determine}} the biologicalsignificance of our findings, as indirect factors that could not be controlled for during this research, may influence the waterchemistry of <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> this region...|$|R

5|$|The Netherlands were {{partially}} metricated {{when they}} were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full metrication, effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the trooisch pond. The apothecaries' new pound was 375.00g. Apart from rounding issues concerning the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French système usuel. (The reform was not followed in the north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the trooisch <b>pond.)</b> <b>In</b> Belgium, apothecaries' weight was metricized effective 1856.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{name came}} from the 'Burne' or stream which ran through today's Old Town area of Eastbourne. All {{that can be seen}} of the Burne, or Bourne, is the small <b>pond</b> <b>in</b> Motcombe Gardens. The bubbling source is guarded by a statue of Neptune. Motcombe Gardens are overlooked by St. Mary's Church, a Norman church which allegedly lies on the site of a Saxon ‘moot’, or meeting place. This gives Motcombe its name.|$|E
5|$|With {{this growth}} in commerce, Tudor's initial {{monopoly}} on the trade broke down, but he continued to make significant profits from the growing trade. Increased supplies of ice were also needed {{to keep up with}} demand. From 1842 onwards, Tudor and others invested at Walden <b>Pond</b> <b>in</b> New England for additional supplies. New companies began to spring up, such as the Philadelphia Ice Company, which made use of the new railroad lines to transport harvested ice, while the Kershow family introduced improved ice harvesting to the New York region.|$|E

5|$|Coggins's {{interest}} in sailing and maritime subjects began in London {{when he would}} sail model yachts on Round <b>Pond</b> <b>in</b> Kensington Gardens. This interest developed into a lifelong passion during his teens when he sailed small craft on Hempstead Harbor, near his new home on Long Island. During {{the early years of}} World War II, Coggins took a sampling of his war illustrations to Worthen Paxton, the art director of LIFE Magazine, who commissioned Coggins to produce a drawing of an imaginary coastal invasion of England. Coggins was paid $250 for that work, a large sum at the time, which paid his rent for five months. Appearing on July 15, 1940, this was the first of many war time illustrations for LIFE. Some of Coggins's works are in the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection.|$|E
5|$|In 1730 Queen Caroline, wife of George II, {{ordered the}} damming of the River Westbourne in Hyde Park {{as part of}} a general {{redevelopment}} of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Original monastic ponds may have existed in the location and these were modified as part of the 1730–1732 scheme to create a single lake. At that time, the Westbourne formed eleven natural ponds in the park. During the 1730s, the lake filled to its current size and shape. The redevelopment was carried out by Royal Gardener Charles Bridgeman, who dammed the Westbourne to create the artificial lake, and dug a large <b>pond</b> <b>in</b> the centre of Kensington Gardens (The Round Pond) to be a focal point for pathways in the park.|$|E
5|$|M-55 {{starts at}} a {{three-way}} intersection with US31 north of Manistee.

The highway passes near the community of Eastlake before turning eastward through forest land. In eastern Manistee County, the roadway crosses the Pine River south of the Tippy Dam <b>Pond</b> <b>in</b> Wellston. M-55 intersects M-37 in western Wexford County southwest of the Caberfae Peaks Ski & Golf Resort. The roadway turns northeasterly along the south shore of Lake Mitchell where it then curves southeasterly to run concurrently along M-115 along the south shore of Lake Cadillac and through {{the south side of}} Cadillac. At the interchange with the US131 freeway, M-55 merges north along the freeway, bypassing downtown Cadillac.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts was {{an early}} center of the Transcendentalist movement, which {{emphasized}} intuition, emotion, human individuality and a deeper connection with nature. Ralph Waldo Emerson, {{who was born in}} Boston but spent much of his later life in Concord, largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work Nature, and continued to be a key figure in the movement for the remainder of his life. Emerson's friend, Henry David Thoreau, who was also involved in Transcendentalism, recorded his year spent alone in a small cabin at nearby Walden <b>Pond</b> <b>in</b> the 1854 work Walden; or, Life in the Woods.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Unionville, {{the route}} slowly bends to the northeast, {{paralleling}} the former right-of-way of the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad (MNJ) as it runs northwest through farmlands. At the far {{eastern end of}} the hamlet of Waterloo Mills, the highway also begins to follow Rutgers Creek. The waterway, the former railroad right-of-way and the road take similar paths to the hamlet of Westtown, where NY284 serves as the main northsouth route through the community. It passes Lockenhurst <b>Pond</b> <b>in</b> {{the southern part of}} the hamlet before meeting CR1 near Art Fords Lake. Past Westtown, NY284 winds its way northeastward across another rural part of Minisink, intersecting CR62 and CR22 at back-to-back junctions near the northern town line. The latter route provides access to the hamlet of Johnson, which NY284 bypasses to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} US2, one mile (1.6km) south of Engadine and crosses the Canadian National Railway line before {{entering}} town. In Engadine, M-117 meets the western terminus of H-40 which runs on Hiawatha Trail. The trunkline passes a small <b>pond</b> <b>in</b> town and some farm fields north of Engadine. The terrain transitions to forest as the highway crosses into Luce County. The route angles {{slightly to the}} northeast to avoid Kaks Lake south of M-28 near Newberry. M-117 provides an important connection {{between two of the}} main highways in the UP. This connection is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Of the ten state trunklines that connect M-28 and US2, M-117 is one of three that do not overlap either. The others are US45 and Interstate 75.|$|E
