In March 1847, Anton Pann authored an account of the Great Fire of Bucharest. During the latter disaster, his printing shop was heavily damaged, and he was only able to salvage the presses. He resumed his activities only in 1849, when he moved the business to a house owned by Catinca Pann on Taurului Street.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>practice</b> setting is, {{next to the}} GP and staff, an {{important}} determinant {{of the quality of}} care. Differences between single-handed <b>practices</b> and group <b>practices</b> in <b>practice</b> management and organization could therefore provide clues for improvement. An explorative, cross sectional survey was conducted in 766 general <b>practices</b> in The Netherlands comparing single-handed <b>practices</b> with group <b>practices.</b> OBJECTIVE: The study is looking for answers on aspects of the organization and management that are lost or gained when single-handed GPs and <b>practices</b> are replaced by group <b>practices.</b> METHODS: Between 1999 and 2003 GPs and their <b>practices</b> were assessed using a validated <b>practice</b> visit method (VIP) consisting of 303 indicators describing 56 dimensions of <b>practice</b> management. Instruments used consisted of questionnaires for patients, GPs, <b>practice</b> assistant and a direct observer in the <b>practice.</b> Single-handed <b>practices</b> (1 GP) were compared to group <b>practices</b> or health centres (> 2. 0 GPs) comparing raw scores on dimensions of <b>practice</b> management. In addition, data were analysed in a regression model with specific aspects of <b>practice</b> management as dependent variables using a general linear model procedure. Independent variables included 'single-handed/group practice', 'rural/ urban' 'part-time/full-time' and 'male/female'. RESULTS: Group <b>practices</b> scored better on nearly all aspects of infrastructure except those rated by patients. Patients gave single-handed <b>practices</b> higher marks for service, accessibility and even for the facilities. In single-handed <b>practices</b> GPs reported that they worked more and experienced higher levels of job stress. They delegated less of the medical technical tasks but there is no difference in delegation of preventive tasks/treatment of chronic diseases. Group <b>practices</b> had more computerized medical information and more quality assurance activities, but gave less patient information. Single-handed <b>practices</b> spent more hours on continuous medical education. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The quality of the <b>practice</b> infrastructure and the team scored better in group <b>practices,</b> but patients appreciated the single-handed <b>practice</b> better. The advantages of single-handed <b>practices</b> could be a challenge for group <b>practices</b> to give better personal, continuous care and to put the patient perspective before organizational considerations. This is underlined by the better score on patient information of single-handed <b>practices.</b> Single-handed <b>practices</b> can reduce their vulnerability and openness to high demand by opening up to the requirements of organised primary care...|$|R
