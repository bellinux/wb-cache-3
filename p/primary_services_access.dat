40|$|This article explores Weber’s {{notions of}} status {{and power in}} {{societies}} that are increasingly organized via digital networks. It draws on a community study conducted in a former coal-mining town in the United Kingdom. The policy background is the UK’s Digital by Default agenda, which seeks to make online <b>services</b> the <b>primary</b> form of <b>service</b> <b>access</b> and transaction. In {{the context of a}} digitally organized society, a person’s status is created through his or her ability to provide certain status markers to authenticate who they are. Status is created through a person’s file, and those lacking an online profile become thin-filed and therefore excluded from many online services. The article argues that digital authentication is a feature of the formation of status in a digitally organized society. Without online system files, individuals lack the power to <b>access</b> public <b>services,</b> banks, credit unions, and e-commerce, and they feel a lack of social honor because of their low authentication status...|$|R
40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{position}} of women teachers in the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> {{within the context of}} their access to power and decision-making. Use is made of socialist-feminist and labour market theories in order to develop a qualified reserve army of labour thesis which along with an analysis of the various ways in which power can be exercised, serves as a theoretical base to guide empirical research. Empirical study using historical documents and journals to trace the implications of state policy for women within education, allows plausible explanations to be made as to why women teachers in the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> have minimal <b>access</b> to power and decision-making. It is suggested that women's access to power within the primary education system is obstructed by problems relating to personnel and structure within the school itself, the primary teachers' professional union, and {{at the level of the}} state. In order to overcome these problems, affirmative action is needed to promote the interests of women teachers. This needs to be pursued simultaneously with efforts to alter the power structure within the primary schools. By moving towards a more democratic form of school organisation, present inequalities in the access to, and the exercise of power, can be eliminated wi thin the <b>primary</b> <b>service.</b> To the extent that scope is left for future research to be done, especially within the theoretical context of power, this study should be viewed as being both explorative and suggestive in the issues that it has raised...|$|R

In this paper, pilot evaluation findings for a targeted public health behavior change intervention, delivered via a website and web-app, aiming to increase uptake of sexual health services amongst 13 to 19 year-olds are reported. A pre-post questionnaire-based design was used. Matched baseline and follow-up data was identified from 148 respondents aged 13 - 18 years. Outcome measures were self-reported <b>service</b> <b>access,</b> self-reported intention to <b>access</b> <b>services,</b> and beliefs about <b>services</b> and <b>service</b> <b>access</b> identified through needs analysis.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of {{spectrum}} pricing in a cognitive radio network where multiple <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> providers compete with each other to offer spectrum access opportunities to the secondary users. By using an equilibrium pricing scheme, each of the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> providers aims to maximize its profit under quality of service (QoS) constraint for primary users. We formulate this situation as an oligopoly market consisting of a few firms and a consumer. The QoS degradation of the <b>primary</b> <b>services</b> is considered as the cost in offering spectrum access to the secondary users. For the secondary users, we adopt a utility function to obtain the demand function. With a Bertrand game model, we analyze the impacts of several system parameters such as spectrum substitutability and channel quality on the Nash equilibrium (i. e., equilibrium pricing adopted by the <b>primary</b> <b>services).</b> We present distributed algorithms to obtain the solution for this dynamic game. The stability of the proposed dynamic game algorithms in terms of convergence to the Nash equilibrium is studied. However, the Nash equilibrium is not efficient {{in the sense that the}} total profit of the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> providers is not maximized. An optimal solution to gain the highest total profit can be obtained. A collusion can be established among the <b>primary</b> <b>services</b> so that they gain higher profit than that for the Nash equilibrium. However, since one or more of the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> providers may deviate from the optimal solution, a punishment mechanism may be applied to the deviating <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> provider. A repeated game among <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> providers is formulated to show that the collusion can be maintained if all of the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> providers are aware of this punishment mechanism, and therefore, properly weight their profits to be obtained in the future.

40|$|Abstract Background This article {{considers}} how health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> {{and equity}} documents represent {{the problem of}} <b>access</b> to health <b>services</b> and what the effects of that representation might be for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities. We conducted a critical discourse analysis on selected access and equity documents using a gender-based diversity framework as determined by two objectives: 1) to identify dominant and counter discourses in health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity literature; and 2) to develop understanding of how particular discourses impact the inclusion, or not, of LGBT communities in health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity frameworks. The analysis was conducted in response to public health and clinical research that has documented barriers to health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> for LGBT communities including institutionalized heterosexism, biphobia, and transphobia, invisibility and lack of health provider knowledge and comfort. The analysis was also conducted {{as the first step}} of exploring LGBT access issues in home care services for LGBT populations in Ontario, Canada. Methods A critical discourse analysis of selected health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity documents, using a gender-based diversity framework, was conducted to offer insight into dominant and counter discourses underlying health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity initiatives. Results A continuum of five discourses that characterize the health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity literature were identified including two dominant discourses: 1) multicultural discourse, and 2) diversity discourse; and three counter discourses: 3) social determinants of health (SDOH) discourse; 4) anti-oppression (AOP) discourse; and 5) citizen/social rights discourse. Conclusions The analysis offers a continuum of dominant and counter discourses on health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity as determined from a gender-based diversity perspective. The continuum of discourses offers a framework to identify and redress organizational assumptions about, and ideological commitments to, sexual and gender diversity and health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity. Thus, the continuum of discourses may serve as an important element of a health care organization's access and equity framework for the evaluation of access to good quality care for diverse LGBT populations. More specfically, the analysis offers four important points of consideration in relation {{to the development of a}} health <b>services</b> <b>access</b> and equity framework. </p...|$|R

This study examines inequality in relation to <b>primary</b> care <b>services.</b> AIM: To {{determine the effect of}} <b>primary</b> care <b>services</b> on <b>access</b> to coronary angiography and revascularisation. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey of all 180 Nottinghamshire practices in the Trent region that were in existence between 1993 and 1997. The numbers of coronary bypass grafts, angioplasties, and angiographies were determined from the regional National Health Service database and linked to a database of general practice characteristics. Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the angiography and revascularisation rates and the following practice characteristics: deprivation score, distance from nearest secondary or tertiary referral centre, medical cardiology admission rate for ischaemic heart disease, fundholding status, and partnership size. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between practice characteristics and the waiting times for revascularisation and angiography. RESULTS: Practices with high deprivation scores had significantly lower rates of utilisation of angiography and revascularisation procedures. Their patients also waited longer for angiography. Practices that were 20 km or further from a revascularisation centre had significantly lower angiography and revascularisation rates. On average, their patients had to wait more than twice as long for an angiography compared with patients from nearer practices. Fundholding practices had higher angiography rates but similar revascularisation rates compared with non-fundholding practices. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there may be some under-investigation and/or treatment of patients with ischaemic heart disease from 'deprived' practices and for those from practices far from a secondary or tertiary referral centre...|$|R

40|$|Leveraging the {{dominance}} of Ethernet in LANs and SONET/SDH in MANs and WANs, we propose a service called CHEETAH (Circuit-switched High-speed End-to-End Transport ArcHitecture). The service concept is to provide end hosts with high-speed, end-to-end circuit connectivity on a call-by-call shared basis, where a “circuit ” consists of Ethernet segments at the ends that are mapped into Ethernet-over-SONET long-distance circuits. This paper focuses on the filetransfer application for such circuits. For this application, the CHEETAH service is proposed as an add-on to the <b>primary</b> Internet <b>access</b> <b>service</b> already in place for enterprise hosts. This allows an end host that is sending a file to first attempt setting up an end-to-end Ethernet/EoS circuit, and if rejected, fall back to the TCP/IP path. If the circuit setup is successful, the end host will enjoy a much shorter file-transfer delay than on the TCP/IP path. To determine {{the conditions under which}} an end host with access to the CHEETAH service should attempt circuit setup, we analyze mean file-transfer delays as a function of call blocking probability in the circuit-switched network, probability of packet loss in the IP network, round-trip times, link rates, and so on...|$|R
