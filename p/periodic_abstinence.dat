40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{demographic and}} behavioural characteristics of sexually active women {{compared to those}} who had abstained from intercourse in the past 6 months. Methods The study participants were women of childbearing age from six sites in three states in the USA. Survey questions were asked of women who were not surgically sterile and who had not gone through menopause. The main outcome measures were correlates of sexual abstinence. Results Of the 1801 respondents, 244 (14 %) reported abstaining from intercourse in the past 6 months. Univariate analysis revealed that abstinent women were less likely than sexually active women to have used illicit drugs [odds ratio (OR) 0. 47; 95 % CI 0. 35 – 0. 63], to have been physically abused (OR 0. 44, 95 % CI 0. 31 – 0. 64), to be current smokers (OR 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 45 – 0. 78), to drink above risk thresholds (OR 0. 66, 95 % CI 0. 49 – 0. 90), to have high Mental Health Inventory- 5 scores (OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 54 – 0. 92) and to have health insurance (OR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 56 – 0. 98). Abstinent women {{were more likely to be}} aged over 30 years (OR 1. 98, 95 % CI 1. 51 – 2. 61) and to have a high school education (OR 1. 38, 95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 89). Logistic regression showed that age> 30 years, absence of illicit drug use, absence of physical abuse and lack of health insurance were independently associated with sexual abstinence. Conclusions Prolonged sexual abstinence was not uncommon among adult women. <b>Periodic,</b> voluntary sexual <b>abstinence</b> was associated with positive health behaviours, implying that abstinence was not a random event. Future studies should address whether abstinence has a causal role in promoting healthy behaviours or whether women with a healthy lifestyle are more likely to choose abstinence...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Data from {{a nationally}} {{representative}} study in Bangladesh (BDHS 1996 – 97) were analysed to identify {{significant predictors of}} use of <b>periodic</b> <b>abstinence,</b> in comparison with other modern contraceptive methods. The study found that women in Bangladesh mostly use modern methods during their peak reproductive years, after which some of them switch to <b>periodic</b> <b>abstinence.</b> These women {{tend to be more}} from educated and from higher socioeconomic backgrounds and with at least one living son. Another set of data from the Matlab DSS was analysed and the results were in the same direction. Focus group discussions found that women were using the <b>periodic</b> <b>abstinence</b> method incorrectly, abstaining for more days than is necessary. For Bangladeshi contraceptive users to reach a higher degree of use-effectiveness for period abstinence, more IEC materials need to be developed...|$|E
40|$|Over 30 {{years ago}} {{the founders of the}} Christian Family Movement (CFM), a {{worldwide}} Catholic family action group, conducted a survey to investigate the marital effects of practicing “rhythm. ” Their final report indicated that many participants felt that <b>periodic</b> <b>abstinence</b> was harmful to their marriage and caused spiritual and religious distress.

40|$|The use of {{contraceptive}} method to avoid pregnancy is a multifaceted phenomenon.
