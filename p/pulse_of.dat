5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{studies of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} in the echolocation <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> the constant frequency-frequency modulating (CF-FM) bat have been mainly {{concentrated on the}} difference in the frequency of the CF component of the predominant second harmonic while neglected other pulse parameters. However, recent studies have shown that other <b>pulse</b> parameters <b>of</b> the predominant second harmonic are also biologically significant to the bat hunting. To complement and advance these studies, we have examined sexual dimorphism of multiple parameters (e.g., duration, frequency, bandwidth of the FM component, and repetition rate <b>of</b> emitted <b>pulses)</b> <b>of</b> the echolocation <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> the CF-FM bat, Hipposideros pratti.|$|R
5|$|Plants grown under UVB light {{are more}} {{resistant}} to insect herbivory compared with plants grown under filters that exclude the radiation. When tomato plants are exposed to a <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short pulses of UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk.

IFF was a responder that sent out a <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E

Some of the 32mya Pircas Negras mafic andesites appear to be associated with the Incapillo volcanic complex. These rocks form the last <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> the Pircas Negras volcanism. Specific ages of the Pircas Negras flows in the Incapillo region include 4.7±0.5mya, 3.2±0.3mya and 1.9±0.2mya.

The lava domes formed through non-explosive extrusion.|$|E

5|$|Messiaen {{continually}} evolved new composition techniques, always integrating {{them into}} his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition. For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. However, very few of these major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in Meditations, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the geophone) for Des canyons aux etoiles..., and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d'Assise.|$|E

5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short <b>pulse</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, before modern AM or FM radio {{transmission}} was developed, radio transmitters communicated information by radiotelegraphy; the transmitter was switched off and on by the operator with a telegraph key, producing <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> radio waves, to spell out text messages in Morse code. Around 1905 the first continuous wave radio transmitters began to replace the earlier spark transmitters. The Morse code signal of the spark transmitter consisted <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> radio waves called damped waves which repeated at an audio rate, so they were audible as a buzz or tone in a receivers earphones. In contrast the new continuous wave transmitters produced a signal consisting <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> continuous waves, unmodulated sinusoidal carrier waves, which were inaudible in the earphones.
