25|$|By 1978, {{manufactured}} goods exports were almost non-existent, {{and with the}} lost support of the Soviet Union the Barre government signed a structural adjustment agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the early 1980s. This included the abolishment of some government monopolies and increased public investment. This and a second agreement were both cancelled by the mid-1980s, as the Somali army refused to accept a proposed 60 <b>percent</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> military spending. New agreements were made with the Paris Club, the International Development Association and the IMF {{during the second half}} of the 1980s. This ultimately failed to improve the economy which deteriorated rapidly in 1989 and 1990, and resulted in nationwide commodity shortages.|$|E
500|$|When Ettelson {{joined the}} congregation, it had 650 member families. To {{accommodate}} growth, in 1926 the synagogue built an annex for the children's religious school. That year the congregation also established the [...] "Temple Men's Club", which had over 200 members, {{and joined the}} National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods. In 1928, the congregation purchased an adjoining house south of the synagogue, for Junior Congregation meetings, and began broadcasting its Friday evening services on the radio. The costs for both endeavors were donated anonymously by synagogue member Abe Plough, founder and chairman of Schering-Plough. The synagogue was hard-hit by the Great Depression. Income from dues dropped from $47,000 in 1928 (today $) to $23,000 in 1932, and membership fell from 750 families in 1929 to as low as 629 families. The Talmud Torah was closed {{due to lack of}} funds, and board meetings focused on finding ways to keep the congregation going financially. Ettelson requested a pay reduction of $1,000 (today $) in 1931, and a further 10 <b>percent</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> 1933, and the salaries of other synagogue employees were also cut. The Junior Congregation did well, though; it had 189 paid members by 1933, held Saturday morning and High Holy Days services, and conducted a number of other programs. The congregation eventually recovered as a whole, assisted by members who were leaders in the civic and business worlds. By 1936, membership had increased to 650, and the synagogue paid off the remaining mortgage on the Poplar and Montgomery synagogue building.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, the United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{released}} a paper called [...] "Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 <b>Percent</b> <b>Cut</b> <b>in</b> Income Tax Rates'. This paper considered {{the impact of}} a stylized reduction of 10% in the then existing marginal rate of federal income tax in the US (for example, if those facing a 25% marginal federal income tax rate had it lowered to 22.5%). Unlike earlier research, the CBO paper estimates the budgetary impact of possible macroeconomic effects of tax policies, that is, it attempts to account for how reductions in individual income tax rates might affect the overall future growth of the economy, and therefore influence future government tax revenues; and ultimately, impact deficits or surpluses. In the paper's most generous estimated growth scenario, only 28% of the projected lost revenue from the lower tax rate would be recouped over a 10-year period after a 10% across-the-board reduction in all individual income tax rates. In other words, deficits would increase by nearly the same amount as the tax cut in the first five years, with limited feedback revenue thereafter. Through increased budget deficits, the tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy will be paid for—plus interest—by taxes borne relatively evenly by all taxpayers. The paper points out that these projected shortfalls in revenue would have to be made up by federal borrowing: the paper estimates that the federal government would pay an extra US$200 billion in interest over the decade covered by the paper's analysis.|$|E
40|$|Urban public {{transport}} fares shall meet {{a number of}} – often contradictory – needs and requirements. Budgetary constraints and reduced subsidies, dividends to owners, service improvements and so on pull {{public transport}} fares up. On the other hand, objectives such as social inclusion, fairness, internalisation of external benefits and corrections for under-priced private transport pull {{in the direction of}} lower fares. During the period of 1986 to 1999, the 7 largest Norwegian cities experienced 42 <b>percent</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> subsidies, in real terms (Carlquist and Fearnley 2001). Figure 1 illustrates what happened in the city of Trondheim during this period. The operators' dependence on fare revenues increased from around 50 percent of operating costs to nearly 100 percent.

40|$|This paper uses {{a dynamic}} computable general {{equilibrium}} model to simulate the effects of unilateral reductions by the U. S. in tariffs and "voluntary" export restraints (VER's). We consider 50 <b>percent</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> tariffs and in ad valorem VER equivalents, separately and in combination. The model features intertemporal optimization by households and firms, explicit adjustment dynamics, an integrated treatment of the current and capital accounts of the balance of payments, and industry disaggregation. Central findings include: (1) VER's are considerably more significant than tariffs {{in terms of the}} magnitude of the macroeconomic effects induced by their reduction; (2) while VER reductions enhance domestic welfare, unilateral tariff cuts reduce domestic welfare (as a consequence of U. S. monopsony power and associated adverse terms of trade effects); (3) international capital movements critically regulate the responses of the U. S. and foreign economies to these trade initiatives and produce significant differences between short and long-run effects; and (4) effects differ substantially across industries. Together, these findings indicate that simulation analyses that disregard international capital movements, adjustment dynamics, and industry differences may generate seriously misleading results. ...|$|R

40|$|According to {{a recent}} {{estimate}} by Gokhale and Smetters (2005), the present value difference between the U.

Closing this enormous fiscal gap requires {{a variety of different}} tax increases and expenditure reductions. In this paper we examine how potential Social Security benefit cuts would impact the wellbeing of different American households. Specifically, we examine the living standard impacts of immediate and permanent 30 percent and 100 <b>percent</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> Social Security benefits. We examine cuts of these magnitudes to illustrate the dependency of the population on Social Security and to help policymakers calibrate the cost to Americans of this form of policy adjustment. The extent of current and future living standard reductions in response to announcements of future Social Security benefit cuts depends on the age of the household, when the cuts are announced, the size of the cuts, and the income of the household.   Social Security benefit <b>cuts</b> of 30 <b>percent,</b> if announced when a household is about to retire, can lead to retirement living standard reductions ranging from roughly one tenth to one third depending on the household’s income. These reductions in living standard are substantially reduced if the household learns at younger ages about the benefit cuts and, consequently, has a longer time period over which to adjust...|$|R
