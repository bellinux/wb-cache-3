5|$|Croatia has a {{universal}} health care system, the roots {{of which can be}} traced back to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance for all factory workers and craftsmen. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2014, the annual compulsory healthcare related expenditures reached 21.8billion kuna (2.9billion euro). Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare, representing a decline from approximately 8% estimated in 2008, when 84% of healthcare spending came from <b>public</b> <b>sources.</b> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Croatia ranks around the 50th in the world in terms of life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|Two {{extensive}} espionage {{cases in}} Sweden during the Cold War involved Boden Fortress, both exposed in 1951. The Enbom case involved Fritiof Enbom, a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden, {{and later the}} local editor for the communist newspaper Norrskensflamman. He was exposed by his own careless talkoften {{under the influence of}} alcoholto the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the Swedish Security Service after the Christmas holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952. During interrogation, he confessed that hefrom February 1943 to April 1951had met with Soviet employers around 25 times. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from <b>public</b> <b>sources,</b> but also secrets, of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of the pieces of information that concerned Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications. He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour, but was released after ten years. The other case involved Ernst Hilding Andersson, who was arrested on 21 September 1951. He had carried out seven missions for the Soviets and had provided them primarily with information regarding the Swedish Navy, but also information on the fortifications along the Norrland coast, and an initiated report about Boden Fortress and the airforce unit located in Boden and Luleå, Norrbottens flygbaskår. Andersson was, like Fritjof Enbom, sentenced to hard labour for life.|$|E

High-income countries public funding is largest contributors to the neglected disease research effort.

This downwards trend leaves a gap for other funders, such as philanthropic foundations and private pharmaceutical companies to fill.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{usage of}} the term [...] "single-payer healthcare" [...] refers to health insurance, as opposed to healthcare delivery, operating as a public service and offered to citizens and legal residents towards providing nearly universal or universal healthcare.

[...] Single-payer contrasts with other funding mechanisms like 'multi-payer' (multiple <b>public</b> and/or private <b>sources),</b> 'two-tiered' (defined either as a <b>public</b> <b>source</b> with the option to use qualifying private coverage as a substitute, or as a <b>public</b> <b>source</b> for catastrophic care backed by private insurance for common medical care), and 'insurance mandate' (citizens are required to buy private insurance which meets a national standard and which is generally subsidized).

25|$|Health {{expenditure}} in 2009 {{amounted to}} EUR 15.7 billion. The public sector {{is the main}} source of health funding, 74.7% of health spending was funded by <b>public</b> <b>sources</b> in 2009, slightly more than the average of 71.7% in OECD countries. The share of public spending in Finland was, however, lower than in all other Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) where it exceeds 80%. As in other OECD countries the health expenditure has been growing steadily since the year 2000. In 2009 health spending per capita in Finland is equal to the OECD average, with spending of EUR 2936 (or USD 3226 adjusted for purchasing power parity). Municipalities spent on average about 1300 euros per inhabitant on health care in 2005. Health care accounted for about 25% of the municipal budget.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 2012, Major League Baseball and ESPN {{agreed to}} an eight-year, $5.6 billion {{contract}} extension, the largest broadcasting deal in Major League Baseball history. It gave ESPN the rights to up to 90 regular-season games, alternating rights {{to one of the}} two Wild Card games (between American League and National League teams) each year, and the rights to all regular-season tiebreaker games. On September 19, 2012, Sports Business Daily reported that the league would agree to separate eight-year television deals with Fox Sports and Turner Sports through the 2021 season. On October 2, 2012, the new deal between Major League Baseball and TBS was officially confirmed; NBC looked to be left without a package, because though it made an offer, Major League Baseball did not consider NBC a serious bidder after the ESPN deal was made <b>public.</b> <b>Sources</b> said that NBC did not make a strong offer, and that it was most interested in ESPN's package, which includes exclusivity on Sunday night and rights to the two mid-week games.

The style evolved into the game's final ripped paper collage look, intended to appear [...] "rough and analog." [...] Designer Christoph Binder created the game's background music and sound effects by beatboxing, echoing this motif. Felix Bohatsch, the project lead, stated in an interview that adding a narrative or backstory was avoided in favor of prioritizing the gameplay. He added however that the level design follows a leitmotif that conveys [...] "a journey from being confined to becoming free" [...] as the game progresses, first beginning in dark caves and ending in a wide blank space.
