25|$|In their imaginative use of {{traditional}} iconography the artists <b>put</b> <b>us</b> {{in touch with}} a wealth of theological tradition that had developed over centuries and had marked with its symbols the meditative road into the depth dimension. Behind the pictures in these volumes we meet not only the theology of an individual Christian but also a theology expressive of the collective witness of many generations who drew their strength from the contemplation of the realities to which their symbols pointed. There is nothing that could prevent a miniature from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves from becoming an effective help of Christian meditation today.|$|E

Brian Mansfield of USA Today highlights the lyrics [...] "If we were two Lego blocks, even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 couldn't <b>put</b> <b>us</b> back together again" [...] {{as one of the}} album's [...] "many funny lines". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen wrote that the singer [...] "gets in touch with her funny bone" [...] on [...] "Up Out My Face".
