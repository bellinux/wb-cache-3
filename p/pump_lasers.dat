25|$|In {{an ideal}} doped fiber without {{birefringence}}, the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibers {{small amounts of}} birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fiber length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibers give rise to polarization mode dispersion) produce a misalignment of the relative polarizations of the signal and <b>pump</b> <b>lasers</b> along the fiber, thus tending to average out the PDG. The result is that PDG {{is very difficult to}} observe in a single amplifier (but is noticeable in links with several cascaded amplifiers).|$|E

50|$|A {{dye laser}} is a laser which uses an organic dye as the lasing medium, usually as a liquid solution. Compared to gases and most solid state lasing media, a dye {{can usually be}} used for a much wider range of wavelengths, often {{spanning}} 50 to 100 nanometers or more. The wide bandwidth makes them particularly suitable for tunable lasers and pulsed lasers. The dye rhodamine 6G, for example, can be tuned from 635 nm (orangish-red) to 560 nm (greenish-yellow), and produce pulses as short as 16 femtoseconds. Moreover, the dye can be replaced by another type in order to generate an even broader range of wavelengths with the same laser, from the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet, although this usually requires replacing other optical components in the laser as well, such as dielectric mirrors or <b>pump</b> <b>lasers.</b>|$|E

50|$|TS-DFT {{is usually}} {{used in a}} two step process. In the first step, the {{spectrum}} of an optical broadband pulse is encoded by the information (e.g., temporal, spatial, or chemical information) to be captured. In the next step, the encoded spectrum is mapped by large group-velocity dispersion into a slowed down temporal waveform. At this point the waveform has been sufficiently slowed down {{so it can be}} digitized and processed in real-time. Without the time stretch, single shot waveforms will be too fast to be digitized by analog to digital converters. Implemented in the optical domain, this process performs a similar function as slow motion used to see fast events in videos. While video slow motion is a simple process of playing back an already recorded event, the TS-DFT performs slow motion {{at the speed of light}} and before the signal is captured. When needed, the waveform is simultaneously amplified in the dispersive fiber by the process of stimulated Raman scattering. This optical amplification overcomes the thermal noise which would otherwise limit the sensitivity in real-time detection. Subsequent optical pulses perform repetitive measurements at the frame rate of the pulsed laser. Consequently, single shot optical spectra, carrying information from fast dynamic processes, can be digitized and analyzed at high frame rates. The time-stretch dispersive Fourier transformer consists of a low-loss dispersive fiber that is also a Raman amplifier. To create Raman gain, <b>pump</b> <b>lasers</b> are coupled into the fiber by wavelength-division multiplexers, with wavelengths of <b>pump</b> <b>lasers</b> chosen to create a broadband and flat gain profile that covers the spectrum of the broadband optical pulse. Instead of Raman amplification, a discrete amplifier such as an erbium doped optical amplifier or a semiconductor optical amplifier can be placed before the dispersive fiber. However the distributed nature of Raman amplification provides superior signal to noise ratio. Dispersive Fourier Transform has proven to be an enabling technology for wideband A/D conversion (ultra wideband analog to digital converters) and has also been used for high-throughput real-time spectroscopy and imaging (serial time-encoded amplified microscopy (STEAM)).|$|E
50|$|While the {{principle}} of Kerr frequency combs is applicable to any type of optical resonator, the requirement for Kerr frequency comb generation is a <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> field intensity above the parametric threshold of the nonlinear process. This requirement is easier to fulfill inside a microresonator because of the possible very low losses inside microresonators (and corresponding high quality factors) {{and because of the}} microresonators’ small mode volumes. These two features combined result in a large field enhancement of the <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> inside the microresonator which allow the generation of broad Kerr frequency combs for reasonable powers of the <b>pump</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{benefit of}} organic dyes is their high {{fluorescence}} efficiency. The greatest losses in many lasers and other fluorescence devices {{is not from}} the transfer efficiency (absorbed versus reflected/transmitted energy) or quantum yield (emitted number of photons per absorbed number), but from the losses when high-energy photons are absorbed and reemitted as photons of longer wavelengths. Because the energy of a photon is determined by its wavelength, the emitted photons will be of lower energy; a phenomenon called the Stokes shift. The absorption centers of many dyes {{are very close to}} the emission centers. Sometimes the two are close enough that the absorption profile slightly overlaps the emission profile. As a result, most dyes exhibit very small Stokes shifts and consequently allow for lower energy losses than many other laser types due to this phenomenon. The wide absorption profiles make them particularly suited to broadband pumping, such as from a flashtube. It also allows a wide range of <b>pump</b> <b>lasers</b> to be used for any certain dye and, conversely, many different dyes can be used with a single pump laser.|$|E
50|$|Although the DFA is {{essentially}} a polarization independent amplifier, {{a small proportion of}} the dopant ions interact preferentially with certain polarizations and a small dependence on the polarization of the input signal may occur (typically < 0.5 dB). This is called Polarization Dependent Gain (PDG). The absorption and emission cross sections of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites. The random distribution of the orientation of the ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers - i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not. In an ideal doped fibre without birefringence, the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibres small amounts of birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fibre length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibres give rise to polarization mode dispersion) produce a misalignment of the relative polarizations of the signal and <b>pump</b> <b>lasers</b> along the fibre, thus tending to average out the PDG.
