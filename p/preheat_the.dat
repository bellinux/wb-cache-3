25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> filaments.|$|E
25|$|Compression {{ignition}} Diesel engines {{ignite the}} fuel-air mixture {{by the heat}} of compression and do not need a spark. They usually have glowplugs that <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> combustion chamber to allow starting in cold weather. Other engines may use a flame, or a heated tube, for ignition. While this was common for very early engines it is now rare.|$|E
25|$|An instant start ballast {{does not}} <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> electrodes, instead using a {{relatively}} high voltage (~600V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted {{from the surface of}} the cold electrodes each time the lamp is turned on. Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the flicker of switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.|$|E

25|$|The {{substrate}} {{on which}} the film deposition takes place is ultrasonically cleaned and fastened to the substrate holder. The substrate holder {{is attached to the}} manipulator shaft. The manipulator shaft moves translationally to adjust the distance between the ingot source and the substrate. The shaft also rotates the substrate at a particular speed so that the film is uniformly deposited on the substrate. A negative bias DC voltage of 200–400 V {{can be applied to the}} substrate. Often, focused high-energy electrons from one of the electron guns or infrared light from heater lamps is used to <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> substrate. Heating of the substrate allows increased adatom–substrate and adatom–film diffusion by giving the adatoms sufficient energy to overcome kinetic barriers. If a rough film, such as metallic nanorods, is desired substrate cooling with water or liquid nitrogen may be employed to reduce diffusion lifetime, positively bolstering surface kinetic barriers. To further enhance film roughness, the substrate may be mounted at a steep angle with respect to the flux to achieve geometric shadowing, where incoming line of sight flux lands onto only higher parts of the developing film. This method is known as glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) or oblique-angle deposition (OAD).|$|E

500|$|Hot Blast was {{the single}} most {{important}} advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace {{and was one of the}} most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. [...] Hot blast was patented by James Beaumont Neilson at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland in 1828. [...] Within a few years of the introduction, hot blast was developed to the point where fuel consumption was cut by one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal, while furnace capacity was also significantly increased. [...] Within a few decades, the practice was to have a [...] "stove" [...] as large as the furnace next to it into which the waste gas (containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt.

40|$|We {{consider}} a curvaton {{scenario in which}} the late-time domination and the generation of the curvature perturbation is achieved by a non-oscillatory (NO) curvaton potential. Instead of considering the conventional curvaton oscillation, we consider ``weak trapping'' after <b>preheating,</b> which modifies <b>the</b> evolution of the curvaton density after <b>preheating.</b> <b>The</b> primordial isocurvature perturbation related to the curvaton is once converted into the fluctuation of the number density of <b>the</b> <b>preheat</b> field through inhomogeneous <b>preheating.</b> Then <b>the</b> evolution of the curvatons and <b>the</b> <b>preheat</b> field {{is controlled by the}} preheat-field number density. The density of these fields decreases slightly slower than the standard matter density which suggests that these fields will grow with time. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>preheat</b> field decays to reheat the Universe leaving behind the curvature perturbation. In our scenario the task of the standard curvaton is not executed solely by the curvaton itself but is partially shared with <b>the</b> <b>preheat</b> field. NO curvatons can be considered as the hybrid version of the quintessential inflationary model. Comment: 12 pages, no figure, added reference...|$|R

2500|$|Thermodynamic {{benefits}} are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated. [...] Major factors limiting the load output of a {{combined cycle power plant}} are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine {{and the heat}} recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the balance of plant and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.|$|E
2500|$|More {{recently}} introduced electronic starters {{use a different}} method to <b>preheat</b> <b>the</b> cathodes. They may be designed to be plug-in interchangeable with glow starters for use in standard fittings. They commonly use a purpose-designed semiconductor switch and [...] "soft start" [...] the lamp by preheating the cathodes before applying a controlled starting pulse which strikes the lamp first time without flickering; this dislodges a minimal amount of material from the cathodes during starting, giving longer lamp life than possible with the uncontrolled impulses to which the lamp is subjected in a switchstart. This is claimed to prolong lamp life {{by a factor of}} typically 3 to 4 times for a lamp frequently switched on as in domestic use, and to reduce the blackening of the ends of the lamp typical of fluorescent tubes. The circuit is typically complex, but the complexity is built into the IC. Electronic starters may be optimized for fast starting (typical start time of 0.3 seconds), or for most reliable starting even at low temperatures and with low supply voltages, with a startup time of 2–4 seconds. The faster-start units may produce audible noise during start-up.|$|E
