The contribution of the plateau phase of PEA as an indicator of optimal ventricular filling, hence of the appropriate atrioventricular interval (AVI) at rest and during exercise, was studied in 12 patients (age 69 ± 6 years) with complete AV block and a PEA sensing DDDR pacemakers (Living 1 Plus, Sorin Biomedica). At a mean resting heart rate of 79 ± 15 beats/min, the mean AVI optimized by PEA versus Doppler echocardiography (echo) were identical (142 ± 37 vs 146 ± 26 ms, P = 0. 59). During submaximal exercise at a mean heart rate of 134 ± 6 beats/min, AVI optimized by PEA was 135 ± 37 ms. Cardiac output at rest, measured by the CO 2 rebreathing method, was comparable with AVI determined by echo versus PEA (4. 3 ± 2. 9 and 3. 7 ± 2. 4 L/min, respectively), and increased to the same extent (8. 0 ± 3. 9 vs 8. 3 ± 5. 2 L/min) during submaximal exercise. In patients with AV block, AVI automatically set by PEA was comparable with AVI manually optimized by Doppler echocardiography and was associated with comparable exercise induced hemodynamic changes. link_to_subscribed_fulltextThe Cardiostim 2000 Congress in Cardiac Electrophysiology, Nice, France, 14 - 17 2000.

40|$|Several {{models of}} the {{atrioventricular}} nodal reentrant tachycardia circuit have been proposed. Recently, there has been experimental <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>electrophysiology</b> evidence that {{the right and left}} inferior extensions of the human atriventricular node and the atrionodal inputs they facilitate may provide the anatomic substrate of the slow pathway. Inferior nodal extensions appear to constitute a necessary limb of the tachycardia circuit in all forms of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and represent the ablation target for all forms of this arrhythmia. Anatomic variations of multiple atrionodal inputs via atrial transitional cells may create the conditions for tachycardia inducibility and differing patterns of retrograde atrial activation. In the present article, we summarize the available evidence and propose a comprehensive model of the tachycardia circuit for all forms of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia based on the concept of atrionodal input...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{standing}} from a supine position, {{the normal}} response {{is an increase}} in heart rate to maintain blood pressure (BP). In patients with chronotropic incompetence, heart rate may not increase upon standing, and they may experience orthostatic hypotension (OH). We evaluated a new orthostatic response (OSR) pacing algorithm that uses an accelerometer signal to detect sudden activity following prolonged rest to trigger a 2 minutes increase in pacing rate to 94 bpm. Ten recipients of DDDR pacemakers which contain the OSR compensation algorithm (mean age = 77 ± 9 years, 8 women) with sick sinus syndrome (n = 6) or atrioventricular block (n = 4) were studied. In all patients BP was measured before and 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, and 3 minutes after standing at their programmed base rate. A 20 mmHg fall in systolic BP upon standing was observed in five patients (OH patients), while the other five were considered non-OH patients. The measurements were repeated with the OSR algorithm turned on. Mean BP was defined as 1 / 3 systolic BP + 2 / 3 diastolic BP. Baseline heart rate was significantly slower in OH patients (62 ± 2 bpm) than non-OH patients (71 ± 7 bpm, P < 0. 05). In OH patients mean BP increased significantly upon standing (P < 0. 05 for all comparisons) with the algorithm ON instead of decreasing with the algorithm OFF, at 1 minute (+ 3. 4 vs - 10. 3 mmHg), 1. 5 minutes (+ 7. 0 vs - 4. 9 mmHg), 2 minutes (+ 1. 6 vs - 6. 7 mmHg), and 3 minutes (+ 2. 5 vs - 8. 5 mmHg). These preliminary results suggest that the OSR algorithm maintains BP upon standing in patients with OH. link_to_subscribed_fulltextCardiostim 2004 Meeting, Nice, France, 16 - 19 June 2004.

40|$|AIMS: Systematic {{registration}} {{of data from}} clinical practice is important for clinical care, local, national and international registries, and audit. Data to be collected for these different purposes should be harmonized. Therefore, during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union (EU) (January to June 2004), the Department of Health and Children worked with the European Society of Cardiology, the Irish Cardiac Society, and the European Commission to develop data standards for clinical cardiology. The Cardiology Audit and Registration Data Standards (CARDS) Project aimed to agree standards for three modules of cardiovascular health information systems: acute coronary syndromes (ACS), percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>electrophysiology</b> (pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and ablation procedures). METHODS AND RESULTS: Data items from existing registries and surveys were reviewed to derive draft data standards (variables, coding, and definitions). Variables common to the three modules include demographics, risk factors, medication, and discharge and follow-up data. Modules about a procedure contain variables on the lesion, the device, and medication during the procedure. The ACS module includes presenting symptoms, reperfusion and acute treatments, and procedures in hospital and at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The data standards were discussed and adopted at a conference involving EU member states in Cork, Ireland, in May 2004. After a pilot study, the standards will be disseminated to stakeholders throughout Europe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{research}} {{roots of}} 19 fluorine (19 F) {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) date back over 35 years. Over that time span, 1 H imaging flourished and was adopted worldwide with an endless array of applications and imaging approaches, making magnetic resonance an indispensable pillar of biomedical diagnostic imaging. For many years during this timeframe, 19 F imaging research continued at a slow pace as the various attributes of the technique were explored. However, {{over the last decade}} and particularly the last several years, the <b>pace</b> <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> relevance of 19 F imaging has exploded. In part, this is due to advances in MRI instrumentation, 19 F/ 1 H coil designs, and ultrafast pulse sequence development for both preclinical <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> scanners. These achievements, coupled with interest in the molecular imaging of anatomy and physiology, and combined with a cadre of innovative agents, have brought the concept of 19 F into early clinical evaluation. In this review, we attempt to provide a slice of this rich history of research and development, with a particular focus on liquid perfluorocarbon compound-based agents...|$|R

40|$|Cardiac arrhythmias are {{characterized}} by a disruption or abnormal conduction of electrical signals within the heart. Treatment of arrhythmias has dramatically evolved over the past half-century, and today, minimally-invasive catheter-based therapy is the preferred method of eliminating arrhythmias. Using an electroanatomical (EA) mapping system, which precisely tracks the position of catheters inside the patient's body, {{it is possible to}} construct three-dimensional maps of the ventricular and atrial chambers of the heart. Each point of these maps is annotated based on bioelectrical signals recorded from the electrodes located {{at the tip of the}} catheter. These maps are then used to guide catheter ablation within the heart. However, the electroanatomical mapping procedure results in relatively sparse sampling of the heart and a significant amount of time and skill are require to generate these maps. In this thesis, we present our software system for the integration of pre-operative, patient-specific magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) imaging data with real-time electroanatomical mapping (EAM) information. (cont.) Following registration between the EAM and imaging data, the system allows for real-time catheter navigation within patient-specific anatomy. We then evaluate candidate registration strategies to rapidly and accurately align the pre-operative imaging data with the intra-operative mapping data using simulated electroanatomical mapping data using the great cardiac vessels including the aorta, superior vena cava, and coronary sinus. Based on these in vitro results, we focus on a registration strategy which is constrained by the ascending and descending aorta. In vivo prospective evaluation of the resulting image integration was then performed (n> 200) in both experimental <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>electrophysiology</b> procedure. To compensate for residual error following registration or patient movement during a procedure, we present and evaluate warping strategies for deforming the pre-operative imaging data into agreement with the intra-operative mapping information. by Zachary John Malchano.
