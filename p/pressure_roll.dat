40|$|Comminution is {{the process}} in which by {{activity}} of mechanical forces the dispersion state of solid material is being changed. The dispersion state is definitely determined by the granulometric compo¬sition particle (size distribution).

The breaking of individual particles is the most efficient comminution method because the energy losses owing to friction and unproductive tension in the instant of breakage are avoided.

The tablets were thermally treated at different temperatures (50 and 75 °C) for 5 [*]h and were evaluated for breaking force and dissolution.

In this process, a polymer film is extruded through a slit die, then stretched in air, coated on a substrate (paper, aluminium or steel foil) between a chill roll and a flexible <b>pressure</b> <b>roll,</b> and finally cooled on successive chill rolls. Due to their non-polar character, polypropylenes are not suitable for extrusion coating on metallic surfaces. Adhesive properties can be improved by grafting on the polymer chain a polar group like maleic anhydride which may react with the aluminium surface.

Moreover, thermal history has a real impact on structure and morphology in the film. All these aspects are revealed by microscopic observations of thin microtomed sections of the film and X-ray diffraction experiments.

40|$|With {{increasing}} industry {{interest in}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>roll</b> grinding (HPGR) technology, {{there is a}} strong incentive for improved {{understanding of the nature of}} grinding pressure that exists in the interior of a compressed particle bed. This corresponds to the crushing region of the HPGR. The relationship between applied pressure (stress) to the particle bed and induced pressure (stress) within particles and at contact points between particles is of particular interest. A detailed parametric investigation is beyond the scope of this exploratory paper. However, this exploratory investigation does suggest some interesting behaviour. The compressed particle bed within an 80 turn diameter piston has been modelled using Particle Flow Code for three dimensions. PFC 3 D is a discrete element code. The total number of simulated particles was 1225 and 2450 for two beds of different thickness. Particle diameters were uniformly distributed between 4 and 4. 5 mm. The results of the simulations show that stress intensity within the simulated particle beds and within the observed particles increased with increase of the applied stress. The intensity of the average vertical stress in the selected particles tended to be comparable with the intensity of the pressure applied to the surface of particle bed and was only occasionally higher. However, the stress at contact points between particles could be several times higher. In a real crusher, such high stress amplification at contacts will quickly decrease due to local crushing and a resultant increase the size of the contact area. Therefore, its significance is likely to be relatively small in an industrial context. The modelling results also suggest that failure within the particle bed will progress from the crushing surface towards the depth of the bed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

However, {{the high price of}} these alloys has seen their use restricted to very few high performance areas such as aerospace and bio-medical applications. The costs can be significantly reduced by directly converting titanium powder to metal products, particularly via the direct powder rolling process. This present research is based on a parametric study of powder rolling and operational effects including rolling speed, roll gap size, roll surface width and powder feeding rate on the integrity of the metal powder compacted strip that is produced from the direct powder rolling process. The objectives of this work were to predict the powder rolling compaction performance in terms of compaction <b>pressure,</b> <b>roll</b> surface force and rolling torque, and produce the highest possible relative density of CP-titanium green strips by optimized rolling variable setups, and to achieve its full density by additional hot deformation processing.

Also the high <b>pressure</b> grinding <b>rolls</b> model developed at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre gives satisfactory predictions using a breakage function derived from impact and compressed bed tests.

Verification of the model is based on results from four data sets that describe the performance of three industrial scale units fitted with both studded and smooth roll surfaces.

Ore samples from the De Beers and BHP Billiton operations were sent to the JKMRC for ore characterisation and HPGR laboratory-scale tests. Rio Tinto contributed an historical data set of tests completed during a previous research project.
