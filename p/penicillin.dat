5|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{of choice}} in the United States for streptococcal pharyngitis is <b>penicillin</b> V, due to safety, cost, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is preferred in Europe. In India, where the risk of rheumatic fever is higher, intramuscular benzathine <b>penicillin</b> G is the first choice for treatment.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of sexual}} {{transmission}} of syphilis {{can be reduced}} by using a latex condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine <b>penicillin</b> G injected into a muscle. In {{those who have a}} severe <b>penicillin</b> allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous <b>penicillin</b> G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E

50|$|The extended-spectrum <b>penicillins</b> are a {{group of}} {{antibiotics}} that have the widest antibacterial spectrum of all <b>penicillins.</b> Some sources identify them with antipseudomonal <b>penicillins,</b> others consider these types to be distinct. This group includes the carboxypenicillins and the ureidopenicillins. Aminopenicillins, in contrast, do not have activity against Pseudomonas species, as their positively charged amino group does not hinder degradation by bacterially produced beta-lactamases.|$|R
5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe <b>penicillin</b> allergies. First-generation cephalosporins {{may be used in}} those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to <b>penicillin.</b> Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|<b>Penicillin</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to <b>penicillin,</b> several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5000|$|... 6-APA is {{the core}} of <b>penicillins.</b> It is {{obtained}} from the fermentation brew of the Penicillium mold and used as the main starting block for the preparation of numerous semisynthetic <b>penicillins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Conformational energy {{calculations}} {{have been}} carried out on a few representative b-lactamase resistant and susceptible, phenyl and isoxazolyl <b>penicillins.</b> These studies, in agreement with those of earlier workers, show that the 6 b-side chains of resistants <b>penicillins</b> are highly rigid as compared to those of susceptible <b>penicillins.</b> The present studies also suggest that the degree of resistant to b-lactamases depends not only on the rigidity of the side chain but also on the nature and orientation of the substituent, beyond the amide carbonyl group in the side chain. The overall shapes of these <b>penicillins</b> correlate well with their antibacterial properties...|$|R
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{resistant}} {{to a variety}} of antibiotics including <b>penicillins,</b> cephalosporins, quinolones, and aminoglycosides. Ampicillin and carbenicillin, which are <b>penicillins,</b> are an exception. It is variably susceptible to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and colistin.|$|R

5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin sodium, <b>penicillin</b> G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine <b>penicillin,</b> benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{performed}} on subjects with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to <b>penicillins</b> have demonstrated a 1 % rate of cross-reactivity between <b>penicillins</b> and both imipenem and meropenem, while a single study found a 5. 5 % rate of cross-reactivity with imipenem/cilastatin {{in subjects with}} T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity to β-lactams, mostly <b>penicillins.</b> We studied 204 consecutive subjects with a well-demonstrated T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity to assess the cross-reactivity with carbapenems and the tolerability of such alternative β-lactams. All 204 subjects underwent skin tests with imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem; 130 of them were skin-tested also with ertapenem. Subjects with negative test results were challenged with these carbapenems. All subjects displayed negative skin tests to carbapenems and tolerated challenges. These data demonstrate the absence of clinically significant T-cell-mediated cross-reactivity between <b>penicillins</b> and carbapenems. Negative delayed-reading skin testing with carbapenems in individuals with documented T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity to <b>penicillins</b> correlates well with subsequent clinical tolerance of therapeutic doses of carbapenems...|$|R
40|$|Commercial penicillinases vary {{in their}} {{capacity}} to destroy penicillinase-resistant <b>penicillins</b> and cephalosporins. A new freeze-dried preparation containing both beta-lactamase I and II was found to inactivate all <b>penicillins</b> and cephalosporins at levels above those likely to be encountered in clinical specimens...|$|R
50|$|Thienamycin was {{the first}} among the {{naturally}} occurring class of carbapenem antibiotics to be discovered and isolated. Carbapenems are similar in structure to their antibiotic “cousins” the <b>penicillins.</b> Like <b>penicillins,</b> carbapenems contain a β-lactam ring (cyclic amide) fused to a five-membered ring. Carbapenems differ in structure from <b>penicillins</b> in that within the five-membered ring a sulfur {{is replaced by a}} carbon atom (C1) and an unsaturation is present between C2 and C3 in the five-membered ring.|$|R
5|$|An {{irreversible}} inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme, {{usually by}} forming a covalent bond to the protein. <b>Penicillin</b> and aspirin are common drugs that act in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1932, Kimball began {{suffering}} from boils and infectious sores, which plagued him until {{the advent of}} antibacterial medicines such as sulfonamides and <b>penicillin</b> during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as <b>penicillin</b> and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of <b>penicillin</b> (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} <b>penicillins</b> that face {{antimicrobial}} resistance due to β-lactamase, {{it is less}} active, can be administered only parenterally, and has a higher frequency of interstitial nephritis, an otherwise-rare adverse effect of <b>penicillins.</b> However, selection of meticillin depended {{on the outcome of}} susceptibility testing of the sampled infection, and since it is no longer produced, it is also not routinely tested for any more. It also served a purpose in the laboratory to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus to other <b>penicillins</b> facing β-lactam resistance; this role has now been passed on to other <b>penicillins,</b> namely cloxacillin, as well as genetic testing for the presence of mecA gene by PCR.|$|R

5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as <b>penicillin</b> because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the <b>penicillin</b> molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 1943, Farquharson {{enlisted in}} the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and was {{assigned}} to No.1 Air Command, based in Trenton, Ontario. He was posted to the United Kingdom in 1944 and briefly returned to No.1 Air Command before being released from service on 22 November 1945 with the rank of wing commander. During the war, he chaired the <b>Penicillin</b> Committee of Canada, which regulated the distribution of <b>penicillin</b> (an antibiotic that largely replaced the sulfonamide used earlier in the war) to the armed forces, and was {{a consultant to the}} RCAF's Director of Medical Services. He was also consulted on medical matters by both the other branches of the Canadian armed forces and by various Allied medical groups. He supervised medical experiments involving <b>penicillin</b> therapy conducted in Ontario hospitals in 194344, and was temporarily appointed Director of Medicine at Christie St. Veteran's Hospital in Toronto. After V-E Day, he travelled to Belgium to supervise the administration of <b>penicillin</b> therapy, and later became involved in the care and treatment of war veterans. For his service in the war, Farquharson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in January 1946. His brother Charles also served in both world wars.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering <b>penicillin,</b> Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the <b>penicillin</b> produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E
5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain safranin and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by <b>penicillin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs are prey animals whose {{survival}} {{instinct is}} to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including <b>penicillin,</b> which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.|$|E
40|$|The {{antibiotic}} susceptibilities of 29 isolates of Plesiomonas shigelloides {{were studied}} with 24 antibiotics and antibiotic-inhibitor combinations.
