25|$|Gutiérrez was {{the first}} driver to attempt his lap in super pole and {{recorded}} fast times before locking his brakes and ran deep into the turn eight escape road, restricting him to qualifying fifth. López, seeking his first pole position in Formula E, was the next competitor to drive onto the track and took third, but was investigated for inadvertently using an excessive amount of electrical energy on his out-lap after mistakenly switching his car's settings. Although no penalty was applied, the switching of settings damaged his car's battery, leading to it being changed before the race. Turvey went fastest in the first sector before making a small error {{in the following section}} and took fourth. Vergne went faster than López to move into provisional pole position. Buemi was the final driver to set his lap time, and despite making small errors in the final sector, he clinched pole position with a time of one minute and 2.319 seconds. The margin of gap to Vergne was 0.006 seconds, the closest in Formula E history. It was Buemi's second consecutive pole position, and the eighth of his career. After qualifying ended, Turvey was demoted ten places on the grid because his team changed an <b>powertrain</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic design methodology for split hybrid vehicles using a single planetary gearset (PG) as the transmission. The design methodology {{consists of four}} steps: 1) analyze clutch locations on the PG and operation modes, 2) generate dynamic models, 3) evaluate drivability (acceleration performance) via forward simulations, and 4) optimize the fuel economy using the dynamic programming technique. The 1 -PG split hybrid transmission can have 12 configurations, and each configuration can have four operation modes when three clutches are added. This methodology systematically evaluates all configuration candidates and identifies the optimal design, and we demonstrate how it helps to identify a simplified design based in the output-split configuration used by the Chevy Volt. The simplified design, named the Volt-, has {{only two of the}} four operation modes of the original Volt. The Volt- achieves the same fuel economy as the original Volt in the FUDS cycle, and has only slightly reduced drivability and fuel economy in the HWFET cycle. In addition, an improved design based on the input-split configuration used by the Toyota Prius is also identified, named the Prius+, which has one additional mode than the original Prius. The Prius+ outperforms the Prius in both drivability and fuel economy.

40|$|Powertrain size {{optimisation}} {{based on}} vehicle class and usage profile is advantageous for reducing emissions. Backward-facing powertrain models, which incorporate scalable powertrain components, {{have often been}} used for this purpose. However, due to their quasi-static nature, backward-facing models give very limited information about {{the limits of the}} system and drivability of the vehicle. This makes it difficult for control system development and implementation in hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test systems. This paper investigates the viability of using forward-facing models in the context of <b>powertrain</b> <b>component</b> sizing optimisation. The vehicle model used in this investigation features a conventional powertrain with an internal combustion engine, clutch, manual transmission, and final drive. Simulations that were carried out have indicated that there is minimal effect on the optimal cost with regards to variations in the driver model sensitivity.

40|$|Although hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) generally improve fuel economy (FE) compared to conventional vehicles, evidence of higher FE variability in HEVs compared to conventional vehicles indicates that {{apart from the}} improvement in FE, the reduction of FE variability is also of significant importance for HEVs. Over the years research on how to optimise <b>powertrain</b> <b>component</b> sizes of HEVs has generally focused on improving FE over a given driving pattern; FE variability over a realistic range of driving patterns has generally been overlooked, and {{this can lead to}} FE benefits of HEVs not being fully realised in real-world usage. How to reduce the FE variability in HEVs due to variation in driving patterns through the optimisation of <b>powertrain</b> <b>component</b> sizes is considered as the research question. This research proposes a new methodology in which powertrain components are optimised over a range of driving patterns representing different traffic conditions and driving styles simultaneously.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive and flexible forward dynamic powertrain simulation tool, WARwick Powertrain Simulation Tool for ARchitectures 2 (WARPSTAR 2), for modelling of conventional internal combustion engine, hybrid, and pure electric vehicles. WARPSTAR 2 includes physical <b>powertrain</b> <b>component</b> models and their controllers, a hybrid supervisory controller, the driver, {{and the environment}} model. The physical <b>powertrain</b> <b>component</b> models are developed in Dymola, while the component controllers, the hybrid supervisory controllers, and the driver model are realized in MATLAB/Simulink.

The generalized formation {{can be used for}} the supervisory controllers of different HEV architectures with varied parameter settings, thus facilitating the controller design process. The rule-based supervisory controller is also developed in WARPSTAR 2. Simulation is carried out for different HEVs with these two supervisory controllers in the driving cycles.

During various modes of operation, such as electric, regenerative braking, engine charge for maintaining the battery state of charge, the losses and their dependence with the control properties were analyzed.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a novel method for the simultaneous optimization of energy management and <b>powertrain</b> <b>component</b> sizing of a parallel plug-in {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (PHEV). The problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem to minimize an objective function, which is a weighted sum of operational and component costs. The operational cost includes the consumed fossil fuel and electrical energy, whereas the component cost includes the cost of the battery, electric motor (EM), and internal combustion engine (ICE). The powertrain model includes quadratic losses for the powertrain components. Moreover, the combustion engine and the electric motor losses are assumed to linearly scale with respect to the size and the losses of baseline components. The result of the optimization is the variables of the global optimal energy management for every time instant and optimal component sizes. Due to the dependency of the result on the driving cycle, a long real-life cycle with its charging times is chosen to represent a general driving pattern. The method allows the study of the effect of some performance requirements, i. e., acceleration, top speed, and all-electric range, on the component sizes and total cost...|$|E
