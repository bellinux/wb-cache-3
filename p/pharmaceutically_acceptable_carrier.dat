40|$|Lung {{deposition}} of new formulations of budesonide, using solid lipid microparticles (SLmP) as a <b>pharmaceutically</b> <b>acceptable</b> filler and <b>carrier</b> for inhalation aerosols, and administered from a dry powder inhaler (Cyclohaler), {{were compared with}} that from Pulmicort Turbuhaler. Six healthy volunteers {{took part in a}} three-way randomized cross-over study, and inhaled a nominal dose of 400 microg budesonide, labelled with 99 mTc, on each study day. Lung deposition was determined by gamma scintigraphy and by a pharmacokinetic method. The percentage of dose (SD) in the whole lung was 49. 9 (3. 7) % for the lipidic matricial form (M) and 62. 8 (4. 9) % for the lipidic physical blend formulation (PB). These results corresponded well with the in vitro fine particle assessment. In comparison with data recorded in literature for in vivo deposition obtained with Pulmicort Turbuhaler, it was estimated that lung deposition was 1. 5 and 2. 0 times higher for the M and PB formulations, respectively. Furthermore, the relative drug availability obtained from the pharmacokinetic evaluation, expressed as the percentage of pulmonary absorption of the comparator product, was 154 % and 220 % for M and PB, respectively. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that pulmonary administration using SLmP gives a prominent and significant increase in budesonide lung deposition.
