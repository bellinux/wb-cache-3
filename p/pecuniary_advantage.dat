Lord Wright held there were [...] "fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, volenti non fit injuria meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in ICI Ltd v Shatwell where an experience quarry shotfirer said he [...] "could not be bothered" [...] to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother.

We have excellent evidence on this head from Mr. S. Druce (17/14. 'Journal R. Agricult.

A high authority, Mr. Pusey, sums up the result in money value during an equal length of time, namely (neglecting shillings), for Cotswolds 248 pounds, for Leicesters 223 pounds, for Southdowns 204 pounds, for Hampshire Downs 264 pounds, and for the crossbred 293 pounds.

60|$|Heaven forefend that I {{should use}} a pen {{that should be}} ever {{dedicated}} to an exposition of unalterable moral principle to transcribe Mrs. Tretherick's own theory of this interval and episode, with its feeble palliations, its illogical deductions, its fond excuses, and weak apologies. It would seem, however, that her experience had been hard. Her slender stock of money was soon exhausted. At Sacramento she found that the composition of verse, although appealing to the highest emotions of the human heart, and compelling the editorial breast to the noblest commendation in the editorial pages, was singularly inadequate to defray the expenses of herself and Carry. Then she tried the stage, but failed signally. Possibly her conception of the passions was different from that which obtained with a Sacramento audience; but it was certain that her charming presence, so effective at short range, was not sufficiently pronounced for the footlights. She had admirers enough in the green-room, but awakened no abiding affection among the audience. In this strait, {{it occurred to her}} that she had a voice,--a contralto of no very great compass or cultivation, but singularly sweet and touching; and she finally obtained position in a church-choir.

What! two hundred pounds to be given to a man for one day's entertainment? If there is an end of it there, it ruins nobody, and cannot be supposed, to a great degree, to corrupt anybody; but when that entertainment is renewed day after day for three months, it is no longer a compliment to the man, but a great <b>pecuniary</b> <b>advantage,</b> and, on the other hand, to the person giving it, a grievous, an intolerable burden. It then becomes a matter of the most serious and dreadful extortion, tending to hinder the people who give it not only from giving entertainment, but from having bread to eat themselves. Therefore, if any such entertainment was customary, the custom was perverted by the abuse of its being continued for three months together. It was longer than Ahasuerus's feast. There is a feast of reason and a flow of soul; but Mr. Hastings's feast was a feast of avarice and a flow of money. No wonder he was unwilling to rise from such a table: he continued to sit at that table for three months.|$|E

As the electoral legislation has become more stringent, attracting voters by giving them attentions and gifts (buckets, packages of food with sugar, oil, etc., or gourmet) was forbidden and election promises have climbed the first rung of the strategy of attracting voters.

2500|$|Finally, in {{this context}} a form of more regular [...] "re-recruitment" [...] should be {{mentioned}} that in practice had some quantitative importance: the ransoming of prisoners of war. Though in the first stages of the Eighty Years' War both parties had mercilessly executed prisoners of war (a practice that continued {{for a long time}} in the war on sea), this practice was soon recognized as a waste of money, as prisoners were often ready and able to offer large sums of money to regain their freedom. The practice of ransoming had long been customary in medieval wars and there was no reason to forgo its <b>pecuniary</b> <b>advantages</b> in this conflict. Informal ransoming was soon formalized in a so-called Cartel between the high commands of the two belligerents, first in 1599, and more definitely in 1602. This cartel was a formal treaty that enumerated the rates of exchange for different grades of prisoners and other conditions of treatment (and compensation for housing and feeding). The advantage for the commanders of both armies was that the losses due to the taking of prisoners could be replenished relatively cheaply and speedily. The cartel with Spain remained in force for the remainder of the war. Similar cartels were concluded in later wars.|$|R

The distance between the stump and shooting-stand was one hundred measured yards; a foot more or a foot less being thought an invasion of the right of one of the parties. The negro affixed his own price to every bird, and the terms of the chance; but, when these were once established, he was obliged, by the strict principles of public justice that prevailed in the country, to admit any adventurer who might offer.|$|E
6000|$|We {{all knew}} that Mr. Thompson was looking for his son, and a pretty bad one at that.

A clever and cruel knave will in a mixed society always be richer than an honest person can be. But Honesty is the best [...] "policy," [...] if policy mean practice of State. For fraud gains nothing in a State. It only enables the knaves in it to live {{at the expense of}} honest people; while there is for every act of fraud, however small, a loss of wealth to the community. Whatever the fraudulent person gains, some other person loses, as fraud produces nothing; and there is, besides, the loss of the time and thought spent in accomplishing the fraud, and of the strength otherwise obtainable by mutual help (not to speak of the fevers of anxiety and jealousy in the blood, which are a heavy physical loss, as I will show in due time). Practically, when the nation is deeply corrupt cheat answers to cheat; every one is in turn imposed upon, and there is to the body politic the dead loss of the ingenuity, together with the incalculable mischief of the injury to each defrauded person, producing collateral effect unexpectedly.

6000|$|... 333 In {{his last}} {{edition of his}} “Manual,” Professor Fawcett thus [...] {{describes}} a co-operative experiment in agriculture: “The one that [...] has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since [...] by Mr. Gurdon, on his estate at Assington, near Sudbury, in Suffolk. [...] Mr. Gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the [...] agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate, that he was [...] prompted to do something on their behalf. When, therefore, one of [...] his farms became vacant, he offered to let it at the ordinary rent, [...] £150 a year, to the laborers who worked upon it. As they, of course, [...] had not sufficient capital to cultivate it, he {{in the first instance}} [...] loaned them the requisite stock and implements. The laborers were, [...] in fact, formed into a company in which there were eleven shares, [...] and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share. The plan [...] was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been [...] saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced, and [...] the stock and implements became the property of the laborers. Each [...] share greatly increased in value. Mr. Gurdon was so much encouraged, [...] not only by the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>advantages</b> secured to the laborers, but [...] also by the general improvement effected in their condition, that [...] some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar [...] terms. Although no statement of accounts has ever been published, [...] the remarkable <b>pecuniary</b> <b>advantages</b> secured to the laborers is [...] proved by the fact that, after enjoying at least as high wages as [...] were paid in the district, they were able in a few years to become [...] the owners of a valuable property, consisting of the stock and [...] implements on the farms. One of the most significant and hopeful [...] circumstances connected with the experiment is, that it was not [...] carried out by a picked body of men; and if so much could be done by [...] laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country, [...] it maybe fairly concluded, that when the intelligence of our rural [...] population has been better developed, co-operation may be applied in [...] a more complete form to agriculture, and with even more striking [...] results than were obtained at Assington.... In the description which [...] has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship, [...] it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated [...] by the feeling of property. When he cultivates his own plot of [...] ground, he exerts himself to the utmost, because he knows that he [...] will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor. Each year, with the [...] extended use of machinery in agriculture, it is becoming more [...] advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale. When, therefore, [...] co-operative agriculture becomes practicable, land may be cultivated [...] by associations of laborers, and thus many of the advantages [...] associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured, [...] {{while at the same time}} the disadvantages of small farming may be [...] avoided. The progress toward co-operative agriculture will no doubt [...] be slow and gradual.” ...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{elucidate}} firm and performance attributes {{of a population}} of small, elite firms that assume prominent positions in their respective technological spaces and product markets. More specifically, this study addresses the role and impact of industrial agglomeration on the location and performance characteristics of serial innovator firms. The dissertation was conceived {{as a collection of}} three distinct but related essays. The first essay on the geographical location of firms with high levels of innovative prowess i. e. serial innovator firms vis-à-vis technology clusters and research universities indicates that these firms are not necessarily located in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) with higher average levels of industry clustering than non-serial innovator firms of similar size. Serial innovator firms and their less innovative counterparts appear to have the same need and capacity to absorb knowledge spillovers in technology clusters. Further analysis, however, revealed that serial innovator firms in the Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology and IT hardware industries are located in MSA's with significantly higher levels of regional specialization than non-serial innovator firms in that industry which suggests an asymmetric need for knowledge spillovers by these firms. Furthermore, serial innovator firms seem to be located in MSA's with a significantly higher number of research universities than a non-serial innovator firm although differences across industries can be noted. This again indicates an asymmetric use and need for academic knowledge spillovers and <b>pecuniary</b> <b>advantages</b> offered by these institutions. The analysis in the second essay reveals that serial innovator firms located in MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) with elevated levels of industrial clustering announce significantly more new products than their counterparts located in MSA areas with low levels of industrial clustering. However, no differences in the pace of technological progress of the technologies developed by serial innovator firms located in technology clusters and those outside of clusters was found. Finally, the research reported in the third essay indicates that the level of industrial agglomeration has a positive impact on the export performance of serial innovator firms and that these firms benefit proportionately more from technology clusters than non-serial innovator firms.

They got out their maps, and showed Charles where Bombay, and Tangier, and the other places offered with the lady as her dowry lay. The statesmen were quite pleased with the prospect of these acquisitions, and Charles was particularly gratified with the money item. It was twice as much, they said, as any English king had ever before received as the marriage portion of a bride. In a word, the proposition was unanimously considered as in every respect entirely satisfactory, and Charles authorized his ministers to open the negotiations for the marriage immediately. All this time Charles had never seen the lady, and perhaps had never heard of her before. Her own individual qualifications, whether of mind or of person, seem to have been considered a subject not worth inquiring about at all.|$|R
