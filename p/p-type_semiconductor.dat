5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor).</b> Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
25|$|Dye sensitised {{solar cells}} {{operate as a}} photoanode (n-DSC), where {{photocurrent}} result from electron injection by the sensitized dye. Photocathodes (p-DSCs) operate in an inverse mode compared to the conventional n-DSC, where dye-excitation is followed by rapid electron transfer from a <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> to the dye (dye-sensitized hole injection, instead of electron injection). Such p-DSCs and n-DSCs can be combined to construct tandem solar cells (pn-DSCs) and the theoretical efficiency of tandem DSCs is well beyond that of single-junction DSCs.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E
50|$|As {{opposed to}} n-type <b>semiconductors,</b> <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> {{have a larger}} hole {{concentration}} than electron concentration. The term p-type refers to the positive charge of the hole. In <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> holes are the majority carriers and electrons are the minority carriers. <b>P-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> are created by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with acceptor impurities (or doping an n-type <b>semiconductor).</b> A common <b>p-type</b> dopant for silicon is boron. For <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> the Fermi level is below the intrinsic Fermi level and lies closer to the valence band than the conduction band.|$|R
50|$|The more {{abundant}} charge carriers are called majority carriers, which are {{primarily responsible for}} current transport {{in a piece of}} semiconductor. In n-type semiconductors they are electrons, while in <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> they are holes. The less abundant charge carriers are called minority carriers; in n-type semiconductors they are holes, while in <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> they are electrons.|$|R
50|$|Many copper {{chalcogenides}} are degenerate <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> {{with relatively}} {{large numbers of}} holes in their valence band. An example is the system LaCuOS1−xSex with Mg doping. It is a wide gap <b>p-type</b> degenerate <b>semiconductor.</b> The hole concentration does not change with temperature, a typical trait of degenerate semiconductors.|$|R
25|$|A p–n {{junction}} diode {{is made of}} a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E

2500|$|Arsenic trisulfide is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula As2S3. [...] It {{is a bright}} yellow solid that is insoluble in water. [...] It also occurs as the mineral orpiment (Latin: auripigment), which {{has been used as}} a pigment called King's yellow. [...] It is produced in the analysis of arsenic compounds. [...] It is a group V/VI, intrinsic <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> and exhibits photo-induced phase-change properties. [...] The other principal arsenic sulfide is As4S4, a red-orange solid known as the mineral realgar.|$|E
2500|$|When {{a voltage}} is applied across a MOS structure, it modifies the {{distribution}} of charges in the semiconductor. If we consider a <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> (with [...] the density of acceptors, p the density of holes; p = NA in neutral bulk), a positive voltage, , from gate to body (see figure) creates a depletion layer by forcing the positively charged holes away from the gate–insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions (see doping (semiconductor)). If [...] is high enough, {{a high concentration of}} negative charge carriers forms in an inversion layer located in a thin layer next to the interface between the semiconductor and the insulator.|$|E
50|$|Like other binary {{chalcogenides}} of antimony and bismuth, Sb2Te3 {{has been}} investigated for its semiconductor properties. It can be transformed into both n-type and <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> by doping with an appropriate dopant.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} the {{combination}} of the metal and semiconductor determines the forward voltage of the diode. Both n- and <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> can develop Schottky barriers. However, the p-type typically has a much lower forward voltage. As the reverse leakage current increases dramatically with lowering the forward voltage, it can not be too low, so the usually employed range is about 0.5-0.7 V, and <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> are employed only rarely. Titanium silicide and other refractory silicides, which are able to withstand the temperatures needed for source/drain annealing in CMOS processes, usually have too low a forward voltage to be useful, so processes using these silicides therefore usually do not offer Schottky diodes.|$|R
25|$|For {{soldering}} semiconductor materials, e.g. {{die attachment}} of silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide, {{it is important}} that the solder contains no impurities that could cause doping in the wrong direction. For soldering n-type semiconductors, solder may be doped with antimony; indium may be added for soldering <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> Pure tin and pure gold can be used.|$|R
2500|$|Many NTC {{thermistors}} {{are made}} from a pressed disc, rod, plate, bead or cast chip of semiconducting material such as sintered metal oxides. [...] They work because raising the temperature of a semiconductor increases the number of active charge carriers - it promotes them into the conduction band. The more charge carriers that are available, the more current a material can conduct. In certain materials like ferric oxide (Fe2O3) with titanium (Ti) doping an n-type semiconductor is formed and the charge carriers are electrons. In materials such as nickel oxide (NiO) with lithium (Li) doping a <b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> is created where holes are the charge carriers.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{traditional}} solid-state semiconductor, a solar cell {{is made from}} two doped crystals, one doped with n-type impurities (n-type semiconductor), which add additional free conduction band electrons, and the other doped with p-type impurities (<b>p-type</b> <b>semiconductor),</b> which add additional electron holes. When placed in contact, some of the electrons in the n-type portion flow into the p-type to [...] "fill in" [...] the missing electrons, also known as electron holes. Eventually enough electrons will flow across the boundary to equalize the Fermi levels of the two materials. The result is a region at the interface, the p-n junction, where charge carriers are depleted and/or accumulated {{on each side of}} the interface. In silicon, this transfer of electrons produces a potential barrier of about 0.6 to 0.7 V.|$|E
