50|$|Above ground, Pluto hears {{a strange}} thumping, while behind him, the {{caterpillar}} pops {{out of a}} new burrow he had just dug. Upon seeing Pluto's long, slender, black tail, the caterpillar who was rather grumpy from having almost been eaten immediately brightens up and starts climbing the tail. Pluto is startled that something was climbing his tail, but {{when he sees the}} caterpillar, he is curious what the caterpillar is trying to do. At this point, the caterpillar starts singing in a deep voice again about the urgent transformation that he must undergo. When he reaches the top of Pluto's tail, which is curved horizontally, he reaches behind himself and pulls out a lasso of silk from his own tail. The caterpillar raises the lasso over his head, swings it around, and loops it across the end of Pluto's tail. The caterpillar takes a bungee leap from the tail and dangles upside-down from the silk thread tied to Pluto's tail, while Pluto becomes more confused and apprehensive at what the caterpillar was up to, but lets him continue anyway. Still singing, the caterpillar curves his body in <b>preparation,</b> <b>building</b> momentum, before suddenly twisting and gyrating his tail, creating a spinning blur that travels down towards his head, leaving a silk covering in its wake. Soon the spinning blur covers the caterpillars head, leaving him completely covered in a gray, spiraling spindle-shaped cocoon that swings slightly before hanging still. Unsure what had just happened, Pluto shakes the end of his tail, swinging the cocoon madly about, causing it to shake and rattle like a maraca. Despite all this, the caterpillar manages to finish his song just as Pluto stops shaking it and stares at the cocoon curiously.|$|E

40|$|The Carrier <b>Preparation</b> <b>Building</b> Materials Handling System {{receives}} {{rail and}} truck shipping casks from the Carrier/Cask Transport System, and inspects and prepares the shipping casks for {{return to the}} Carrier/Cask Transport System. Carrier preparation operations for carriers/casks received at the surface repository include performing a radiation survey of the carrier and cask, removing/retracting the personnel barrier, measuring the cask temperature, removing/retracting the impact limiters, removing the cask tie-downs (if any), and installing the cask trunnions (if any). The shipping operations for carriers/casks leaving the surface repository include removing the cask trunnions (if any), installing the cask tie-downs (if any), installing the impact limiters, performing a radiation survey of the cask, and installing the personnel barrier. There are four parallel carrier/cask preparation lines installed in the Carrier <b>Preparation</b> <b>Building</b> with two preparation bays in each line, each of which can accommodate carrier/cask shipping and receiving. The lines are operated concurrently to handle the waste shipping throughputs and to allow system maintenance operations. One remotely operated overhead bridge crane and one remotely operated manipulator is provided for each pair of carrier/cask preparation lines servicing four preparation bays. Remotely operated support equipment includes a manipulator and tooling and fixtures for removing and installing personnel barriers, impact limiters, cask trunnions, and cask tie-downs. Remote handling equipment is designed to facilitate maintenance, dose reduction, and replacement of interchangeable components where appropriate. Semi-automatic, manual, and backup control methods support normal, abnormal, and recovery operations. Laydown areas and equipment are included as required for transportation system components (e. g., personnel barriers and impact limiters), fixtures, and tooling to support abnormal and recovery operations. The Carrier <b>Preparation</b> <b>Building</b> Materials Handling System interfaces with the Cask/Carrier Transport System to move the carriers {{to and from the}} system.

This qualitative study gathers data from primary and secondary Australian teachers (n= 25) through extended response questionnaire and audio-recorded focus group discussions, and preservice teachers (n= 10) using audio-recorded interviews {{at the conclusion of}} their four-week practicum. Findings indicated that mentors had clear views on desirable attributes (e. g., enthusiasm, commitment, resilience) and practices (e. g., planning, <b>preparation,</b> <b>building</b> a teaching repertoire) for mentees; whereas mentees had varying views on identifying such attributes and practices and did not refer to: content knowledge, differentiation, and knowing school and university policies.

40|$|Qualification {{testing of}} Combustion Engineering's AMDATA Intraspect/ 98 Data Acquisition and Imaging System {{that applies to}} the {{redesigned}} solid rocket motor field joint capture feature case-to-insulation bondline inspection was performed. Testing was performed at M- 111, the Thiokol Corp. Inert Parts <b>Preparation</b> <b>Building.</b> The purpose of the inspection was to verify {{the integrity of the}} capture feature area case-to-insulation bondline. The capture feature scanner was calibrated over an intentional 1. 0 to 1. 0 in. case-to-insulation unbond. The capture feature scanner was then used to scan 60 deg of a capture feature field joint. Calibration of the capture feature scanner was then rechecked over the intentional unbond to ensure that the calibration settings did not change during the case scan. This procedure was successfully performed five times to qualify the unbond detection capability of the capture feature scanner. The capture feature scanner qualified in this test contains many points of mechanical instability that can affect the overall ultrasonic signal response. A new generation scanner, designated the sigma scanner, should be implemented to replace the current configuration scanner. The sigma scanner eliminates the unstable connection points of the current scanner and has additional inspection capabilities...|$|E
40|$|In October 2010, AREVA Enrichment Services LLC (AES) {{collected}} sixty {{soil samples}} at the Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility (EREF) {{site for the}} purpose of establishing the natural range of background concentrations of radionuclides in on-site, surface soil, prior to the beginning of facility construction activities. The data from the radiological analyses of these samples provide radionuclide background levels that will be used for future assessments of potential impact on the local environment from facility operations or decommissioning. The soil sample results are summarized in Enclosure 1. The complete report is available for inspection at our offices, if needed. The sampling plan addressed the four pre-construction survey units identified in the AES response to NRC Request for Additional Information D- 2 (Reference 1), and satisfies the commitment to the NRC to provide a sufficient number of sampling points to characterize the site area for pre-construction background radionuclide levels. The four survey units were delineated as follows: " Survey Unit 1 : The stormwater detention and retention basins; * Survey Unit 2 : The main cylinder storage pad area north of the main facilities; • Survey Unit 3 : The main facility footprint for the Technical Support Building, the Blending, Sampling and <b>Preparation</b> <b>Building,</b> the Separation Building Modules, the UF 6 Handling Areas, and the Full Product Cylinder Storage Pad, and; * Survey Unit 4 : Areas on-site, but outside those that are scheduled to be disturbed during plant construction...|$|E
