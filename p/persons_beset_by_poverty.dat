50|$|Late 19th century, non-Messianic Restorationism {{was largely}} driven by {{concern over the}} fate of the Jews of the Russian Empire, <b>beset</b> <b>by</b> <b>poverty</b> and <b>by</b> deadly, government-inspired pogroms. It was widely {{accepted}} that western nations did not wish to receive Jewish immigrants. Restorationism was a way for charitable individuals to assist oppressed Jews without actually accepting them as neighbors and fellow-citizens. In this, Restorationism was not unlike the efforts of the American Colonization Society to send blacks to Liberia and the efforts of British abolitionists to create Sierra Leone. Winston Churchill endorsed Restoration because he recognized that Jews fleeing Russian pogroms required a refuge, and preferred Palestine for sentimental reasons.|$|R

40|$|South Africa is {{experiencing}} an exceptionally high crime rate and many people, across the various ethnic groups, are <b>beset</b> <b>by</b> <b>poverty.</b> The {{question is whether}} the prevalence of violence in South Africa is the result of neocolonialism or postcolonialism, among other complicated sociological factors. The current article suggests how postcolonial hermeneutics can provide access to the diverse complexities of Africa. Postcolonial consciousness means that the experience of the Other is taken seriously from their own perspective. From the perspective of anti-societal language in the Gospel of Matthew, postcolonial theory is presented as a tool for biblical interpretation that assists in identifying colonial intentions that informed and influenced the South African context. Such theory calls for a constructive reading of concerns relating to justice. The article focuses on the Jesus saying, as influenced by Roman imperial policy. It deals with the comparison between the fate of beasts and that of the son of man, who has nowhere to lay his head (Mt 8 : 20) ...|$|R

In 1788, the Bayard family, dividing their farm into blocks and lots for sale, laid down eight streets parallel to Broadway, numbered from east to west, plus seven cross streets. A few years later, the numbered streets were named, and {{by the turn of}} the century they were renamed, for Revolutionary War officers, including Henry Laurens (see nearby map).

An 1860 proposal to widen Laurens Street and extend it north one block to Washington Square Park was carried out in 1869 and 1870.

5000|$|The {{greatest}} threat presented by Castro's Cuba is {{as an example}} to other Latin American states which are <b>beset</b> <b>by</b> <b>poverty,</b> corruption, feudalism, and plutocratic exploitation ... his influence in Latin America might be overwhelming and irresistible if, with Soviet help, he could establish in Cuba a Communist utopia. - Walter Lippmann, Newsweek, 27 April 1964 The Cuban Revolution was a crucial turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations. Although the American government was initially willing to recognize Castro's new government, it soon came to fear that Communist insurgencies would spread through the nations of Latin America, as they had in Southeast Asia. Castro, meanwhile, resented the Americans for providing aid to Batista's government during the revolution. After the revolutionary government nationalized all U.S. property in Cuba in August 1960, the American Eisenhower administration froze all Cuban assets on American soil, severed diplomatic ties and tightened its embargo of Cuba. In 1961, the U.S. government backed an armed counterrevolutionary assault on the Bay of Pigs {{with the aim of}} ousting Castro, but the counterrevolutionaries were swiftly defeated by the Cuban military. The American embargo against Cuba - the longest-lasting single foreign policy in American history - is still in force as of 2017, although it has undergone a partial loosening in recent years. The U.S. began efforts to normalize relations with Cuba in the mid-2010s, and formally reopened its embassy in Havana after over half a century in August 2015.|$|R

40|$|Conducting {{research}} in elderly populations is important, but challenging. In this paper, the authors describe specific challenges that have arisen and solutions {{that have been}} used in carrying out The MOBILIZE Boston Study, a community-based, prospective cohort study in Massachusetts focusing on falls among 765 participants aged 70 years or older enrolled during 2005 – 2007. To recruit older individuals, face-to-face interactions are more effective than less personal approaches. Use of a board of community leaders facilitated community acceptance of the research. Establishing eligibility for potential participants required several interactions, so resources must be anticipated in advance. Assuring a safe and warm environment for elderly participants and offering a positive experience are a vital priority. Adequate funding, planning, and monitoring are required to provide transportation and a fully accessible environment in which to conduct study procedures as well as to select personnel highly skilled in interacting with elders.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} and increasing rate of urbanisation is causing many researchers to look deeper at life in cities. Increasingly recognised are {{the benefits of}} urban green space and their associated recreational parks and nature reserves. While {{there is a growing}} literature on the environmental services provided by these areas; so too is there a growing literature on the numerous social benefits that recreational green spaces in particular afford their users. Although imagined and generally designed as salubrious public spaces, many parks often fall short of this. In fact research has shown that a park's design, its surroundings, and its management can all combine to exclude certain types of people. In this study I conducted ethnographic research to participate in and observe the activities of visitors to False Bay Nature Reserve in Cape Town. False Bay Nature Reserve includes a series of nature reserves and the Cape Flats Waste Water Treatment Works, and is situated in the area of Cape Town known as the Cape Flats. Much of the Cape Flats is <b>beset</b> <b>by</b> <b>poverty,</b> unemployment, and violent drug - related crime carried out by notorious gangs. Despite the challenges of the surrounding areas, my study reveals that False Bay Nature Reserve provides relative safety to its users as well a range of enjoyable re creational activities. Some of the key recreational activities are separated distinctively between two key sites in the reserve. Furthermore the visitors of these sites differ markedly in race, ethnicity and income. The legacy of apartheid almost certainly accounts for much of this separation; however, the study indicates that the barriers of this legacy are eroding and can potentially be further dismantled with engaged and informed management strategies. Due to its surroundings, the reserve is vulnerable and recently experienced a period where crime was prevalent, vegetation was overgrown, and it was feared by many of its users, particularly women. The reserve had in many ways become what researchers call a landscape of fear, a not so uncommon description of parks around the world. However, management and the majority of visitors feel the reserve has recovered from this period. This is in large part due to upgrades that improved recreational facilities and security in the reserve. Accounts from visitors high light how important a sense of safety is for people frequenting this reserve, most of who live in nearby neighbourhoods. The reserve still faces some challenges today, but is a significant asset to the City of Cape Town and many of its more marginalised residents. This study challenges much of the literature on the benefits of urban green space and associated parks. It shows that particularly in cities of the Global South such as Cape Town, parks require specific management strategies that prioritise safety and in doing so promote and ensure inclusivity for all...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{an early}} contact between Spain and the Philippine Island {{in the early}} 16 th century, the Spaniards did not {{successfully}} conquer the Philippines until 1571, during an expedition led by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. There after, Philippines became a colony of Spain. In provincial context particularly in southern Philippines, Spanish influence was hardly felt in Davao until 1848, when an expedition of 70 men and women led by Don Jose Cruz de Uyanguren, a native of Vergara, Guipuzcoa, Spain, came to establish a Christian settlement {{in an area of}} mangrove swamps that is not the Bolton Riverside. At the period, Davao was ruled by a chieftain named Datu Bago considered the most powerful datu in the Gulf area, strongly opposed Spanish intrusion and invasion of the region. However, despite the strong resistance of Datu Bago, he was defeated by Uyanguren’s religious mission and subsequently rename the region Nueva Guipozcoa, a name taken from his home in Spain. Heroism, the manifestation of great courage in a nation consistently <b>beset</b> <b>by</b> adversity, <b>poverty</b> and a long history of captivity by foreign powers, has been a defining factor in the Philippine nation’s history. Thus, the study seeks to explore the life of Datu Bago and how he resisted Spanish colonialism, thereafter commended his heroism in the province. In fact, a Dato Bago award is given every area on its outstanding residents in Davao who have brought honor and distinction to their home city. Moreover, despite his well known contribution in the region, his life and role has not been revealed in the study of Philippine history...|$|R

They {{are vulnerable to}} social, political and natural disasters, but also bear great opportunities for economic and social development. Most of European trade with China and Japan is shipped through the Straits of Malacca. Most of the energy requirements of Japan depend on oil shipments from the golf states through the Straits of Malacca. The Straits have for centuries connected the Indian subcontinent with East and Southeast Asia as well as Europe with China {{as an alternative to}} the Northern 'Silk Road'. The states bordering the Straits, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore form the core of the ASEAN region, one of the growth poles of the developing world.

40|$|In {{the context}} of East African pastoralism, {{improved}} risk management is proposed to offer ways to promote wealth conservation, reduce poverty, mitigate conflicts, and enhance food security at the household level. The Pastoral Risk Management (PARIMA) project is a multi-disciplinary, effort funded by USAID from 1997 to 2006. The two main components of the project include research arid outreach. The study area extends from Hagremariam in southern Ethiopia to Isiolo and Baringb Districts' in north-central Kenya. The study area represents an intact eco-marketing region, hosts 10 major ethnic groups, and is <b>beset</b> <b>by</b> pervasive <b>poverty,</b> violence, food insecurity, poor infrastructure, and inadequate public services: Research has focused on risk mapping, household survey, and community-level case studies to identify prominent risks for pastoralists, clarify pastoral coping strategies, and reveal possible Development interventions. Outreach disseminates research information among researchers, Development agents; policy makers, and communities. Outreach has also engaged in efforts to build awareness and capacity of pastoral communities and Development agents to implement risk-management interventions using pilot projects. Degree training has focused on master's and doctoral students, both in East Africa and the United States. Non-degree training includes workshops and interactive field tours for communities, Development facilitators, and policy makers. One Development vision of the PARIMA project is based on how to promote household wealth accumulation and conservation via asset and income diversification. The process could involve encouraging households {{to become involved in}} more timely livestock sales before crises occur, putting some revenue in draught-proof alternative investments, and then focusing on how to achieve a degree of sustainable livelihood diversification. This paper reviews some general findings and experiences from the PARIMA project over the period 1997 to 2002, with a focus on work conducted in southern Ethiopia...|$|R
