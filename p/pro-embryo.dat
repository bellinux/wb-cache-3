In B. transvaalensis the basal cell of the <b>pro-embryo</b> divides longitudinally so that a globular tetrad which develops into a spherical suspensorless embryo, is formed. This embryo conforms to the Penaea Variation of the Asterad Type. The basal cell of the G. sutherlandii <b>pro-embryo</b> divides transversely resulting in a T-shaped tetrad. The embryo passes through a linear phase before a globular stage is reached. A linear, four-celled suspensor is formed. The embryo of G. sutherlandii falls under the Erodium Variation of the Asterad Type and is characterized by Periasami’s embryonic number 351.

40|$|In the new Brassica napus {{microspore}} culture system, wherein embryos with suspensors are formed, {{ab initio}} mimics zygotic embryogenesis. The system provides a powerful in vitro tool {{for studying the}} diverse developmental processes that take place during early stages of plant embryogenesis. Here, we studied in this new culture system both the temporal and spatial distribution of nuclear DNA synthesis places {{and the organization of}} the microtubular (MT) cytoskeleton, which were visualized with a refined whole mount immunolocalization technology and 3 D confocal laser scanning microscopy. A ‘mild’ heat stress induced microspores to elongate, to rearrange their MT cytoskeleton and to re-enter the cell cycle and perform a predictable sequence of divisions. These events {{led to the formation of}} a filamentous suspensor-like structure, of which the distal tip cell gave rise to the embryo proper. Cells of the developing <b>pro-embryo</b> characterized endoplasmic (EMTs) and cortical microtubules (CMTs) in various configurations in the successive stages of the cell cycle. However, the most prominent changes in MT configurations and nuclear DNA replication concerned the first sporophytic division occurring within microspores and the apical cell of the <b>pro-embryo.</b> Microspore embryogenesis was preceded by pre-prophase band formation and DNA synthesis. The apical cell of the <b>pro-embryo</b> exhibited a random organization of CMTs and, in relation to this, isotropic expansion occurred, mimicking the development of the apical cell of the zygotic situation. Moreover, the apical cell entered the S phase shortly before it divided transversally at the stage that the suspensor was 3 – 8 celled...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} lupin (Lupinus spp.) are grown in Australia as crop and pasture plants. Lupin {{breeding}}, and legume breeding in general, is {{constrained by the}} inability to produce doubled haploid (DH) plants, which would accelerate the selection and release of new varieties. This technology {{is still in the}} developmental phase for legumes, although other major grain crops such as wheat, barley, and canola successfully use DHs on a commercial scale. A new, reproducible method of microspore culture that leads to cell division and <b>pro-embryos</b> in lupin is reported here. Microspores at the late uninucleate stage of development are mechanically isolated from lupin buds and embryogenesis induced by a combined heat shock and sucrose starvation stress treatment. Addition of further components to the growth medium promotes division of up to 50 % of microspores to ≥ 16 cells within 24 h. Further development of these multicellular structures or <b>pro-embryos</b> appears to be limited by the rigid outer exine layer, which needs to rupture for continued cell division to the globular embryo stage. Further research is required to break this barrier to development of haploid lupin embryos...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to test the effects of explant type, auxin concentrations, culture media, and auxin concentrations on the induction and proliferation of somatic embryos of Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla. Seeds and cotyledons were used as explants and inoculated in culture media containing 1. 13, 2. 26, 3. 39 and 4. 52 µM dicamba or 4. 14, 10. 35, 20. 71 and 31. 06 µM picloram. Embryogenic calli induced in the picloram treatments were used as explants and inoculated in semisolid or liquid media containing 4. 14, 10. 35, 20. 71 and 31. 06 µM picloram and keeping the origin of the embryogenic callus (seeds or cotyledons) and the concentration of picloram in those who were in the induction phase. Statistical, descriptive and anatomical analyses were performed. Induction of somatic <b>pro-embryos</b> into the juvenile plant material of Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla was performed using seeds or cotyledons as the source of explants, with the addition of dicamba and picloram as growth regulators. The use of cotyledons as a source of explants and the concentration of 4. 1 µM picloram added to the culture media resulted in a higher induction of somatic <b>pro-embryos.</b> Proliferation of secondary somatic embryos was achieved using liquid medium added with picloram...|$|R

During 42 days in culture, the cell growth pattern of both cultures was similar. The pH of the culture medium of both BM 0 and BM 2 underwent progressive reduction during culture time. For both the embryogenic cultures a preferential uptake of glucose in the late stages of cell growth kinetics was observed. The extracellular protein content was similar for both the embryogenic cultures.

40|$|The ovule of Ornithogalum dubium is anatropic, bitegmic and crassinucellate. The integuments are biseriate. Starch grains {{occur in}} the outer integument, the funicule and in the {{intercellular}} space surrounding the embryo-sac. The embryo-sac development is of the Polygonum type. The synergids are conspicuous and contain a large filiform apparatus. Fertilization is porogamic and occurs 24 h after pollination. The pollen tube enters the egg apparatus {{in the region of}} an intercellular space between the micropylar ends of the synergids. Sperm cells in the pollen tube appear to be released through small protuberances of the pollen tube. Migration of the sperm cell to the egg cell is possibly through a gap in the wall between the egg cell and the receptive synergid. Changes in the synergids occur only after a pollen tube has entered the receptive synergid. Changes occurring in the persistent synergid suggest that this cell may be involved in the nutrition of the <b>pro-embryo</b> up to the eight-cell <b>pro-embryo</b> stage.

40|$|Key message Somatic {{embryogenesis}} {{has never}} been reported in ferns. The study showed that {{it is much easier}} to evoke the acquisition and expression of embryogenic competence in ferns than in spermatophytes. Abstract We discovered that the tree fern Cyathea del-gadii offers an effective model for the reproducible and rapid formation of somatic embryos on hormone-free medium. Our study provides cyto-morphological evidence for the single cell origin and development of somatic embryos. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) in both primary and secondary explants was induced on half-strength micro-and macro-nutrients Murashige and Skoog medium without the application of exogenous plant growth regulators, in darkness. The early stage of SE was characterized by sequential perpendicular cell divisions of an individual epidermal cell of etiolated stipe explant. These resulted in the formation of a linear <b>pro-embryo.</b> Later their devel-opment resembled that of the zygotic embryo. We defined three morphogenetic stages of fern somatic embryo development: linear, early and late embryonic leaf stage. The transition from somatic embryo to juvenile sporophyte was quick and proceeded without interruption caused by dormancy. Following 9 weeks of culture the efficiency of somatic embryogenesis reached 12 – 13 embryos per responding explant. Spontaneous formation of somatic embryos and callus production, which improved the effectiveness of the process sevenfold in 10 -month-long culture, occurred without subculturing. The tendency for C. delgadii to propagate by SE in vitro makes this species an excellent model for studies relating to asexual embryo-genesis and the endogenous hormonal regulation of that process and opens new avenues of experimentation...|$|E
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the presence}} of nuclear bodies and particularly Cajal bodies during representative stages of gametophytic and haploid embryogenic development in isolated microspore and anther cultures of a model system (Brassica napus cv. Topas) and a recalcitrant species (Capsicum annuum L. var. Yolo Wonder B). The nuclear bodies domain is involved on several important roles on nuclear metabolism, and Cajal bodies are specifically involved on the storage and maturation of both snRNPs and snoRNPs, {{as well as other}} splicing factors, necessary for mRNA and pre-rRNA processing, but not directly on the transcription. In this study, immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling with anti-trimethylguanosine antibodies against the specific cap of snRNAs, ultrastructural and cytochemical analysis were performed on cryoprocessed samples at confocal and electron microscopy respectively. Results showed that Cajal bodies increase during the early stages of microspore embryogenic development (young <b>pro-embryos),</b> compared to microspore and pollen development. Our results suggest that Cajal bodies may have a role in the transcriptionally active, proliferative stages that characterise early microspore embryogenic development...|$|R
40|$|We have {{optimized}} {{a system}} for the somatic embryogenesis via embryogenic suspension cultures in bitter melon (Momordica charantia L.). Friable calli could be induced in 30 -day-old leaves on semi-solid MS [Murashige, T., Skoog, F., 1962. A revised medium for rapid growth and bioassays with tobacco tissue cultures. Physiol. Plant. 15, 473 - 497. ] medium supplemented with 1. 0 mg/l 2, 4 -D. Large number of globular embryos (24. 6 %) were noticed when the calli was subcultured in liquid medium containing 1. 5 mg/l 2, 4 -D. The complete removal of 2, 4 -D in the later stages of culture, stimulated their further development to heart and torpedo stages. Microscopic examination revealed the ontogeny of somatic cell development via the formation of cell clusters, which then enlarged to <b>pro-embryos,</b> and gave rise to heart and torpedo stages within a period of 2 weeks. Somatic embryos successfully germinated on agarified MS medium with no additional growth regulators. An effect of media, other components and stimulating factors such as carbohydrates, amino acids has also been evaluated for somatic embryogenesis. The full strength NIS medium containing 50 mg/l PVP and 40 mg/l glutamine was effective to achieve a high frequency of somatic embryo induction, maturation and further development. An average of 6. 2 % young plants was achieved from friable callus and was phenotypically normal. To our knowledge, there is no published report on somatic embryogenesis of bitter melon (M. charantia L.) via embryogenic callus or cell suspension cultures. These results are likely to facilitate genetic transformation of bitter melon. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{embryogenesis}} {{is regulated}} by differential {{distribution of the}} plant hormone auxin. However, the cells establishing these gradients during microspore embryogenesis remain to be identified. For the first time, we describe, using the DR 5 or DR 5 rev reporter gene systems, the GFP- and GUS-based auxin biosensors to monitor auxin during Brassica napus androgenesis at cellular resolution in the initial stages. Our study provides evidence that the distribution of auxin changes during embryo development and depends on the temperature-inducible in vitro culture conditions. For this, microspores (mcs) were induced to embryogenesis by heat treatment and then subjected to genetic modification via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The duration of high temperature treatment had a significant influence on auxin distribution in isolated and in vitro-cultured microspores and on microspore-derived embryo development. In the "mild" heat-treated (1 day at 32 A degrees C) mcs, auxin localized in a polar way already at the uni-nucleate microspore, which was critical for the initiation of embryos with suspensor-like structure. Assuming a mean mcs radius of 20 mu m, endogenous auxin content in a single cell corresponded to concentration of 1. 01 mu M. In mcs subjected to a prolonged heat (5 days at 32 A degrees C), although auxin concentration increased dozen times, auxin polarization was set up at a few-celled <b>pro-embryos</b> without suspensor. Those embryos were enclosed in the outer wall called the exine. The exine rupture was accompanied by the auxin gradient polarization. Relative quantitative estimation of auxin, using time-lapse imaging, revealed that primordia possess up to 1. 3 -fold higher amounts than {{those found in the}} root apices of transgenic MDEs in the presence of exogenous auxin. Our results show, for the first time, which concentration of endogenous auxin coincides with the first cell division and how the high temperature interplays with auxin, by what affects delay early establishing microspore polarity. Moreover, we present how the local auxin accumulation demonstrates the apical-basal axis formation of the androgenic embryo and directs the axiality of the adult haploid plant...|$|R
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of {{flowering}} plants alternates between a diploid sporophytic and a haploid gametophytic phase. Successful reproduction depends on fate specification of the gametic cells within the embryo sac and on double fertilization. This double fertilization event is initiated by fusion of the central cell {{with one of the}} two sperm cells as well as fusion of the egg cell with the other sperm cell, which gives rise to the endosperm and the embryo, respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms of cell fate specification during female gametophyte development remain elusive and gene expression programs in different cell types of early embryos are largely unknown. Here, we show that ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM 1 (AMP 1) is required to prevent cell fate substitution within the embryo sac in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function mutations in AMP 1 result in supernumerary egg cells at the expense of synergid cells allowing for twin embryo formation. However, generation of twin embryos usually precludes endosperm formation, which eventually leads to ovule abortion. Remarkably, in such a case, ovule abortion can be overcome by delivering functional supernumerary sperm cells in tetraspore (tes) pollen, thereby enabling the formation of twin plants. AMP 1 expression in sporophytic tissue is sufficient to suppress the formation of supernumerary egg cells and the twin-embryo phenotype, indicating that one or more mobile factors are involved in synergid fate specification and that the surrounding tissue can contribute to the patterning process of the female gametophyte. This work highlights the importance of specifying two synergids and only one egg cell within the female gametophyte to ensure successful reproduction. The second part of this thesis includes a technique that integrates nuclear sorting by flow cytometry and subsequent microarray analysis to generate transcriptome datasets of different cell types in the Arabidopsis early embryo. The results presented indicate that the majority of genes are similarly expressed in the <b>pro-embryo</b> and the suspensor but that a number of genes with supposedly important functions during embryogenesis showed different expression patterns. This technique and the resource presented will assist further studies of early embryogenesis. In addition, this technique can also be applicable to other inaccessible tissues with a limited number of cells...|$|E
40|$|The senior {{author has}} long been engaged to {{establish}} the chromosome map of rice plant by the usual F_ 2 analysis method. The results were rather fruitless notwithstanding the enormous F_ 2 combinations were analyzed. Recently the present authors tried to introduce another methods to promote this study, namely teisomic and translocation analysis using the lines which were obtained in the progenies of atomic bombed rice plants in Nagasaki. However, these materials were not desirable for trisomic analysis, the authors decided furthermore to propuce 12 kinds of primary trisomic lines from triploid plants artificially. This attempt {{was supported by the}} fact that 12 kinds of primary trisomic lines are theoretically well known as the haploid chromosome number of the rice plant is 12. In the first step, in order to obtain triploid rice plants, the authors attempted to crossbetween diploid and auto-tetraploid. During three years from 1959 to 1961, 9822 flowers were crossed reciprocally after usual hot water emasculation method. From these crossings, 77 normal fully developed grains and 947 wrinkled imperfect grains were obtained, although seed setting was better when the tetraploid plant was used as maternal plant than reciprocal crosses. Normal grains germinated well and grew to maturity, but only two of them, that is 0. 022 % of pollinated flowers, were true triploids and the others were maternal ones. Germination of imperfect grains were bad, representing 16 % of 177 seeds sown, and no viable seedlings were obtained. Weight and germination rate of imperfect grains were also better in 4 X× 2 X crosses than reciprocals. To make clear what is the cause of difficulty for getting triploid rice plants by crossing between diploid and tetraploid plants, embryological studies were carried on and the results were as follows. In the selfed seeds, both diploid and tetraploid, normal growth and development were observed and the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd foliage leaves were differentiated on 5, 7 and 9 days after pollination respectively. Accumulation of polysaccharides in young primordia of embryonal organs proceeded quite normally and development of endosperm was also normal. In the hybrid seeds of 2 X× 4 X, growth and differentiation were very poor and abnormal, that is, in the most advanced cases <b>pro-embryo</b> or sign of differentiation were only observed and no progress of differentiation were found. On the other sides endosperm developed pretty normally during 3 days after pollination, but soon afterwards it began to degenerate and entirely collapsed at the end. In the hybrid seeds of 4 X× 2 X, development of embryo was better than that of 2 X× 4 X, and the differentiation of 1 st and 2 nd foliage leaves were observed in the materials of 5 days and 7 or 9 days after pollination respectively. As compared with the selfed samples, differentiational feature was nearly equal to selfed 4 X embryos and a little inferior to selfed 2 X embryos and very malformed types were observed. In spite of such abnormal differentiation mentioned above, the growth was very vigorous and final size of the matured embryo was rather larger than the selfed ones. Development of hybrid embryo was thought to finish at 9 days after pollination. The development of endosperm was normal in earlier stage and exceeded the selfed one till 3 days after pollination but soon afterwards it rushed in degeneration process and most of the matured endosperm was collapsed. From the above experiment, the authors concluded that the difficulty of obtaining the triploid rice plants by crossing between diploid and auto-tetraploid plants was not due to the failure of fertilization but to the poor development of embryo and endosperm and unbalanced development of these organs. In addition, the authors discussed the introduction of the embryo-culture method and the improvement of crossing technique to facilitate the efficiency for getting triploid rice plants from the literature. 1. イネの染色体地図作成の効率を高めるために, 3 染色体植物の利用を企図し,そのためまず 3 倍体イネの育成を試みた. 2. 1959 ～ 61 年の 3 ヵ年間に約 9000 花の 4 倍体× 2 倍体間の相反交雑を試み, 77 粒の完全種子と 948 粒の不完全種子を得た. 着粒率は 4 倍体を母親にした場合が逆交配より勝れていた. 3. 完全種子から 65 個体の植物を養成できたが真性 3 倍体は僅かに 2 個体(0. 022 %) にすぎず,他は母型の 2 倍体または 4 倍体であつた. 不完全種子は 16 %の発芽を示したが 1 個体のみが 4 葉期まで生育して枯死し,他は鞘葉を伸長したのみで枯死した. 4. 温湯除雄後放任した頴花では, 2 倍体と 4 倍体で着粒性の相違がみられ, 2 倍体には不完全種子はなく,極めて低率に完全種子が得られたのに対し, 4 倍体では 1 %の不完全種子と 3. 4 %の完全種子が得られた. 5. 4 倍体× 2 倍体交雑の不和合性を究明するために,授粉後 3, 5, 7, 9 日目の種子の永久標本を作つて,種子の発達過程を組織学的,顕微化学的に観察して次の知見を得た.
