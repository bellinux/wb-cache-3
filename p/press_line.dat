The blank aluminium sheet is stretched over the lower draw die and openings are cut with robots transferring the panels between processes.

In 1956 he took 500 sets of the remaining unbound sheets for three of his titles and had them bound in paper covers {{as part of the}} Fantasy Press [...] "Golden Science Fiction Library", which he then marketed (mostly at conventions)for $1.00 apiece. And, as a favor to Martin Greenberg over at Gnome Press, Eshbach utilized his position as director of the Church Center Press in 1961 to assist in the production of two of the last Gnome Press titles, Invaders from the Infinite, by John W. Campbell, Jr., and The Vortex Blaster, by Edward E. Smith - both titles which Eshbach had held the rights to but had transferred to Gnome. As part of his agreement with Greenberg, Eshbach also produced a limited run (about one hundred copies of the Campbell book, and 300 of the Smith) of each title on better-quality book paper under the Fantasy Press logo, which have since become among the most sought-after titles in the Fantasy <b>Press</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{optimization}} of a <b>press</b> <b>line</b> {{part for the}} manufacture of reflectors present at the Automotive Lighting Company, Jihlava. The first part focuses on describing the current workplace layout of the <b>press</b> <b>line.</b> The workplaces are located inconveniently and thus require {{a larger number of}} operators and a considerable amount of manual work. The second part of the thesis proposes layout solutions for the injection presses and for other machine parts. At the same time, a smoother transition design is proposed for the <b>press</b> <b>line</b> and for the manufacturing section that follows. Based on an evaluation of selected criteria, the optimum version is chosen, thereby adding to the efficiency of the molding process by reducing the number of operators required, by lowering the proportion of manual work relative to other activities, and by limiting the risk of poor quality. The conclusion of the thesis sums up the necessary investment costs and offers an economic assessment of introducing the selected <b>press</b> <b>line</b> arrangement to operation...|$|E
40|$|An {{off-line}} optimization of a sheet-metal <b>press</b> <b>line</b> {{is performed}} with improved production performances, {{both in terms}} of increased production rate and smoother robot motions. Smooth motions prevent the sheet-metal to slide out of position or even fall out, thereby causing lengthy down times. The simulation based method use a process optimizer connected to a time synchronized virtual manufacturing model including real industrial control systems, e. g. PLC. The key benefit herein is that all tuned control system parameters can be directly downloaded to the real <b>press</b> <b>line</b> without any post-processing or transformations. The challenge to find suitable optimization algorithms for a <b>press</b> <b>line</b> that handle highly nonlinear, discontinuous functions; considerable number of parameters; and long evaluation times is reached...|$|E

40|$|Simulation-based {{optimisation}} often considers computationally expensive problems. Successfully optimising {{such large}} scale and complex problems within a practical timeframe is a challenging task. Optimisation techniques to fulfil this {{need to be}} developed. A technique to address this involves decomposing the considered problem into smaller subproblems. These subproblems are then optimised separately. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for simulation-based optimisation is proposed. The proposed algorithm extends the cooperative coevolutionary algorithm, which optimises subproblems separately. To optimise the subproblems, the proposed algorithm enables using a deterministic algorithm, next to stochastic genetic algorithms, getting the flexibility of using either type. It also includes a constructive heuristic that creates good initial feasible solutions {{to reduce the number}} of fitness calculations. The extension enables solving complex, computationally expensive problems efficiently. The proposed algorithm has been applied on automated sheet metal press lines from the automotive industry. This is a highly complex optimisation problem due to its non-linearity and high dimensionality. The optimisation problem is to find control parameters that maximises the line's production rate. These control parameters determine velocities, time constants, and cam values for critical interactions between components. A simulation model is used for the fitness calculation during the optimisation. The results show that the proposed algorithm manages to solve the <b>press</b> <b>line</b> optimisation problem efficiently. This is a step forward in <b>press</b> <b>line</b> optimisation since this is to the authors' knowledge the first time a <b>press</b> <b>line</b> has been optimised efficiently in this way...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{simulation}} {{is needed}} {{as one of}} the tools for optimum utilization of a <b>press</b> <b>line.</b> Utilization includes: high throughput, minimum ware of the line and high quality. High quality includes quality of the produced parts, quality of the stamping dies and quality of the tooling manufactured. In order to perform efficient geometrical simulation and virtual commissioning in stamping, two main fields are investigated namely simulation time and optimization time. Thus, reducing computation time is the main theme of this thesis. An efficient <b>press</b> <b>line</b> simulation model is built and verified, resulting in reduced simulation building time due to the modularization of the model. To reduce simulation time, collision detection time is reduced by a method based on 3 D to 2 D geometrical collision detection. The method is based on pre-calculation of all collision points in the environment of interest, and then using a simplified collision detection model in a simulation based optimization. This is less resource consuming than collision checking the original 3 D objects for all optimization evaluations. The suggested approach reduces the collision detection from a 3 D to a 2 D problem, where collision between simplified but moving curves is used in the repeated simulation for optimization. This collision detection approach, together with a simplified implementation of the control code, results in ~ 200 times reduction of the computation time, compared to the original simulation based on standard 3 D collision detection. The variable parameters in a <b>press</b> <b>line</b> exceed 100, resulting in time/computationally demanding computations. There is also a need of fast optimizations for die design, line tryout and ramp-up. Since the number of evaluations grows exponentially with the number of dimensions in an optimization problem, optimization time is reduced by a decomposition strategy aiming at dimension reduction. Two simulation/optimization strategies were chosen and tested to decrease calculations. The presented results mean that simulation and virtual commissioning can be performed not only for press stations but also for complete press lines, where the complexity increases linearly with the number of stations in the line.
