40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{analysis}} of North Korean ports {{in the light of}} existing models and cases of port system evolution. In particular, it reviews the economical and political factors shaping port concentration in developed, developing, and socialist countries. A database on vessel movements allows for the analysis of individual North Korean port traffic by total capacity circulated, cargo type, fleet nationality, immediate origin and destination, and berthing time between 1985 and 2005. On the one hand, results confirm broader trends such as geopolitical change from socialist trade to isolation, and new inter-Korean relations. On the other hand, the geography of North Korean port traffic combines elements of both socialist and developing countries. While ideological factors and military control hamper <b>port</b> <b>modernization</b> and trade openness, traffic concentration at the Pyongyang-Nampo gateway highlights the gradual precedence taken by economical factors over political factors. This is also explained by spatial polarization in the capital region at the expense of Eastern ports for which inland transport limitations and industrial decline have become major issues.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{capacity}} of the USA coast port industry to sustain the development of the US economic system, which is predicted to undergo further strong expansion throughout the period up to 2020. The analysis is based on the observation that GDP depends on international trade, which in turn depends on maritime transport and therefore on the efficiency of the United States coast port industry system. The paper also points out that in many respects the US coast port industrial system is very efficient. It boasts a large number of ports, strategically located, efficient in their production specialization and competitiveness; in addition, the US coast ports are integrated with the national intermodal system. Despite this, the system reveals numerous weaknesses that need to be addressed. The most evident deficiencies involve land access to the <b>ports,</b> inadequate <b>modernization</b> of the intermodal system, dredging and its funding, the power the liner shipping companies wield over the ports, container terminal productivity, the organization of dock work and labour. A number of interesting proposals emerge, to some extent favourably re-assessing the role of federal coordination in the maritime transport sector and putting forward the suggestion of a form of specific financing for the transport sector rather than generic funding; this could be achieved by setting up a purpose-created bank and the subsequent emission of transportation bonds. The paper concludes with the assertion that although the US coast port industry is the most powerful in the world, measures need to be undertaken for technological, organizational and financial rationalization in the coast ports, considered synergically with the intermodal system. Such measures are vital in order to sustain the development that is expected for the period up to 2020; nevertheless, if the proposed measures are not carried out or prove to require a longer time period for completion, this would not lead to an irremediable breakdown, although it would certainly cause a noticeable slow-down of development [...] US coast ports, US maritime transport, intermodality, ports weaknesses, dredging, naval gigantisms, transport bonds...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographySummary Trade between Africa and South America is of {{relatively}} minor importance for each region. The {{main purpose of}} this report is {{to determine if a}} scarcity of maritime transport services could explain this comparative unimportance. More than half of all trade between the two regions is accounted for by just ten specific bilateral flows in petroleum, grain, iron ore, coal, and sugar. Almost all inter-regional trade moves by sea, mostly by non-liner charter shipping services. Trade between Africa and South America is subject to relatively low freight rates, mainly due to the type of products traded, which are of a bulk nature rather than manufactured goods. Trade patterns are the main determinant of the supply of transport services, and there is little trade between Africa and South America for historical reasons, the lack of preferential trade agreements between the two regions, and because their economies do not necessarily complement each other. Wherever there is a demand for transport, be it for Argentinean grain in Egypt, for cotton from Benin in Brazil, for iron ore from Brazil in South Africa, or for petroleum from Nigeria in Chile, no fundamental shortage of supply of shipping services can be identified. There appears to exist a potential to generally reduce international transport costs in Africa and South America by <b>port</b> <b>modernization...</b>|$|E
