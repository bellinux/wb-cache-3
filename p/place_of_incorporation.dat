The first part focuses on entry into foreign markets in general, {{the introduction of the}} company and providing basic information on the United States. The next section concentrates on current activities of the company on the US market, reasons for further expansion and factors to be taken into consideration before setting up a new business. On the basis of analysis, consultations and information obtained, the outcome of the thesis is to outline the most suitable possibilities of starting and doing business in the USA. This recommendation will include two <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporations</b> and a type of business entity I consider to be the most appropriate for a new business set up by Czech nationals...|$|R

40|$|The uneven {{projection}} of voices from or {{within a community}} can be addressed, in part, by methods such as digital storytelling in a technology and media-savvy society. Whilst the use of digital storytelling to facilitate constructive dialogue has proved successful for those who participate, instilling a sense of motivation to become involved at the outset can pose a challenge. Members {{of different types of}} community groups, whether geo-physical or practice-based, will not necessarily be drawn to involvement in social action through group workshops without prior personal engagement. This paper considers which other participatory media techniques can be employed to encourage involvement in community digital storytelling workshops to inspire activism, and examines barriers to participation, with emphasis on the necessity of mandate, for project success. To help answer these issues, one particular workshop in a case study in North Yorkshire, UK will be used to identify the importance <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> methods when undertaking community digital storytelling. </p...|$|R

50|$|On the {{position}} of the largest dam there are two hypotheses, which have been discussed in the literature. One of them suggests a fairly favourable location directly below Nero's villa, where the valley narrows to a bottleneck. The other theory proposes a place further down the stream, near San Mauro stream - where a field is found by the riverbank. According to Arnold Esch, the original location of the dam is indisputedly the narrow area at the Ponte di San Mauro, the stream joining the Aniene at the roach to Arcinazzo. In that <b>place,</b> traces <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> into the rockface can be seen and a bit further downriver cement residue, i.e. Roman concrete from the mortar, has been found.

This Policy Paper seeks to demystify this aspect of the debate over the future of the Human Rights Act, examining the terms of the Good Friday Agreement as an international treaty and peace agreement and explaining its interrelationship with both the Human Rights Act and the Devolution Acts. Once some of the hyperbole that surrounds the Agreement and its attendant domestic legislation is removed, {{it can be seen that}} {{the impact of}} the Agreement is in some regards more extensive than has to date been recognised, whilst in other respects the Agreement has less impact than some of the supporters of the Human Rights Act claim.

40|$|After {{the recent}} ECJ’s {{case-law}} on EC {{freedom of establishment}} (cases Centros, Überseering and Inspire Art), regulatory competition for corporate laws takes place within the EU at the early stage <b>of</b> the <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> new companies. On the contrary, as regarding the “moving-out” of companies from the country <b>of</b> <b>incorporation,</b> the ECJ considered once (case Daily Mail) a tax law restriction against the transfer abroad of the administrative seat as compatible with EC freedom of establishment. For years, this decision has been considered as applicable to whatever restriction <b>placed</b> by countries <b>of</b> <b>incorporation,</b> even to the forced liquidation of the “emigrating” company. This paper will address the issue as to whether EC freedom of establishment really allows Member States to place whatever limit on the “emigration” of nationally registered companies. I will argue that EC freedom of establishment covers {{the transfer of the}} administrative seat as well as the transfer of the registered office and, therefore, that the country <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> can not liquidate “emigrating” companies. In addition, I will address the question as to whether a new Directive is needed allowing the transfer of companies’ registered office and identity preserving company law changes. I will argue that such a Directive is necessary to avoid legal uncertainty and to protect interests of employees, creditors and minority shareholders, among others, which could be detrimentally affected by the “emigration” of national companies...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, the U. S. Circuit Courts of Appeals have been divided {{on how to}} {{determine}} the citizenship of dissolved or inactive corporations {{for the purposes of}} diversity jurisdiction. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, courts of appeals addressing the issue had settled on one of three conclusions: (1) citizenship should be determined only by the corporation’s state of incorporation; (2) citizenship should be determined both by the corporation’s state <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> and its last principal <b>place</b> <b>of</b> business; or (3) citizenship should always be determined by the corporation’s state <b>of</b> <b>incorporation,</b> but only be determined by principal <b>place</b> <b>of</b> business on a case-by-case basis. In 2010, the U. S. Supreme Court in Hertz Corp. v. Friend clarified the standard for determining an active corporation’s principal <b>place</b> <b>of</b> business. Two years later, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Holston Investments, Inc. B. V. I. v. LanLogistics Corp. ruled that the reasoning of Hertz settled the debate over the citizenship of dissolved or inactive corporations: only the inactive or dissolved corporation’s state <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> determines citizenship. This Note argues that although Hertz provided useful guidance to the courts of appeals on how to determine the citizenship of dissolved and inactive corporations, the Eleventh Circuit misinterpreted that guidance. The Eleventh Circuit should have adopted a modified version of an existing rule, which always factors both an inactive or dissolved corporation’s state <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> and its last principal <b>place</b> <b>of</b> business when determining citizenship. This test better accords with the Court’s reasoning in Hertz, the intent behind the statutory definition of corporate citizenship, and broader principles of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction...|$|R

40|$|In animal {{cells and}} fungi, {{cytokinesis}} {{is achieved by}} constriction of an actomyosin-based ring assembled during mitosis. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an excellent model organism for unraveling cell division controls by combining molecular genetics with cell biology approaches. Once spatially defined, the ring assembly site is the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> sequential <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> a set of proteins during mitotic progression, {{most of which are}} evolutionarily conserved. Then, fission yeast divides medially to produce equally sized daughter cells. In the past years, several studies have explored mechanisms of division site determination. It has been demonstrated that positive signals for division plane positioning originate from the central region. Position of the predivided nucleus and the anilin-related protein Mid 1 give spatial cues to establish the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> ring formation. In addition, negative signals controlled by the DYRK Pom 1 kinase and emanating from the cell ends restrict ring formation in the central region. This dual system prevents illegitimate cell division outside the centre of the cell and subsequent polyploid cell formation. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} the mitotic regulator Cdr 2 kinase is intrinsically involved in division plane specification by binding to Mid 1 at the cell equator during interphase. Moreover, nuclear-to-cytoplasm shuttling of Mid 1 is another independent crucial mechanism that couples nuclear position with the actomyosin ring assembly site late in the G 2 phase. Kin 1, another kinase that regulates morpho-genesis and intracellular organization, shares an essential function with Pom 1 in cytokinesis. Recent advances have also identified distinct pathways involved in completion of CAR formation. Therefore, multiple regulatory mechanisms act in parallel to accurately specify and build up the actomyosin ring at the centre of the cell. Concomitant inhibition of these pathways dramatically affects cytokinesis and cell viability. Here we present these redundant pathways that contribute to faithful distribution of the genetic material into daughter cells...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} Hispanic levels <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> {{and access to}} health care. Applying the Aday and Andersen framework {{for the study of}} access, the study examined the relationship between two levels <b>of</b> Hispanic <b>incorporation</b> into U.

Data for the study were drawn from a 1992 telephone survey of 600 randomly selected Hispanics in Houston and Harris County. ^ The hypotheses tested were: (1) Hispanics who are incorporated into mainstream society {{are more likely to have}} better potential and realized access to health care than those who are incorporated into ethnic-group enclaves regardless of their socioeconomic status (SES), health status and health needs, and (2) there is no interaction between the levels <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> (mainstream or ethnic) and SES, health status, and health needs in predicting potential and realized access. ^ The data analysis supported Hypothesis One for the two measures of potential access. The results of bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that for Hispanics in Houston and Harris County, being in the 2 ̆ 2 mainstream 2 ̆ 2 incorporation category increased their potential access to care, having 2 ̆ 2 health insurance 2 ̆ 2 and a 2 ̆ 2 regular <b>place</b> <b>of</b> care 2 ̆ 2. For the selected measure of realized access, having a 2 ̆ 2 regular check-up 2 ̆ 2, the analysis did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in having a regular check-up among Hispanics incorporated in the ethnic or mainstream incorporation categories. ^ Hypothesis Two, that there is no interaction between the levels <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> and socioeconomic characteristics, health status, and health needs in predicting potential and realized access among Hispanics was supported by the data. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for socioeconomic status, health status, and health needs, the association between 2 ̆ 2 level <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> 2 ̆ 2 and the two measures of potential access (2 ̆ 2 health insurance 2 ̆ 2 and having a 2 ̆ 2 usual <b>place</b> <b>of</b> care 2 ̆ 2) was not modified by the control variables nor by their interaction with level <b>of</b> <b>incorporation.</b> That is, the effect <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> on Hispanics 2 ̆ 7 health insurance coverage, and having a usual <b>place</b> <b>of</b> care, was homogenous across Hispanics with different SES and health status. ^ The main research implication of this dissertation is the employment of a theoretical framework for the assessment of cultural factors essential to research on migrating heterogeneous subpopulations. It also provided strategies to solve practical and methodological difficulties in the secondary analyses of data on these populations. ...|$|R
