50|$|In {{offshore}} {{and marine}} installations, a three-spindle screw pump {{is often used}} to pump high-pressure viscous fluids. Three screws drive the <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid</b> forth in a closed chamber. As the screws rotate in opposite directions, the <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid</b> moves along the screws' spindles.|$|E

50|$|Lobe {{pumps are}} similar to {{external}} gear pumps in operation in that fluid flows around {{the interior of the}} casing. Unlike external gear pumps, however, the lobes do not make contact. Lobe contact is prevented by external timing gears located in the gearbox. Pump shaft support bearings are located in the gearbox, and since the bearings are out of the <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid,</b> pressure is limited by bearing location and shaft deflection.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the Downton pump sought {{to create a more}} {{constant}} flow of <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid,</b> and a steadier load-state on the pump, by increasing the number of buckets operating in the pump. These buckets were actuated by means of a rotating crankshaft and connecting rods, which caused the buckets to reciprocate up and down, with each feeding the next with liquid. Hebert (1836) contains a description and cut-away illustration of an early Downton Pump.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. As the lobes {{come out}} of mesh, they create {{expanding}} volume on the inlet side of the <b>pump.</b> <b>Liquid</b> flows into the cavity and is trapped by the lobes as they rotate.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} is to <b>pump</b> <b>liquid</b> carbon dioxide into the concrete before mixing. This can reduce the carbon emissions from concrete production when combined with a power plant or other industry that produces CO2.|$|R
5000|$|Turbopumps to <b>pump</b> <b>liquid</b> {{propellants}} {{are complex}} to design, and can suffer serious failure modes, such as overspeeding if they run dry or shedding fragments {{at high speed}} if metal particles from the manufacturing process enter the pump.|$|R
50|$|An inducer is the axial inlet {{portion of}} a {{centrifugal}} pump rotor, the function {{of which is to}} raise the inlet head by an amount sufficient to prevent significant cavitation in the following pump stage. It is used in applications in which the inlet pressure of a pump is close to the vapor pressure of the <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid.</b> Inducers are frequently included in design of turbopumps for liquid propellant rocket engines, although they are used in other applications which require high suction performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{pumps are}} an internal-combustion fluidyne engine. Although fluidynes are now {{considered}} to be a form of the external combustion Stirling engine, the Humphrey pump was an early example of one using internal combustion. A fluidyne has few moving parts: although they may include various valves, their key feature is that a mass of liquid acts as their piston, rather than the more usual mechanical piston. They are normally used for pumping liquids and use the <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid</b> as its own piston.|$|E
50|$|A chopper pump is a {{centrifugal}} pump which {{is equipped with}} a cutting system to facilitate chopping/maceration of solids that are present in the <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid.</b> The main advantage of this type of pump is that it prevents clogging of the pump itself and of the adjacent piping, as all the solids and stringy materials are macerated by the chopping system. Chopper pumps exist in various configurations, including submersible and dry-installed design and they are typically equipped with an electric motor to run the impeller and to provide torque for the chopping system. Due to its high solids handling capabilities, the chopper pump is often used for pumping sewage, sludge, manure slurries, and other liquids that contain large or tough solids.|$|E
5000|$|Surface tension causes liquids in {{microgravity}} to form perfectly round spheres. This {{can cause}} problems {{when trying to}} <b>pump</b> <b>liquids</b> through a conduit, {{but it is very}} useful when perfect spheres of consistent size are needed for an application.|$|R

40|$|The {{surface energy}} {{present in a}} small drop of liquid is used to <b>pump</b> the <b>liquid</b> through a microchannel. The flow rate is {{determined}} by the volume of the drop present on the pumping port of the microchannel. A flow rate of 1. 25 mL s 21 is demonstrated using 0. 5 mL drops of water. Two other fluid manipulations are demonstrated using the passive <b>pumping</b> method: <b>pumping</b> <b>liquid</b> to a higher gravitational potential energy and creating a plug within a microchannel...|$|R
50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry. A set of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the pump suction in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the hydraulic parts of the pump. A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid</b> from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|E
50|$|Conventional SiC, or {{sometimes}} the less expensive SiSiC, {{have been used}} successfully for more than 25 years in slide or journal bearings of pumps. The <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid</b> itself provides the lubricant for the bearing. Very good corrosion resistance against practically all kinds of media, and very low wear and low friction coefficients are {{the basis of this}} success. These bearings consist of a static bearing, shrink-fitted in its metallic environment, and a rotating shaft sleeve, mounted on the shaft. Under compressive stress the ceramic static bearing has a low risk of failure, but a SiC shaft sleeve does not have this situation and must therefore have a large wall thickness and/or be specially designed. In large pumps with shafts 100-350 mm in diameter, the risk of failure is higher due to the changing requirements on the pump performance - for example, load changes during operation. The introduction of SiC/SiC as a shaft sleeve material has proven to be very successful. Test rig experiments showed an almost triple specific load capability of the bearing system with a shaft sleeve made of SiC/SiC, sintered SiC as static bearing, and water at 80 °C as lubricant.The specific load capacity of a bearing is usually given in W/mm2 and calculated as a product of the load (MPa), surface speed of the bearing (m/s) and friction coefficient; it is equal to the power loss of the bearing system due to friction.|$|E
5000|$|The K-Series was {{introduced}} in 1988 by Rover Group as a powerplant for the Rover 200 car. It was the second volume-production implementation of the low-pressure sand-casting (or LPS) technique in a new plant sited between East Works and Cofton Hackett. (The first volume application of the LPS process had been for the M-16 cylinder head, produced in South Works, adjacent to the former forge). The LPS process <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid</b> aluminium into a chemically-bonded sand mould from below. This reduced oxide inclusions and gave a casting yield of around 90%, compared with 60% for more conventional gravity casting processes. The process avoided many of the inherent problems of casting aluminium components and consequently permitted lower casting wall thickness and higher strength-to-weight ratios. However, the process required the use of heat-treated LM25 material which gave the engines {{a reputation for being}} fragile. An engine overheat would often result in the material becoming annealed and rendering the components scrap. The aluminium engine blocks were fitted with spun-cast iron cylinder liners that were initially manufactured by GKN's Sheepbridge Stokes of Chesterfield, but these were replaced by liners made by Goetze after some seminal research conducted by Charles Bernstein at Longbridge, which proved influential even to Ducati for their race engines. Unfortunately a large number of aftermarket engines, the so-called [...] "VHPD"s", were built with the old substandard GKNs by Minister, Lotus and PTP well after the Goetze liner's introduction to the production line in 2000.|$|E

50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (in-line circulating pump, typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating pump rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the <b>pumped</b> <b>liquid,</b> causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive suction head (NPSH).|$|E

They are therefore often used where contactless force is required, where low maintenance is desirable, or where the duty cycle is low.

40|$|We {{describe}} two novel centrifugal microfluidic platform {{designs that}} enable passive <b>pumping</b> of <b>liquids</b> radially inward while {{the platform is}} in motion. The first design uses an immiscible liquid to displace an aqueous solution back towards {{the center of the}} platform, while the second design uses an arbitrary <b>pumping</b> <b>liquid</b> with a volume of air between it and the solution being pumped. Both designs demonstrated the ability to effectively pump 55 % to 60 % of the solution radially inward at rotational frequencies as low as 400 rpm (6. 7 Hz) to 700 rpm (11. 7 Hz). The pumping operations reached completion within 120 s and 400 s respectively. These platform designs for passive <b>pumping</b> of <b>liquids</b> do not require moving parts or complex fabrication techniques. They offer great potential for increasing the number of sequential operations that can be performed on centrifugal microfluidic platforms, thereby reducing a fundamental limitation often associated with these platforms...|$|R
