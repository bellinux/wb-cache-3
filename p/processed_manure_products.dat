De-contamination may be conducted by extended storage, until field conditions are suitable for application to land as source of agricultural nutrients. Results: The hygienic evaluation of manure and slurry coming from a plant that collects cattle livestock wastes from a big slaughterhouse was carried out. Samples were even collected from spillages {{in the area around}} the plant. Microbial analyses highlighted the massive presence of faecal indicators in all samples: mean counts of Escherichia coli and enterococci were always above EU limits for marketable <b>processed</b> <b>manure</b> <b>products.</b> Cultures referable to the genus Brucella spp. were recorded in two samples of fresh manure but not in the aged ones. Conventional isolation techniques failed to detect members of the Mycobacterium genus, while by means of IS 900 and F 57 PCR real-time system on DNA directly extracted from environmental samples, the pathogen was detected in all cases. Conclusions: Thoughtful design of manure storage infrastructure is critical to prevent spills and over-topping of an open structure. The documented overload situation seems to lay the basis for an ongoing environmental contamination by enteric organisms and opportunistic pathogens circuit faecal-oral route. Moreover, the type of wastes analysed during this study, namely a mixture of fresh cattle manure, bedding and rumen content, needs a longer storage period or, alternatively, of specific chemical, biological or thermal treatments for stabilization...|$|E
30|$|The solid/liquid {{separation}} of manures usually generates one clarified fraction with good levels of NH 4 +-nitrogen and one nutrient-rich organic solid fraction for multiple uses (Zhang and Westerman 1997; Møller et al. 2000, 2002; Petersen et al. 2007; Jørgensen and Jensen 2009; Hjorth et al. 2010) with subsequent optimization of crop nutrient management (Meade et al. 2011). Composting process can further enhance solid fraction recycling (Moral et al. 2009; Brito et al. 2012): {{it can be}} performed {{with or without the}} addition of co-substrates and/or bulking agents (Georgakakis et al. 1996; Roca-Pérez et al. 2007; Bernal et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2006; Nolan et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Bustamante et al. 2012).

As a matter of fact, the slow release of nutrients connected to these amendments was found to significantly minimize the risk of gas emissions into atmosphere (Ball et al. 2004), provided that appropriate timing of N application is set up to avoid wet conditions, which could lead to high N 2 O fluxes by denitrification (Hayakawa et al. 2009). Moreover, increasing the use of organic amendments would help to reduce the application rate of N fertilizers that is recognized as the most effective measure of reducing N 2 O emissions (Rees et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|Why {{is it time}} {{to think}} outside the box about manure? It is no secret that manure is on the short list of {{environmental}} and social concerns about livestock production. Several decades of increasing specialization in agriculture have concentrated manure resources on farms, in counties, and sometimes whole regions where manure nutrient supplies exceed crop demand (Kellogg et al. 2000). Because of the low nutrient density of manure relative to synthetic fertilizers, the transportation costs of moving it to areas where there is crop demand are often prohibitive (Fleming et al. 1998). Without viable local alternatives, many livestock producers overapply manure (Schmidt et al. 1996, Novak et al. 1998), leading to nitrate leaching, phosphorus accumulation, and other water quality concerns. Large concentrations of manure create other problems, such as odor (Zahn et al. 1997), which communities are no longer willing to tolerate. However, the same scale and concentration that raise environmental concerns also create an opportunity to collect and <b>process</b> <b>manure</b> as a feedstock for value-added manufacturing.

40|$|An {{anaerobic}} digestion (AD) process is studied. The AD reactor belongs to UASB (up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket) typology {{and it was}} constructed in a typical Norwegian farm (Foss farm) localized in Skien, Norway. The reactor is fed with cattle <b>manure.</b> The <b>process</b> {{is divided into two}} different parts: pre-treatment and AD, nitrification and post-treatment. Biogas and compost are outputs of the first section, liquid fertilizer output of the second one. This paper has two core parts: energy/mass flows determination and CO 2 emissions-reduction assessment. The study has indicated that energetic consumption is bigger than production. Radiation losses represent the most important terms of consumed energy, but is possible to diminish them by changing insulation and/or reactor shape. The pilot plant has an average energy consumption and thermal production of 1592 kWh/year and 482 kWh/ year, respectively. The equivalent CO 2 emissions of open-air-standing cow’s manure are noteworthy. Two different probable situations are analyzed: <b>processed</b> <b>manure</b> and not <b>processed</b> <b>manure.</b> The reduction of carbon dioxide releases in the first case, compared to the second, is significant and goes from 32 % to 83 %.

40|$|The general {{objective}} of the research effort reported in this thesis was to develop the knowledge required to optimize the design and operation of solid and semi-solid manure handling and land application equipment. Selected physical and rheological properties of <b>manure</b> <b>products</b> deemed to have an influence on the performances of manure handling and land application equipment were measured and general trends were identified among the measured properties. Relationships were also established between the measured properties {{and the type of}} manure as well as its total solids concentration. Field experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of selected mechanical configurations, operating parameters and product properties on the discharge of manure spreaders. The influence of the type of conveying system (scraper conveyor and system of four augers) and the velocity at which it is operated, the geometry of the holding system and the position of a flow-control gate were all included in the analysis. The discharge rates of the machines as well as the specific energy required by the unloading operations were measured. A numerical modeling method called discrete element method (DEM) was used to create virtual manure, a numerical model of the real product. The measured physical and flow properties were used to develop and validate the virtual manure models. It was found that <b>manure</b> <b>products</b> could successfully be represented in a DE framework and that several parameters defining the contact constitutive model in the DEM had an influence on the behaviour of the virtual products. The DEM was then used to study machine-product interactions taking place in handling and land application equipment. Results from field experiments carried out using various land application equipment were used in the development and validation of the interaction models. The predicted flow rates and power requirements were in good agreement with measured data. The results obtained allowed for {{a better understanding of the}} flow of <b>manure</b> <b>products</b> in <b>manure</b> handling and land application equipment. It was found that the constitutive model used for the product influenced the results of the machine-product interactions models. A precision banded applicator under development at the University of Saskatchewan was also modeled. The discharge rate of this equipment is influenced by a number of parameters. The predicted mass distribution across the width of the banded applicator was well correlated to the experimental results. The models developed in this thesis have the potential to become powerful engineering tools for the design of improved machines for the handling and land application of solid and semi-solid manure...|$|R
40|$|In {{some regions}} in the Netherlands, high pig {{concentrations}} and limited availability of arable land {{have led to a}} surplus of manure which results in high off-farm manure disposal costs. The aim of manure treatment is to lower manure transport costs by reducing the volume and to improve market prospects by changing the nutrient composition. The objective {{of this study was to}} promote the introduction of manure treatment in the Netherlands by giving research support to farmer initiatives and providing them with data on the actual performance of their system with regard to product composition, mass flows, gaseous emissions, and economic feasibility. Four farm-scale systems for treatment of liquid pig manure were studied: two systems for mechanical separation, one for nitrification/denitrification, and one for evaporation. The results showed that a wide range of <b>manure</b> <b>products</b> could be obtained that differ in dry matter, N, P, and K content. The emission of ammonia and odour varied from 1 · 8 to 55 g t¿ 1 [manure] and from 3 · 8 × 103 to 1 · 3 × 107 [European odour units] t¿ 1 [manure], respectively. The nitrification/denitrification showed the highest emission of greenhouse gases (48 kg [carbon dioxide equivalents] t¿ 1 [manure]), mainly nitrous oxide (N 2 O), whereas the emission of the other systems was 12 ¿ 17 kg [CO 2 -eq. ] t¿ 1 [manure].

40|$|Government {{policy in}} many {{countries}} has been to promote manure management methods to reduce the negative impacts related to water and air pollution.

30|$|The co-composts {{reduced the}} {{extractable}} Fe in soil. The Fe {{content in the}} sandy loam soil was reduced by 53 % with the application of manure: leaf litter at 1 : 3 ratio {{as compared to the}} manure minus leaf litter (1 : 0). The efficient reduction with the application of co-compost could be attributed to the potential source of essential nutrients and the drop of heavy metals in the soils. The fluctuations observed in the release of Fe could be related to the elemental status of the co-composts applied to the soil. The effectiveness of the <b>manure</b> <b>product</b> could be associated with the formation of organometallic complexes that hold more Fe and reduced the Fe uptake by spinach plants. Furthermore, basic pH of soil helps to adsorb cationic metals on organic matter sites. The pH is evaluated as the controlling factor of ion exchange, redox reactions, adsorption and complexation reactions (Walter et al. 2006). The effectiveness of heavy metal solubility after manure compost application was determined by the extent of organic matter humification and the successive ramification on soil pH (Gupta and Sinha 2007).|$|R

40|$|Manure {{management}} {{contributes to}} adverse environmental impacts through losses of nitrogen (N), phosphorus, and carbon (C). In this study, we aimed {{to assess the}} potential of newly designed strategies for integrated manure management (IS) to reduce environmental impact. An {{important aspect of the}} strategies was that they prevented pollution swapping. Life cycle assessment was used to compute climate change (CC), fossil fuel depletion (FFD), terrestrial acidification (TA), marine eutrophication (ME), particulate matter formation (PMF), N use efficiency (NUE), and phosphorus over application rate (POA), relative to the crop demand for N. We applied the IS to North West European practice (Ref) and included the Dutch current situation of progressive manure management (NL) to illustrate the potential of the IS to reduce environmental impact. Manure management in Ref included production and management of liquid and solid dairy cattle manure applied to maize and grass, and liquid pig manure applied to wheat. A Monte Carlo uncertainty simulation was done to assess the effect of variation in N and C losses and N uptake by crops on the comparison with Ref, IS, and NL. Results showed that the IS reduced all environmental impacts in all <b>manure</b> <b>product</b> and crop combinations and more than doubled the NUE (70 % compared with maximum 33 % in Ref). Main causes were: segregation of pig and dairy cattle urine and feces inside the housing system reduced methane (CH 4) and ammonia (NH 3) emissions; addition of zeolite to solid dairy cattle manure reduced NH 3 emission; sealed storages in all IS reduced volatilization of N and C; bio-energy production from the feces reduced the production of fossil electricity and heat; and finally N emissions in the field were reduced by ammonia emission reducing application techniques and improved application management (tillage, field traffic en synchronization of <b>manure</b> <b>product</b> application with crop demand). Compared with the Ref, NL had lower TA, PMF, POA, and higher NUE, except for solid cattle manure applied to grass. This result indicates that the Dutch regulations to reduce NH 3 emissions were successful, but that CC can be improved. Compared with NW EU practice, IS reduced environmental impact up to 185 % for CC, up to > 700 % for FFD, up to 96 % for TA, up to 99 % for ME, up to 100 % for PMF, up to 110 % for POA and more than doubled the NUE.

For this rea-son, the technical <b>process</b> of <b>manure</b> spreading was studied using various methods of scientific research and analysis. The focus was primarily on improving the working principles of manure spreading, using so−called wide−angle manure spreaders. Results of the analysis of material transport along the rotor revealed the most relevant parameters of manure spreading. It was found that friction is not the most important parameter. The initial position of pieces of manure and the rotational frequen-cy of the rotor are far more important. The coefficient of friction between the rotor and pieces of manure has a minimum influ-ence on the tangential speed of a piece on the rotor, which in turn also means a minimum influence on the range of spreading. The initial position of the piece on the rotor has an influence on the tangential speed and travel of the piece on the rotor. The tangential speed of the piece as it departs from the rotor is influenced by the size of rotor and the rotational frequency of the rotor.

At {{the core of this}} paper is the Anaerobic Digestion Analytical Model (ADAM) that examines the economic and environmental impacts of integrating AD into UK farming systems. However, the average dairy farm in the UK is not of sufficient size to enable profitable biogas production. Indeed, farm size, as represented by FBS/FAS data used in ADAM, needs to be scaled by three to four times for a biogas enterprise to break‐even. To boost profitability, some farms may use additional energy (food and non food) crops as well as other high energy sources such as biodiesel residues etc. In some circumstances, possibilities may exist for neighbouring farmers to co‐operate and manage a biogas installation that <b>processes</b> <b>manures</b> and energy crops to increase the scale of an on‐farm plant.

40|$|Q fever is {{distributed}} {{in a number}} of ways, one of which is through inhalation of particles of manure from infected animals kept in deep litter houses. In the lambing season farms with more than 50 dairy goats or sheep are obliged to work the manure into the soil themselves or hire a company to do so or to compost it on site. Not all farms are able to meet this obligation, however. Alternative forms of processing, such as industrial composting or gasification are not allowed under current legislation. Composting is a <b>manure</b> fermentation <b>process</b> that kills bacteria as temperatures rise. Exact levels of Coxiella in the manure and how effectively they are killed in the standard fermentation process cannot be determined to date but will be assessed as soon as possible. A comparison between traditional and industrial composting processes shows that their effectiveness is basically similar and that pasteurisation can compensate for the small difference. The Director of the Risk Assessment Bureau has based this recommendation on a risk assessment, permitting the transport of dairy goats and sheep manure from farms free from Q fever to industrial composters, provided that pasteurisation is made part of the <b>process.</b> <b>Manure</b> from farms where Q fever has been confirmed is expected to contain high levels of Coxiella and may therefore contribute to spreading this disease. For this reason, this manure must be sterilised or incinerated. The Director also recommends a study to be carried out into levels of bacteria found in deep litter house manure and the specific temperature/timeframes for killing any Coxiella burnetii present...|$|R
40|$|Feedlot {{operators}} {{may increase}} profitability by including distillers grains in finishing diets. However, the nutrients {{remaining in the}} by‐product are concentrated by about a factor of three during the distillation <b>process.</b> <b>Manure</b> {{can be applied to}} meet single‐ or multiple‐year crop nutrient requirements. The water quality effects of the use of distillers grains in feedlot diets and multiple‐year manure application have not been well quantified. The objectives of this study were to (1) compare the runoff water quality effects resulting from the application of manure derived from corn and distillers grain diets, (2) examine the effects of till and no‐till conditions on runoff nutrient transport, and (3) compare the water quality impacts of 1 ‐, 2 ‐, and 4 ‐year phosphorus (P) based manure application rates. Simulated rainfall events were applied to 0. 75 m wide × 2 m long plots soon after manure application. No significant difference in dissolved phosphorus (DP) or total P (TP) load was found between the corn and distillers grain treatments. The runoff load of TP was significantly larger on the no‐till plots than on the till plots. The amount of particulate phosphorus (PP), DP, and TP transported in runoff was significantly affected by multi‐year application of manure. The TN content of runoff was similar for till and no‐till conditions on the plots containing manure obtained from the distillers grain diet. The environmental effects of the use of manure from a distillers grain diet and multiple‐year manure application should be considered when developing nutrient management plans...|$|R
40|$|Athermochemical {{conversion}} (TCC) <b>process</b> ofswine <b>manure</b> as {{an alternative}} means of wastetreatment and utilization was developed andtested. The {{detailed description of the}} TCC process was presented by the authors previously (He et al., 2000). Results showed that the TCC process could not only substantially reduce the waste strength of swine manure slurry but also produce renewable energy. The end products of the process include raw TCC oil, post-processed water, gases, and solid residues. Ligno-cellulosic wastes can be converted to various forms of energy through numerous TCC processes, depending upon the characteristics of the raw materials and the type of product desired. Among the TCC processes, liquefaction {{was one of the most}} widely studie...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify associations of bedding type and selected management practices with bulk milk quality and productivity of larger Wisconsin dairy farms. Dairy herds (n= 325) producing ≥ 11, 340 kg of milk daily were surveyed during a single farm visit. Monthly bulk milk SCC and total bacteria counts were obtained from milk buyers for 255 farms for a 2 -yr period. Of farms with the same type of bedding in all pens during the study period, most used inorganic bedding (IB), followed by organic nonmanure bedding (OB) and <b>manure</b> <b>products</b> (MB). Almost all bulk milk total bacterial counts were < 10, 000 cfu/mL and total bacterial count was not associated with bedding type. Bulk milk somatic cell score (BMSCS) was least for farms using IB, varied seasonally, and was greatest in the summer. The BMSCS was reduced when new bedding was added to stalls at intervals greater than 1 wk and when teats were dried before attaching the milking unit. The BMSCS for farms using OB was reduced when bedding in the backs of stalls was removed and replaced regularly and when fewer cows with nonfunctioning mammary quarters were present. The BMSCS for farms using MB was reduced when the proportion of cows with milk discarded was less. The rolling herd average (RHA) of herds using IB was 761 and 1, 153 kg greater than the RHA of herds using OB and MB, respectively. The RHA was 353 kg greater on farms where farmers understood subclinical mastitis and 965 kg greater on farms milking 3 times daily. Each 1 % increase of cows with nonfunctioning mammary quarters was associated with a decrease of 57 kg of RHA. The BMSCS, proportions of cows with milk discarded and proportion of cows with nonfunctioning mammary quarters were least for herds using IB and were associated with increased productivity. Large Wisconsin dairy farms that used inorganic bedding had greater productivity and better milk quality compared with herds using other bedding types...|$|R
