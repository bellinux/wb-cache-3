5|$|The town's {{inhabitants}} <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> {{for this}} neglect in September 1540 when Barbary pirates from North Africa {{carried out a}} major raid, {{taking advantage of the}} weak defenses. Hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The Spanish crown responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the Charles V Wall to control the southern flank of the Rock. The wall's builder, the Italian engineer Giovanni Battista Calvi, also strengthened the Landport Gate. Another Italian engineer, Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino, extended the wall onto the Upper Rock at some point probably between 1558–65. A lookout tower, one of several constructed along Spain's southern coast during this period, was built at the eastern end of the isthmus linking Gibraltar with the Spanish mainland. This structure, known as Devil's Tower, was demolished during World War II. The German engineer Daniel Specklin is also thought to have been employed in improving Gibraltar's fortifications between 1550–52. Although there is no direct evidence, the Spanish fortifications {{at the southern end of}} the town are virtually identical in design to drawings in Specklin's posthumously published Architectura von Vestungen ("The Architecture of Fortresses") and on this basis it has been suggested that he was the designer of Gibraltar's southern works.|$|E
5|$|In Benítez's {{first season}} in charge, Liverpool reached the UEFA Champions League Final, where they beat A.C. Milan on penalties, after the match {{finished}} 3–3 after extra time. The following season, Liverpool reached the FA Cup Final, where they beat West Ham United, again on penalties after a 3–3 draw. Benítez again guided Liverpool to a Champions League Final in 2007, {{but this time}} A.C. Milan beat them 2–1. On 3 June 2010, Benitez <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> for a disappointing 2009–10 season when Liverpool announced {{he had left the}} club by mutual consent after six years in charge. Benitez, who was one year into a five-year contract, finalised his departure after agreeing a severance payment. Benitez's assistant Sammy Lee took over the reins at Liverpool until Managing director Christian Purslow and former manager Kenny Dalglish found a replacement. On 1 July 2010, former Fulham boss Roy Hodgson was confirmed as the new manager. After a poor tenure, which included Liverpool being 18th after 6 games, and only one away win during Hodgson's time in charge, Hodgson was sacked on 8 January 2011 and was replaced by former manager Kenny Dalglish the day before a 3rd Round FA Cup game against Manchester United. Dalglish signed a three-year contract as permanent manager in May, but was sacked a year later. Although the 2011/12 season ended with a poor 8th-place finish in the Premier League, Dalglish guided Liverpool to two Cup finals at Wembley, ending a six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup. The second Cup final appearance was the FA Cup, which Liverpool lost to Chelsea. He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers on 1 June 2012.|$|E

He gave up his {{immediate}} plans to chase Willie Ritchie and stayed in Wales {{for a while to}} be near his family. He fought four more fights in Britain, beginning with a home contest at Aberdare against Frenchman Paul Brevieres, who was stopped in the third. Then he took a points win over Young Nipper, a successful defence of his European title against Raymond Vittet, finishing with a points win over Eddie Beattie. The three final fights were conducted within seven days, and Welsh almost <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> for such a challenging schedule when Beattie knocked him down for nine seconds in the ninth.|$|E
25|$|Nasser's {{response}} was the nationalization of the Suez Canal. On 26 July, {{in a speech}} in Alexandria, Nasser gave a riposte to Dulles. During his speech he deliberately pronounced the name of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the canal, a code-word for Egyptian forces to seize control of the canal and implement its nationalization. He announced that the Nationalization Law had been published, that all assets of the Suez Canal Company had been frozen, and that stockholders would be <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of their shares according to the day's closing price on the Paris Stock Exchange. That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. Egypt also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, in contravention of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Many argued that this was also a violation of the 1949 Armistice Agreements.|$|E

25|$|During {{her first}} term, Benazir Bhutto had {{strained}} {{relationship with the}} Pakistan Armed Forces, especially with Pakistan Army. Army chief Mirza Aslam Beg had cold relations with the elected prime minister, and continued to undermine her authority. As for the military appointments, Benazir Bhutto refused to appoint General Beg as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, instead invited Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey to take {{the chairmanship of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 1988, Benazir Bhutto appointed Air Chief Marshal Hakimullah as the Chief of Air Staff and Admiral Jastural Haq as the Chief of Naval Staff. In 1988, shortly after assuming the office, Benazir Bhutto paid a visit to Siachen region, to boost the moral of the soldiers who fought the Siachen war with India. This was the first visit of any civilian leader to any military war-zone area since the country's independence in 1947. In 1988, Benazir appointed Major-General Pervez Musharraf as Director-General of the Army Directorate General for Military Operations (DGMO); and then-Brigadier-General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani as her Military-Secretary. In 1989, the Pakistan Army exposed the alleged Operation Midnight Jackal against the government of Benazir Bhutto. When she learned the news, Benazir Bhutto ordered the arrest and trial of former ISI officer Brigadier Imtiaz Ahmad and Major Amir Khan, it was later revealed that it was General Beg who was behind this plot. General Beg soon <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> in 1993 elections, when Benazir Bhutto politically destroyed the former general and his career was over before taking any shifts in politics. During her first term, Benazir Bhutto had successfully removed senior military officers including Lieutenant-Generals Hamid Gul, Zahid Ali Akbar Khan, General Jamal A. Khan, and Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan, all of whom had anti-democratic views and were closely aligned to General Zia, replacing them with officers who were educated in Western military institutes and academies, generally the ones with more westernised democratic views.|$|E

A fire started under the ship's forecastle. The smothering fire from Beatty's ships forced Hipper to temporarily withdraw his battlecruisers to the southwest. As the ships withdrew, Seydlitz began taking on more water, and the list to starboard worsened. The ship was thoroughly flooded above the middle deck in the fore compartments, and had nearly lost all buoyancy.|$|E
500|$|The 68th {{began the}} second day in a more {{defensible}} position on Cemetery Hill. [...] This placed them {{at the center of}} the Union line, and most of the day's early action was on the flanks. [...] In the evening, however, Early's forces attacked again; the charging Confederates quickly reached the top of the hill and some hand-to-hand combat broke out, but losses were light because the growing darkness made it difficult for soldiers on both sides to shoot accurately. [...] Reinforcements from the II Corps arrived and helped the XI Corps hold the position. [...] On the third day, the 68th remained in that position, but the major attack of the day, Pickett's Charge, was to their left. [...] The 68th performed better than they had at Chancellorsville, participating in their first Union victory. [...] They <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> with much higher casualties, 8 killed and 63 wounded; 67 were made prisoners of war, many on the first day during the retreat to Cemetery Hill. [...] In the thick of the action for two out of three days, the 68th lost more men at Gettysburg than in any other battle.|$|E
