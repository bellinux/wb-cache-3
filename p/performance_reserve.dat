It analyses {{the experience of}} the <b>performance</b> <b>reserve</b> system currently implemented within the Italian National Strategic Regional Framework, rewarding the improvement in the provision of public services to Mezzogiorno citizens. The analysis focuses on the system of indicators and targets, on the design and implementation of actions needed to achieve expected results, on the strategic and technical governance of the system. Notwithstanding the peculiarities of the financial and governance framework, wider than the one strictly referred to Structural Fund co financed Operational Programmes, and some difficulties that are seriously hindering its implementation, the Italian experience provides useful indications for strengthening the results orientation of Cohesion Policy after 2013 and for fine tuning the <b>performance</b> <b>reserve</b> system proposed by the European Commission. The most relevant lesson learnt is that a result based programming approach needs focused and detailed Operational Programmes and a clear endorsement by relevant authorities. This requires to design strategies following the logical sequence from expected results to needed actions, to define objectives and indicators fulfilling rigorous methodological principles through a deliberative process, to set targets and identify actions considering the time dimension and place specific factors, to analyse and prevent all possible obstacles stemming from pre-conditions and responsibilities beyond the sphere of the Managing Authority.

High-fidelity closed-loop Monte Carlo simulation determines the amount of propellant used with each random combination of parameters that are still unknown at the time of launch. Using the results of the Monte Carlo simulation, several methods were used to calculate the FPR.

In patients with severe heart failure {{there is a great}} need for objective criteria to define candidates for heart transplantation or intensive medical treatment. Cardiac pumping <b>performance</b> <b>reserve</b> has been shown to have excellent prognostic value in patients with cardiogenic shock. Methods. Cardiac peak power, an afterload-independent contractility index, was measured noninvasively at rest and at peak dobutamine inotropic stimulation. Contractile reserve was defined as the difference between maximal cardiac power at peak dobutamine dose and baseline value. Maximal cardiac power was calculated from the maximal product of validated central arterial pressure and aortic flow. Results. Results were obtained from 52 subjects (42 patients, 10 control subjects). Twenty-two patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV. Of nine patients with a contractile reserve 1. 5 W/ml. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, contractile reserve was shown to be the only predictor of survival. Conclusions. Contractile reserve measured noninvasively during dobutamine infusion is a valuable prognostic indicator in patients with severe heart failure, with added value to ejection fraction.

40|$|AbstractModern {{embedded}} {{systems that are}} integrated as multi-processor system on chips, are often characterized by the complex behaviors and dependencies between system components. Different events that trigger such systems may cause different execution demands, depending on their event type {{as well as on}} the task they are processed by, leading to complex workload correlations. For example in data processing systems, the size of an event's payload data will typically determine its execution demand on most or all system components, leading to highly correlated workloads. Performance analysis of such systems is often difficult, and conventional analysis methods have no means to capture the possible existence of workload correlations. This leads to overly pessimistic performance analysis results, and thus to expensive system designs with considerable <b>performance</b> <b>reserves.</b> We propose an abstract model to characterize and capture workload correlations present in a system architecture, and we show how the captured additional system information can be incorporated into an existing framework for modular performance analysis of {{embedded systems}}...|$|R

Rather than looking for indicators with specific relevance to the current crisis, the selection of variables is driven by an extensive review of more than eighty papers from the previous literature on early warning indicators. The review suggests that central bank reserves and past movements in the real exchange rate are the two {{leading indicators}} that have proven the most useful in explaining crisis incidence across different countries and crises in the past. For the 2008 - 09 crisis, we use six different variables to measure crisis incidence: drops in GDP and industrial production, currency depreciation, stock market <b>performance,</b> <b>reserve</b> losses, or participation in an IMF program. We find {{that the level of}} reserves in 2007 appears as a consistent and statistically significant leading indicator of the current crisis, in line with the conclusions of the earlier literature. In addition to reserves, recent real appreciation is a statistically significant predictor of devaluation and of a measure of exchange market pressure during the current crisis.

Few of these efforts have focused on evaluating the actual response of the bridge systems, especially beyond the elastic limit of their behavior, and correlating the impact of damage to the overall system behavior. In practice, most of the in-service bridge superstructures behave elastically under the routine daily traffic; however, existing damage and deteriorating conditions would significantly influence different aspects of the structural performance including reserve capacity, resilience and remaining service-life.
