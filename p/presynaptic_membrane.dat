25|$|The {{photoreceptor}} ribbon synapse {{is around}} 30nm in thickness. It sticks {{out into the}} cytoplasm around 200-1000nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density which is an electron dense structure that is anchored to the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> The arciform density is located within the synaptic ridge, a small evagination of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon {{is considered to be}} invisible by electron microscope. The ribbon’s surface has small particles that are around 5nm wide where the synaptic vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called synaptic ribbons, which are large presynaptic structures associated in the active zone. They are thought to fine-tune the synaptic vesicle cycle. Synaptic ribbons are in close proximity to synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the presynaptic neurotransmitter release site via the ribbon.|$|E

The toxin acts at several sites within the central nervous system, including nerve terminals, the spinal cord, and brain, and within the sympathetic nervous system. By binding to peripheral motor neuron terminals, the toxin enters the nerve axons, and is transported across synaptic junctions to the nerve-cell body in the brain stem and spinal cord by retrograde intraneuronal transport, until it reaches the central nervous system, where it rapidly binds to gangliosides at the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> of inhibitory motor nerve endings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent studies {{indicate}} that active zones (AZs) —sites of neurotransmitter release—may be assembled from preassembled AZ precursor vesicles inserted into the <b>presynaptic</b> plasma <b>membrane.</b> Here we report that one putative AZ precursor vesicle of CNS synapses—the Piccolo-Bassoon transport vesicle (PTV) —carries a comprehensive set of AZ proteins genetically and functionally coupled to synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Time-lapse imaging reveals that PTVs are highly mobile, consistent with a role in intracellular transport. Quantitative analysis reveals that the Bassoon, Piccolo, and RIM content of individual PTVs is, on average, half of that of individual presynaptic boutons and shows that the synaptic content of these molecules can be quantitatively accounted for by incorporation of integer numbers (typically two to three) of PTVs into <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membranes.</b> These findings suggest that AZs are assembled from unitary amounts of AZ material carried on PTVs...|$|R
40|$|Tonic nerve {{activity}} in skate electroreceptors {{is thought to}} result from spontaneous activity of the lumenal membranes of the receptor cells which is modulated by applied stimuli. When physiological conditions are simulated in vitro, the receptor epithelium produces a current which flows inward across the lumenal surface. This epithelial current exhibits small spontaneous sinusoidal fluctuations about the mean {{that are associated with}} corresponding but delayed fluctuations in postsynaptic response. Small voltage stimuli produce damped oscillations in the epithelial current similar in time-course to the spontaneous fluctuations. For lumen-negative, excitatory stimuli, these responses are predominantly an increase over the mean inward current. For inhibitory stimuli they are predominantly a decrease. Increased inward current across the lumenal membranes of the receptor cells increases depolarization of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> in the basal faces leading to increased release of transmitter and an excitatory postsynaptic response. Decreased inward current decreases depolarization of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> leading to a reduction in transmitter release and an inhibitory postsynaptic response. Clear changes in postsynaptic response are detectable during stimuli as small as 5 microV with saturation occurring at +/- 400 microV. The evoked oscillations in epithelial current are damped and the postsynaptic responses decline during maintained stimuli with large off-responses occurring at stimulus termination. The initial peak of the off-response is similar to the response produced by onset of an oppositely directed stimulus. These observations substantiate the role of receptor cell excitability in the detection of small voltage changes...|$|R
25|$|Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobic, Gram positive, spore-forming rod. Botulinum toxin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} known toxins: about one microgram is lethal to humans when inhaled. It acts by blocking nerve function (neuromuscular blockade) through inhibition of the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine's release from the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> of neuromuscular junctions in the somatic nervous system. This causes paralysis. Advanced botulism can cause respiratory failure by paralysing the muscles of the chest; this can progress to respiratory arrest. Furthermore, acetylcholine release from the presynaptic membranes of muscarinic nerve synapses is blocked. This can lead to a variety of autonomic signs and symptoms described above.|$|E
25|$|In full {{collapse}} fusion, the synaptic vesicle merges {{and becomes}} {{incorporated into the}} cell membrane. The formation of the new membrane is a protein mediated process and can only occur under certain conditions. After an action potential, Ca2+ floods to the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> Ca2+ binds to specific proteins in the cytoplasm, {{one of which is}} synaptotagmin, which in turn trigger the complete fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the cellular membrane. This complete fusion of the pore is assisted by SNARE proteins. This large family of proteins mediate docking of synaptic vesicles in an ATP-dependent manner. With the help of synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle, the t-SNARE complex on the membrane, made up of syntaxin and SNAP-25, can dock, prime, and fuse the synaptic vesicle into the membrane.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} a {{neurotransmitter}} is triggered {{by the arrival of}} a nerve impulse (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion (exocytosis). Within the presynaptic nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the down stroke of the action potential (tail current). Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of presynaptic vesicles is called the active zone. The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{active zone}} is a {{specialized}} {{region of the}} <b>presynaptic</b> plasma <b>membrane</b> where synaptic vesicles dock and fuse. In this study, we have investigated the cellular mechanism underlying the transport and recruitment of the active zone protein Piccolo into nascent synapses. Our results show that Piccolo is transported to nascent synapses on an ∼ 80 nm dense core granulated vesicle together with other constituents of the active zone, including Bassoon, Syntaxin, SNAP- 25, and N-cadherin, as well as chromogranin B. Components of synaptic vesicles, such as VAMP 2 /synaptobrevin II, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, or proteins of the perisynaptic plasma membrane such as GABA transporter 1 (GAT 1), were not present. These studies demonstrate that the presynaptic active zone is formed {{in part by the}} fusion of an active zone precursor vesicle with the <b>presynaptic</b> plasma <b>membrane...</b>|$|R
50|$|The neuromuscular {{junction}} {{is where a}} neuron activates a muscle to contract. Upon the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic neuron terminal, voltage-dependent calcium channels open and Ca2+ ions flow from the extracellular fluid into the presynaptic neuron's cytosol. This influx of Ca2+ causes neurotransmitter-containing vesicles to dock and fuse to the <b>presynaptic</b> neuron's cell <b>membrane</b> through SNARE proteins. Fusion of the vesicular <b>membrane</b> with the <b>presynaptic</b> cell <b>membrane</b> results in the emptying of the vesicle's contents (acetylcholine) into the synaptic cleft, {{a process known as}} exocytosis. Acetylcholine diffuses into the synaptic cleft and can bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the motor endplate.|$|R
25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E

2500|$|Because TAAR1 is an {{intracellular}} receptor in monoamine neurons, TAAR1 ligands must {{enter the}} presynaptic neuron through a {{membrane transport protein}} or be able to diffuse across the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> {{in order to reach}} the receptor and produce reuptake inhibition and neurotransmitter efflux. Consequently, the efficacy of a particular TAAR1 ligand in producing these effects in different monoamine neurons is a function of both its binding affinity at TAAR1 and its capacity to move across the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> at each type of neuron. [...] The variability between a TAAR1 ligand's substrate affinity at the various monoamine transporters accounts for much of the difference in its capacity to produce neurotransmitter release and reuptake inhibition in different types of monoamine neurons. E.g., a TAAR1 ligand which can easily pass through the norepinephrine transporter, but not the serotonin transporter, will produce – all else equal – markedly greater TAAR1-induced effects in norepinephrine neurons as compared to serotonin neurons.|$|E

We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of seven contiguous domains of the α-NRXN- 1 extracellular region at 3. 0  Å resolution. The structure reveals an arrangement where the N-terminal five domains adopt a more rigid linear conformation and the two C-terminal domains form a separate arm connected by a flexible hinge. In an extended conformation the molecule is suitably configured to accommodate a bound NLGN molecule, as supported by structural comparison and surface plasmon resonance.

40|$|Abstract Background Reuptake of {{synaptic}} norepinephrine (NE) via the antidepressant-sensitive NE transporter (NET) supports efficient noradrenergic signaling and presynaptic NE homeostasis. Limited, {{and somewhat}} contradictory, information currently describes the axonal transport and localization of NET in neurons. Results We elucidate NET localization in brain and superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons, {{aided by a}} new NET monoclonal antibody, subcellular immunoisolation techniques and quantitative immunofluorescence approaches. We present evidence that axonal NET extensively colocalizes with syntaxin 1 A, and to a limited degree with SCAMP 2 and synaptophysin. Intracellular NET in SCG axons and boutons also quantitatively segregates from the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT 2), findings corroborated by organelle isolation studies. At the surface of SCG boutons, NET resides in both lipid raft and non-lipid raft subdomains and colocalizes with syntaxin 1 A. Conclusion Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} SCG NET is segregated prior to transport from the cell body from proteins comprising large dense core vesicles. Once localized to presynaptic boutons, NET does not recycle via VMAT 2 -positive, small dense core vesicles. Finally, once NET reaches <b>presynaptic</b> plasma <b>membranes,</b> the transporter localizes to syntaxin 1 A-rich plasma membrane domains, with a portion found in cholera toxin-demarcated lipid rafts. Our findings indicate that activity-dependent insertion of NET into the SCG plasma membrane derives from vesicles distinct from those that deliver NE. Moreover, NET is localized in <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> in a manner that can take advantage of regulatory processes targeting lipid raft subdomains. </p...|$|R

Presynaptic neuronal voltage-gated N-calcium channels are {{largely responsible for the}} release of this glutamate as well as the neuropeptide, substance P. The expression of presynaptic neuronal voltage-gated N-calcium channels increases after a nerve lesion or repeated stimulation.

40|$|SummaryIn {{searching for}} binding {{partners}} of the intracellular {{domain of the}} immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecule CHL 1, we identified the clathrin-uncoating ATPase Hsc 70. CHL 1 gene ablation resulted in reduced targeting of Hsc 70 to the synaptic plasma membrane and synaptic vesicles, suggesting CHL 1 as a synapse-targeting cue for Hsc 70. CHL 1 accumulates in <b>presynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> and, in response to synapse activation, is targeted to synaptic vesicles by endocytosis. CHL 1 deficiency or disruption of the CHL 1 /Hsc 70 complex results in accumulation of abnormally high levels of clathrin-coated synaptic vesicles with a reduced ability to release clathrin. Generation of new clathrin-coated synaptic vesicles in an activity-dependent manner is inhibited when the CHL 1 /Hsc 70 complex is disrupted, resulting in impaired uptake and release of FM dyes in synaptic boutons. Abnormalities in clathrin-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling may thus underlie brain malfunctions in humans and mice that carry mutations in the CHL 1 gene...|$|R

Neuroligins and β-neurexins are neuronal cell-surface proteins that bind {{to each other and}} form asymmetric intercellular junctions. To test whether the neuroligin/β-neurexin junction is related to synapses, we generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies to neuroligin 1. With these antibodies, we show that neuroligin 1 is synaptic. The neuronal localization, subcellular distribution, and developmental expression of neuroligin 1 {{are similar to those of}} the postsynaptic marker proteins PSD- 95 and NMDA-R 1 receptor. Quantitative immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that neuroligin 1 is clustered in synaptic clefts and postsynaptic densities. Double immunofluorescence labeling revealed that neuroligin 1 colocalizes with glutamatergic but not γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic synapses. Thus neuroligin 1 is a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule that is enriched in postsynaptic densities where it may recruit receptors, channels, and signal-transduction molecules to synaptic sites of cell adhesion.

During synaptogenesis, NR 1 is mobile throughout axons - including growth cones and filopodia, structures that are involved in synaptogenesis. Upon synaptogenic contact, NMDA receptors are quickly recruited to terminals by neuroligin- 1 /neurexin signaling.
