50|$|In 1962 Soriano {{went into}} exile, {{settling}} in Miami {{with his wife}} Milagros and his daughter Hortensia {{until his death in}} 2015. He worked as a graphic designer and occasionally taught, first at the Catholic Welfare Bureau, and later at the Cuban Cultural Program of the University of Miami.Soriano avoided vernacular themes which dominated Cuban art from its emergence with the first Vanguard in the mid-twenties. His work proceeded along the paths of geometric abstraction in the course of 1950's and was part of the Ten Concrete Geometric painters but by the late 1960s, Soriano’s work took a radical turn. His brush began to create amazing shapes; abstract expressions related to the emotions, feelings, meditations and mystical introspections. A novel treatment of light and color, transparencies and forms placed Soriano in a new aesthetic dimension and freed him from his earlier attachments to schools and tendencies. Through a highly refined technique, he became a master of luminosity, of the pictorial metaphor and of the metaphysical language of forms. In his amazing and highly complex images, light acts as both form and content. It is this unity of <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> of representation that constitutes Soriano’s transcendental contribution to contemporary visual discourse and elevates his artistic creation to universal rank.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> for {{increasing}} the support or integration scale of a model element for physically based snow accumulation and melt models. It is sometimes desirable to use relatively large model elements in a distributed snowpack model. Generally {{the purpose is to}} better match the scale of observations or to match the support scale of calculations in an atmospheric model. The motivation to increase the support scale of snowmelt models is to take up the opportunities for simplification inherent in using a statistical description of the system as opposed to spatially explicit descriptions of the process throughout the unit of interest. When scaling-up models, different processes or state information may become important in the description of a model element. At scales where spatial variability in snow water equivalence can be substantial, some measure of the variability of the snowpack must be included as a state variable or observable. Covariance between snow water equivalence and the accumulation rate or melt rate at each point is the source of temporal changes in spatial variance of snow water equivalence. Areal depletion curves relating snow-covered area to basin average snow water equivalence {{have been shown to be}} an effective parameterization of subgrid variability caused by differentia...|$|E

Focusing on unsuccessful use of organic products this project analyses potentially useful information that could be deployed for strategic recommendations. There were 26 qualitative case studies conducted. Using guidelines, different histories or the establishment of organic food offers were explored. Additionally thirteen experts in the organic eating-out sector were surveyed. Beside descriptive findings concerning the communal feeding sector and the individual feeding sector a comparison analysis uncovered that decisions are department-specific within the respective organizations of eating-out. Critical success factors for organic offers concern not only the clientele, but also product quality, supply, certification constraints as well as the support of the superior organizational purpose. The problems are driven by external impulses, which are differently received by the departments of the organization however. This was a result of insufficient reflection on the purpose for using organic food products, the organization’s objectives as well as the necessary resource demands. With the help of structural recommendations, the process of introducing organic products can be based on strategic and focused planning in regard to <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> considering the reflection about made deci-sions...|$|E

The language data under study have been collected from the Internet news websites published in 2013 – 2014. The aim of the paper is twofold: to give an overview of recent cases of euphemization in news headlines, and to define functions, <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> of euphemization. The most frequently euphemized topics this year {{have been found to be}} war, military actions in different countries, politics and economics. The analysis of the news article headlines has showed that one of the main purposes of euphemization of social problems and political issues is to veil and cover up the real names of such phenomena as military actions, massacre, preparation for war, rising prices, unsuitable behavior of various officials, conflicts between leading politicians, bad economic conditions. The sub-topics of euphemization are concerned with the criticism of the behaviour of government leaders, leading politicians who are claimed to have violated ethics, who are arrogant, corrupt and dishonest. The semantics of euphemisms is best reflected describing them according to the means of euphemization, which are generalization, conceptual metaphorization, choice of international terms, periphrasis, pronominalization and litotes. Political euphemisms are part and parcel of the world of diplomacy, international and internal policy; politically correct language is crucial in today’s mass media communication.

For this reason it becomes increasingly important to identify the causes of underdevelopment of lagging countries or regions, by analyzing the influence of economic, socio demographic, cultural, institutional and political variables on growth and development. Economic development is an evolutionary process in which people / society is the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>means,</b> causes and effects thereof. The sustainable development must be an anthropocentric one, because the human factor has the decisive role in ensuring its success. In nowadays the economic progress of lagging countries or regions dramatically depends on their ability to harness the potential of creativity, skills and abilities of the human factor, by promoting those cultural values that can contribute to the higher growth. The development can be boosted when the population is driven by a strong work ethic, fierce desire to learn from the experiences of other countries, the attachment to the principles of quality and professional excellence, etc., and all this are closely related to the cultural matrix of the country. This article aims to identify the cultural aspects with a major impact on national or regional economic development and to provide an analysis of the implications of cultural differences between EU countries on disparities in development. In order to achieve these objectives will be used data on the situation of development indices (HDI, Legatum Prosperity Index, etc.) and regarding the situation of some cultural variables in European countries, offered by the World Values Survey...|$|E

In order to recognize the essence of modified epistemological paradigm in the interpretation and understanding of technology, which involves the interpretation and understanding of technical sciences as a whole, {{the analysis of the}} topic in the article is methodologically divided into five sequential parts. The first part investigates some essential features of the historical metamorphosis of natural-scientific and technological enterprise from the original cultural perspective, i. e. the ancient understanding of reality. The second part, in contrast to the ancient cosmological order, analyses the intra-world implications. The third part explores a number of important aspects of modern metamorphoses as regards the interpretation and understanding of the world, man, nature, ethics, science and technology. This makes the so-called historical metamorphoses in the interpretation and understanding of technology complete.

Technology simpliciter can be understood as humans at work. The way we work shapes the technologies we use just as technologies shape the way we work. That is, there is a mutual shaping or coconstruction of society and technology. This thesis is a study of libraries and the introduction of Internet technologies. Employing the notion of an open system that is, one which is undergoing constant change, has indeterminate boundaries and means of control, it examines from a sociotechnical viewpoint, informed by Actor-Network Theory, the way the mutual interaction between technologies, society and culture shape the evolution of the system. Data were collected in 1998 - 9 and 2005 utilizing techniques from both ethnographic and case study research, to capture and illustrate this fluidity. Three libraries in Melbourne, Australia, were objects of this exploratory study with both library staff and users being interviewed and observed as they engaged with Internet technologies as part of their working, studying, communicating or recreational lives. The thesis report seeks to make the reader aware, through a process of reflexive or confessional reporting, the interrelatedness of all the actors (including the researcher), both human and nonhuman, in the evolution and shaping of the system of Internet use in the organizations that were the objects of this study. The resulting study reveals uncertainty, resistance, accommodation, enthusiasm and even failure in the sociotechnical system and serves to illustrate the fallibility of theories that assume society and technology are essentially static categories -especially when applied at the micro level, as here...|$|E

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxvi, 343 leaves, bound 29 cmThis dissertation addresses ongoing colonialism {{in the western}} academy, especially in continued analysis by non-indigenous scholars of indigenous cultures. As the daughter of colonials, my seeking to {{understand some of the}} manifestations of colonialism, to open up discussion of its mechanisms and of possibilities for change, {{has been the focus of}} years of exploration, writing, reading, talking, experimentation, rethinking, a multitude of exchanges with others, and dreaming. The dissertation is the culmination of these endeavors in the present moment but not an end to the search. Chapter 1 begins with a quote from Haunani-Kay Trask's From a Native Daughter: 'There should be a moratorium on studying, unearthing, slicing, crushing, and analyzing us" and asks the question: "What is it to behave ethically in the context of literary studies [...] including, currently, in cultural studies?" The chapter then introduces problems such as appropriation, silencing, hierarchical structures, universalization of culture-specific concepts such as objectivity, along with exploration of solutions such as self-scrutiny (what Edward Said calls a "consciousness of what one really is"), engagement, and friendship as concepts helpful in decolonizing. Chapter 2 looks at examples of current indigenous responses to western scholarship and research. These responses point to the need for serious re-evaluation of where western academics stand on research and teaching on indigenous cultures. Chapters 3 through 7 explore 10 aspects of western academic culture: <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> (Ch. 3); objectivity (Ch. 4); externalization of self and being unaffected by what one studies (Ch. 5); fact and fiction, written vs. oral, and linear thought (Ch, 6); and modes of thought and effects (Ch. 7). Chapter 8 examines two examples of western "metropolitan" commentary on indigenous writing and two examples of indigenous commentary, one using western theory and one based in the culture, Chapter 9 discusses possible alternative strategies to those presently accepted, and Chapter 10 concludes with a continued inventory of this author's process. Interleaved between chapters, I have included unpaginated "Inbetweens," which offer an utterance of the problems from a more personal viewpoint...|$|E

A „magic polygon" arises between aims of concentration policy and other aims of economic policy. It means that it is practically impossible to realize all economic purposes. The state uses a number of means influencing the level of concentration, however it is difficult to give an exact classification of them from the viewpoint of their division into checking <b>and</b> stimulating <b>means.</b> The influence of those means depends on their definite form.

Explore {{the major}} ideological {{patterns}} of {{development of a}} socially philosophies {{of education in the}} context of the problems of institutionalization of knowledge about human and social development. To analyse system-integration aspect of social philosophy and education management in interaction of concepts of an instrumentalism of a pragmatism and a neopragmatism with model of «new humanism» in formation of socially valuable orientations. Methodology. Classification existing in the western philosophy of education and education of directions is spent, proceeding from basic principles of philosophical school or a current, first of all considering those the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> which are really involved by them in process of education, social development and socially-moral education and being based on the basic installations, the purpose expressed by that or other direction, how its supporters imagine the person, its requirement, a social role, модус behaviour which the education system and education urged to form. Scientific novelty. In conditions when against crisis of an education system of the government of the USA and the leading countries of Europe are compelled to begin its long-term reform, its theorists substantially pay attention to democratic workings out of concepts of an instrumentalism of a pragmatism/neopragmatism in modern social philosophy of education, in particular on their aspiration to introduce in process of social development, education and education idea and practical model both educational, and a social equality. Considering growing requirement of a practical embodiment of ideas of freedom, justice, aspiration to realization of the human rights proclaimed a society, supporters of the concept of «new humanism» see the main objective in blocking a way to conformism, to a manipulation behaviour of the person and to create conditions for its free self-expression, for realization by the person of a fundamental choice of acts in a concrete situation and by that to warn danger of formation of the unified form of behaviour. In it principles of «new humanism» approach with a position of «new humanism» instrumentalism and neopragmatism. Conclusions. Before social philosophy of education/education it is necessary to define a problem factors which cause achievement of its main objective, to state an estimation to moral principles and personal qualities with which actually the education/education theory connects realization of the problems, to show, why these, instead of any other principles and qualities open to the person possibility to choose in a concrete situation socially powerful both morally defensible and comprehensible line of conduct in public the relation. Statement of a question on necessity of the philosophical analysis of problems of education and education in a social context serves as an indicator of understanding philosophers, teachers of an increasing role of the human and moral factor in society development. And, at last, the aspiration to develop socially-philosophical bases of pedagogics in general and education in particular, testifies that the western and domestic philosophers, teachers, representatives of social and psychological sciences, at least, the majority of them, have realized the public importance of an education system and education, its global character...|$|E
