25|$|Bell {{officials}} {{voted unanimously}} to look into legal action against city officials, <b>political</b> <b>consultants</b> or others. Other city officials receiving inflated salaries. Lourdes Garcia, the city's director of administrative services, and Eric Eggena, the director of general services, were paid more than $400,000 each. Garcia has since agreed to a 61% pay cut and Eggena was fired. An unnamed third official was also let go.|$|E
25|$|That said, {{not all of}} {{his studies}} of {{mediation}} in context have found clear-cut divergence. His ethnographic study of the advent of <b>political</b> <b>consultants</b> and spot-centered campaigns in the 1996 Japanese national elections were highly supportive of creeping convergence, as was his content analysis {{of what he has}} labeled “adentity”. In the latter case, messages of self-identification in Japan, while becoming more locally profuse and variegated, have also become exogenously-homogeneous—insofar as their self-orientation appears more similar to ad messages from the West. Appraising the implications of Holden's grounded theorization, Kenji Kosaka observed that such adentifications reflect a departure from the past, where identity was often mediated by the group. To Kosaka, Holden's study was further evidence that Japanese society had evolved from its original collectivistic values to more individualistic values.|$|E
500|$|For much of {{his final}} two decades, Romney {{had been out of}} the {{political}} eye, but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. [...] Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son's house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. [...] Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events. [...] When Kennedy's campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church's past policy on blacks, Romney interrupted Mitt's press conference and said loudly, [...] "I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture." [...] The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his <b>political</b> <b>consultants</b> and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.|$|E

2500|$|By 2004, {{the role}} of blogs became {{increasingly}} mainstream, as <b>political</b> <b>consultants,</b> news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK's Labour Party's MP Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents. In January 2005, Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people [...] "could not ignore": Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{came into}} {{widespread}} use near {{the time of}} the 1996 Republican National Convention. [...] The first use of the term in a news article about that election appeared in the July 21, 1996 edition of The Washington Post. E. J. Dionne, the article's author, quoted Alex Castellanos (at the time a senior media advisor to Bob Dole) suggesting that Bill Clinton was targeting a voting demographic whom Castellanos called the [...] "soccer mom." [...] The soccer mom was described in the article as [...] "the overburdened middle income working mother who ferries her kids from soccer practice to scouts to school." [...] The article suggested that the term soccer mom was a creation of <b>political</b> <b>consultants.</b> Castellanos was later quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying [...] "She's the key swing consumer in the marketplace, and the key swing voter who will decide the election." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turner's {{campaign}} manager, E. O'Brien Murray, {{was later}} named 2012 GOP campaign {{manager of the}} year, by the American Association of <b>Political</b> <b>Consultants</b> {{for his role in}} the win. The district is Democratic leaning with a Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI) of D+5. In Salon, which called Turner's win [...] "unremarkable", it was argued that the district had been leaning rightward, as it was one of the few districts in the nation in which Barack Obama performed one point worse than John Kerry in 2004 and 12 points worse than Al Gore in 2000. Though Salon's claims are questioned by some as Obama won the district in 2008 by 11 points and Kerry by 12 in 2004, which does not seem to imply a strong conservative swing. Further the local city council seat was easily won by a Democrat in the most recent election along with the local State Senate and Assembly seats. This included a special election for New York State Assembly on the same day as Turners election, within his congressional district, where the democrat won with 76% of the vote. Further Governor Cuomo easily won the congressional district in his run for Governor of New York.|$|E
2500|$|Liberal Republicans have voiced {{disappointment}} over conservative {{attacks on}} liberalism. One example is {{former governor of}} Minnesota {{and founder of the}} Liberal Republican Club Elmer L. Andersen, who commented that it's [...] "unfortunate today that 'liberal' is used as a derogatory term". After the 1980s, fewer activists and politicians were willing to characterize themselves as liberals. Historian Kevin Boyle explains, [...] "There was a time when liberalism was, in Arthur Schlesinger's words 'a fighting faith' ... Over the last three decades, though, liberalism has become an object of ridicule, condemned for its misplaced idealism, vilified for its tendency to equivocate and compromise, and mocked for its embrace of political correctness. Now even the most ardent reformers run from the label, fearing the damage it will inflict". Republican political consultant Arthur J. Finkelstein was recognized by Democratic <b>political</b> <b>consultants</b> for having employed a formula of branding someone as a liberal and engaging in name-calling by using the word [...] "liberal" [...] in negative television commercials as frequently as possible, such as in a 1996 ad against U.S. Representative Jack Reed: [...] "That's liberal. That's Jack Reed. That's wrong. Call liberal Jack Reed and tell him his record on welfare is just too liberal for you." ...|$|E
