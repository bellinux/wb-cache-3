2500|$|In 1994, Richard Felson coauthored the {{controversial}} book [...] "Aggression and Coercive Actions: A Social-Interactionist Perspective" [...] with James Tedeschi, a book which argues that sexual fulfillment is the motive of rapists, {{rather than the}} aggressive desire to dominate the victim. Felson believes that rape is an aggressive form of sexual coercion and the goal of rape is sexual satisfaction rather than power. Most rapists {{do not have a}} preference for rape over consensual sex. In one study, male rapists evaluated with penile <b>plethysmography</b> demonstrated more arousal to forced sex and less discrimination between forced and consensual sex than non-rapist control subjects, though both groups responded more strongly to consensual sex scenarios.|$|E
2500|$|Male {{bisexuality}} {{is particularly}} {{presumed to be}} non-existent, with sexual fluidity studies adding to the debate. In 2005, researchers Gerulf Rieger, Meredith L. Chivers, and J. Michael Bailey used penile <b>plethysmography</b> to measure the arousal of self-identified bisexual men to pornography involving only men and pornography involving only women. Participants were recruited via advertisements in gay-oriented magazines and an alternative paper. They found that the self-identified bisexual men in their sample had genital arousal patterns similar to either homosexual or heterosexual men. The authors concluded that [...] "in terms of behavior and identity, bisexual men clearly exist", but that male bisexuality had not been shown to exist with respect to arousal or attraction. The assertion of Bailey that [...] "for men arousal is orientation" [...] was criticized by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) as a simplification which neglects to account for behavior and self-identification. [...] Further, some researchers hold that the technique {{used in the study}} to measure genital arousal is too crude to capture the richness (erotic sensations, affection, admiration) that constitutes sexual attraction. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force called the study and The New York Times coverage of it flawed and biphobic.|$|E

50|$|Air {{displacement}} <b>plethysmography</b> or ADP (also {{known as}} whole-body air displacement <b>plethysmography)</b> is a recognized and scientifically validated densitometric method to measure human body composition.ADP {{is based on}} the same principles as the gold standard method of hydrostatic weighing, but through a densitometric technique that uses air displacement rather than water immersion.Air-displacement <b>plethysmography</b> offers several advantages over established reference methods, including a quick, comfortable, automated, noninvasive, and safe measurement process, and accommodates various subject types (e.g., children, obese, elderly, and disabled persons).|$|E

Air <b>plethysmography</b> uses a similar principle but based on an air-filled long cuff, which is more convenient but less accurate.Another practical device is mercury-filled strain gauges used to continuously measure circumference of the extremity, e.g. at mid calf.Impedance <b>plethysmography</b> is a non-invasive method used to detect venous thrombosis in these areas of the body.|$|E
