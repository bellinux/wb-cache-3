Twitter board member Todd Chaffee forecast that the company could <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> e-commerce, noting that users may want to buy items directly from Twitter since it already provides product recommendations and promotions.|$|E

For example low OCs are associated with low <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> current land use. Per hectare OC estimates for each sub-watershed thus represent the weighted average per hectare <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> the respective land cover types.|$|R

5|$|The {{expedition}} was {{a private}} venture much like the Drake-Norris expedition, supported by limited assistance and subsidies from the crown.

5|$|Between 1889 and 1917, ETNC was an {{independent}} private college that only gained income from tuition and a modest <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> its dormitories; {{it had no}} endowment. During this period, it offered six degree programs and educated more than 30,000 students, including more public school teachers than any other institution of higher learning in Texas during the same period; the college also gained a reputation for educating rural school teachers. In 1917, ETNC counted almost 2,000 currently enrolled students.|$|E

5|$|In Moldavia, {{agriculture}} and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that finding new land was still preferred to crop rotation. The {{establishment of the}} principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> the transit trade between Poland and the Black Sea ports. The first local coins were minted in 1377, under Peter I Muşat (c.13751391).|$|E
