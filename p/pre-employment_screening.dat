40|$|Background Historically, many {{prospective}} {{employees in}} Great Britain have undergone <b>pre-employment</b> health <b>screening</b> (PEHS) assessments before {{a job offer}}. Section 60 of the Equality Act 2010 stipulates that PEHS assessments before a job offer may contravene the disability provisions of the Act except under specific circumstances.

Aims To describe the knowledge, perceptions and practices of occupational health physicians in UK fol-lowing implementation of the Equality Act 2010. Methods Data were collected through an anonymous online survey of occupational health physicians (OHPs) actively reporting to the Occupational Physicians Reporting Activity (OPRA) at the Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, the University of Manchester. Results There were 126 responses available for analysis (response rate 43 %). Most participants (81 %) were accredited occupational health specialists providing occupational health advice to various industry sectors; 96 % reported involvement in PEHS assessments; 81 % reported awareness of section 60 of the Equality Act 2010. Further analysis of these participants revealed varying knowledge levels and practices relating to specific requirements of section 60. Changes in professional practice resultin...|$|R

40|$|A 44 -year-old eastern European woman {{presented}} to the tubercu-losis (TB) service after she had a <b>pre-employment</b> TB <b>screening</b> chest radiograph. The frontal anteroposterior (AP) chest radio-graph demonstrated a soft-tissue opacity projected over the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax, with poorly defined lateral margins (Fig 1 a). The ancillary lateral chest radiograph demonstrated a well-defined soft-tissue lesion projecting posterior to the right breast, across the anterior thoracic wall into the right lung field (Fig 1 b). The features were consistent with a soft-tissue extrapulmonary chest wall abnormality. The patient went on to have a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, which demonstrated a well-circumscribed, uniformly homogeneous, low-attenuation lesion measuring 3 cm, which projected across the pleural margin into the right lung field (Fig 1 c). It had a mean Hounsfield unit (HU) value of − 105 HU and was radiologically consistent with a benign intrathoracic lipoma. There was no mediastinal or hilar lymphade-nopathy and the abdominal viscera were normal. Lipomas are benign neoplastic mesenchymal tumours arising from adipose tissue. They are well defined and encapsulated. Intrathoracic lipomas are extremely rare, and usually located centrally in the ante-rior mediastinum, although {{they can also be}} found peripherally.

50|$|The National Firefighter Selection Inventory - (NFSI), {{when used}} as a <b>pre-employment</b> <b>screening</b> tool, helps select {{qualified}} individuals for service as firefighters. A fundamental aspect of the NFSI is that its testing platform is an alternative to conventional firefighter written entrance examinations. Utilizing a comprehensive and compensatory model, the exam assesses not only individuals’ cognitive ability, but also their behavioral predispositions; job-related attitudes and motivation. The National Firefighter Selection Inventory displays no evidence of adverse impact against protected classes of individuals. This alternative testing model is well suited to predict success for all entry-level firefighter positions and to be in strict compliance with all federal, state and local testing guidelines and regulations.|$|E

40|$|Policy & {{practice}} Evidence {{base for}} <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>screening</b> Joseph Pachman a Abstract This paper examines the evidence {{base for the}} use of pre-employment/pre-placement medical examinations. The use of pre-employment examinations is often driven more by cultural practices than evidence. There is a lack of evidence on their effectiveness in preventing health-related occupational risks. Hypertension screening is highlighted as a common pre-employment practice {{for which there is no}} standardized criteria to use to determine fitness for work. There are inherent problems in screening for psychiatric disorders and substance abuse as well as potential for racial bias and other unintended negative effects. This paper questions the economic case for this practice and also expresses concerns about paternalism related to identified risk factors. Health assessments should only be included when appropriate to the task environment and the general use of pre-employment exams and drug screening should be eliminated. Generally, a health assessment by questionnaire should suffice. Occupational health providers should advise against the application of physical or mental standards that are not relevant to fulfilment of the essential job functions. Consensus development regarding best practice, as well as consideration for acquiring outcome data related to pre-employment practice, is recommended.

40|$|The use of {{the urine}} drug screen (UDS) to test for {{substances}} of abuse has become commonplace b cause urine is relatively easily obtained and concentrations of drug in urine tend {{to be higher than}} in other biological matrices (1). The UDS is increasingly utilized as a <b>pre-employment</b> requirement, toxicological <b>screen</b> in the emergency room, as part of a general admissions medical screen at inpatient psychiatric facilities, and as a measure of abstinence in patients being treated at substance abuse facilities (2). Also, members ofthe armed services and athletes are subject to periodic or random screens. Additionally, "off site " diagnostic kits are increasingly being utilized. Positive results are highly suggestive that an individual has been using the substance inquestion. The major UDS test methods used in the U. S. are automated immunoassay tests uch as radioimmunoassay (RIA), fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (2). It has been recognized that a number of medications (2, 3), certain foods (4), and herbal products (5) may cross-react and/or produce "false-positive " results for a number of analytes. The use of herbal supplements has expanded dramatically in the last decade and as part of our ongoing herb-drug interaction studies we sought to determine their potential to confound the results of the UDS. Accordingly, we assessed normal volunteers participating in a series of studies for the potential of commonly utilized herbal preparations to produce "false positive " results during formal study...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters on the economics of labor markets. Each chapter explores {{an aspect of the}} distributional consequences of labor market shocks due to changes in trade, regulations, or technology. The first chapter investigates the extent to which geographic variation in wage growth reflects workers' incomplete arbitrage of changing job opportunities in different locations, industries, and occupations. Without moving costs, worker adjustment to changes in labor demand would eliminate differential earnings effects between directly exposed workers and others in the same skill group. I find evidence against this full-mobility benchmark, estimating that exposure to trade with China reduces earnings of non-college educated workers in exposed Commuting Zones (CZs) by 4 %, and fracking increases earnings of the original residents of exposed CZs by 7 %. I estimate a model of location, sector, and occupation choice to quantify the costs that rationalize this incomplete arbitrage. Simulations show that halving these moving costs would have reduced the effect of exposure to trade with China by 35 %. In the second chapter, Scott Nelson and I study recent bans on employers' use of credit reports to screen job applicants. Exploiting geographic, temporal, and job-level variation in which workers are covered by these bans, we find that the bans reduced job-finding rates for blacks by 7 to 16 log points, and increased separation rates for black new hires by 3 percentage points. We interpret these findings in a statistical discrimination model in which credit report data provides employers with a higher precision signal of workers' skills, compared to employers' prior beliefs and knowledge about workers' skills; this signal has particularly strong effects on blacks' employment outcomes. In the third chapter, Janet Currie, Christopher Knittel, Michael Greenstone, and I investigate the local welfare consequences of hydraulic fracturing. Exploiting geological and temporal variation, we find that allowing fracking leads to improvements in a wide set of economic indicators. At the same time, estimated willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the decrease in local amenities is equal to $ 1000 to $ 1, 600 per household annually. Overall, we estimate that the WTP for allowing fracking equals $ 1, 300 to $ 1, 900 per household annually. 1.
