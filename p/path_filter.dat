The telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) transponder of MOM is required to handle continuous RF power of 200 [*]W in the telemetry path besides simultaneously maintaining an isolation of greater than 145 [*]dBc to its sensitive telecommand path. This is accomplished {{with the help of a}} complex diplexer, requiring high power, high rejection transmit <b>path</b> <b>filter,</b> and a low power receive <b>path</b> <b>filter.</b> To reduce the complexity in the multipaction-free design and testing, the transmit <b>path</b> <b>filter</b> of the diplexer is split into a low rejection filter integral to the diplexer and an external high rejection filter. This paper highlights the design and space qualification phases of this high rejection filter. Multipaction test results with 6 [*]dB margin are also presented. Major concerns of this filter design are isolation, insertion loss, and multipaction. Mission performance of the on-board filter is normal...|$|E

40|$|Predicated Execution {{can be used}} to {{alleviate}} the costs associated with frequently mispredicted branches. This is accomplished by trading the cost of a mispredicted branch for execution of both paths following the conditional branch. In this paper we examine two enhancements for branch prediction in the presence of predicated code. Both of the techniques use recently calculated predicate definitions to provide a more intelligent branch prediction. The first branch predictor, called the Squash False <b>Path</b> <b>Filter,</b> recognizes fetched branches known to be guarded with a false predicate and predicts them as not-taken with 100 % accuracy. The second technique, called the Predicate Global Update branch predictor, improves prediction by incorporating recent predicate information into the branch predictor. We use these techniques to aid the prediction of region-based branches. A region-based branch is a branch that is left in a predicated region of code. A regionbased branch may be correlated with predicate definitions in the region in addition to those that define the branch's guarding predicate. 1...|$|E
40|$|Study {{of human}} {{activities}} {{in space and}} time has been an important research topic in transportation research. Limitations of conventional statistical methods for analysis of individual-level human activities have encouraged spatiotemporal analysis of human activity patterns in a space-time context. Based on Hagerstrand's time geography, this study presents a space-time GIS approach that is capable of representing and analyzing spatiotemporal activity data at the individual level. Specifically, we have developed an ArcGIS extension, named Activity Pattern Analyst (APA), to facilitate exploratory analysis of activity diary data. This extension covers a set of functions such as space-time path generation, space-time path segmentation, space-time <b>path</b> <b>filter,</b> and activity distribution/density pattern exploration. It also provides a space-time path based multi-level clustering method to investigate individual-level spatiotemporal patterns. Using an activity diary dataset collected in Beijing, China, this paper presents how this Activity Pattern Analyst extension can facilitate exploratory analysis of individual activity diary data to uncover spatiotemporal patterns of individual activities.

40|$|A PCM audio {{recording}} adapter {{which can be}} used in conjunction with the herical scanning type VTR has been constructed. This report describes the design of its playback part and the estimated overall characteristics throughout the recording and playback system. The digital code reproduced from the VTR is composed of the 12 bits PCM code and the 4 check bits for each sampled data. After serial to parallel conversion of each data and code error checking, the net 12 PCM bits are stored to the FI/FO register having a capacity of 12 bits× 64 stages for each channel. The stored PCM bits are read out successively in the constant PCM sampling rate of 44. 1 kHz and converted to the analoge signal by a usual current ladder type D/A converter. The final playback signal is obtained pathing through the following output low <b>path</b> <b>filter.</b> The overall audio record-playback characteristics were estimated with respect to, for example, the frequency response, dynamic range, wave distortion, and impulsive noise caused by the code error. Nearly flat playback response ranging from zero to 19 kHz and the dynamic range of about 70 dB were obtained. The impulsive noise in the playback signal, however, was not sufficiently eliminated and the necessity of more complicated counterplan was confirmed to overcome the burst code error...|$|E

While first visualization techniques for this kind of data exist, suitable interactive exploration techniques have rarely been investigated so far. In this paper, we introduce means for the analysis, representation, and exploration of spatiotemporal multilevel data as first solutions to fill this gap. Particularly, these are analysis strategies serving to order the data appropriately, a novel data display providing an overview to the data as well as level- and path-based exploration strategies supporting systematic data browsing. Appropriate level and <b>path</b> <b>filtering</b> techniques are also provided.

Specifically, a 156 -MHz contour-mode disk resonator with Q = 20, 500 exhibits a measured IIP 3 = 19. 49 dBm, which is substantially better than the- 3 dBm previously measured for a 10 -MHz clamped-clamped beam resonator, and which now erases any lingering skepticism regarding the linearity of micro-scale mechanical resonators. Indeed, with IIP 3 ’s about 20 dBm, high Q communication filters using the micromechanical resonators of this work should now be able to replace present-day receive <b>path</b> <b>filters</b> with little degradation (only 0. 11 dB) in cumulative receiver IIP 3.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel path-based methodology for postsilicon timing validation. In timing validation, {{the objective is}} to decide if the timing behavior observed from the silicon is consistent with that predicted by the timing model. At the core of our path-based methodology, we propose a framework to obtain the post-silicon path ranking from observing silicon timing behavior. Then, the consistency is determined by comparing the post-silicon path ranking and the pre-silicon path ranking calculated based on the timing model. Our post-silicon ranking methodology consists of two approaches: ranking optimization and <b>path</b> <b>filtering.</b> We discuss the applications of both approaches and their impacts on the path ranking results.
