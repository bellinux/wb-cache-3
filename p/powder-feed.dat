40|$|Metal powder feeding {{has been}} used widely in various rapid {{prototyping}} and tooling processes such as direct laser deposition (DLD) and layered engineered net shaping (LENS) to achieve near net shape accuracy. Although powder recycling has been practiced, the material usage efficiency has been very low (normally below 30 %). This study compares the process characteristics, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} wire- and <b>powder-feed</b> DLD. A 1. 5 kW diode laser is used to build multiple layer parts, which are compared and analysed in terms of surface finish, microstructure and deposition efficiency. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy are used for the material characterisation. The microstructure of samples from both the methods is similar, with some porosity found in <b>powder-feed</b> components, but the surface finish and material usage efficiency is better for wire-feed samples. The deposition angle is found to be critical in the case of wire feeding and the characteristics of different feed angles are explored. Possible reasons for the different characteristics of the two deposition techniques are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{simulation}} to {{the temperature}} of laser cladding can simulate the process of its technique, which can also optimize {{the parameters of the}} technique and predict the defects of the cladding. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element <b>powder-feed</b> laser single cladding model of the transient temperature field was built based on APDL in ANSYS, where the Gaussian distribution of heat source, forced convection heat transfer and the motion of laser heat source are simulated. The results reveal how the main technique parameters affect the distribution of the temperature, and make a prepare for the experiment of laser cladding...|$|E
40|$|The {{fields of}} rapid {{prototyping}} and tooling, have seen rapid expansion {{due to the}} use of techniques such as multiple-layer laser cladding using blown metal powders. So far, however, only CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers have been used commercially, and the potential advantages, in terms of both costs and efficiency, of using a high powered diode laser have not been investigated. Due to the unique beam characteristics of a diode laser, the work done with other lasers in this field cannot be assumed to hold true in this new area. The aim of the present paper is to establish the relationships between input parameters and final material dimensions and properties in the process by using a 1. 5 kW diode laser and lateral <b>powder-feed</b> nozzle. The composition, microstructure, dimensions and surface propel-ties of the final samples are compared with the major input parameters. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A compact laser-cladding {{head with}} {{integrated}} sensors and coaxial powder feeding {{was developed and}} qualified for industrial applications. Different sensors were integrated in the head for monitoring the optical components and for monitoring and controlling the laser cladding process. The operating status of the dichroitic beam splitter, the protective glass and the <b>powder-feeding</b> nozzle could be acquired in real time. The process monitoring and control based on the infrared temperature signal were adopted {{in order to ensure}} high product quality and reproducibility. These characteristics guarantee the application of the cladding head in industrial environments and for automated production...|$|R
40|$|The limited {{application}} of electrostatic powder coating technology is mainly {{due to the}} insufficient control of the numerous influences. In the first project step a new variable powder coating pilot plant will be developed in collaboration with plant constructors. In the second project step {{the focus is on}} the determination of functional dependencies in the set-ups, handling, <b>powder-feeding</b> and recycling of the powder spray systems, as well as of the ambience conditions. From that optimization concepts with regard to a stable and high quality powder coating process can be worked out. (orig.)

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{known that the}} porosity of thermal barrier coatings is essential to guarantee a sufficiently high strain tolerance of the coating during thermal cycling. However, much less {{is known about the}} influence of the specific morphology of porosity, such as microcracks and typically larger pores, on the performance of the coatings. Both features are usually formed during plasma spraying of yttria-stabilized zirconia (VSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this investigation, the influence of microcracks on the thermal cycling behavior was studied. The amount of microcracks within VSZ thermal barrier coatings was changed by changing the <b>powder-feeding</b> rate. Only small changes of the total porosity were observed. Mercury porosimetry served as a tool to investigate both the amount of microcracks and pores in the coating. Additionally, microcrack densities were determined from metallographical investigations. A linear dependence between the amount of fine pores determined by Hg porosimetry and the crack density was obtained for one set of coatings. Thermal cycling TBC specimens with different microcrack densities were produced and tested in a gas burner test facility. At high surface temperatures (above 1300 degreesC), failure occurred in the ceramic close to the surface. Under these conditions, the samples with increased horizontal microcrack densities showed a significant increase of thermal cycling life...|$|R
40|$|For laser cladding, a {{multitude}} of powders, known from conventional thermal coating processes, and components from process interface systems are available, which, in regard to their properties and their effects on the process have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In the tests, gas-atomized, cobalt-based hard alloy powders, type Stellit 12 and Stellit F, which differed in chemical composition and also partly in melting atmosphere, were applied for laser cladding and plasma-arc powder surfacing processes. The produced coatings were subject to metallographic investigations {{as well as to}} abrasion tests. Furthermore, comparative investigations on two powder feeders and on various nozzle designs were made, and nozzle with co-axial <b>powder-feed</b> was developed. The results showed a tendency towards better abrasive behaviour of the laser-cladded coatings. Responsible for this is rather the finer structure than the hardness. The comparably high dispension precision of the two powder feeders showed their suitability for the laser-cladding-process. With the newly designed head, results which were independent from the welding direction, could be achieved in single- and multipass surface weldingsSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1175 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} manufacturing technique of laser direct metal deposition allows multiple tracks of full density metallic material {{to be built}} to form complex parts for rapid tooling and manufacture. Practical results and theoretical models {{have shown that the}} geometries of the tracks are governed by multiple factors. Original work with single layer cladding identified three basic clad profiles but, so far, models of multiple layer, <b>powder-feed</b> deposition have been based on only two of them. At higher powder mass flow rates, experimental results have shown that a layer's width can become greater than the melt pool width at the substrate surface, but previous analytical models {{have not been able to}} accommodate this. In this paper, a model based on this third profile is established and experimentally verified. The model concentrates on mathematical analysis of the melt pool and establishes mass and energy balances based on one-dimensional heat conduction to the substrate. Deposition track limits are considered as arcs of circles rather than of ellipses, as used in most established models, reflecting the dominance of surface tension forces in the melt pool, and expressions for elongation of the melt pool with increasing traverse speed are incorporated. Trends in layer width and height with major process parameters are captured and predicted layer dimensions correspond well to the experimental values...|$|E
40|$|An oxygen-blown, coal <b>powder-feed,</b> entrained-flow {{demonstration}} gasifier {{was constructed}} {{and operated by}} the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan. Specific tests have been conducted to investigate the gasifier's performance and gain operation experience under part-load conditions either caused by reduced load demands or maintenance needs. Water spray near the exit of the gasifier was employed to test its feasibility in tuning H 2 content or controlling gas exit temperature. To help understand the gasifying characteristics of various part-load conditions, computational simulation was conducted using the commercial CFD solver FLUENT. The 3 -D Navier-Stokes equations and seven species transport equations were solved with eddy-dissipation combustion model. The simulation results provide the velocity, temperature, and species distributions inside the gasifier. The results indicate that water spray injection cools down the gas and increases H 2 mole fraction {{at the cost of}} the reduction of CO and increased production of CO 2. It is recommended that a better way to produce H 2 is to inject steam near the feedstock injection ports where plenty carbon is available and temperature is high and favorable to produce H 2 more efficiently via the gasification reaction without producing CO 2. The simulated results were compared with the experimental data including situations when two of the three fuel injectors were under maintenance. Employing fuel injection through a single injector unexpectedly performs better than applying three injectors. The results indicate the injection velocity speed and momentum strength of each injector, rather than the total injection momentum, are more influential in affecting the gasification efficiency. The results of this study can be used to improve prediction of future part load performance...|$|E
40|$|Cold {{spraying}} is {{a promising}} method for rapid prototyping {{due to its}} high deposition efficiency and high-quality bonding characteristic. However, many researchers have noticed that holes cannot be replenished and will grow larger and larger once formed, which will significantly decrease the deposition efficiency. No work has yet been done on this problem. In this paper, a computational simulation method was used to investigate the origins of these holes {{and the reasons for}} their growth. A thick copper coating was deposited around the pre-drilled, micro-size holes using a cold spraying method on copper substrate to verify the simulation results. The results indicate that the deposition efficiency inside the hole decreases as the hole become deeper and narrower. The repellant force between the particles perpendicular to the impaction direction will lead to porosity if the particles are too close. There is a much lower flattening ratio for successive particles if they are too close at the same location, because the momentum energy contributes to the former particle’s deformation. There is a high probability that the above two phenomena, resulting from high <b>powder-feeding</b> rate, will form the original hole, which will grow larger and larger once it is formed. It is very important to control the powder feeding rate, but the upper limit is yet to be determined by further simulation and experimental investigation...|$|R
