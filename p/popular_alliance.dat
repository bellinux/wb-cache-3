2500|$|This {{triggered}} a nationalist reaction and the coup d'état of 9 June 1923 eventually resulted in Stamboliykski's assassination. An extreme right-wing government under Aleksandar Tsankov took power, {{backed by the}} army and VMRO, which waged a White terror against Agrarians and Communists. In 1926, after the brief War of the Stray Dog, the Tsar persuaded Tsankov to resign, a more moderate government under Andrey Lyapchev took office and an amnesty was proclaimed, although the Communists remained banned. A <b>popular</b> <b>alliance,</b> including the re-organised Agrarians, won the elections of 1931 under the name [...] "Popular Bloc".|$|E
2500|$|The Socialist <b>Popular</b> <b>Alliance</b> Party and the Revolutionary Socialists {{opposed the}} use of state media for the {{promotion}} of el-Sisi as a candidate. The Socialist <b>Popular</b> <b>Alliance</b> also demanded [...] "fair, transparent, credible elections" [...] and argued that allowing the election to turn into a referendum over a single candidate would mean the establishment of a totalitarian state. Ahmed Douma, an activist and member of the Popular Current presently imprisoned for allegedly violating an anti-protest law, called on Hamdeen Sabahi to withdraw his candidacy unless the protest law is annulled and prisoners whose incarceration is justified by this law or otherwise associated with its application are freed. Sabahi and his campaign issued complaints of state bias, assaults and arbitrary arrests against pro-Sabahi campaigners, and destruction of candidate endorsement documents. Sabahi also accused Sisi's campaign of bribing citizens to garner endorsements, as well as having orchestrated prepaid arrangements to acquire endorsements. The Presidential Elections Committee stated that Sabahi broke election rules by announcing his campaign prematurely and that it will investigate the matter. In response to actions undertaken by governmental authorities {{during the course of the}} voting process, Sabahi withdrew his campaign representatives from polling stations and described the election as [...] "a seemingly non-democratic process that lacks a minimum amount of freedom of expression." [...] The Sabahi campaign denounced the arrests of many of its members throughout the course of the voting process.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 November, tens of {{thousands}} of people held protests in Cairo against [...] Morsi demanding that their first freely elected leader respect their wishes either to roll back his 22 November constitutional declaration or to resign. At least one demonstrator died in early clashes with authorities before Tuesday night's massive rally. The opposition <b>Popular</b> <b>Alliance</b> Party said the protester died after inhaling excessive amounts of tear gas, which police used in numerous scuffles with rock-throwing protesters on the side streets leading to the square. And in the Nile Delta city of Mahalla, police reported dozens of injuries when demonstrators stormed and destroyed the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Protests were also held in Alexandria and other cities. FJP offices in Alexandria and Mansoura were stormed, with the latter set ablaze. The Muslim Brotherhood scrapped its own demonstration to show support for Morsi – also scheduled for 27 November 2012 – [...] "to avoid any problems due to tension in the political arena," [...] according to spokesman Mahmoud Ghozlan.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 November, in an {{interview}} with TIME magazine [...] Morsi said of his 22 November constitutional declaration: [...] "If we had a constitution, then all of what I have said or done last week, will stop.... when we have a constitution, what I have issued will stop immediately.... The Constituent Assembly of Egypt rushed to finish its work amid widespread protests against Morsi and his declaration. The rush toward a new constitution spurred a walkout among its drafters, i.e. liberals, human rights activists, and others who were unsatisfied with a range of provisions dealing with {{the role of religion in}} the state, the status of women, and the privileges accorded to the country's army. According to the BBC's Jon Leybe the move was designed to preempt a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court on 2 December, which might once again dissolve the assembly. The Brotherhood hoped that the decree replaced by a completely new constitution would be approved on a referendum and put an end to the unrest. Low-level rallies continued in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday. Dozens of police officers, backed by trucks firing tear gas, arrested numerous protesters, some of whom were beaten by officers as others continued to throw stones at police. The Brotherhood organized counter-demonstrations, including one in Egypt's second city, Alexandria, which attracted a few thousand participants. As protests mounted over Morsi's decision to grant himself sweeping powers until the text of the constitution was ratified in a referendum, the panel tasked with writing the constitution wrapped up its deliberations on Wednesday and readied for a vote on Thursday. By 28 November two more people were killed and hundreds more injured. Egypt Independent reported that one of the dead was Fathy Ghareeb, a founder of the Socialist <b>Popular</b> <b>Alliance</b> Party, who died by suffocation caused by the tear gas fired by the Central Security Forces (CSF) in Tahrir Square. Egypt's Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, the Cairo Appeals Court, and other appeals courts suspended their work until Morsi's decree is rescinded.|$|E
