25|$|Tai Lam Country Park sits in {{the western}} New Territories with an area of 54km². Tai Lam has a small area of {{porphyry}} in the northeast; for the remaining area, it is composed of highly erodible decomposed granite. In 1952, afforestation started as a measure to protect the water catchment area. In spite of the poor soil conditions and the setbacks of fire damage over the years, mature stands of Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana,</b> Pinus elliottii and Eucalyptus species now cover most of the area. In addition, the plantations also offer a good habitat for birds, pangolins, Chinese leopard cat, and barking deer. Nevertheless, Tai Lam is an excellent place for outdoor activities because of its remoteness.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{founding}} of the crown colony in the 19th century, afforestation has taken place to prevent soil erosion in the catchment areas of the reservoirs that were built. During the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, the countryside was deforested as the remaining population required fuel to survive. Most of the trees were cut down and extensive reafforestation was carried out after the war. Trees that were planted are mostly non-native species, such as: <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana,</b> Acacia confusa (Formosan acacia), Lophostemon confertus and the Paper Bark Tree.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Coarse woody debris (CWD) {{in forest}} {{ecosystems}} provides critical habitat for many organisms, maintains a healthy forest structure, and {{is important in}} the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients. However, the characteristics and ecological functions of CWD are poorly documented and understood in the subtropical forests of southern China. In this study, the amount and characteristics of CWD in three typical forest ecosystem types in southern China were investigated at the Dinghushan Nature Reserve. These forests were selected to form a successional sequence with a <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> forest, a mixed coniferous broad-leaved forest, and a monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest representing early-, mid-, and advanced- successional stages, respectively. Both the <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> and the mixed coniferous broad-leaved forests developed on artificial <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> plantations planted in the 1930 s. Nevertheless, these two forests were at different successional stages. The <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> forest was harvested for leaf / needle litterfall, CWD, and under 2 growth until 1990 whereas human interventions were excluded in the mixed coniferous broad-leaved forest.

40|$|Dichotomous mycorrhizas were induced in <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> and Pinus elliottii {{seedlings}} inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius growing under non-axenic conditions. Six {{months after}} inoculation, <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> seedlings exhibited {{a higher degree}} of infection, bore more mycorrhizas and had developed more abundant extramatrical mycelium than seedlings of Pinus elliottii. Nevertheless, seedlings of <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> were stunted and exhibited chorosis of the needles, indicating a possible nutrient deficiency. Histological examination of these pine mycorrhizas showed an ectomycorrhizal association typical of gymnosperms with an intercellular Harting net penetrating between several layers of cortical cells close to the endodermis. However, strong polyphenolic reactions, intracellular hyphae and wall modifications were occasionally observed, indicating that both host-tissue incompatibility and ectendomycorrhizal association can occur in pine species under stressed conditions. postprin...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{seasonality}} on freshwater lignicolous fungi in Tai Po Kau Forest Stream was investigated {{by examining the}} fungal communities on naturally occurring submerged wood. Fungal succession (sequential occurrence of sporulating fungi) was also investigated by studying changes of fungal communities on wood baits of Machilus velutina and <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> over 21 months. Higher species richness, fewer dominant fungi and more infrequent fungi were found on naturally occurring submerged wood during the hot wet season, {{as compared to the}} cool dry season. Fungal communities were variable on collections made over different hot wet seasons, but the communities were consistent during the cool dry season collections. Aniptodera chesapeakensis, Massarina ingoldiana and Sporoschisma nigroseptatum dominated the fungal communities during the cool dry season, while Nectria cf. byssicola was dominant during the hot wet season. During 21 months submersion of wood baits of Machilus velutina and <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana,</b> three distinct types of fungal communities were observed, i. e. pioneer, early and later successional groups. Higher species richness and more dominant fungi were found on both wood types during the early successional stage. Differences in successional groups were more prominent on wood baits of <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana.</b> Fungal communities on wood baits of Machilus velutina and <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> were similar during both pioneer and early successional stages, but differed at the later successional stage. Nectria cf. byssicola, Sporoschisma nigroseptatum and S. uniseptatum were early colonisers on both wood types. Savoryella lignicola was a later coloniser on Machilus velutina, while Dictyosporium digitatum, Massarina bipolaris and M. ingoldiana were later colonisers on <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana.</b> A total of 175 fungi, including 56 ascomycetes, 1 basidiomycete, 115 anamorphic fungi, 2 myxomycetes and 1 zygomycete, were recorded in this study. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} effect of drought on the photosynthetic traits of leaves in forest ecosystems in subtropical regions is unclear. In this study, three limiting processes (stomatal, mesophyll and biochemical limitations) that control the photosynthetic capacity and three resource use efficiencies (intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and light use efficiency (LUE)), which were characterized as the interactions between photosynthesis and environmental resources, were estimated in two species (Schima superba and <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana)</b> under drought conditions. A quantitative limitation analysis demonstrated that the drought-induced limitation of photosynthesis in Schima superba was primarily due to stomatal limitation, whereas for <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana,</b> both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations generally exhibited similar magnitudes. Although the mesophyll limitation represented only 1 % of the total limitation in Schima superba, it accounted for 24 % of the total limitations for <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana.</b> Furthermore, {{a positive relationship between}} the LUE and NUE and a marginally negative relationship or trade-off between the NUE and iWUE were observed in the control plots. However, drought disrupted the relationships between the resource use efficiencies. Our findings may have important implications for reducing the uncertainties in model simulations and advancing the understanding of the interactions between ecosystem functions and climate change...|$|E
30|$|According to Klaassen [31], {{different}} timber species presented different erosion degrees. For example, {{the samples}} from <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> were basically {{in a minor}} erosion level, and the samples from Terminalia hainanensis had moderate to heavy erosion. A similar result was also observed in a previous study on shipwrecks [41].|$|E
40|$|<b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> bark proanthocyanidins (PMBPs), {{an active}} {{component}} isolated from <b>Pinus</b> <b>massoniana</b> bark, {{has been reported}} to possess a wide range of biochemical proper-ties. Here, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of PMBPs on ovarian cancer. The results indicated that PMBPs significantly reduced the growth of ovarian cancer cells and induced dose-dependent apoptosis. The underlying mechanisms involved were elucidated to include the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2 and the activation of Caspase 3 / 9, suggesting that PMBPs triggered apoptosis through activation of mitochondria-associated apoptotic pathway. In addition, wound heal-ing and transwell chamber assays revealed that PMBPs could suppress migration and inva-sion of ovarian cancer cells. PMBPs dramatically inhibited MMP- 9 activity and expression, blocked the activity of NFκB and the activation of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 MAPK.
