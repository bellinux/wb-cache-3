Perry stated, [...] "Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless." [...] Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke. Perry intends to become [...] "more of a Joni Mitchell", releasing folk and acoustic music.

2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E

And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But I knew, and she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E

Chapman was arrested without incident. In his statement to police three hours later, Chapman stated, [...] "I’m sure the big <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book.

60|$|There I stayed, {{squatting}} {{on my feet}} on the mats, {{admiring the}} mimic volcano which in the orthodox artistic way the charcoal was arranged to represent, and trying my best to warm myself over the idea. But the idea proved almost as cold comfort as the brazier itself. The higher aesthetic <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> in paradise, and the bodily half somewhere on the chill confines of outer space. The spot would no doubt have proved wholly heaven to that witty individual who was so anxious to exchange the necessities of life for a certainty of its luxuries. For here, according to our scheme of things, was everything one {{had no right to}} expect, and nothing that one had. My European belongings looked very gross littering the mats; and I seemed to myself a boor beside the unconscious breeding of those about me. Yet it was only a poor village inn, and its people were but peasants, after all.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have already}} told the reader, that every night, {{when the family}} were gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes. It happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by the sorrel nag, who was his valet. When he came I was fast asleep, my clothes fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist. I awaked at the noise he made, and {{observed}} him to deliver his message in some disorder; after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very confused account {{of what he had}} seen. This I presently discovered, for, going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he asked me “the meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to be at other times; that his vale assured him, some <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> white, some yellow, at least not so white, and some brown.” ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was still}} in my mind, for long it {{remained}} in my mind, a bitterness against Mary. I had left her, I had lost her, we had parted; but from Germany to America and all through America and home again to my marriage and with me after my marriage, it rankled that she could still go on living a life independent of mine. I had not yet lost my desire to possess her, to pervade and dominate her existence; my resentment that though she loved me she had first not married me and afterwards not consented to come away with me was smouldering under the closed hatches of my mind. And so while the better <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> laying hold of this work because it gave me {{the hope of a}} complete distraction and escape from my narrow and jealous self, that lower being of the pit was also rejoicing in the great enterprises before me and in the marriage upon which I had now determined, because it was a last trampling upon my devotion to Mary, because it defied and denied some lurking claims to empire I could suspect in her. I {{want to tell you that}} particularly because so I am made, so you are made, so most of us are made. There is scarcely a high purpose in all the world that has no dwarfish footman at its stirrup, no base intention over which there does not ride at least the phantom of an angel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> a song by American singer-songwriter Chris Cornell, {{from his}} third solo studio album, Scream. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> the first {{official}} single for Canada and Europe (and second official single overall) and was released as a digital download on October 12, 2008 in Canada and Germany. There is no indication of a release in the US. The non-explicit version of the song was previewed on Virgin Radio 999, where listeners were encouraged to enter a poll of the audience's reaction to the song. The Album version of the song was leaked on the 12th November, where the outro is the seamless integration into the next song [...] "Time", on the [...] "album orientated" [...] Scream. California DJ Steve Aoki also made a remix of the song which can be downloaded for free in MP3 off his record label's official website, while his remix also appears on the official [...] "Part <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> (Remix EP)" [...] digital release.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> {{proud and}} wants to own this movie, promote it, {{generally}} celebrate it {{and look forward to}} all the possibilities that may emerge from the experience. And an equally real <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> wants to lock myself in a dark room for a month and pretend it never happened. Why the latter? Because the truth is that I had not a bit of control over the final product, and Hollywood does tend to suckify things. Often quite badly.|$|R
60|$|This is not {{the place}} to enlarge upon the sensations of a man who feels for the first time a ship move under his feet to his own {{independent}} word. In my case they were not unalloyed. I was not wholly alone with my command; for there was that stranger in my cabin. Or rather, I was not completely and wholly with her. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> absent. That mental feeling of being in two places at once affected me physically as if the mood of secrecy had penetrated my very soul. Before an hour had elapsed since the ship had begun to move, having occasion to ask the mate (he stood by my side) to take a compass bearing of the Pagoda, I caught myself reaching up to his ear in whispers. I say I caught myself, but enough had escaped to startle the man. I can't describe it otherwise than by saying that he shied. A grave, preoccupied manner, as though he were in possession of some perplexing intelligence, did not leave him henceforth. A little later I moved away from the rail to look at the compass with such a stealthy gait that the helmsman noticed it--and I could not help noticing the unusual roundness of his eyes. These are trifling instances, though it's to no commander's advantage to be suspected of ludicrous eccentricities. But I was also more seriously affected. There are to a seaman certain words, gestures, that should in given conditions come as naturally, as instinctively as the winking of a menaced eye. A certain order should spring on to his lips without thinking; a certain sign should get itself made, so to speak, without reflection. But all unconscious alertness had abandoned me. I had to make an effort of will to recall myself back (from the cabin) to the conditions of the moment. I felt that I was appearing an irresolute commander to those people who were watching me more or less critically.|$|E

But when I first read it, I was scared of it. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was,</b> like, it’s so unattractive! But I liked that it didn't glamorize alcohol. And what's admirable about Billie is that she's a straight shooter. She doesn't {{have a lot of}} pretense. It's like, ‘Take me as I am. You like me, fine! You don't, I don't give a damn!’ There's something quite empowering about somebody who doesn't care what other people think. Billie is learning about herself.
