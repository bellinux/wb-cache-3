60|$|Out of the court, and a {{long way}} out of it, there is {{considerable}} excitement too, for men of science and philosophy come to look, and carriages set down doctors at the corner who arrive with the same intent, {{and there is more}} learned talk about inflammable gases and phosphuretted hydrogen than the court has ever imagined. Some of these authorities (of course the wisest) hold with indignation that the deceased had no business to die in the alleged manner; and being reminded by other authorities of a certain inquiry into the evidence for such deaths reprinted in the sixth volume of the Philosophical Transactions; and also of a book not quite unknown on English medical jurisprudence; and likewise of the Italian case of the Countess Cornelia Baudi as set forth in detail by one Bianchini, prebendary of Verona, who wrote a scholarly work or so and was occasionally heard of in his time as having gleams of reason in him; and also of the testimony of Messrs. Fodere and Mere, two pestilent Frenchmen who WOULD investigate the subject; and further, of the corroborative testimony of Monsieur Le Cat, a rather celebrated French surgeon once upon a time, who had the unpoliteness to live in a house where such a case occurred and even to write an account of it--still they regard the late Mr. Krook's obstinacy in going out of the world by any such by-way as wholly unjustifiable and personally offensive. The less the court understands of all this, the more the court likes it, and the greater enjoyment it has in the stock in trade of the Sol's Arms. Then there comes the artist of a <b>picture</b> <b>newspaper,</b> with a foreground and figures ready drawn for anything from a wreck on the Cornish coast to a review in Hyde Park or a meeting in Manchester, and in Mrs. Perkins' own room, memorable evermore, he then and there throws in upon the block Mr. Krook's house, as large as life; in fact, considerably larger, making a very temple of it. Similarly, being permitted to look in {{at the door of the}} fatal chamber, he depicts that apartment as three-quarters of a mile long by fifty yards high, at which the court is particularly charmed. All this time the two gentlemen before mentioned pop in and out of every house and assist at the philosophical disputations--go everywhere and listen to everybody--and yet are always diving into the Sol's parlour and writing with the ravenous little pens on the tissue-paper.|$|E

40|$|Job {{losses and}} {{organisational}} restructuring at Fairfax continue {{to transform the}} landscape of Australian media It’s clear that newspapers in their traditional form are approaching a point of no return, as news consumption habits are changing for good. It’s {{all too easy to}} blame (or praise) the internet for this transformation of the media landscape; the simple fact is that it now plays an important role as a medium through which news is accessed and shared by the general public. One side effect of this shift is that traditional metrics for tracking the market share and influence of media companies no longer provide the full <b>picture.</b> <b>Newspaper</b> circulation figures are no longer a relevant or reliable metric (if they ever were). But what measures of importance are really available to us in the online space? Particularly when news is now distributed across a variety of platforms from aggregators like Google News and Flipboard to social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter? Indeed, how do we understand “importance” in this context – is it important for a website simply to attract visitors, or should we also take into account how those visitors react to what they encounter, for example by sharing links to the content through their own social networks? New measures Only a very limited amount of independently verified information is available on how Australian news websites perform in this context; what internal click-through data they may gather is rarely available to the general public. To add to the mix, and to generate a reliable, comparative index of the resonance for the major Australian online news and commentary sites, my colleagues and I at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation at Queensland University of Technology have developed a tool which tracks the circulation of links to these sites on the social media platform Twitter. Day by day, we track all tweets which contain links to any of the country’s leading national and regional news sites, {{as well as to the}} various opinion and commentary sites such as Crikey and The Conversation; we capture those tweets even if the original link has been converted into a short URL (using bit. ly, t. co, or any other shortening service). The only tweets we are unable to capture at this point are “button” retweets, but we do track “manual” retweets (e. g. “RT @user …”), which serve as a reasonable basis for extrapolation. Counting these links for each of the sites is a measure half-way between newspaper circulation figures and TV ratings: link circulation figures on Twitter don’t simply indicate the size of these sites 2 ̆ 7 audiences (as paper circulations do), but also point to readers 2 ̆ 7 levels of engagement with the content they encounter (as TV ratings can). It’s one thing to read a story on a news Website – it’s another to go to the trouble of sharing it with your social media followers. A measure of engagement As with print circulations and TV ratings, though, there remains room for interpretation here, too: what users share and what they read may diverge to some extent. As a professional on Twitter, for example, I may not want to let my followers know about all the sports news I read; conversely, I may pass on links to stories which I haven’t read fully (or at all) myself, just because they sound interesting. But such margin of error exists in most ratings systems – the newspaper we buy to put under the cat’s litter tray still adds to The Sunday Mail’s circulation figures; the TV running while we make dinner still adds to the ratings for ABC News. What’s unique about our Twitter news circulation index, though, is that it’s neither based on simple sales figures (like print circulations), nor on an extrapolation from the media consumption patterns of a small number of more or less representative households (like ratings). Rather, apart from “button” retweets, we capture all tweets that contain links to Australian news and opinion sites – that is, we track active, visible, deliberate engagement with Australian news content. 18 - 25 June 2012 The first weeks of this Australian Twitter News Index (ATNIX) were momentous for the Australian media industry, of course; Fairfax announced some major job cuts, and News Ltd revealed plans to follow suit. This may well have boosted the circulation of links to Australian news sites on Twitter – and especially perhaps to Fairfax properties themselves. Over the course of the week from 18 to 25 June, we captured some 150, 000 tweets: ATNIX week 25 / 2012 – news sites CCI; [URL] In a week of bad news for Fairfax, that’s a very strong result for its two major sites, the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. The marketshare of News Ltd sites is also interesting: individually, these sites don’t command positions as prominent as those of the two leading Fairfax papers, but in combination, the four top News Ltd sites news. com. au, The Australian, The Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph still account for almost exactly 25...|$|E

Our algorithm, moreover, is a method that not only labels components but also extracts component contours at the same time, which proves to be more useful than those algorithms that only label components...|$|R

On the the other hand, the other approach analyzed each space as part of a whole. The study universe was formed by houses built between 1886 - 1916. The analysis was done with the tools used for the study of everyday life and the understanding of architectural space. The sources of information were varied and abundant, including plans, <b>pictures,</b> <b>newspapers</b> and periodicals.
