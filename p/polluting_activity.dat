In this study, we (i) evaluated a Bayesian isotopic mixing model (stable isotope analysis in R [SIAR]) for NO 3 - source apportionment using 2 yr of delta N- 15 -NO 3 - and delta O- 18 -NO 3 data from 29 locations within river basins in Flanders (Belgium) and five expert-defined NO 3 - <b>polluting</b> <b>activities,</b> (ii) used the NO 3 - source contributions as input to an unsupervised learning algorithm (k-means clustering) to reclassify sampling locations into NO 3 - <b>polluting</b> <b>activities,</b> and (iii) assessed if a decision tree model of physicochemical data could retrieve the isotope-based and expert-defined classifications. Based on the SIAR and delta B- 11 results, manure/sewage {{was identified as}} a major NO 3 - source, whereas soil N, fertilizer NO 3 -, and NH 4 + in fertilizer and rain were intermediate sources and NO 3 - in precipitation was a minor source. The k-means clustering algorithm allowed classification of NO 3 <b>polluting</b> <b>activities</b> that corresponded well to the expert-defined classifications. A decision tree model of physicochemical parameters allowed us to correctly classify 50 to 100 % of the sampling locations as compared with the k-means clustering approach. We suggest that NO 3 - <b>polluting</b> <b>activities</b> can be identified via clustering of NO 3 source contributions from samples representing an entire river basin. Classification of future monitoring locations into these classes could use decision tree models based on physicochemical data. The latter approach holds a substantial degree of uncertainty but provides more inherent information for dedicated abatement strategies than monitoring of NO 3 - concentrations alone...|$|R
30|$|Introduction The {{healthcare}} {{activity is}} recognized as a major <b>polluting</b> <b>activity.</b> In France, it generates 800, 000  tons of waste cremated each year, and represents 12 % of the tertiary energy consumptions. In the United States, it generates 7000 tons of waste per day and 7 % of total CO 2 emissions in 2007 were attributed to him. Ultimately, such waste production is associated with adverse environmental and health effects. Nevertheless, near half of the hospital waste would be recyclable, particularly in our intensive care units (ICU) [1]. Furthermore, sustainable development solutions generate profits.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{models of}} {{enforcing}} environmental law have incorporated varying assumptions about regulatory objectives. This paper examines {{the consequences of}} different attitudes toward the benefits and costs of pollution control {{on the part of}} regulators who have limited powers and resources. We find that greater weight given to compliance costs relative to the social damages of the <b>polluting</b> <b>activity</b> will bring outcomes closer to the optimum when the regulator is strong, but may move outcome further from the social optimum when regulatory powers are weak. When negotiated noncompliance is an option, greater consideration of compliance costs will tend to produce better results.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} how income-induced environmental policy differences and damage heterogeneity interact {{to determine the}} comparative advantage in a <b>polluting</b> <b>activity.</b> In a non-cooperative framework, North and South regulate two types of pollution, local pollution (e. g., air and water pollution) and global pollution (e. g., greenhouse gas emissions), each of which induces heterogeneous damages for consumers. I find that (1) North or South can have the comparative advantage in the dirty sector; (2) whatever the region with this comparative advantage, the worldwide level of global pollution can either increase or decrease with trade; (3) local and global emissions evolve symmetrically in each region with trade, even though pollution regulations may be asymmetric...|$|E
40|$|Abstract onlyA {{two stage}} game is {{analyzed}} in which citizens who own mobile {{factors of production}} also vote for domestic environmental policies. It is shown that individuals {{have an incentive to}} cross-haul polluting factors across jurisdictions when direct controls are used to regulate emissions, that this cross-hauling can induce a ratcheting up of environmental policy in both jurisdictions, and can occur even when jurisdictions are identical and offer the same direct rates of return on installed capacity. The importance of the order in which capacity export decisions and voting occur are also analyzed, and it is found that factor mobility may induce ratcheting up of environmental policy even in a jurisdiction that acts as a host to all <b>polluting</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the features of}} optimal environmental policies composed of pollution standards and costly inspection processes, where fines for exceeding the standards depend both {{on the degree of}} transgression and the environmental technology that the firm uses to reduce the social impact of its <b>polluting</b> <b>activity.</b> We show that the main characteristics of these policies depend crucially on when the firm selects that technology with respect to the timing of the policy announcement. In fact, the firm has incentives to over-invest in green technologies when the policy is announced afterwards; and to under-invest in them if the environmental authority plays first. Surprisingly, we find that both the firm and the regulator prefer that the firm invests in technology before the policy is announced, even when this implies that expected penalties for noncompliance might be zero.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} that an international permit trading system may hurt relatively poor countries by making associated economic activities unaffordable. A model is constructed {{in which the}} free market solution is Pareto inefficient {{as a result of}} pollution. The introduction of tradable permits allows pollution to be internalised, and brings about an increase in the total social surplus. But when incomes vary, this may not lead to a Pareto improvement; those in poor countries stop the <b>polluting</b> <b>activity</b> because they cannot afford to do otherwise. Only those in relatively rich countries are made better off. This may explain why poor countries are reluctant to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, itself advocating a permit trading scheme. The politico-economic implications of permit trading are also examined. We show that the democratic requirements for ratification impose a lower bound on pollution reduction that can be achieved through a system of pollution permits with trade...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} known {{analyses}} of the environmental problem is {{the discussion of the}} externalities as a market failure and the solutions that could be offered by public policies and law to deal with them. The classic discussion of the opposed ideas of Pigou and Coase has been renewed nowadays in the discussions of the option between command and control measures, taxation of emissions and promotion of pollution reduction through a carbon emissions reductions trade system, related with the climate changes. Generally considering, the Pigouvian model suggests taxation over <b>polluting</b> <b>activities.</b> Coase has criticized the approach of the economists after Pigou who accepted the so-called Pigouvian taxes as the solution to externalities. The possibilities of transacting over the social costs were the subject discussed in his “The problem of social cost”.

40|$|We seek {{to explain}} the {{emergence}} of spatial heterogeneity regarding development and pollution {{on the basis of}} interactions associated with the movement of capital and <b>polluting</b> <b>activities</b> from one economy to another. We use a simple dynamical model describing capital accumulation along the lines of a fixed-savings-ratio Solow-type model capable of producing endogenous growth and convergence behavior, and pollution accumulation in each country with pollution diffusion between countries or regions. The basic mechanism underlying the movements of capital across space is the quest for locations where the marginal productivity of capital is relatively higher than the productivity at the location of origin. The notion that capital moves to locations of relatively higher productivity but not necessarily from locations of high concentration to locations of low concentration, does not face difficulties associated with the Lucas paradox. We show that, {{for a wide range of}} capital and pollution rates of flow, spatial heterogeneity emerges even between two economies with identical fundamental structures. These results can be interpreted as suggesting that the neoclassical convergence hypothesis might not hold under differential rates of flow of capital and <b>polluting</b> <b>activities</b> among countries of the same fundamental structure...|$|R

In 1989 several summer smog episodes occurred which contributed to exceedence of Dutch air quality limit values for NO 2 on a few stations. However exceedence of the Dutch draft limit values for O 3 were not detected. At a few stations the limit values for black smoke were exceeded and at one station the maximal allowable hour value was exceeded once caused by an incidental <b>polluting</b> <b>activity.</b> Guide values for SO 2 and NO 2 were exceeded at 6 % and 80 % resp. {{of the total number}} of stations.

A way to contribute to the assessment of the environmental impact of mercury release in the Pantanal is to make use of bioaccumulation. Thus, determinations of total mercury in 188 Gastropods of three different species were made in seven different sampling sites during the dry and wet periods. Increase of mercury levels in the snails was restricted to the gold mining area and adjacent sedimentation areas. The largest mercury concentrations were found at the Tanque dos Padres site, reaching 2. 04 mug g(- 1) in individuals of Pomacea scalaris. In the other sampling sites, molluscs collected in the Araras/Piuval Bay complex, a mercury retention area, showed the largest mercury concentration, reaching up to 1. 12 mug g(- 1...|$|E
40|$|Farmers in the EU do not trade {{greenhouse}} gases under the Kyoto agreement. This is an empirical puzzle because agriculture {{is a significant}} contributor of {{greenhouse gases}} (GHG) in the EU and may harvest private net gains from trade. Furthermore, the US has strongly advocated land-use practices as ‘the missing link’ in past climate negotiations. We argue that farmers have relatively low marginal reduction costs and that consequences {{in terms of the}} effect on permit price and technology are overall positive in the EU Emission Trading System (ETS). Thus, we propose a project-based system for including the farming practices in the EU ETS that reduces the uncertainty from measuring emission reduction in this sector. The system encourages GHG reduction either by introducing a new and less polluting practice or by reducing the <b>polluting</b> <b>activity.</b> When doing so, farmers will receive GHG permits corresponding to the amount of reduction which can be stored for later use or sold in the EU ETS...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} assessed {{and evaluated}} the soil <b>polluting</b> <b>activities</b> in 30 Romanian and Hungarian {{settlements in the}} region of the Double, Black and White Körös-Cris Rivers. Pb concentrations are mainly higher than the limit values with maximum values registered in the area of landfill and near the roads. The concentration of Cu and Zn in soils of the region is below the alarming values. In some places Cd levels in soils reached the alert threshold. Plant samples mostly do not contain higher than permitted levels of heavy metals. One of the main goals of the study is to contribute to the future sustainable use of the environment and conservation actions in the region in order to implement regional development policy. We must therefore address the social activities that involve a risk of soil pollution in the region, especially in the Körös-Cris Valley. Science-based assessment of the level of pollution can lead to the development of implementing procedures to reduce the impact of these activities.
