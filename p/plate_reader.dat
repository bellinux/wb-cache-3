5000|$|Absorbance {{detection}} {{has been}} available in microplate readers for more than 3 decades, and is used for assays such as ELISA assays, protein and nucleic acid quantification or enzyme activity assays (i.e. in the MTT assay for cell viability). A light source illuminates the sample using a specific wavelength (selected by an optical filter, or a monochromator), and a light detector located {{on the other side}} of the well measures how much of the initial (100%) light is transmitted through the sample: the amount of transmitted light will typically be related to the concentration of the molecule of interest. Several conventional colorimetric analyses have been miniaturized to function quantitatively in a <b>plate</b> <b>reader,</b> with performance suitable for research purposes. Examples of analyses converted to <b>plate</b> <b>reader</b> methods include several for ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, [...] urea, iron(II), and orthophosphate. [...] More recent colorimetric chemistries have been developed directly for use in plate readers.|$|E

Thus through NLETS, a law enforcement agency in one state could search for someone's criminal and driver records in another state. NLETS potentially serves as a better tool to search for minor misdemeanors and traffic violations that would not be in the NCIC.|$|E

50|$|Luminescence is {{the result}} of a {{chemical}} or biochemical reaction. Luminescence detection is simpler optically than fluorescence detection because luminescence does not require a light source for excitation or optics for selecting discrete excitation wavelengths. A typical luminescence optical system consists of a light-tight reading chamber and a PMT detector. Some <b>plate</b> <b>readers</b> use an Analog PMT detector while others have a photon counting PMT detector. Photon Counting is widely accepted as the most sensitive means of detecting luminescence. Some <b>plate</b> <b>readers</b> offer filter wheel or tunable wavelength monochromator optical systems for selecting specific luminescent wavelengths. The ability to select multiple wavelengths, or even wavelength ranges, allows for detection of assays that contain multiple luminescent reporter enzymes, the development of new luminescence assays, as well as a means to optimize signal to noise.|$|R
50|$|There are {{instruments}} {{for measuring the}} dynamic or static light scattered from samples in a microplate. Companies that sell <b>plate</b> <b>readers</b> for dynamic light scattering include Wyatt Technology and Malvern Technology. Another company, Harbinger Biotechnology and Engineering, specializes in an instrument for static light scattering. Laser-based microplate nephelometers are also available.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} was first described by Semisotnov et al. (1991) using 1,8-ANS and quartz cuvettes. 3 Dimensional Pharmaceuticals {{were the first}} to describe a high-throughput version using a <b>plate</b> <b>reader</b> and Wyeth Research published a variation of the method with SYPRO Orange instead of 1,8-ANS. SYPRO Orange has an excitation/emission wavelength profile compatible with qPCR machines which are almost ubiquitous in institutions that perform molecular biology research. The name Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) was introduced later but thermofluor is preferable as thermofluor is no longer trademarked and differential scanning fluorimetry is easily confused with differential scanning calorimetry.|$|E
50|$|A ‘sandwich’ {{is formed}} of {{solid-phase}} antibody, suPAR and peroxidase-conjugated antibody. The concentration (ng/mL plasma) of suPAR {{in the patient}} sample is determined via interpolation, based on a calibration curve prepared from seven suPAR standards. Recombinant suPAR standards are calibrated against healthy human blood donor samples. Absorbance is measured using a microtiter <b>plate</b> <b>reader,</b> at 450 nm with a 650 nm reference filter. Measurement of suPAR levels from blood samples provides greater accuracy and precision than measurement from urine or cerebral spinal fluid. suPAR level is not changed by transient illness such as cold. It also remains stable after a blood sample is taken despite storage.|$|E
50|$|Antimicrobial {{susceptibility}} testing (AST) {{can be done}} on 96-well plates by diluting the {{antimicrobial agent}} at varying concentrations in broth inoculated with bacteria and measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration that results in no growth. However, these methods cannot be used to study some membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, which are inhibited by the broth itself. The virtual colony count procedure takes advantage of this fact by first exposing bacterial cells to the active antimicrobial agent in a low-salt buffer for two hours, then simultaneously inhibiting antimicrobial activity and inducing exponential growth by adding broth. The growth kinetics of surviving cells can then be monitored using a temperature-controlled <b>plate</b> <b>reader.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{equipment}} {{required is}} a colorimeter, some cuvettes and a suitable color reagent. The process may be automated, e.g. {{by the use}} of an AutoAnalyzer or by Flow injection analysis. Recently, colorimetric analyses developed for colorimeters have been adapted for use with <b>plate</b> <b>readers</b> to speed up analysis and reduce the waste stream.|$|R
40|$|The maximum {{exponential}} growth rate, the Malthusian parameter (MP), {{is commonly used}} {{as a measure of}} fitness in experimental studies of adaptive evolution and of the effects of antibiotic resistance and other genes on the fitness of planktonic microbes. Thanks to automated, multi-well optical density <b>plate</b> <b>readers</b> and computers, with little hands-on effort investigators can readily obtain hundreds of estimates of MPs in less than a day. Here we compare estimates of the relative fitness of antibiotic susceptible and resistant strains of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus based on MP data obtained with automated multi-well <b>plate</b> <b>readers</b> with the results from pairwise competition experiments. This leads us to question the reliability of estimates of MP obtained with these high throughput devices and the utility of these estimates of the maximum growth rates to detect fitness differences...|$|R

50|$|After abandoning his Ford Mustang at Roanoke-Blacksburg Regional Airport, Flanagan drove {{a rented}} Chevrolet Sonic north on I-81, then east on I-66. An {{automated}} license <b>plate</b> <b>reader</b> in a Virginia state trooper's car identified the rented Sonic at 11:20 a.m. The trooper called for backup {{and attempted to}} initiate a traffic stop, but Flanagan sped away. After a pursuit of less than two miles, Flanagan's car ran {{off the side of}} the road and struck an embankment near Markham. Flanagan was found inside the car with gunshot wounds, which were apparently self-inflicted while he was driving. He was airlifted to Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, where he was declared dead at 1:26 p.m.|$|E
50|$|Automatic {{number plate}} {{recognition}} (ANPR) or an automatic license <b>plate</b> <b>reader</b> (ALPR) {{is a system}} that uses optical character recognition on images to read the license plates on vehicles. While the technology is most commonly used by law enforcement for cataloging vehicle movements and traffic enforcement, ANPR has also been used as a method of electronic toll collection. ANPR can be used in conjunction with transponder systems. If a transponder is not detected on a vehicle, a system of cameras located at each junction logs the vehicle’s unique identity and an invoice is mailed. The use of ANPR reduces fraud related to cash transactions or non-payment, makes charging effective, and reduces the amount of required manpower to enforce the toll road.|$|E
5000|$|A {{prominent}} signaling molecule {{in cells}} is Calcium, (Ca2+), {{which can be}} detected with a Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl dye. It binds to free Ca2+ ions, which in turn slightly increase fluorescence of the Fluo-4 AM. [...] The drawback of the Fluo-4 dye formulation is that a washing step is required to remove extracellular dye, which may provide unwanted background signals. For instance, washing puts additional stress on the cells, as well as consumes time, which prevents a timely analysis.Recently, an alternative dye solution and microplate system has been developed called FLIPR® (fluorometric imaging <b>plate</b> <b>reader),</b> which uses a Calcium 3 assay reagent that {{does not require a}} washing step.

50|$|Alexandrov et al. (2008) {{published}} {{a variation on}} the thermofluor assay where SYPRO Orange was replaced by N-4-(7-diethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)phenylmaleimide (CPM), a compound that only fluoresces after reacting with a nucleophile. CPM has a high preference for thiols over other typical biological nucleophiles and therefore will react with cysteine side chains before others. Cysteines are typically buried in the interior of a folded protein as they are hydrophobic. When a protein denatures cysteine thiols become available and a fluorescent signal can be read from reacted CPM. The exitation and emission wavelengths for reacted CPM are 387 nm/ 463 nm so a fluorescence <b>plate</b> <b>reader</b> or a qPCR machine with specialised filters is required. Alexandrov et al. used the technique successfully on the membrane proteins Apelin GPCR and FAAH as well as β-lactoglobin which fibrillates on heating rather than going to a molten globule.|$|E
5000|$|The bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) {{is based}} on a simple {{colorimetric}} measurement and is the most common protein quantification assay. BCA is similar to the Lowry or Bradford protein assays and was first made commercially available by Pierce, which is now owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific. In the BCA assay, a protein’s peptide bonds quantitatively reduce Cu2+ to Cu1+, which produces a light blue color. BCA chelates Cu1+ at a 2:1 ratio resulting in a more intensely colored species that absorbs at 562 nm. Absorbance of a sample at 562 nm is used to determine the bulk protein concentration in the sample. Assay results are compared with known standard curves after analysis with a spectrophotometer or <b>plate</b> <b>reader.</b> [...] Total assay time is 30 minutes to one hour. While this assay is ubiquitous and fast, it lacks specificity since it counts all protein, the virus preparation to be quantified must contain very low levels host cell proteins.|$|E
5000|$|Commercially {{available}} diagnostic kits {{are also}} available. One such kit is the [...] "Trupoint" [...] diagnostic assay from PerkinElmer, Inc. This assay is a time-resolved fluorescence quenching assay that utilizes the PerkinEmer [...] "SignalClimb" [...] {{technology that is}} based on two labels that bind in close proximity to one another but on opposite DNA strands. One label is a fluorescent lanthanide chelate, which serves as the label that is monitored through an adequate 96/384 well <b>plate</b> <b>reader.</b> The other label is an organic quencher molecule. The basis of this assay is the [...] "quenching" [...] or repressing of the lanthanide chelate signal by the organic quencher molecule when the two are in close proximity - as they would be when the DNA duplex is in its native state. Upon helicase activity on the duplex, the quencher and lanthanide labels get separated as the DNA is unwound. This loss in proximity negates the quenchers ability to repress the lanthanide signal, causing a detectable increase in fluorescence that is representative of the amount of unwound DNA and {{can be used as a}} quantifiable measurement of helicase activity.|$|E
50|$|Instead, {{the city}} and the Police Department {{increased}} the turnout of law enforcement in 2012, with a tougher stance on minor infractions. Nearly 600 officers were on duty.

40|$|The {{boundaries}} that delineate public from private sphere have challenged our political system’s foundations since its origination. License <b>plate</b> <b>readers</b> (LPRs), a tool used {{by law enforcement}} and private businesses, cause citizens and their government to question the criteria separating public and private information. While police and repossession agencies contend that license <b>plate</b> <b>readers</b> aid their work, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argues that surveillance equipment interferes with an individual’s right to privacy. Addressing such privacy concerns requires the public to hold its government accountable by petitioning for limits on LPR use and data retention. LPRs also pose unique threats to public administration. Placing this technology {{into the hands of}} public and private interests without informing constituents hinders government accountability. Even though LPRs help police maintain a cost- effective way to handle crime, the United States’ federalist structure prevents uniform regulations at local, state, and federal levels. Politics pit those favoring big government against supporters of limited government; thus, creating deadlocks on the issue of LPRs violating an individual’s privacy. LPRs ultimately provide a new opportunity to reopen age-old debates within the fields of political science and public administration...|$|R
