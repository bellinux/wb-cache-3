They have traditionally been prepared in open moulds with styrene vapour allowed to escape to the workspace and environment. This paper considers the development of in-mould gel-coating processes. A Double Glass <b>Plate</b> <b>Mould</b> (DGPM) was used to prepare flat composite test panels. Laminates were manufactured by liquid composite moulding processes. Conventional hand painted gel-coat, innovative In-Mould Gel-Coating with a trilayer separator fabric (IMGC) or In-Mould Surfacing with a silicone shim (IMS) were studied. The surface quality of the final products was measured using a Wave-Scan device while the adhesion of the gel-coat was characterised by pull-off tests. The new processes offer reasonable properties in a cleaner, more controlled process...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} project is to analyze the hexagonal floor tile design by simulation with Moldflow Plastic Insight software (MPI) and to optimize the mould design parameter using Taguchi method. The product is designed in hexagonal shape build with interlocking features and {{will be used for}} application in indoor sports activities such as futsal, badminton, takraw and other sports. The material used for this design is thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) that increased the slipping resistance due to active and fast movement on it. The design of the product will be analyzed using MoldFlow Plastic Insight software (MPI) to reduce the warpage problem that appears during injecting the product. Warpage is the deflection of the part on the product design from its original shape. Taguchi method is used to optimize the parameter of the mould design for injecting the product with less warpage. In addition, the signal to noise ratio and analysis of variance is utilized to optimize the parameter for the product. The Taguchi method is conducted to minimize the warpage in both +z deflection and -z deflection. The result shown that, the most significance parameter of the mold design that tend to minimized the warpage values are from the cooling channel diameter at cavity half, cooling channel distance at core half and cooling channel diameter at core half. Also, from the result the summarized of the mold design parameter that reduces the warpage problem has been identified for the further process which is fabrication of mold...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} realize {{two-dimensional}} lithography at high resolution (several tens of nanometres), {{a new approach}} to the lithography of a fine pattern using a confined etchant layer technique (CELT) in an electrochemical system is presented. A <b>mould</b> <b>plate</b> of conductive material with a high-resolution line pattern (which can be prepared with the aid of e. g. electron beams) is used instead of the tip in scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). The etchant species is generated at the surface of the <b>mould</b> <b>plate</b> by electrochemical photochemical or photoelectrochemical methods, then diffuses away {{from the surface of the}} <b>mould</b> <b>plate.</b> The key feature of CELT is the design of a chemical reaction which rapidly destroys the etchant (e. g. within microseconds on average) following its generation. Therefore, the gradient of the concentration of etchant can be greatly enhanced and the thickness of the diffusion layer can be greatly decreased to several tens of nanometres. Thus, the etchant layer is confined and its outer boundary can essentially retain the fine structure of the pattern of the <b>mould</b> <b>plate.</b> Then the substrate to be corroded is adjusted by ECSTM to approach the <b>mould</b> <b>plate</b> within several tens of nanometres and the corroded pattern can retain the fine structure giving a resolution of several tens of nanometres...|$|R

Mould flow analysis software is used to perform the analysis of filling, wrap and best gate location. This will discuss the flow of molten plastic inside the injection mould. The analysis begins with the origin of the flow channels such as Barrel, nozzle, sprue, runners, and gates until the cavity is completely filled. In this analysis, plastic flow behavior is studied together with parameters settings in plastic injection mould, Based on the analysis improvement has been made to the part design and feed systems in the mould. This includes the location of the gate at the part design, size of sprue, runners and gates. From the analysis also, CAE helps to determine the part defects that might occurred during plastic injection molding process such as Short shot, unequal filling, over filling, welding lines and others.

40|$|The {{co-injection}} {{moulding process}} was studied. The experimental work from several tools, such a square plaque <b>plate</b> <b>moulding</b> {{has led to}} an understanding of the mechanism of dual injection mould filling. Emphasis has been focussed the relationships between the rheological property of the polymers and the relevant moulding parameters. The skin-core formations, which cot-relate to these relationships, were also studied. Many factors were introduced for understanding the effect on the skin-core adhesion where the two polymers are incompatible. In this case a compatibiliser was found to be one of the most important factors. In the presence of compatibiliser, the chemical reaction between active functional groups of skill and compatibiliser in the core occurred. Suitable conditions were necessary to produce good bonding between skin and core. The greater thickness of skin layer and greater. simultaneous injection times led to more probability for the skin and core active functional groups to react with each other before the skin became no-flow layer. Methods available to achieve these thicknesses and simultaneous injection times were possible by controlling the moulding parameters, such as melt temperature, tool temperature, injection speeds, and lengths of simultaneous phase-, these parameters could affect the skin-core thickness formations and their adhesion to different degrees...|$|R

40|$|Cooling channel {{design in}} the plastic {{injection}} moulding process {{is of paramount importance}} to the performance of the mould, influencing the quality of the parts being produced and productivity of the process. However, cooling channel design is usually limited to relatively simple configurations as well as conventional machining processes, such as straight-line drilling, and milling, etc. The cooling performance may not meet the expectations of the mould engineers. This paper proposes an alternative design method for a conformal cooling passageway with multi-connected porous characteristics based on the duality principle. The proposed method can provide a more uniform cooling performance between the <b>mould</b> <b>plate</b> and the conformal cooling passageway than the existing conformal cooling channel design. Injection mould defects like warpage or hot spots can be avoided. In this study, a 3 D <b>mould</b> <b>plate</b> model was offset negatively and the location of the proposed multi-connected porous cooling passageway was identified. The negatively offset model was decomposed into a finite number of cubical cells via the sub-boundary spatial enumerated cell decomposition. Then a duality relationship between the primal and the dual graphs was developed. This provided the preliminary layout of the multi-connected porous passageway for the coolant flow in multiple directions. The cooling channel axis design of the multi-connected porous passageway, illustrated by the skeleton from the dual graph, was created. Following a Boolean difference operation, the proposed multi-connected porous cooling passageway inside the <b>mould</b> <b>plate</b> was able to be generated and fabricated with the aid of rapid tooling technologies. A real-life case study for the design of a multi-connected porous cooling passageway was implemented and examined.

This work, study of its various mechanical properties like tensile strength, flexural strength and density. This work also includes erosion behaviors wrt. Varying Velocity and angle of impact of erodent. Comparison of properties of PEEK-GF and PEEK-GF REDMUD composites gives a detailed idea {{about the effect of}} REDMUD in PEEK-GF composites. For preparation of the composites clean glass <b>plates</b> were taken. <b>Mould</b> release sheets were placed on the <b>plates.</b> <b>Mould</b> release spray was applied on them. The catalyst and accelerator were added to the polyester in proportion 1. 5 % and 1 % respectively and are thoroughly mixed. For preparation of different composites i. e. is neat PEEK-GF composite, Red mud filling PEEKGF composite, this mixture was sprayed on the sheets to a thickness of about 2 mm followed by a piece of glass fiber mat(cut {{in the shape of a}} rectangle). Again another layer of resin was sprayed. Thus a single layer of composite is formed. Load was applied on all these preparations and these were left for 48 hours for adequate curing and solidification. Then the mould release sheets were removed and molded composites were taken out. It may be mentioned that in all these composites the fiber orientation was set at 90 0. The important factors influencing the erosion rate of materials are the impact velocity, impact angle of erodent particles, the size, shape and hardness of eroding particles. This has been reported by a number of researchers for a wide range of materials and erodent. Many Investigators have used angular silica sand, alumina, corundum particles or irregular silicon Carbide abrasives. In the present study dry silica sand is used as erodent. Hence it is difficult to compare present erosion data precisely with literature data. It can be concluded that reinforcement of glass fiber into the PEEK matrix improves the flexural strength quite significantly, thus making them potential materials for structural applications. Addition of Red Mud to glass fiber reinforced composites also enhances the flexural strength, flexural modulus and tensile strength of the material. PEEK with glass fiber reinforcement exhibits better resistance to solid particle erosion in comparison to the un-reinforced PEEK resin. The rate of wear of the composite material is also greatly influenced by operational variables like impact angle and the velocity of impact. Further, material variables like erodent and type of composite also affect the erosion rate. The neat PEEK and 20 % red mud filling of glass fiber reinforced PEEK composite exhibited maximum erosion rate at an impingement angle of 60 0 under the present experimental conditions studied...|$|R
