40|$|In its {{study of}} the {{disturbing}} proportions of pollution {{in the village and}} agriculture, ecology is confronted with visible difficulties. It has no predse and developed vocabulary, no precisely determined subject, no clear relations with the many sdentific disciplines it must integrate within it. The alarming state of environmental pollution has imposed a biotechnical concept and criterion of pollution. According to this criterion, pollution begins after the "permitted" treshold (amount) of soil, water and air pollution has been crossed. That <b>pollution</b> <b>criterion</b> is predse and very important, but it is one-sided and superficial because it considers that pollution is the result of an accident, i. e. of a mistake or uncontrolled activity. However, environmental pollution does not begin with an accident or crossing the "permitted" threshold of pollution. Pollution begins before that, and it is not caused by accident but by "cracks" in the industrial civilization and social relations based on that civilization. Thus it is not suffident for ecology to merely demand work and technological discipline. The village and agriculture are areas into which pollution was imported from the town. Therefore, the problem of rural pollution cannot be understood or solved within its own narrow framework, but only in the horizons of sodety as a whole. The interest in rural ecological problems is directed by the selfish interest of the town. Thus the historic antimony and rift between village and town appear in a new way in the plane of ecological problems: the town introduced pollution into the village and will work on its removal to the measure of its own interests...|$|E

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) constitutes the first and most crucial stage in this selection process, aiming to quantify the impacts according to the natural characteristics of the sites. A method is presented to facilitate the proper selection of a landfill site for municipal waste. The method follows specific principles, called "selection criteria", the aim of which are to compare the considered sites to a hypothetical "ideal one".

The interpretation of the resulting operators’ indexes values is such that areas with a higher index value are more vulnerable, as compared with those with a lower index. Deducing from the various operators’ indexes values, the degree of vulnerability per location in the area varies from one operator index algorithm to another (Table  6). This is because the users’ decision strategy characterizing the developed OWA-DRASTIC model allows diverse vulnerability assessment performance through flexibility using of varying numbers of <b>pollution</b> potential <b>criteria</b> input in the established vulnerability model (Eq.  2). The records in Table  6 were further processed in GIS environment to demarcate the continuous indexes values into class boundary ranges using the ad hoc classification technique of Rahmati et al.

These operators’ indexes classified ranges are interpretable for vulnerability assessment in the area. The attribute of these operators’ indexes strategies implication in vulnerability assessment varied as discussed in the literature (Gorsevski et al. 2012; Mogaji et al. 2014). The OWA-DRASTICAND index operator was chosen over other operators’ indexes for its reasons of risk aversion solution advantage (Bell et al. 2007).

The concept of external cost is used to establish the presumption that market forces will lead to excessive <b>pollution.</b> The performance <b>criterion,</b> that of Pareto efficiency, leading to this presumption is discussed. It is shown that for significant problems of pollution {{it is not possible to}} limit the role of the state to that of re-defining property rights. What is necessary is state intervention by way of the taxing, or regulation, of discharges into the environment: where external effects are undepletable, markets cannot meet the requirements of Pareto efficiency. Government intervention to meet such requirements requires that the government has information which is, in practice, either unavailable or very costly. Intervention towards more restricted goals is discussed. It is shown that arguments to the effect that the role of the state can be restricted to defining private property rights are based on assumptions which are irrelevant to significant problems. In particular, it is argued that a recent publication by the Institute of Economic Affairs does not, as claimed, show either that external costs do not exist, or that they exist but imply a minor role for the state in the protection of the natural environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{present study}} explores the amphipod assemblages of six marine caves on the Mediterranean coast of {{southern}} Spain. Replicate samples were taken {{both inside and}} outside each marine cave in order to characterize the amphipod fauna and the physicochemical properties of the sediment. As a result, 44 amphipods species were identified. The high number of species found in a relatively limited area highlighted the richness of the Alboran Sea fauna, which is mainly due to the mixture of species from different biogeographic areas. Harpinia genus was the dominant amphipod taxa inside marine caves and Perioculodes longimanus was also very abundant in the caverns. On the other hand, external communities were domi-nated by Siphonoecetes sabatieri, Metaphoxus fultoni and Photis longipes. There was a high degree of variability in both the internal and the external stations. Only the external station situated at low-medium depth showed a relatively homogeneous amphipod assemblage. The structure and behaviour of soft-bottom communities inside marine caves is difficult to predict because their environmental conditions depend on a particular combination of factors such as topography, depth and orienta-tion. Therefore, no constant patterns were observed for species richness, Shannon diversity and abundance of amphipods in marine caves in comparison with open habitats. According to canonical correspondence analysis, sediment granulometry, organic matter and nitrogen concentration were the parameters that best explained the distribution of amphipods. Species were also classified by their tolerance to environmental <b>pollution</b> according to <b>criteria</b> followed by the Azti Marine Biotic Index and the BENTIX index.

40|$|Faghri, ArdeshirThe Energy Policy Act of 1992 {{motivated}} transit {{agencies to}} utilize alternative-fuel transit buses {{in addition to}} their popular diesel buses. The Delaware Authority for Regional Transit (DART) has also planned to add a significant number of alternative-fuel buses to its current transit fleet. This study has been defined to assist the DART administration to make an optimal decision in this regard. The information used in this study was gathered from the latest scientific and practical reports published by Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP), National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It also combined with the knowledge that the author gained from two major recent conferences related to public transportation; 1) BusCon 2009 in Chicago, Illinois, and 2) APTA annual meeting 2009 in Orlando, FL. Among eight alternative-fuel buses introduced by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, this study recognized that only Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), biodiesel, and hybrid-diesel buses can be considered as the viable alternatives for the Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) transit buses. For each of these technologies Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and emissions are estimated and compared with the available information for the ULSD buses. The LCC consists of capital cost and operating cost. The capital cost includes initial purchasing cost and infrastructure cost which is separated in two subsections, refueling station and depot modification. The operating cost includes fuel cost, total maintenance cost, facility (refueling station and depot) maintenance cost, compression electricity cost (applicable to CNG buses only), and battery replacement cost (applicable to hybrid diesel-electric buses only). The results show that buses propelled by hybrid-diesel engine have the least LCC ($/mile). Alternatives were ranked with respect to their capital cost as follows: 1) ULSD, 2) Biodiesel, 3) Hybrid diesel-electric, and 4) CNG. The ranks of alternatives changed with respect to their operating cost and it was as follows: 1) CNG, 2) Hybrid diesel-electric, 3) ULSD, and 4) Biodiesel. Although all the alternative-fuel buses meet the latest EPA emissions standard, the recent scientific reports prove that hybrid diesel-electric buses emit fewer air pollutants than their counterparts. This characteristic also gives hybrid buses an edge to consider as the most suitable alternative-fuel buses for DART. This study found that CNG buses are the strongest competitor for the hybrid diesel-electric buses. The major problem with CNG buses for being utilized by DART is their cost of implementation. The infrastructure (refueling stations and depot modification) cost of CNG buses is very high. This issue gets worse because DART demands more than one infrastructure to be able to operate CNG buses throughout the state of Delaware. Also, DART needs to wait until the required infrastructures have been built meaning that the readiness index of CNG technology for DART is very low. This study also conducted an expert survey {{in order to determine the}} relative importance of other criteria on the transit fleet expansion plan. Four major goals and twelve criteria were defined. A questionnaire was designed and distributed among the relevant decision-making experts from governmental agencies, bus manufactures, academic organizations, energy suppliers, and research institutes. They assessed the relative importance (subjectively) for each of the criteria. The collected data shows that energy independence criterion is the most important factor in evaluating the alternative-fuel buses; second in importance are energy availability and safety; third is energy efficiency, indicating the need for new alternative-fuel buses. The survey also asked the respondents to rank the alternatives regarding each criterion. Based on the results, hybrid diesel-buses were ranked first in six criteria including energy availability, safety, energy efficiency, air pollution, noise pollution, and sense of comfort. Hybrid diesel-electric buses also were ranked second in two criteria including energy independence and cost of implementation. These buses were only ranked lowest with respect to the cost of maintenance criterion. However, this observation is not supported by our estimation and comparative analysis reports published by other organizations. The expert survey results clearly show that ULSD buses are the most reliable and capable alternative among other technologies. These buses were also ranked first with respect to the cost of implementation and cost of maintenance criteria. However, ULSD buses were ranked third and fourth (lowest) with respect to the most important criteria including energy independence, and energy efficiency. These buses were also assumed to perform poorly with respect to noise pollution, sense of comfort, and air <b>pollution</b> <b>criteria.</b> This study concludes that hybrid diesel-electric buses rate well according to the criteria of energy, environmental impact, industrial relationship, and implementation cost for DART. The results of this study also confirm that each transit agency needs to consider its unique characteristics and facilities before deciding what alternative-fuel bus to invest in. Two major reasons that support this conclusion are 1) Capital cost varies based upon facilities that transit agencies already have in place, and 2) Even for one transit agency, the best option may change based upon the number of buses that will be acquired. Life-cycle cost is sensitive to the number of buses that will be purchased. However, transit agencies can use other transit agencies experience or studies such as this thesis to perform their own study.

Furthermore, the protection of Safety and Health of workers requires the definition of exposure models based on the quantification of Hazard Factors. The workers' exposure models in particular should be based on: 1. {{the identification of the}} exposed workers (only apparently an easy task in the modern industrial and construction scenarios); 2. the analysis of the exposure way, frequency and duration; 3. measuring processes aimed to effectively characterize, with the necessary detail, the Hazard Factors (physical, chemical, biological) which can compromise the workers Safety and Health; 4. statistical criteria suitable to ensure the representativeness of the achieved measurement results, essential to make comparisons with the limit values suggested by Safety regulations, standards and good practices.

Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean, the total area of the island is 25, 711 km 2, with more than 5 million inhabitants. The terrain of inland Sicily is mostly hilly and intensively cultivated wherever it was possible, nitrate vulnerable zone about 40 % of flat areas and 5. 37 % of total. The test site is located in Canicattì (central Sicily); the current land use (grape, olive and almond cultivation) constitutes the main source of groundwater pollution. In order to investigate the effect of over-farming on groundwater quality and to indentify an appropriate methodology for pollution risk management, we have carried out a comparative study on the potential risk of contamination from nitrate of agricultural origin, according to the conventional parametrical methods used in Europe; the IPNOA parametric model (agricultural nitrates hazard index) method combined with the SINTACS and DRASTIC intrinsic aquifer vulnerabilitymethods. All parameters used in this risk assessment were prepared, classified, weighed, and integrated in a GIS environment. For calibrating the models and optimizing and/or weighing the examined factors, the modeling results were validated by comparing them with groundwater quality data, in particular nitrate content, and with census data fromthe potential <b>pollution</b> sources. The <b>criterion</b> for checking this method was the correlation coefficient of each model with the nitrate concentration in the groundwater. A relative coincidence of a high nitrate concentration and risk mapping was observed, but this correlation was only significant using the SINTACS method. In fact, the final risk maps show significant differences in risk quality assessment; the DRASTIC model values show an over-evaluation of the real contest. In conclusion, the SINTACS parametric method appears to be the most suitable for constructing a relevant risk map of the contamination of these aquifers, which are considered to be typical of the Mediterranean region for their hydrogeological and hydrochemical feature...|$|R
