25|$|Prevention of HPV+OPC {{involves}} avoiding or reducing {{exposure to}} risk factors where possible. About 90% of HPV+OPC carry HPV 16, and another 5% type 18. These two types are both targets of available vaccines. HPV vaccines given <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> can prevent persistent genital infection {{and the consequent}} precancerous state. Therefore, they have a theoretical potential to prevent oral HPV infection. A 2010 review study has found that HPV16 oral infection was rare (1.3%) among the 3,977 healthy subjects analyzed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} {{that the existence of}} God can be known to all, even <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure</b> to any divine revelation, predates Christianity. St. Paul made this argument when he said that pagans were without excuse because [...] "since the creation of the world [...] invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made". In this Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by St. Thomas and others, but that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} {{potassium iodide}} to protect thyroid glands from radioactive iodine involving accidents or fission emergencies. In an accidental event or {{attack on a}} nuclear power plant, or in nuclear bomb fallout, volatile fission product radionuclides may be released. Of these products, [...] {{is one of the}} most common and is particularly dangerous to the thyroid gland because it may lead to thyroid cancer. By saturating the body with a source of stable iodide <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>exposure,</b> inhaled or ingested [...] tends to be excreted, which prevents radioiodine uptake by the thyroid. According to one 2000 study [...] "KI administered up to 48 h before [...] exposure can almost completely block thyroid uptake and therefore greatly reduce the thyroid absorbed dose. However, KI administration 96 h or more before [...] exposure has no significant protective effect. In contrast, KI administration after exposure to radioiodine induces a smaller and rapidly decreasing blockade effect." [...] For optimal prevention, KI must be dosed daily until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodine by either inhalation or ingestion no longer exists.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between energy reserves of the penaeid shrimp Penaeus vannamei and Baculovirus penaei, or BP, were investigated {{in a series}} of experiments using mysis stage or early postlarval shrimp. Pre-exposure and post-exposure levels of protein and triacylgycerol (TAG) were determined. The effect of pre-exposure protein and TAG levels on susceptibility to BP infections was also investigated by starving a group of shrimp immediately <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> BP <b>exposure.</b> There was no consistent {{relationship between}} either pre-exposure or post-exposure protein levels and the percent of shrimp developing patent BP infections. There was, however, a significant positive correlation between TAG levels immediately <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> viral <b>exposure</b> and prevalence of infection 72 h later. Experimental reduction of TAG reserves <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> BP <b>exposure</b> delayed the development of a patent infection. In some, but not all, experiments there was a significant reduction in TAG levels of infected compared with uninfected shrimp 72 h post-exposure. The effect of patent BP infections on host TAG levels was subordinate to fluctuations in TAG content associated with the ontogeny of the hepatopancreas. Results of this study support histological observations that shrimp lipid levels can be altered by baculovirus infections. Furthermore, high levels of energy reserves in the form of TAG are associated with increased susceptibility to BP infection in larval and postlarval shrimp...|$|R

Prior research has not been consistent in it treatment of providing system training and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> participants. The potential impact of these differences in methodology on key measures of response and outcome is unknown. Ninety-six participants completed this study that crossed system training with <b>prior</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> the warning to systematically evaluate these effects for both forward crash warning (FCW) and lane departure warning (LDW) systems evaluations. <b>Prior</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> the alerts led to changes in engagement with the distraction task for both FCW and LDW events. Training on the system influenced outcomes of the FCW events with less severe outcomes for participants who were aware they had the system. There is also evidence that driver who {{were aware of the}} system’s presence but did not have <b>prior</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> it were less likely to complete the experiment successfully.
