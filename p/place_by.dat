5|$|The {{first section}} of roadway to receive the M-109 {{designation}} was in place and signed on maps by May 1, 1929.

The highway was extended east along an existing road between Glen Haven and Glen Arbor. This extension was in <b>place</b> <b>by</b> May 1, 1933, completing the modern routing of M-109.

40|$|Pour size {{as one of}} {{the site}} factors {{affecting}} concreting was examined to determine its effects on concreting productivity. A total of 167 separate concrete pours were observed on 25 building construction sites in Lagos, Nigeria,comprising 35 pours <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> crane and skip; 26 pours <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> dumper; 58 pours <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> wheelbarrow; 37 pours <b>placed</b> <b>by</b> head pan; and 11 pours <b>placed</b> jointly <b>by</b> pump, wheelbarrow and head pan. Data collected from the daily concrete pours were analyzed to determine operational productivity rates. The relationship between concreting productivity and pour size was examined using regression analyses to develop a model relating productivity to pour size. The results showed that irrespective of placing method, productivity generally increased by 1. 1 m 3 /h for every 10 m 3 increase in pour size. It was recommended that the obtained index of productivity increase per pour size be standardised for use in improving on-site productivity in the Nigerian construction industry...|$|R
