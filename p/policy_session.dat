50|$|Dufferin Roblin, the 50-year-old PC Premier of Manitoba, {{was another}} late entrant to the campaign. He was the {{youngest}} serious contender, and {{was reported to have}} the behind-the-scenes support of the conservative Union Nationale party in Quebec. He portrayed himself as having been outside of the fighting over Diefenbaker's leadership, and independent of the Diefenbaker and Camp bloc. He would therefore be able to bring the party together. Roblin was seen to be on the left of the party, i.e., supported by Red Tories. He delivered an emotional appeal at the <b>policy</b> <b>session</b> for harmony between English-speaking Canadians and French-speaking Canadians. His call for party unity struck a chord with delegates, and it appeared as though he might lead on the first ballot. His Quebec delegates, however, were very critical of Diefenbaker at the convention, and undermined Roblin's image as a compromise candidate.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Stanfield, the 53-year-old PC Premier of Nova Scotia, was a late entrant to the campaign, {{and was the}} {{eventual}} victor. He had disclaimed any interest in running for the federal leadership having won a healthy mandate in the spring 1967 Nova Scotia election. He finally bowed to pressure from Dalton Camp and other Ontario opponents of Diefenbaker, and joined the race. According to reportage in the Toronto Star, it was his [...] "honesty, forthrightness, and quiet demeanour" [...] that set him apart from other candidates. Stanfield was supported by many party members from the Maritime provinces, but had little support from Quebec or the Western provinces. Running as a [...] "right-of-centre" [...] candidate, his successful convention presence, and especially his very well received speech at the Tuesday night <b>policy</b> <b>session,</b> attracted many of the anti-Diefenbaker delegates, and made him [...] "the man to beat".|$|E
5000|$|George Hees, the 57-year-old former Minister of Transport {{and then}} Minister of International Trade and Commerce in the Diefenbaker government, was {{described}} as a [...] "millionaire bon vivant". Hees had been successful as trade minister, aggressively promoting Canadian trade in other countries, but left politics before the 1963 election. As head of the Montreal Stock Exchange, however, he had done nothing innovative, and returned to politics in the 1965 election. Hees did not come across as an intellectual, but injected glamour into the campaign, spending the most of any of the candidates, an estimated $200,000. The Globe and Mail newspaper noted that, surrounded by chanting young supporters, the [...] "arrival of Hees was like something from Hollywood". Hees descended from one of two red London double-decker buses that he had hired to transport his campaign workers between his headquarters at the Royal York Hotel and the convention centre at Maple Leaf Gardens. Hees's speech, delivered in carnival-barker style, at the Tuesday night <b>policy</b> <b>session,</b> however, was not well received by delegates, and his support began to drift off to other candidates.|$|E

This {{research}} investigates intuitive models for cross pollinating fine art practice into local production centres so as to encourage more sustainable models of business activity. A key element is to examine methodologies for mapping the cultural value of artistic activities to support the research approach and its proposed outcomes. For my presentation, I will be using findings from the Sound Proof (SP) seri es of exhibitions that I curated in the period 2008 2012 to test various methodologies for mapping cultural value. The aim {{is to make the}} case for cultural heritage activities that support a stronger sense of place in the community. SP was a series of annu al exhibitions tracking the development of the Stratford site of London 2012 over a five year period through artistic commissions with a focus on sound. During this key timeframe, SP was the only independent initiative of its kind to respond to the same so urce material as the Cultural Olympiad. The research examined how organically evolving cultural activity can contribute to notions of legacy and how it can highlight cultural memories overlooked by official channels. SP provided a forum for independent res ponses alongside the official Cultural Olympiad and championed the notion of heritage as a shared public resource. The key dimension I would like to explore in my presentation is how to map the intangible cultural value of SP the intricate links and coinfluences achieved through the activities of SP's artists, curators, partners, funders, and public disseminators. This more holistic approach is based on networks of interdependent participants, and quantification of its effectiveness will require a more complex means to measure its success. This can be achieved through a rigorous cultural mapping methodology that can reliably express the value of intangible cultural elements...|$|E

40|$|The GSM {{technologies}} plays {{vital role}} in pervasive computing environments. The open and dynamic nature of the pervasive computing environment allows entities to join and leave frequently. This causes {{a large number of}} autonomous entities to interact in an ad-hoc manner, raising concerns as to the trustworthiness of the service providers. Thus service providers are not willing to share their resources to the anonymous users for fear of a potential security violation. To handle the issue of anonymous resource access, a policy based trust management system must grant user access of resources and information based on trustworthiness rather than the conventional technique map access rights authorization. In this paper, we have developed a new model of GSM-SMS based user authentication and policy based resource access, which will guarantee that service providers can securely share an unlimited number of resources to remote access. This framework provides mechanism to administrator to create <b>policy</b> and grant <b>session</b> based access permission to trusted users. The users can access information and resources based on the access <b>policies</b> and <b>session</b> <b>policies</b> through their mobile phone by sending SMS. This is a low cost and high performance model for preserving access control and resource access in pervasive computing environment...|$|R
