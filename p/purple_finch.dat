40|$|This {{winter in}} Nebraska was much colder on average than the few {{previous}} winters, {{not so much}} because of low temperatures, but a lack of warmer days. This kept water bodies frozen most of the winter, with far fewer than usual midwinter water-bird records. Surprisingly, though, passerines, including some surprises, were able to brave the coolness. Notable were three species of wood-warblers; although Yellow-rumped Warblers winter to some extent in the southeast, 9 of the 21 total February records for the species have come in the last two winters. The others were not unprecedented for Nebraska, and are known to be somewhat cold-tolerant: Yellow-throated and Pine Warblers. Sparrows were also in evidence, with Fox Sparrow an occasional winterer, but Chipping and Field Sparrows, especially the latter, are rare in midwinter. Another group usually absent in midwinter involved two icterids, Great-tailed Grackle and Brown-headed Cowbird. <b>Purple</b> <b>Finches</b> were reported statewide in good numbers, a definite incursion or even invasion by this species.

40|$|Houses Finches {{became a}} {{breeding}} species in Indiana in 1981 and subsequently {{went through a}} rapid population increase. This study was {{an investigation of the}} growth of the House Finch population and its impact on House Sparrows, American Goldfinches and <b>Purple</b> <b>Finches</b> in Indiana. Data from the Annual Christmas Bird Counts of the National Audubon Society (CBC) were used to construct five winter range maps to show the expansion of the House Finch population since 1940. A population density map based on the CBCs of 1988 and 1989 was constructed using birds counted per party hour. CBC data collected during 1965 to 1989 at twelve locations in Indiana were used to track long-term changes in the populations of House Finches, House Sparrows, American Goldfinches and <b>Purple</b> <b>Finches.</b> The number of House Finches counted in Indiana since 1981 increased dramatically. The size of the House Sparrow population appears to have been in a long-term decline for the last 25 years. However, American Goldfinches have, in general, increased in abundance since 1979. The abundance of <b>Purple</b> <b>Finches</b> in Indiana in the winter varies erratically. Observations at backyard feeding stations frequented by House Finches and House Sparrows show that House Finches tend to displace other House Finches more often than would be expected if the displacements occurred in proportion to the frequency at which the birds appear in the population. House Sparrows were found to displace other House Sparrows at a rate which greatly exceeded the expected frequency based on their proportion of the population. Both species tend to avoid interspecific interactions. Field studies in Muncie, Indiana show that House Finches commonly nest in shrubbery and building decorations while House Sparrows often nest in crevices in old buildings and bird houses. No direct competition for nesting sites was observed. Banding studies indicate that during the fall and winter there is a constant turnover of House Finches in Muncie. Using banding data from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service it was found that House Finches in the Midwest tend to travel in a southern direction as the season changes from summer to winter and in a northern direction as the season changes from winter to summer. The study shows that House Finches have a strong propensity to return to the same general area each summer. Department of BiologyThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

40|$|Advisor: Muir EatonElaborate and/or {{colorful}} bird plumages {{have often}} been hypothesized to evolve via sexual selection for increased ornamentation. Differences in coloration among individuals can be influenced {{by a number of}} variables, including diet, hormones, and disease resistance. Specifically, Hamilton and Zuk 22 (1892) hypothesized a link between an individual’s parasite resistance and more colorful plumage signals, as a mechanism for individuals to advertise their ‘quality’. While much data has accumulated documenting the nutritional and hormonal regulation of various types of plumage coloration, relatively little data exists reporting the effects of parasite load on individual plumage colors (i. e. melanin and carotenoid pigmented feathers). We collected ectoparasites and plumage color data from 24 <b>purple</b> <b>finches</b> (Carpodacus purpureus), 11 pine siskins (Carduelis pinus), and 21 American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis).

This article describes {{the details of this}} epizootic in the Canadian Atlantic provinces, based on laboratory examination of dead affected birds and on suspected but unconfirmed cases of salmonellosis reported by members of the public. The common redpoll (Carduelis flammea) was the species most often affected, followed by pine siskins (C. pinus), <b>purple</b> <b>finches</b> (Carpodacus purpureus), evening grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus), and American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis).

The large incursion of <b>Purple</b> <b>Finches</b> and the smaller one of Mountain Chickadees continued into the spring period, with impressive totals. Identification of Catharus thrushes is more difficult in the field than field guides might indicate because of the tendency of birds to stay in areas where lighting is inconsistent and often subpar for viewing. Thus reports without details earlier than late April are difficult to evaluate; also adding to the problems this spring was a higher than usual number of Hermit Thrushes. Some exciting rarities were reported; most exciting was Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s first Grace 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, a bird well-documented with photos. Others were two Black-throated Gray Warblers, a Golden-crowned Sparrow, and several other species considered casual in occurrence.

I will not routinely list early and late dates and peak counts for each species unless they are significant; readers should refer to past issues of NBR for guidelines as to what are early or late dates and high counts. Observers are, however, urged to report early and late dates and high counts of all migrant species; {{it is difficult to know}} if a sighting is significant until all the reports are pooled in my computer. In general, most observers thought this a fairly routine fall, although the Panhandle continued to be a source of significant new information, thanks to consistent coverage by Steven Dinsmore. Similar coverage of the Rainwater Basin by Joel Jorgensen also has enhanced our knowledge considerably. Every report is valuable: very few of the large list of observers fail to have at least one of their sightings included in the report. There were no new species added to the state list this fall, but this year was amazing in that respect, with 7 new species (some awaiting approval by the Records Committee) bringing the total state list to a very respectable 441 species. Rarest this fall was the pair of Black-bellied Whistling-Ducks in the Rainwater Basin, a second documented state record. Also very rare were a 7 th state record White-winged Dove and 8 th state record Lesser Goldfinch. Other interesting finds included a Brant of the western race, 3 Pomarine Jaegers, the first documented central Nebraska Blue-headed Vireo, a Mountain Chickadee, a Varied Thrush, another report of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, the first Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole for fall east of the Panhandle, and a White-winged Crossbill.

A similar category of events, but perhaps better labeled 2 ̆ 2 quirky, 2 ̆ 2 were some strange bobwhite items from the Panhandle, the occurrence of Eurasian Collared-Doves in 74 counties so far, the possibility that the Curve-billed Thrasher at the Frimann Ranch in Sioux County was able to sneak its genes into the Brown Thrasher pool, a Blue Grosbeak carrying a minnow, and an Orange Bishop (a bird, not a Dutch prelate) in Kearney. Among significant early or late dates of occurrence were record late Caspian Terns, Panhandle Gray Catbird, and Bobolink (although the Boblink was unsubstantiated), second-latest Forster 2 ̆ 7 s Tern and Western Kingbird, and record early Northern (Red-Shafted) Flickers eastward.
