5000|$|BLT2 {{receptor}} {{protein and}} mRNA {{was found to}} be markedly elevated in human advanced pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias in their primary pancreas sites as well as in lymph node metastasis sites; mRNA for BLT1 was also elevated in these tissues but to a ~5-fold greater extent.

The stable over expression of BLT2 in AsPC-1, Colo357, and Panc-1 human <b>pancreas</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines increased these cells' in vitro growth rates; specific BLT2 agonists also stimulated Colo367 and Panc-1 cell growth.

30|$|In summary, antigen-specific {{molecular}} imaging has {{the potential}} to provide a more accurate assessment of the tumor burden for pancreatic cancer patients. CEA is strongly expressed in the majority of <b>pancreas</b> <b>cancers</b> and thus is a potential target for antibody-based molecular imaging and therapy. Using the novel mutated anti-CEA scFv-Fc (H 310 A) antibody fragment with a reduced serum half-life, we demonstrated in vivo antigen-specific molecular imaging. Furthermore, we define the microscopic pattern of tumor targeting which may have implications regarding radioimmunotherapy. The versatility of this antibody construct, based on {{the presence or absence of}} an Fc domain mutation, provides for improved pharmacokinetics in both imaging and therapy making it a very attractive fragment for continued study and development.|$|R

30|$|In general (see [15]) T 2 D {{presents}} two features {{associated with}} cancer: insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. As the association occurs independently on a {{variable such as}} BMI, {{the implication is that}} T 2 D might be an independent risk factor for cancer. In particular, breast, colon and <b>pancreas</b> <b>cancers</b> showed positive associations, contrary to prostate cancer. Finally, anti-diabetes drugs can affect cancer cells, and in some cases represent a target for cancer therapies too. As two of the main promoters of cancer in T 2 D patients are chronic hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, difficulties emerge in some cases. Even if a role is played in the above listed cancers, it is particularly complex the consideration of directionality of association for pancreatic cancer in which diabetes may induce through hyperinsulinemia via enhanced proliferation of islet cells, but also destruction of islet cells and insulin resistance due to cancer may reverse the directionality.|$|R

40|$|Combinatorial {{inhibition}} of effector and feedback pathways is a promising treatment strategy for KRAS mutant cancers.

By performing 70 screens in models of KRAS mutant colorectal, lung, ovarian, and <b>pancreas</b> <b>cancers,</b> we uncovered universal and tissue-specific sensitizing combinations involving inhibitors of cell cycle, metabolism, growth signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcription. Furthermore, these screens revealed secondary genetic modifiers of sensitivity, yielding a SRC inhibitor-based combination therapy for KRAS/PIK 3 CA double-mutant colorectal cancers (CRCs) with clinical potential.

METHODOLOGY: 33 patients were affected by pancreas, 22 by stomach, 16 by extrahepatic biliary tract and 18 by liver cancers; every patient was considered worthy of radical or palliative surgery according to preoperative staging (thorax-abdominal CT and percutaneous ultrasonography). Paired sample t-tests were {{used to analyze the}} results of each methodical and probability values of less than 0. 05 were considered significant.
