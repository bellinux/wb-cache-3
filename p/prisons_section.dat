40|$|This paper, {{the fifth}} in the Social Indicators series {{published}} by the NSW Parliamentary Library, provides a snapshot of public administration and politics in NSW. While {{the focus is on}} NSW, relevant information is provided on the other States and Territories to assist in providing appropriate context and perspective for the NSW data. Section one examines the public sector at a Local, State/Territory and Federal level. There are 1. 9 million public sector employees throughout Australia, of whom 563, 400 are in NSW. The NSW public sector employs 444, 700 people, more than one in ten of all employed person in NSW. The Health and Education sectors account for 60 % of employment. The NSW public sector is more feminised than NSW employment as whole, with the majority of its employees being women. Its workforce is also older, with {{more than half of all}} employees aged 45 years or over. Section one also briefly considers the issues of how to define the public sector and whether public sector workers are overpaid. Whilst attitudes towards the public sector and its efficiency vary, much community support exists for the government provision of numerous services including: electricity, universities, transport, water, motorways, community services and <b>prisons.</b> <b>Section</b> two of the paper is concerned with the parliaments and governments throughout Australia, with a focus on NSW. It compares the composition of Australian parliaments, by party, House and gender. The number of sitting days and passage of Acts throughout the year are noted. For each jurisdiction, information is also provided on the composition of Government Ministries. Australian citizens may be called to serve on juries, they must vote in Australian elections, they have the right to stand for election to Parliament, and they may apply for an Australian passport which enables them to leave and re-enter Australia. Section three considers the notion of citizenship and provides a summary of the number and distribution of citizens within Australia. It also refers to the number of new citizens and where they are from. It notes the number of voters on the electoral roll, voter turnout in recent elections and the level of informal voting. It also highlights some of the ways Australians participate in the wider community, with almost 19 % of people actively participating in civic and political groups in the previous year. The changing nature of political party and trade union membership is also discussed. Sources are identified throughout the paper. However, much of the data on the NSW public sector has been sourced from the NSW Department of Premier and Cabinet’s ‘Public Sector Workforce Snapshot Tables’ which are available from [URL]...|$|E

Missouri ranks eighth in the nation in terms of {{imprisonment}} and has experienced substantial growth in incarceration over the past two decades. The reality of mass incarceration and the accruing cost of corrections have led many states to consider implementing alternatives to traditional incarceration and parole.

50|$|The {{correction}} and detention {{facilities in}} Turkey are officially categorized in three security level groups as closed (kapalı), semi-open (yarı açık) and open (açık) prisons. Closed prisons are maximum security penitentiaries with {{external and internal}} control that hold violent prisoners and those judged most likely to escape. Semi-open prisons are medium security correctional institutions without external control but with only internal physical barriers that house prisoners bearing a moderate escape risk who also have a job. Open prisons are low security, work-oriented prison camps with no external control and internal physical barriers that hold inmates who are allowed to have limited interaction with the public. As of September 1999, the mixed-sex prison hosted 776 detainees and prisoners held in nineteen wards in the close and semi-open <b>prison</b> <b>sections.</b> The prison's healthcare facility had a capacity of forty beds.|$|R

5000|$|The second witness was Knut Bjarkeid, Chief Warden at Ila Prison.

He read: [...] "There are obvious limits to {{how long he}} can be in Section G"; the document was written by Bjarkeid. Storrvik said that [...] "The words are here, obviously {{there are limits to}} how long he shall be isolated. This was in 2012. He is still in total isolation". After Bjarkeid left the witness stand, Emberland read out loud from a letter that Breivik had written, dated 29 September 2013; in the letter Breivik reported several persons to the police; the Asker and Bærum Police District investigated and later dropped the investigation; Breivik's letter detailed the number of strip searches, [...] "grip manoeuvres", and handcuffings he had undergone.|$|R

[...] To ensure appropriateness of this scene, Kukunoor used shades of grey and blue deliberately.|$|R
50|$|The Pitești {{detention}} {{regime was}} optimal {{for such an}} initiative. In {{the second part of}} 1949, the conditions worsened considerably: the <b>prison</b> <b>sections</b> were isolated and the communication channels between the inmates cut off. The cells were over-crowded and the food had a low caloric content. (maximum 1000 calories per day). There was little to none medical assistance, the sanitary program was done on a group basis, many did not get to the toilet in the allocated time and had to do it in their own food tins, which had to be later washed. Beatings from the guardians were common and the most severe penalties included the solitary ("casimca"), a small isolation cell, without light of ventilation, extremely cold in winter, while the floor was flooded with water and urine. As the program progressed, exterior walls were built around the prison, and within the penitenciary perimeter, the inside and outside yards, so far separated by barbed wire fences, were now completely isolated by concrete walls.|$|R
50|$|When {{prisoners are}} seriously ill and thus cannot be treated {{at the prison}} clinic, they are {{transferred}} to Fuxing (复兴, Revival) Hospital on the Fuxingmen Outer Street. Fuxing Hospital {{is one of the}} hospitals for Ministry of Public Security employees and their relatives. All Ministry of Public Security hospitals shoulder the additional responsibility of treating prisoners, but Fuxing Hospital is specially designated to treat prisoners from Qincheng <b>Prison.</b> The <b>prison</b> <b>section</b> is located on the 2nd Floor of one of the hospital buildings and it is completely segregated {{from the rest of the}} facility. Every room is about 10 square meters, with one or two hospital beds, a wash sink, and a toilet. The window is equipped with sanded glass so that nothing outside can be seen and there is another layer of iron fence outside the window glass. Guards watch the prisoners behind the door that is locked from outside. Prisoners treated at the hospital exercise by walking on the roof of the building.|$|R

When he woke up, he was greeted by a translator. Later that day he was flown to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, where he stayed in the <b>prison</b> <b>section</b> of a hospital. Because no one in the hospital spoke Russian, he communicated in German. [...] "I was kept there for several days and given the very best: wonderful food, rest, and the finest of medical care.

5000|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the Act only provides for enforced treatment of mental disorder in a hospital. As a prison is not defined as a [...] "hospital" [...] by the Act, no prisoner can be treated against his or her wishes under the Act in prison, even in a prison healthcare wing. Instead, Sections 47 and 48 provide for prisoners {{to be transferred to}} a hospital for treatment of a mental disorder. Section 47 applies to sentenced prisoners, whilst Section 48 applies to those on remand and those convicted but awaiting sentence; it provides for temporary treatment out of <b>prison.</b> <b>Section</b> 48 can be used only for prisoners in need of urgent treatment for mental illness or severe mental impairment, whilst Section 47 can be used to treat any category of mental disorder. The Home Office is required to approve applications for these sections and decides what level of security in hospital is necessary for a particular prisoner.|$|R
5000|$|The third witness was Bjørn Draugedalen, {{a general}} {{practitioner}} working one day per week at Skien Prison. His first consultation with Breivik {{was held in}} a recreation room in avdeling for særlig høy sikkerhet, a high-security unit. Draugedalen shook hands with Breivik, with five prison officers present; all the later consultations (until the trial) were held with a glass wall separating them. Storrvik asked [...] "This change, when another prisoner arrived started {{to live in the}} same <b>prison</b> <b>section,</b> which resulted in Breivik's movement being restricted—did you consider to go up there to view living conditions or how things were"?; Draugedalen answered [...] "We have to deal with changes done by the Corrections Services". The judge interjected, and she said that the Correction Services likely would listen to health care workers; Draugedalen replied that [...] "We did not see any extra value then, regarding visiting him in the prison section". At 12:36 Draugedalen said that he has not been notified that Breivik has discontinued his college/university studies.|$|R
