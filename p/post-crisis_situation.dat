Investments in current assets of the businesses are a hedging instrument against individual risk sensitivity that is higher in crisis affected times. The paper aim is to compare real economy data with FLIEM predictions. The FLIEM model expected that inventories to total assets indicator should be treated as forecasting indicator about future risk sensitivity of the entities. It could be also suitable as forewarning impulse of future standing of whole food processing part of economy...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{arrangements}} that have been used in the present crisis and their relative success and to look to the <b>post‐crisis</b> <b>situation.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines and explains the crisis and the roles of deposit insurance and government guarantees. It deals with coverage, funding, institutional structure, speed of payout, incentives, accountability and, in particular, considers how such systems should function in a world of cross‐border institutions. Findings – The paper suggests how such principles and standards should be set either through International Association of Deposit Insurers or some more efficient means to complement an international approach to financial stability being addressed by the Basel institutions. Originality/value – There is no widely accepted standard over what the reformed financial system safety net should look like with respect to the protection of deposits and the wider guaranteeing of creditors and other stakeholders. This paper, therefore, makes an attempt to fill that gap. ...|$|E
40|$|Monetary policy {{approaches}} at the ZLB {{to solve}} <b>post-crisis</b> <b>situation</b> and their effectiveness Magdalena Hummelová May 10, 2016 Abstract This thesis describes monetary policy tools implemented by central banks whose main monetary policy rates {{at some point}} after 2008 global economic crisis hit the zero lower bound. Central banks considered {{in this study are}} the Fed, the ECB, the SNB and the CNB. A smaller ef- fectiveness analysis of the macroeconomic effects using a simple vector autoregressive (VAR) model is provided as well. The model is inspired by similar study of Gambacorta et al. (2012). With the use of monthly data over the sample period, the VAR tries to quantify the impact an increase in a central bank's balance sheet has on the main economic indicators- real output, consumer prices and implied volatility indices in the financial markets. Some of the results are comparable to those of the reference study mentioned above. This applies to the output results in a sense that the balance sheet shock has a slightly significant temporary effect on it. On the contrary, responses of the implied volatility indices and prices are less significant (or insignificant) and not at all comparable with the reference study. With some exceptions, there are no major discrepancies between individual country results in spite of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{disaster}} and conflict response communities, concern about lack of effectiveness of outside responses {{has led to}} a debate about the role of local people in developing the capacity to prepare for a crisis and to respond after calamity has struck. Pelling (2007) points out the potential for participatory disaster risk assessment to build local capacity and for generating knowledge that, along with more expert-driven data collection, is used to identify and reduce the risk of disaster. Similarly, Weinstein and Tidball (2007) and Tidball et al. (2008) present an alternative model for post-crisis intervention based on local assets, including ongoing attempts of communities to manage their natural resources. For example, these authors suggest that civic ecology (CE) practices, including community forestry, watershed enhancement, community agriculture and gardening, and other participatory environmental restoration initiatives that emerge from the actions of local residents (Tidball and Krasny 2007), should be examined and perhaps leveraged by outsiders for their ability to mitigate <b>post-crisis</b> <b>situations.</b> The question is, how might CE relate to citizen science in applications post-disaster or conflict?|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of <b>post-crisis</b> {{transition}} <b>situations</b> (natural or man-made disasters, mainly conflicts), rather than merely coordinating ‘relief’ and ‘development’, the recovery approach currently being developed by the United Nations aims to integrate these two dimensions as well as, {{in the case of}} conflicts, peacebuilding and peacekeeping activities.

40|$|As {{sustainable}} employment {{is one of}} the best routes out of poverty, assistance in designing and implementing strategies and programmes for job creation can contribute to the objective of poverty alleviation in situations of low income and high unemployment and underemployment. The challenge of poverty reduction is made tougher by crises of some form or the other (e. g., those resulting from economic turmoil, armed conflicts or natural calamities) which tend to aggravate the poverty situation. Special attention, therefore, needs to be devoted to countries emerging from crises of various types. The Recovery and Reconstruction Department (EMP/RECON) of the International Labour Office has the dual function of (i) responding to the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs in various <b>post-crisis</b> <b>situations,</b> and (ii) contributing to an employment-focussed development agenda by providing direct assistance in the creation of poverty-reducing jobs. The first function is undertaken through the InFocus Programme on Crisis Response and Reconstruction which assists in formulating and implementing employment-focussed reconstruction programmes. The second function is undertaken by the Employment Intensive Investment Branch of the Department which demonstrates how employment-intensive investment in infrastructure can contribute to the objective of job creatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the sustainability of}} the unprecedentedly high aggregate GDP growth witnessed in India from 2003 - 04 till the eruption of the global crisis. It argues that the post-liberalization highly non-inclusive and corporate-sector led growth trajectory in India suffers from a fundamental contradiction which renders it inherently unstable. This contradiction is between increasing dependence of growth on investment demand {{and the absence of}} a commensurate expansion of either output or employment in organized manufacturing, the main sector where rapid growth of capital formation tends to be relatively concentrated. This had already generated a collapse of investment and a manufacturing centered growth slowdown {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s. The paper shows that high growth in India after 2003 - 04 did not eliminate this contradiction. Instead, the transmission effects generated by an exceptionally expansionary phase of the global economy enabled a sharp revival of investment which generated this growth, but in the process the contradiction started surfacing again. With the global crisis this phase came to an end, and in the <b>post-crisis</b> <b>situation</b> revival of that growth trajectory appears unlikely. In such circumstances even modest gains on the development front from via the positive effects of high growth on public revenues cannot be guaranteed. ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe 2009 {{edition of}} Social Panorama of Latin America links trends {{in poverty and}} income {{distribution}} with social protection systems, placing special emphasis on how these systems {{have responded to the}} social impacts of the current crisis and on medium- and long-term projections. It focuses in particular on the impact of public transfers, trends in social spending, the mechanisms by which social vulnerability is reproduced and changing intergenerational and gender relations. These changes pose significant challenges for the role played by the State, the market and families in jointly meeting needs related to the population's welfare. The document is divided into two parts. Part 1 includes the usual chapter on poverty and income distribution in the region and a second chapter that examines these issues in greater depth through an analysis of social spending, monetary transfers and conditional cash transfer programmes. The third chapter examines poverty and social vulnerability in light of the crisis and <b>post-crisis</b> <b>situation</b> and analyses how the countries' social protection systems can mitigate these effects of the crisis. Part 2 focuses on the care economy. It includes a chapter on paid and unpaid work from a gender perspective, highlighting inequalities and outstanding debts in the sexual division of labour; a chapter that looks at population projections and trends and underscores the pressing short- and medium-term priorities for care work; and a final chapter on the policy implications of these transformations...|$|E
50|$|Fourthly, the IVI {{develops}} a global partnership for development (Millennium Development Goal 8). As the WHO officially announced by issuing the WHO Position Paper on Cholera Vaccines in 2010, {{there are only}} two available cholera vaccines on the world market: Dukoral and Shanchol. However, unlike Dukoral, which is made by a Dutch corporation, Crucell, Shanchol is the first licensed oral cholera vaccine in 2009 that is developed by an international organization, the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), with supports from the Government of Republic of Korea, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Furthermore, what is significant about Shanchol {{is that it does not}} require administration with buffer, meaning that its use is simplified, and therefore this oral cholera vaccine can be greatly used in refugee camps and other <b>post-crisis</b> <b>situations.</b> In addition, government and international agencies are able to purchase Shanchol at a very low cost (e.g. approximately $1). Thus, in India in 2009, in order to boost global partnership and the global use of the new oral cholera vaccines, Shanchol, with a simplified use and a low cost, the IVI transferred its technology for the vaccine to Shantha Bioethics of Hyderabad, which is an India pharmaceutical company that is a major vaccine supplier to UNICEF.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the businesses and assets of an open system {{is to continue to}} adapt to the environment; and their ability to adjust and be affected by the environment and the structure of the sub-systems in line with expectations depends on their response to change. Constant change in organizational environment and organizations that cannot take the necessary measures against environmental influences and balance lead to the creation of hazards. Achievements of businesses, made possible largely by seeing and handling of danger in advance, depend on assessments. Businesses and environment influence entail various threats and crises which organizations may face. Due to the devastating effects of crisis, coping skill of managers, in terms of organization is essential. To manage crisis, problems need to be identified in advance, as a way to prevent them from occurring; rather than to take steps to limit their consequences. As can be seen it is better to predict and prevent crises from occurring or steps should be taken to limit their results, if they cannot be stopped. The main problems of the industry in Turkey are financial problems, transportation, lack of domestic and imported raw materials, inadequate use of modern and design-focused production, and particularly for small- and medium-scale organizations, lack of information about the international markets. In addition, the global crisis that shook the world economy in 2001, together with other sectors, deeply affected the furniture industry. Furniture industry is affected by a crisis environment, which is what this study aims to determine. In this regard, the pre-and <b>post-crisis</b> <b>situations</b> of furniture enterprises crisis may well be studied...|$|R

40|$|The key goal of {{this thesis}} work lies in the {{development}} of models and tools in support of value-added information extraction from Synthetic Aperture Radar amplitude-only images. In the last decades earth observation instruments provided a great amount of images relevant to any part of the world. These data could be potentially helpful {{for a wide range of}} human activities, ranging from agriculture to rural and urban planning and disaster monitoring and assessment. However, practical use of these data is often limited by the lack of efficient, possibly unsupervised, tools for the retrieving of effective information. In this thesis the first steps toward a modeling of the whole imaging process is provided. In particular, we discuss in detail the fundamentals of the Synthetic Aperture Radar in its standard and well known working configuration, highlighting the need for an adequate modeling able to guarantee effective high resolution data description (Chapter 1). In fact, the statistics of this kind of images are often very different from those used in the modeling of low resolution data. First results coming from the analysis of the first TerraSAR-X high resolution data are presented here and represent the first original contribution of this thesis. In Chapter 1 not only the working geometries and SAR performances are presented but also a conceptual scheme for the simulation of the primary signal collected by the sensor called raw data. Simulators, in fact, are important tools supporting the design and project of new sensors and are able to conveniently lead the criterions for setting the mission parameters as they take into accounts the applications they are planned for. Furthermore, they can be used to conveniently address the inverse problem starting from the complete solution of the direct one. In fact, the development of effective information extraction techniques from SAR data and the synthesis of automatic tools for image analysis mandatory pass through the development of adequate direct models relating the image to the parameters of the surface. Thus, the direct models can become the starting point toward the availability of inversion techniques and physically-based classification techniques. The models used in this thesis work are detailed in Chapter 2. In particular, the geometric and electromagnetic models for natural surfaces are presented, both for natural terrain and for the ocean sea surface. After having introduced the different techniques to collect and model SAR data, we move to discuss the possibility of retrieving information analyzing those data. In particular, in Chapter 3 we present a fractal framework for the simulation of SAR images relevant to simulated disaster scenarios. Such an instrument can be used to increase the understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying radar image formation in case of disasters. In, fact, the main problem of the scientist working on the development of remote sensing techniques for disaster monitoring is the lack or the limitedness of an accurate ground truth. The proposed simulator makes possible to perform parametric studies on canonical disasters scenarios with a perfectly known ground truth. Furthermore, it can be used to obtain images relevant to both pre- and <b>post-crisis</b> <b>situations,</b> providing the possibility to develop a test bed of simulated images to be used for the testing of change detection techniques. Relevant case studies are presented with regard to different kinds of natural disasters. Finally, a novel change detection technique based on the estimation of significant parameters and supported by fractal concepts is described. Results on the simulation of images relevant to ocean scenes covered with oil slicks of arbitrary shape are also presented. In Chapter 4 we cope with the problem of radar imaging of fractal surfaces. In particular, we develop a rigorous analytical formulation for the problem in case a small slope regime can be assumed for the profile. The proposed model allows for the computation of the structure function and of the power density spectrum of the image in closed form. The proposed model is validated through an appropriate numerical framework base on the sound physical models presented in Chapter 2. The first steps toward the extension to the two-dimensional case are also provided. Note that the development of this kind of direct modeling is of key importance for every image analysis technique based on the evaluation of global statistics on SAR images...|$|R
40|$|Incluye BibliografíaThe 2009 - 2010 {{edition of}} Latin America and the Caribbean in the World Economy, which {{discusses}} the crisis {{generated in the}} developed world and the recovery driven by the emerging economies, is divided into five chapters. Chapter I undertakes a short- and medium-term analysis of the <b>post-crisis</b> international economic <b>situation,</b> concentrating on its implications for international trade prospects in Latin America and the Caribbean. It examines the recovery of the global economy, which has centred mainly on the Asian economies (especially China) and other emerging economies, together with the role played by international trade in this recovery both globally and regionally and the heterogeneity of trade performance between different regions of the world. Chapter II reviews developments in regional trade during and after the crisis from both a longterm and a more immediate perspective, as well as the trade policy applied by the region's countries during this period. It offers a detailed analysis of the evolution of goods trade flows by origin and destination and of their sectoral composition over the past two decades, finding a high degree of heterogeneity between the region's countries: export growth has been stronger in the countries of South America than in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, owing to strong demand for commodities from Asia, particularly China. Consequently, while the recovery in regional trade has been substantial, particularly in South America, it has heightened an already somewhat excessive reliance on commodities that incorporate little know-how or technological progress. Chapter III reviews recent trade developments (particularly in the last 12 months) within the main subregional Latin American integration schemes: the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), the Andean Community and the Central American Common Market (CACM). It also examines progress with more recent initiatives such as the Latin American Pacific Basin Initiative and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. Also looked at are the most prominent recent initiatives to enhance trade ties between countries in the region belonging to different integration schemes. Chapter IV analyses recent trends and future prospects in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), an incomplete customs union of 15 States in the Caribbean that includes most English-speaking countries in the region plus Suriname and Haiti. Chapter V examines the strategies recently adopted by Japan to enhance its economic relationship with Latin America and the Caribbean {{from the perspective of a}} public-private partnership that aims to take advantage of opportunities in the region not only in the area of natural and energy resources but also in respect of food security and infrastructure. ...|$|R
