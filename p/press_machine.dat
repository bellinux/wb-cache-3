25|$|Although Wang's Nong Shu {{was mostly}} printed {{by use of}} woodblock printing, his {{innovation}} of wooden movable type soon became popularly used {{in the region of}} Anhui. Wang's wooden movable type was used to print the local gazetteer paper of Jingde City, which incorporated the use of 60,000 written characters organized on revolving tables. During the year of 1298, roughly one hundred copies of this were printed by wooden movable type in a month's time. Following in the footsteps of Wang, in 1322 the magistrate of Fenghua, Zhejiang province, named Ma Chengde, printed Confucian classics with movable type of 100,000 written characters on needed revolving tables. The process of metal movable type was also developed in Joseon Korea by the 13th century, while metal movable type was not pioneered in China until the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) printer Hua Sui used bronze movable type in 1490. Although metal movable type became available in China during the Ming period, wooden movable type persisted in common use even until the 19th century. After that point, the European printing <b>press</b> <b>machine</b> first pioneered by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century became the mainstay and standard in China {{and for the most part}} the global community until the advent of digital printing and the modern computer printer.|$|E

40|$|Electro-hydraulic {{actuators}} (EHAs) have a {{wide range}} of applications where force or position control with high accuracy is exceedingly necessary. Among them, <b>press</b> <b>machines</b> applied hybrid EHAs are more and more used in the heavy industry. This paper presents an online smart tuning fuzzy PID (OSTFPID) approach based on a robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) for the development of high force control precision in the <b>press</b> <b>machines.</b> Here, the main control unit employs the fuzzy PID structure of which membership function (MF) optimization is considered as a system identification problem. A smart selection procedure (SSP) is implemented to pick out only fuzzy input and output MFs activated at each running step, and then the REKF algorithm is used to tune the active MFs automatically during the operation process to minimize the control error. Consequently, the active MFs are trained about their shapes and positions to adapt to the working conditions. As the result, the control performance is significantly improved, while the optimizing time and number of the controller calculations are remarkably reduced. In order to verify the ability of the proposed controller applied to the <b>press</b> <b>machines</b> using EHAs, a test press bench system called electro-hydraulic test machine (EHTM) is also suggested and setup to use in this study. Real-time experiments on the EHTM are carried out to evaluate the control method in a large variation of working environments. Considerable improvement in the performance generated by the designed controller is compared with the traditional PID and fuzzy PID controllers...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{consider}} an incline <b>press</b> <b>machine</b> {{that is a}} single-lever machine that has the plates halfway up the lever from the handles to the fulcrum, and begins moving the plates at a 45-degree angle from vertical. The lever will provide a leverage advantage of 2:1, and the incline will have an advantage of 1:√2/2, for a net mechanical advantage of (4/√2):1 ≈ 2.8:1. Thus 50 kg (~491 N) of plates will apply to the user only an equaling weight of 18 kg or a force of ~174 N {{at the beginning of}} the motion.|$|E

5000|$|Offset {{printing}} is {{a commonly}} used printing technique {{in which the}} inked image is transferred (or [...] "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface.

5000|$|The {{production}} of elongated coins {{can be divided}} into three general classes, each of which covers a distinct period from 1893 to the present. The first of the three classes are referred to colloquially as [...] "oldies", and were produced mainly for issuance at nationwide fairs like the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exhibition and the 1904 Saint Louis World's Fair. This period started with the issuance of the first elongateds in 1893, and ended with an influx of private rollers around 1965. The second class of elongated coins, the [...] "Modern Elongateds", cover the years c. 1965 to c. 1985. Around 1965, the major source of elongated coins became private rollers, individuals who designed and rolled elongated coins for sale. The major rollers of this period include Dottie Dow, the [...] "House of Elongateds" [...] (Lee Martin/Warren Bunge), Ralph Jones, Ralph W. Jobe, Elmer Anderson, Don Adams, Cee Ceven, and Angelo A. Rosato. While many private rollers still operate (notables include Raymond W. Dillard, Tyler D. Tyson, Brad Ream, and Don Adams), the vast introduction of commercial stand alone elongated machines came into the marketplace in 1988, following the introduction of the coin-operated penny <b>press</b> <b>machine</b> 1971, decreased the demand for private issues. This event marks the beginning of the third class of elongated coins, the [...] "Contemporary Elongateds" [...] (c. 1988 - present). This class of elongated coin machines were designed and built by Randy and Earl Vaughn from Dayton, Ohio in 1988. These mechanical coin-operated machines are still prominent in amusement parks such as Disney Resorts [...] and attractions throughout the United States, and the world. The first ever stand alone coin-operated mechanical penny <b>press</b> <b>machine</b> was placed in Kings Island Amusement park in 1988 by manufacturer Uncommon Cents, now called Global Impressions USA.|$|E
