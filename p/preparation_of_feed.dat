5000|$|Corn, sorghum, {{wheat and}} barley {{are the most}} used cereals in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> for the livestock, poultry, swine, and fish industry. Roller and hammer mills are {{the two types of}} {{processing}} equipment generally used to grind grains into smaller particle sizes. Milling cereal grains by mechanical action involves several forces like compression, shearing, crushing, cutting, friction and collision. The particle size of the ground cereal is very important in the animal feed production; smaller particle sizes increase the number of particles and the surface area per unit volume which increase access to digestive enzymes. Other benefits are increased ease of handling and easier mixing of ingredients. The average particle size is given as geometric mean diameter (GMD), expressed in mm or microns (Âµm) and the range of variation is described by geometric standard deviation (GSD), with a larger GSD representing lower uniformity. According to , GMD and GSD are accurate descriptors of particle size distribution when the particle size distribution is expressed as log data, and are distributed log normally. Studies have shown that grinding different grains with the same mill under similar conditions results in products with different particle sizes. The hardness of a grain sample is related to the percentage of fine particles obtained after grinding, with a higher percentage of fine particles from lower hardness grains. [...] discussed that hard endosperm produces irregularly-shaped larger particles, while soft endosperm produces smaller size particles. The correlation between particle size and energy consumed is although not positive but, to obtain very fine particle sizes require higher energy which reduces the rate of production. Moreover, a very fine grind of grain has no impact on the efficiency of pelleting, nor on the power consumed during pelleting. [...] discussed the availability of more data suggesting grain particle sizes are very important in mashed diets than in pelleted diets.|$|E

40|$|Feeding {{operations}} in dairy cow farms are of strategic {{importance for the}} economy of the farm. In addition to being strictly related to the productivity of the cows, feeding represents one of the greater costs for farms, considering that more than 25 % of labour time is dedicated to this operation. In a context characterized by the need for maintaining high production standards and of decreasing the costs, the adoption of automated systems for the preparation and distribution of the total mixed ration (TMR) can represent a valid solution, especially in specialized farms. Automatic Feeding Systems (AFS) allow for the increase in frequency of feed distribution with a consequent optimization of dry matter ingestion by the animals, and simultaneously, assist with maintaining a higher stability of ruminal pH along with significant advantages in terms of health and production. Furthermore, they provide a reduction of man labour related to <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed,</b> distribution, and to propel the ration closer to the feeding rack. The present research was focused on monitoring of a dairy farm, located in the Veneto region of Italy, during the transition from a conventional feeding system (CFS), represented by a tractor-operated mixing wagon, to an automatic system equipped with stationary feeding hoppers, a mixing unit and distribution wagon operating on rail. The paper reports a comparative analysis of the functionality of the two systems, including energy consumption and man labor, for preparation and distribution of the TMR. Despite the initial capital investment and maintenance, expenditures have not been taken into account in this study, AFS represent an innovative way to reduce the labour requirements and the improve quality and consistency of work when feeding TMR. In particular, labour was reduced from 2. 5 hÂ·day- 1 related to the CFS to 1. 02 hÂ·day- 1 needed for the management of the AFS.
