40|$|New {{developments}} in the mobile telecom industry, such as growing transmisson bandwidth and sector-crossing business alliances, change {{the way in which}} mobile telco’s are innovating. Traditional innovation models, such as the well-known single-company linear model ('pipeline model'), do not describe anymore how innovation occurs in today's practice. An alternative way of looking at innovation is the boundary-crossing Cyclic Innovation Model (CIM). It views innovation processes as coupled 'cycles of change', connecting science with business as well as technology with markets, in a cyclic manner. CIM has been applied to ‘Lucio’, a mobile data <b>product-service</b> <b>combination</b> introduced into the Dutch market by KPN Mobile. The analysis shows that Lucio is a multi-sector, class- 2 innovation. It also shows that CIM is capable of giving insight into the complex network of companies involved, making clear how each company brings-in functionality that together consitutes the innovation. CIM can therefore be considered as a promising addition to the growing family of fourth-generation innovation model...|$|E
40|$|Current {{discourse}} on smart grid deployment expects residential end users {{to play a}} more active role as co-providers in the electric power system. Their electricity consumption and production is considered a resource for balancing supply and demand in an electric power system with distributed generation. This means that, in addition to using energy efficiently, they, for example, have to adjust their consumption patterns to the production patterns of locally available and intermittent energy generation. This thesis explores how the technological and social contexts of smart grids can shape the role of residential end-users as co-providers in the electric power system. The main objective was to formulate implications for the development of products and services that support end-users in taking up a co-provider role. The research involved a literature review about currently applied smart grid technologies and field studies of two pilot projects in which households were equipped with smart energy technology: Energy Battle and PowerMatching City. Both cases concern the implementation of a <b>product-service</b> <b>combination</b> that was new for the household and that was aimed at enabling one or more aspects of co-providing end-user behavior. End-users’ experiences in using the implemented system were central to the research in each case. The research resulted in design implications within four themes: (1) Design of the user interface, (2) Design in relation to the social context at household and community level, (3) Integral design approach to address behavioral and technical aspects of smart energy system performance, and (4) Design of products and services as part of an experiential learning process for both developers and end-users.

40|$|Cyber-physical {{consumer}} durables (CPCDs) are <b>product-service</b> <b>combinations</b> {{that reflect the}} functional and structural features of cyber-physical systems. Not only due to their complexity, but also to their significantly different functional and structural features, mass customization (MC) of this new category of goods poses challenges. Due to the largely differences of features, a straightforward exportation of the mass customization principles of traditional {{consumer durables}} {{does not seem to}} be possible or sufficient. The objective of our research was to investigate relationships among the functional and structural features of traditional consumer durables and cyber-physical consumer durable...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} how the Theory of Inventor's Problem Solving (TRIZ) may be applied in the development of <b>product-service</b> <b>combinations.</b> The authors have analyzed TRIZ modules and tools under a PSS (Product Service System) perspective to extract some principles of particular interest for their development. Basing on the outcomes of such investigation, the authors propose a framework for the use of TRIZ-based tools in product-service design.

40|$|The {{development}} of complex <b>product-service</b> <b>combinations</b> challenges the existing practices for engineering knowledge management. The {{objective of the}} paper is to highlight how such practices need to change to meet the engineers’ demand for knowledge when developing “functions” instead of merely hardware. It further proposes Knowledge Enabled Engineering (KEE) as an umbrella term that collects engineering knowledge management methods and tools inspired by the second wave of knowledge management, and that are aimed to meet needs of today’s modern knowledge workers in engineering organizations. The current state of readiness of these approaches is eventually described together with results from verification and validation activities.

40|$|On {{all levels}} of economy and society {{innovations}} are perceived as key success factor to economic growth and employment. Often it reads as follows: Increased research and development generates technologically innovative products, enabling companies to achieve competitive advantages and gain market shares, which eventually leads to economic growth and employment. This coherence has many times been empirically proven and was again confirmed by the Manufacturing Performance Survey 2003. At {{the same time the}} survey also revealed that other promising innovation strategies can be pursued: Companies that achieve innovative breakthroughs by intelligent <b>product-service</b> <b>combinations</b> or innovative techno-organisational processes also are superior to their competitors in regards to employment growth. This indicates that innovation can be more than just research and development. Innovative companies contributing to economic growth and employment can also be found in industrial sectors that are not as dedicated to research. They too ought to be appreciated and supported in their innovation efforts corre spondingly. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In industrialised {{countries}} {{the reduction of}} the consumption of resources is recognised as the first step toward sustainable development. Achieving this will require an economic change which divorces economic success from resource consumption. An emerging trend in design research that is directly concerned with such 'dematerialisation' is for businesses to realign their corporate strategies toward the selling of performance rather than goods through the design of <b>product-service</b> <b>combinations.</b> In such a 'service' economy products cannot be completely defined by an essential and eternal form because productservices change in ways that are unforeseeable to the designer. This paper considers that such an epistemological shift can be conceptualised, following the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze (1925 - 1995) as the transition from an axiomatic to a problematic approach to design. This paper will develop and explain the differences and similarities between these two approaches and then draw out the implications for sustainable design and the relation between design and science...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} {{opportunities}} {{have been put}} forth for the apparel industry to develop alternative revenue streams while reducing the volume of new production and flow of merchandising to be more sustainable (WRAP 2011). Such alternative revenue streams can be generated {{from the sale of}} pre-owned apparel, services that offer the consumer different ways to gain greater use of items already owned, accessible and affordable alteration and repair services, and collection of used clothing for recycle and reuse. An alternative sustainable concept for business named product-service system (PSS) has been under investigation and practices (Tukker 2004). PSS is defined as the combination of tangible products and intangible services, which jointly satisfy consumer needs with more emphasis placed on intangible services (Tukker 2004). PSS utilizes the concepts such as product renting or leasing, redesigning, maintaining, or sharing to reduce reliance on natural resources as well as increasing product longevity (Heiskanen and Jalas 2003; Tukker 2004). PSS offers a variety of benefits, such as reducing the material flows in production and consumption by creating <b>product-service</b> <b>combinations</b> that provide consumers with the same level of performance, but with a lower impact on the environment (Catulli 2012; Mont 2002).|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the Finnish {{education}} system has often {{reached the top}} position in international rankings, backed-up {{by the results of}} well-established international evaluations such as PISA. Along with the good reputation, there has been a surge in educational tourism and an increased interest in bringing Finnish education into other countries. This thesis aims to provide a deeper insight on the composition of the Finnish Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) services and how their packaging, export, distribution, adaptation and execution can be improved with the help of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). This exploratory study follows an abductive approach, combining theoretical and empirical evidence t o determine qualitative and distinctive attributes of Finnish ECEC. It starts with an overview of the national education system, its welfare context, operational characteristics and pedagogical principles. It continues with the analysis of previous academic research related to the productization and export of Finnish education, distinguishing common characteristics and models applicable to the ECEC level. The background research finalizes with a detailed description of existing service theories and their evolution over time, leading into the field of Service Design (SD). This discipline and its key concepts are presented as a holistic and comprehensive approach to model complex <b>product-service</b> <b>combinations,</b> such as the ones found in Finnish ECEC. The second half of the thesis is the exploratory case study of a Finnish start-up that wants to sell an ECEC franchise. The author’s own observations while working inside the company are validated through SD workshops to determine the key process areas and stakeholders involved in the current business strategy. Based on the case study and the theoretical framework, the author proposes recommendations for the company and other practitioners, aiming to clarify their offerings and devise an efficient use of various technological solutions that facilitate the export of Finnish ECEC products and services...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} have traditionally focused their design and development activities on realizing technical and engineered aspects of physical artifacts based on performance requirements. The ever-changing business climate, with its increased pace {{during the past}} decades, has forced industries to continuously innovate their approach toward {{the development of new}} products. Pressured also by global competition, manufacturing companies need to reconsider the traditional concept of realizing value via goods production, and shift towards realizing value through <b>product-service</b> <b>combinations.</b> Companies have begun to recognize that gaining competitive advantage and expanding market shares is not achievable purely through continuous technical improvements. Rather, it is necessary to develop a closer relationship to the customer to gain a deeper understanding of expectations, needs, and perceived value. From a development perspective, the overarching problem within complex systems such as those in which cars, aircraft, and excavators are manufactured, or healthcare is provided, is that the focus on customer value is likely to become blurred since it is difficult to understand the impact a change in any single component in the overall system has on value, and to determine a new function’s impact on future scenarios. The main goals of this thesis are to provide an understanding of key challenges when considering the value different design alternatives provide in the conceptual phases of product development taking the automotive industry as case study, and to explore how to support a multi-disciplinary design team in making value-conscious decisions when dealing with new product-service offerings. The research approach has involved data collection through participation in, and facilitation of, product-service design workshops in the automotive industry. Also, it has involved follow-up meetings and interviews, as well as a review of literature on state-of-the-art methods in early conceptual design phases, which describes {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different frameworks. The primary finding of the study is that determination of the impact of different PSS design options on customer value becomes more challenging since new elements are introduced (e. g., new business models and services). The design team requires more holistic competences in order to more fully understand changing contexts; and new methods and tools are needed in order to establish a base to define, discuss and assess what “uncontested customer value” is, and link it to the different product-service elements of the system. Secondly, this thesis proposes a conceptual approach for value simulation and assessment of different design options, where the iterative use of personas and scenario generation is combined with value modeling and computer-based simulation techniques, enabling a quick “what-if” analysis of the various options, facilitating the identification of promising combinations of product and service elements that provide higher customer value...|$|R
