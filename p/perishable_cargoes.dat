A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or <b>perishable</b> <b>cargoes.</b> Seaborne trade carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.|$|E

Similar vessels were built as privateers during the War of Independence and the War of 1812, and as pilot boats. The famous yacht America, derived from the lines of a New York pilot boat, was conceptually not far removed from the Baltimore clipper. Many such vessels went to Australia during the Australian gold rush, or after being seized as slavers and sold.|$|E
50|$|Wherries were sail and oar craft {{dating back}} to 1604. These were small craft, in 1727 being of 8 tons burthen. They were still sail and oar boats, fitted with hoops and canvas tilts for the comfort of their passengers. They would have {{provided}} a service carrying passengers and small <b>perishable</b> <b>cargoes.</b> Alongside these early wherries where the bigger keels, which were transom-sterned clinker-built barges with a square sail on a mast stepped amidships of about 54 ft by 14 ft and able to carry 30 tons of goods. The keel had been built since the Middle Ages and the design probably {{went back to the}} Viking invasion. After 1800, the Norfolk Keel (or 'keel wherry') disappeared, partly because a wherry could be sailed with fewer crew, and it had limited manoeuvrability and lacked speed.|$|E

5000|$|But, when {{negligence}} {{is followed}} by a natural event of such magnitude that it erases the physical effects of the original negligence, the defendant’s liability ceases at the moment in time when the supervening condition occurs. In Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government, the Carslogie collided with the Heimgar and admitted liability. Temporary repairs were effected with permanent repairs to be carried out later in the United States. After the collision but before crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar was given a certificate of seaworthiness, authorising her to be continued in her present class without fresh record of survey, subject to permanent repairs at the owner's convenience. She was held fit to carry dry and <b>perishable</b> <b>cargoes.</b> While crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar encountered heavy weather and sustained such serious damage as to become unseaworthy and to require immediate dry docking. Thus, prior to encountering the rough weather, the Heimgar was a seaworthy vessel, capable of earning profits for her owners. Repairs due to the collision and to the heavy weather, as well as the owner's repairs were all carried out at the same time. Ten of the fifty days in dry dock were allocated to the repair of the collision damage and the question for the House of Lords was whether the owners of the Carslogie were liable for that ten-day loss of earning capacity. The claim was for damages because a working ship is [...] "a profit-earning machine". If she ceases to earn a profit, it is essential to consider what caused the detention in dry dock at that time. In this case, the Heimgar was a profit-earning vessel before suffering the heavy weather damage. Thus, the loss of earnings at that time was not caused by the collision. Hence, The Oropesa demonstrates that where there are two successive causes of harm, the court may regard the first event as the cause of all the harm, or hold that the second supervening event reduces or eliminates the effect of the initial negligence as in Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) to identify the tuna cargo handling conducted in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ, 2) to determine the main variables that affect the performance of tuna cargo handling in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ, and 3) to determine what policies can be used to improve the performance of tuna cargo handling in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ. This research was conducted by using the descriptive methodology i. e. a discrete simulation model of the process of tuna cargo handling in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ by utilizing ARENA software. In the policy making of tuna cargo handling improvements, the Analytical Network Process, Benefit, Opportunity, Cost, and Risk (ANP BOCR) were also used. The simulation results point out that the existing conditions contribute to the delay level of tuna cargo delivery by 12 % with the quality level of 22, 934 %. Delays in tuna cargo delivery have led to an increase in operational costs by 1, 5 %. ANP BOCR results highlight that opening a special lane for <b>perishable</b> <b>cargo</b> handling will improve the performance of tuna cargo handling in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ. Furthermore, the results of discrete model simulations on the improvement scenario of tuna cargo handling performance show that by opening a special lane for <b>perishable</b> <b>cargo</b> handling, it can ensure delivery schedule to be accurate indicated by the level of on time delivery reaching up to 100 %, with an average quality rate of 86. 013 %. By speeding up the processing period (with an average of 81. 519 minutes), the delay of cargo delivery up to 100 % will be reduced; therefore, the quality of tuna is maintained in a good condition with the histamine level of 6, 7 ppm.

Many environment and health related events in the last decade, such as the Foot & Mouth disease epidemic in 2001, followed by numerous instances of food contamination in imports from third countries and similar events resulted in Governments heavily regulating international trade in environment and health sector. As a result, businesses have been imposed with a huge pile of regulations to comply with. Regulations include controls imposed by the UK Government {{as well as by the}} European Union. This increase in red tape and burden of compliance coupled with high value and time sensitive nature of perishable items has put logistical functions under tremendous pressure. Moreover, distant relationship between businesses and Government Authorities, existence of manual processes and gaps in Information Technology systems have resulted in increase in time and costs of compliance for businesses.
