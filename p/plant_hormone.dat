5|$|Microorganisms {{and plants}} can {{synthesize}} many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make 2-aminoisobutyric acid and lanthionine, {{which is a}} sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic lantibiotics such as alamethicin. However, in plants, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate {{in the production of}} the <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> ethylene.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{growth and}} {{development}} is influenced by mutual interactions among <b>plant</b> <b>hormones.</b> The five classical <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene. They are small diffusible molecules that easily penetrate between cells. In addition, newer classes of <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> have been identified such as brassinosteroids, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and various small proteins or peptides. These hormones also play important roles in the regulation of plant {{growth and development}}. This review begins with a brief summary of the current findings on <b>plant</b> <b>hormones.</b> Based on this knowledge, a conceptual model about interactions among <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> is built so as to link and {{develop an understanding of}} the diverse functions of different <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> as a whole in plants...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> such as auxins, cytokinins (CKs), and abscisic acid (ABA) not only govern important plant physiological traits but are key players in plant–microbe interactions. A poorly appreciated fact, however,is that both microbes and animals produce and perceive <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> and their mimics. Moreover, dietary <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> impact on human physiological process such as glucose assimilation, inflammation, and cell division.

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>hormones</b> {{are the key}} {{regulators}} {{of adaptive}} stress response. Abiotic stresses such as drought and salt are known to affect the growth and productivity of plants. It {{is well known that}} the levels of <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> such as zeatin (ZA), abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and brassinolide (BR) fluctuate upon abiotic stress exposure. At present, there is not any single suitable liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for simultaneous analysis of BR and other <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> involved in abiotic stresses. In the present study, we developed a simple, sensitive, and rapid method for simultaneous analysis of five major <b>plant</b> <b>hormones,</b> ZA, ABA, JA, SA, and BR, which are directly or indirectly involved in drought and salt stresses. The optimized extraction procedure was simple and easy to use for simultaneous measurement of these <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana. The developed method is highly reproducible and can be adapted for simultaneous measurement of changes in <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> (ZA, ABA, JA, SA, and BR) in response to abiotic stresses in plants like A. thaliana and tomato...|$|R
5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor Peptides) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E

25|$|The {{hormonal}} {{control of}} growth, differentiation {{and development in}} plants was Osborne's lifelong interest. She is particularly known for her work establishing that the gas ethylene is a natural <b>plant</b> <b>hormone,</b> rather than a by-product or pollutant, and for demonstrating that ethylene, rather than abscisic acid, is the major regulator of senescence (ageing) and abscission (shedding of parts such as leaves). She conducted extensive research into interactions between ethylene and auxin (another key <b>plant</b> <b>hormone)</b> in controlling numerous aspects of plant development. This work led her to develop {{the idea of the}} target cell as a model for how a small number of plant hormones can exert many different effects, a concept she expounded in her 2005 book, Hormones, Signals and Target Cells in Plant Development (co-authored with Michael McManus).|$|E

In addition to serving as an important active metabolite of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which acts in part as a prodrug to salicylic acid, it is probably best known for its use as a key ingredient in topical anti-acne products.

40|$|Reprogramming of {{somatic cells}} into induced {{pluripotent}} stem (iPS) cells by defined pluripotency and self-renewal factors has taken stem cell {{technology to the}} forefront of regenerative medicine. However, a number of challenges remain in the field including efficient protocols and the threat of cancer. Reprogramming of plant somatic cells to plant embryonic stem cells using a combination of two <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> was discovered in 1957 and has been a routine university laboratory practical for over 30 years. The <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> responsible for cell reprogramming to pluripotency, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and isopentenyl adenosine (IPA), are present in human cells, leading to the exciting possibility that <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> might reprogram mammalian cells without genetic factors. We found that <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> on their own could not reprogram mammalian cells but increase the efficiency of the early formation of iPS cells combined with three defined genetic factors during the first 3 weeks of reprogramming by accelerating the cell cycle and regulating pluripotency genes. Moreover, the cytokinin IPA, a known human anticancer agent, reduced the threat of cancer of iPS cell in vitro by regulating key cancer and stem cell-related genes, most notably c-Myc and Igf- 1. In conclusion, the <b>plant</b> <b>hormones,</b> auxin and cytokinin, are new small chemicals useful for enhancing early reprogramming efficiency of mammalian cells and reducing the threat of cancer from iPS cells.

25|$|Used in high doses, auxin {{stimulates the}} {{production}} of ethylene. Excess ethylene (also native <b>plant</b> <b>hormone)</b> can inhibit elongation growth, cause leaves to fall (abscission), and even kill the plant. Some synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were marketed also as herbicides. Dicots, such as dandelions, are much more susceptible to auxins than monocots, such as grasses and cereal crops. So, these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. 2,4-D was the first widely used herbicide, {{and it is still}} so. 2,4-D was first commercialized by the Sherwin-Williams company, and saw use in the late 1940s. It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene {{has been}} used since the ancient Egyptians, who would gash figs in order to stimulate {{ripening}} (wounding stimulates ethylene production by plant tissues). The ancient Chinese would burn incense in closed rooms to enhance the ripening of pears. In 1864, {{it was discovered that}} gas leaks from street lights led to stunting of growth, twisting of plants, and abnormal thickening of stems. In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow showed that the active component was ethylene. Sarah Doubt discovered that ethylene stimulated abscission in 1917. It wasn't until 1934 that Gane reported that plants synthesize ethylene. In 1935, Crocker proposed that ethylene was the <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> responsible for fruit ripening as well as senescence of vegetative tissues.|$|E
25|$|The <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> {{ethylene}} is a combatant for salinity in most plants. Ethylene {{is known}} for regulating plant growth and development and adapted to stress conditions. Central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. ETO2, Ethylene overproducer 2, is a protein that when mutated it will gain a function to continually produce ethylene even {{when there is no}} stress condition, causing the plant to grow short and stumpy. ERS1, Ethylene response sensor 1, is activated when ethylene is present in the signaling pathway and when mutated, it loses a function and cannot bind to ethylene. This means a response is never activated and the plant {{will not be able to}} cope with the abiotic stress. EIN2, Ethylene insensitive 2, is a protein that activates the pathway and when there is a mutation here the EIN2 will block ethylene stimulation and an ethylene response gene will not be activated. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and limit plant growth. The effects of salinity have been studied on Arabidopsis plants that have mutated ERS1 and EIN4 proteins. These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain stress conditions, such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is allowing suppress of any sensitivity to the salt stress. Mutations in these pathways can cause lack of ethylene signaling, causing stunt in plant growth and development.|$|E

500|$|Root nodules {{containing}} Rhizobium bacteria {{have been}} found on R. regia trees in India.

[...] Further evidence of nitrogen fixation was provided by the presence of nitrogenase (an enzyme used in nitrogen fixation) and leghaemoglobin, a compound which allows nitrogenase to function by reducing the oxygen concentration in the root nodule. [...] In addition to evidence of nitrogen fixation, the nodules were also found to be producing indole acetic acid, an important <b>plant</b> <b>hormone.</b>|$|E
500|$|A hormone {{produced}} in the brain of the female moths controls sex pheromones. The hormone is released into the hemolymph to stimulate pheromone production. [...] Pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN) is a peptide that regulates pheromone production in moths. It acts on the pheromone gland cells using calcium and cyclic AMP. Although the photoperiod regulates the release of PBAN to some extent, the chemical signals from the host plant supersede the effect {{from the time of}} day. Female Helicoverpa zea in corn fields do not produce pheromones during the night until they encounter corn. Several natural corn silk volatiles like the <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> ethylene induce H. zea pheromone production. The presence of the silk from an ear of corn is enough to cause pheromone production, and physical contact between females and corn is unnecessary. This evolutionary mechanism enables the moths to coordinate their reproductive behavior with the availability of food. Female moths often become depleted of sex pheromone after mating within 2 hours of separation from the male. The pheromonostatic peptide (PSP), a protein 57 amino acids long found in the male accessory gland, is what causes depletion of the female’s sex pheromone. This capability in males has been selected for because it increases the reproductive fitness of those that carry it, since other males will not be attracted to a female without a sex pheromone; thus, the female will bear only the first male's offspring. The transfer of a spermatophore without accessory gland products does not stop female pheromone production, but does stop the female's calling behavior. Intense selection acting on males to manipulate female reproductive physiology promotes rapid evolution of specific molecules, and male-derived pheromone suppressing factors exhibit positive selection.|$|E
500|$|Leaves are {{structures}} specialised for photosynthesis and {{are arranged}} {{on the tree}} {{in such a way}} as to maximise their exposure to light without shading each other. They are an important investment by the tree and may be thorny or contain phytoliths, lignins, tannins or poisons to discourage herbivory. Trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes and sizes, in response to environmental pressures including climate and predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen. The needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments where resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees. In conifers such as fir trees, the branches hang down at an angle to the trunk, enabling them to shed snow. In contrast, broad leaved trees in temperate regions deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves. When the days get shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer make new chlorophyll and the red and yellow pigments already present in the blades become apparent. Synthesis in the leaf of a <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> called auxin also ceases. This causes the cells at the junction of the petiole and the twig to weaken until the joint breaks and the leaf floats to the ground. In tropical and subtropical regions, many trees keep their leaves all year round. Individual leaves may fall intermittently and be replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time. Other tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves annually, such as at the start of the dry season. Many deciduous trees flower before the new leaves emerge. A few trees do not have true leaves but instead have structures with similar external appearance such as Phylloclades [...] modified stem structures [...] as seen in the genus Phyllocladus.|$|E
