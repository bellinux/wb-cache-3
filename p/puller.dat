5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's <b>puller,</b> essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the <b>puller</b> pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that a major}} Japanese {{attack was}} underway, <b>Puller</b> {{requested}} reinforcement. At 03:45, the 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall and being held in reserve, was fed piecemeal into Puller's line. In spite of the darkness and intermittent heavy rain, the Army National Guard troops were placed in Puller's defences before daybreak.|$|E
5|$|At 17:00 on 24 September, as Puller's men {{hiked up}} the {{northeast}} slope of Mount Austen, they surprised {{and killed a}} bivouac of 16 Japanese soldiers. The noise from the skirmish alerted several companies of Oka's Maizuru Battalion, who were emplaced nearby. The Maizuru troops quickly attacked Puller's Marines, who took cover and returned fire. Acting on Oka's orders, the Japanese slowly disengaged while withdrawing towards the Matanikau River, and the engagement was over by nightfall. The Marines counted 30 dead Japanese and had suffered 13 dead and 25 wounded. <b>Puller</b> radioed headquarters and requested help to evacuate the wounded. Vandegrift replied that he would send the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (2/5) as reinforcements the next day.|$|E

40|$|This {{review article}} {{examines}} previous weightlifting literature {{and provides a}} rationale {{for the use of}} weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives that eliminate the catch phase for athletes who are not competitive weightlifters. Practitioners should emphasize the completion of the triple extension movement during the second <b>pull</b> phase that is characteristic of weightlifting movements as this is likely to have the greatest transference to athletic performance that is dependent on hip, knee, and ankle extension. The clean <b>pull,</b> snatch <b>pull,</b> hang high <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh <b>pull</b> are weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives {{that can be used in}} the teaching progression of the full weightlifting movements and are thus less complex with regard to exercise technique. Previous literature suggests that the clean <b>pull,</b> snatch <b>pull,</b> hang high <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh <b>pull</b> may provide a training stimulus that is as good as, if not better than, weightlifting movements that include the catch phase. Weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives can be implemented throughout the training year, but an emphasis and de-emphasis should be used in order to meet the goals of particular training phases. When implementing weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, athletes must make a maximum effort, understand that <b>pulling</b> derivatives can be used for both technique work and building strength–power characteristics, and be coached with proper exercise technique. Future research should consider examining the effect of various loads on kinetic and kinematic characteristics of weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, training with full weightlifting movements as compared to training with weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, and how kinetic and kinematic variables vary between derivatives of the snatch...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCombined {{with the}} chip guiding, this paper {{presents}} a new “assisted turning method” where the cut chip is <b>pulled</b> using an external <b>pulling</b> device to improve the performance of turning process.

Design of the chip <b>pulling</b> system, proposed <b>pulling</b> device and its automatic control are presented in this research.
