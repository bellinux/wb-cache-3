50|$|Cable that is run between {{floors in}} non-plenum areas is rated as riser cable. The fire {{requirements}} on riser cable {{are not as}} strict. Thus, <b>plenum</b> <b>cable</b> can always replace riser cable, but riser cable cannot replace <b>plenum</b> <b>cable</b> in plenum spaces.|$|E
50|$|They are {{distinct}} from optical fiber, nonconductive, <b>plenum</b> <b>cable</b> (OFNP), and general-purpose optical cable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plenum</b> <b>cable</b> [...] is {{electrical}} cable that is {{laid in the}} plenum spaces of buildings. In the United States, plastics used {{in the construction of}} <b>plenum</b> <b>cable</b> are regulated under the National Fire Protection Association standard NFPA 90A: Standard for the Installation of Air Conditioning and Ventilating Systems. All materials intended for use on wire and cables to be placed in plenum spaces are designed to meet rigorous fire safety test standards in accordance with NFPA 262 and outlined in NFPA 90A.|$|E
2500|$|UTP <b>plenum</b> <b>cables</b> {{that run}} above {{ceilings}} and inside walls use a solid copper core for each conductor, which enables the cable {{to hold its}} shape when bent. [...] Patch cables, which connect computers to wall plates, use stranded copper wire because {{they are expected to}} be flexed during their lifetimes.|$|R
5000|$|Horizontal cabling wiring can be IW (inside wiring) or <b>plenum</b> <b>cabling</b> and connects {{telecommunications}} {{rooms to}} individual outlets or work {{areas on the}} floor, usually through the wireways, conduits or ceiling spaces of each floor. A horizontal cross-connect is where the horizontal cabling connects to a patch panel or punch up block, which is connected by backbone cabling to the main distribution facility.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} resistance to ultraviolet light in outdoor applications nylon containing a minimum of 2% carbon black is used to protect the polymer chains and extend the cable tie's service life. Blue cable ties are supplied to the food industry and contain a metal additive {{so they can be}} detected by industrial metal detectors. Cable ties made of ETFE (Tefzel) are used in radiation-rich environments. Red cable ties made of ECTFE (Halar) are used for <b>plenum</b> <b>cabling.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Plenum</b> <b>cable</b> is {{jacketed}} with a fire-retardant plastic jacket {{of either}} a low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or a fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP). Polyolefin formulations, specifically based on polyethylene compounding {{had been developed}} by at least two companies {{in the early to}} mid-1990s; however, these were never commercialized, and development efforts continue in these yet-untapped product potentials. Development efforts on a non-halogen plenum compound were announced in 2007 citing new flame-retardant synergist packages that may provide an answer for a yet-underdeveloped <b>plenum</b> <b>cable</b> market outside the United States.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, a {{development}} program specifically targeting {{the production of}} a non-halogen <b>plenum</b> <b>cable</b> compound was announced to specifically address lingering toxicity concerns presented by halogenated compounds for use in European and other global markets.|$|E
5000|$|Most phone systems {{use this}} type of cable. The common color is gray and made of {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC). Most manufactures have standardized on this color for this material. Another standardized color is white, usually associated with <b>plenum</b> <b>cable.</b> <b>Plenum</b> <b>cable</b> is cable used in plenum spaces of buildings. The plenum [...] is the space used for air circulation for {{heating and air conditioning}} systems, by providing a location for ductwork. Space between the structural ceiling and the dropped ceiling or under a raised floor is typically considered plenum. Some drop ceiling designs create a tight seal that does not allow for airflow and therefore may not be considered a plenum air-handling space.|$|E
50|$|Different cable {{manufacturers}} {{use different}} methods of identification for the shielded pairs of cable. Belden have a sequenced color code {{and a number}} {{for each of the}} conductors in their products of up to 52 pair <b>cables,</b> for their <b>plenum</b> <b>cables</b> each pair is covered with their patended Belfoil shield, that is only conductive on the inner surface. For their portable cables they use a French braid. Canare, Mogami, Clark Wire & Cable and GEPCO mark numbers on the PVC insulation of the individual pairs.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>plenum</b> and riser <b>cables</b> {{commonly}} {{include a}} rope or polymer filament with high tensile strength, which helps support {{the weight of}} the cable when it is dangling in an open chute.|$|R
50|$|Velocity {{factor is}} an {{important}} characteristic of communication media such as category 5 cables and radio transmission lines. <b>Plenum</b> data <b>cable</b> typically has a VF between 0.42 and 0.72 (42% to 72% {{of the speed of}} light in a vacuum) and riser cable around 0.70. A VF of 0.70 corresponds to a speed of approximately 210,000,000 m/s or 4.76 ns to travel one meter.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} that the dropped ceiling is used as a plenum, {{low-voltage}} cables and wiring not installed inside conduit need to use a special low-smoke and low-toxicity wire insulation which will tend to char and stop burning on its own. This helps to protect building occupants so that they are not poisoned with toxic chemicals sucked through the ventilation system {{in the event of a}} fire, and helps to prevent fires from spreading inside the hidden plenum space. This special low-smoke cable is typically referred to as <b>plenum</b> <b>cable</b> or Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH or LS0H) cable. While twisted pair cable for networking and telephone service is the most common form of <b>plenum</b> <b>cable,</b> coaxial cable also needs to be plenum-rated for safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{multicore}} cable {{runs from the}} stage box or microphone splitter {{and then to the}} front-of-house sound desk or mixing console. Permanent installations have stage boxes mounted in the floor or side of stage and the <b>plenum</b> <b>cable</b> runs through the ceiling or false floor to the console, located either in the auditorium or the bio-box.|$|E
