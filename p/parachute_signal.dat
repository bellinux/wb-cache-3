5000|$|... 216 <b>Parachute</b> <b>Signal</b> Squadron (216 Para Sig or simply, 216) is a Squadron of the British Army's Royal Corps of Signals. It is {{responsible}} for installing, maintaining and operating all types of telecommunications equipment and information systems in support of 16 Air Assault Brigade. The 216 <b>Parachute</b> <b>Signal</b> Squadron are capable of delivering Aerial Support (AS) to the 16 Air Assault Brigade. They can use parachute training and parachute capability (also they are trained in altitude negotiation- how to react to a situation at a certain height) as tactical measures {{to get to where}} they are needed if the 16 Air Assault Brigade need them in hills, rocky and/ or dangerous terrain that cannot be negotiated on foot or by vehicle.|$|E

5000|$|... 1981 saw the Signal Squadron re-role, retitling {{to become}} 1st Infantry Brigade Headquarters and Signal Squadron (216), losing {{much of its}} {{airborne}} status. In 1982 members of the Squadron formed part of the Operation Corporate task force to the South Atlantic. The success of the Parachute Regiment during the conflict led to the decision to reinstate the parachute role and 5th Airborne Brigade Headquarters and Signal Squadron (205) came into existence in November 1983. In December 1983 1st Infantry Brigade Headquarters and Signal Squadron (216) relinquished its airborne associations to 205 Signal Squadron and assumed the number 215. In recognition of the historical significance of the number '216' and to mark the 50th Anniversary Year of Airborne Signalling, 205 Signal Squadron was re-titled in October 1991 as 216 <b>Parachute</b> <b>Signal</b> Squadron.|$|E

50|$|Together {{with the}} {{announcement}} of the proposed establishment of the Brigade by the then Minister of Defense, Mr. P. W. Botha, in April 1978, approval was also given for the establishment of 44 Parachute Brigade, 44 Field Engineer Squadron and 44 <b>Parachute</b> Brigade <b>Signal</b> Squadron with effect from 1 January 1979. 2 and 3 Parachute Battalions were officially placed under command of 44 Parachute Brigade on 4 January 1979, and in May 1979, the Brigade became self-accounting.|$|R
50|$|In the 21st {{century the}} 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade {{comprises}} two parachute battalions, one special forces battalion, 60 Parachute Field Ambulance, 411 (Independent) Parachute Field Company (Bombay Sappers), 622 Parachute Composite Company ASC, 50th (Independent) Parachute Brigade OFP (Ordnance), 50th (Independent) <b>Parachute</b> Brigade <b>Signal</b> Company, 2 (Independent) Parachute Field Workshop Company, 1 parachute field regiment (Artillery) (9 & 17 parachute field regiments) and a provost section, an air defence battery. The President's Bodyguard also forms {{part of the}} brigade as the pathfinder company.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{original}} units of 50 Parachute Brigade, only two exist as of date, namely 411 Parachute Field Company of the Bombay Sappers, the oldest parachute {{unit of the}} Indian Army and 50 <b>Parachute</b> Brigade <b>Signal</b> Company. The original medical unit, 80 Parachute Field Ambulance was 'deparaed' and only one field ambulance, 60 Parachute Field Ambulance (now 60 Parachute Field Hospital) was retained in the airborne role. The other minor units followed suit. The Governor General's Body Guard was retained in the pathfinder role.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the Second World War (1939 - 45), {{members of}} the Royal Corps of Signals had served in every theatre of war. By {{the end of the}} war the {{strength}} of the Corps was 8,518 officers and 142,472 other ranks. In one famous episode, Corporal Thomas Waters of the 5th <b>Parachute</b> Brigade <b>Signal</b> Section was awarded the Military Medal for laying and maintaining the field telephone line under heavy enemy fire across the Caen Canal Bridge during the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{structure}} of the Battalion was five <b>Parachute</b> Companies, a <b>Signal</b> Company and a Sapper Company. In combat the companies of the battalion were to be split up into five or six man teams to lower its operational profile. As a force with special capabilities it remained under the direct command of the Kommando Landstreitkräfte (KdoLaSK) - the NVA high command.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 the Gorka Sabha had 483 members. They {{belonged to}} 14 {{regiment}}s and Corps of the Indian army as follows: 1 GR 30, 3 GR 5, 4 GR 374, 8 GR 10, 9 GR 4, 11 GR 5, Garhwal Rifles 2, Jammu and Kashmir Rifles 20, EME 4, <b>Parachute</b> regiment 5, <b>Signal</b> Regiment 3, Corps of Military police 2, and Intelligence Corps 5.|$|R
50|$|Company F {{consisted}} of a large company headquarters and operations section, three patrol platoons, a communications platoon, and a parachute rigger section. Each patrol platoon {{consisted of}} a platoon headquarters and, at full strength, six 6-man patrol teams. Company F was historically an independent company within the Michigan National Guard, but for a period during the Cold War beginning in 1983, the company was aligned with VII Corps Headquarters in Stuttgart, West Germany, where it would deploy and serve as the corps Long Range Surveillance unit {{in the event of}} a NATO-Soviet conflict in Europe. Members of Company F held military occupational specialties (MOS) in the branches Infantry, Quartermaster Corps (<b>Parachute</b> Rigger 92R), <b>Signal</b> Corps and Military Intelligence. Since it was an airborne unit, members were required to attend the Army's Basic Airborne Course at Fort Benning, GA.|$|R
5000|$|The new {{regiment}} {{was given}} the role of SHAPE Troops (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe). No.3 Squadron, 40 <b>Signal</b> Regiment, 305 (<b>Parachute</b> Brigade) <b>Signal</b> Squadron T.A., did not become part of 47 Signal Regiment (Middlesex Yeomanry) T.A. but continued in its role as the Signal Squadron to 44 Parachute Brigade, retaining its Middlesex Yeomanry cap badge and badges of rank. It was subsequently reduced to become Airhead Signal Troop, still in support of 44 Para bde but now part of 55 Signal Sqn, which also had troops in Cardiff (Port Troop) and Liverpool (Nobody knew what this troop was for). 55 Sqn was not parachute minded but the arrangement continued - including an eventful exercise in Cyprus - until 1978 when 44 Para Bde was broken up into three separate Parachute battalions: 4, 10, and 15 (Scottish). The remnants of the Airhead Troop merged with the Signal Platoon of 10 PARA (V). The CO of 10 PARA, a charming Cameronian, greeted the former OC of the Airhead Troop with the suggestion that, as he was {{to take over the}} Signal Platoon, he would need to do a training course. The former OC whose career had started in a Signals regiment in Wales and had declined through 305 Sqn to Airhead Tp, replied [...] "Yes Sir" [...] (always a good answer) [...] "What should I teach?" [...] It remains a mystery why he was not then sacked.|$|R
5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment {{is considered the}} most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected {{for their ability to}} work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, <b>parachuting,</b> combat survival, <b>signaller</b> / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|R
