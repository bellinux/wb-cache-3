It is an eloquent work of writing and deals with length on the ideal state of marriage between men and women. The treatise reveals an influence of humanist and philosophical ideas.|$|E

The placement of objects in Balinese architecture naturally plays an important role to achieve this.|$|E

25|$|Transcendentalism in the United States {{was marked}} by an {{emphasis}} on subjective experience, and {{can be viewed as}} a reaction against modernism and intellectualism in general and the mechanistic, reductionistic worldview in particular. Transcendentalism is marked by the holistic belief in an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical, and this <b>perfect</b> <b>state</b> can only be attained by one's own intuition and personal reflection, as opposed to either industrial progress and scientific advancement or the principles and prescriptions of traditional, organized religion. The most notable transcendentalist writers include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller.|$|E

Gray (synonymous with Pirobasidium sarcoides von Hoehnel). The specific epithet is derived from Greek and means [...] "fleshy, flesh-like", from σάρξ (sarx, sarc- in compounds), [...] "flesh", and the common adjectival ending -οειδής (-oeides), [...] "similar, -like".|$|E

[...] In the tradition of the Bhakti Movement, Swaminarayan and his spiritual successors began erecting mandirs to provide a means to uphold proper devotion to God on the path towards moksha, or ultimate liberation.

The <b>perfect</b> <b>state</b> of enlightenment is one without any personality, no [...] "I am" [...] conceit, no physical identification, no intellectual identification, no identification in direct or indirects terms related {{to any of the}} five skandhas, translates Peter Harvey, because [...] "a tathagata has abandoned the personality factors". The physical, the personality factors (skandhas), and any sense of Self or I are a burden which the enlightened individual has dropped, thus becoming a [...] "man of nothing", not clinging to anything internal or external.

2500|$|In the Muqaddimahs {{introductory}} remarks, Ibn Khaldun {{agrees with}} the classical republicanism of the Aristotelian proposition that man is political by nature, and that man's interdependence creates {{the need for the}} political community. [...] Yet Ibn Khaldun argues, like Thomas Hobbes later, that men and tribes need to defend themselves from potential attack by beast or even unjust men, and thus political communities are formed. [...] The glue which holds such tribes together and eventually forms [...] "royal authority" [...] or the state, according to Ibn Khaldun, is ʿasabiyyah. Ibn Khaldun argues that the best type of political community is the Caliphate or the Islamic state, and argues that the neo-Platonist political theories of al-Farabi and Ibn Sina and the [...] "perfect state" [...] (Madinatu l-Faḍīlah) are useless because God's Law, the sharia, has been revealed to take account of public interest and the afterlife. [...] The second most <b>perfect</b> <b>state,</b> Ibn Khaldun argues, is one based on justice and consideration for public welfare in this life, but not based on religious law and so not beneficial to one's afterlife. [...] Ibn Khaldun calls this state blameworthy. [...] Yet the worst type of state, according to Ibn Khaldun, is a tyranny wherein government usurps property rights and rules with injustice against the rights of men.|$|E

2500|$|The {{meaning of}} moksha differs {{among the various}} Hindu schools of thought. For example, Advaita Vedanta holds that after {{attaining}} moksha a person knows their [...] "soul, self" [...] and identifies it as one with Brahman and everyone in all respects. The followers of Dvaita (dualistic) schools, in moksha state, identify individual [...] "soul, self" [...] as distinct from Brahman but infinitesimally close, and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a loka (heaven). To theistic schools of Hinduism, moksha is liberation from samsara, while for other schools such as the monistic school, moksha is possible in current life and is a psychological concept. According to Deutsche, moksha is transcendental consciousness to the latter, the <b>perfect</b> <b>state</b> of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of [...] "realizing the whole universe as the Self". Moksha in these schools of Hinduism, suggests Klaus Klostermaier, implies a setting free of hitherto fettered faculties, a removing of obstacles to an unrestricted life, permitting a person to be more truly {{a person in the}} full sense; the concept presumes an unused human potential of creativity, compassion and understanding which had been blocked and shut out. Moksha is more than liberation from life-rebirth cycle of suffering (samsara); Vedantic school separates this into two: jivanmukti (liberation in this life) and videhamukti (liberation after death).|$|E
