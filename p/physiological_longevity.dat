40|$|We {{assess the}} causes of adult sex ratio skew in marine pelagic copepods by {{examining}} changes in these ratios between the juveniles and adults, sexual differences in juvenile stage durations, and mortality rates of adults {{in the field and}} laboratory (when free from predators). In the field, late copepodite stages (CIV and CV) commonly have sex ratios that are either not significantly different from equity (1 : 1), or slightly male biased. By contrast, in adults, these ratios are commonly significantly biased toward female dominance. Sex ratio skews are therefore primarily attributable to processes in adults. Members of the non-Diaptomoidea have especially skewed adult ratios; in the members Oithonidae and Clausocalanidae this is not generated from differences between male and female adult <b>physiological</b> <b>longevity</b> (i. e., laboratory longevity when free of predators).

It examines sex differences in the age trajectories of 14 markers of physiological functions across multiple systems and three summary indices including inflammation burden, metabolic syndrome, and allostatic load.

5000|$|The {{honey bee}} queens and workers {{represent}} {{one of the}} most striking examples of environmentally controlled phenotypic polymorphism. In spite of their identical clonal nature at the DNA level, they are strongly differentiated across a wide range of characteristics including anatomical and <b>physiological</b> differences, <b>longevity</b> of the queen, and reproductive capacity. Queens constitute the sexual caste and have large active ovaries, whereas workers have only rudimentary, inactive ovaries and are functionally sterile. The queen/worker developmental divide is controlled epigenetically by differential feeding with royal jelly; this appears to be due specifically to the protein royalactin. A female larva destined to become a queen is fed large quantities of royal jelly; this triggers a cascade of molecular events resulting in development of a queen. [...] It has been shown that this phenomenon is mediated by an epigenetic modification of DNA known as CpG methylation. Silencing the expression of an enzyme that methylates DNA in newly hatched larvae led to a royal jelly-like effect on the larval developmental trajectory; the majority of individuals with reduced DNA methylation levels emerged as queens with fully developed ovaries. This finding suggests that DNA methylation in honey bees allows the expression of epigenetic information to be differentially altered by nutritional input.|$|R

30|$|As copepods {{form the}} {{predominant}} zooplankton taxon {{in terms of}} both abundance and diversity and since they form a critical component of the estuarine trophic ecology (Baretta and Malschaert 1988; Soetaert and Rijswijk 1993; Froneman 2004), the variability in their population dynamics, in conjunction with the prevailing environmental conditions, is very much decisive in the better understanding of the seasonal dynamics of the zooplankton community in the estuarine ecosystem. Copepods, being dioecious organisms with sexually dimorphic males and females, each exhibiting prominent sex-specific differences in their <b>physiological</b> <b>longevity</b> (Rodríguez-Graña et al. 2010), growth, and mortality rates (Ohman and Hsieh 2008), the responses of individuals belonging to varied sexes to environmental variability are expected to {{play a crucial role in}} the population dynamics of the estuarine copepod community. Though there are ample studies regarding biasness from the Fischerian 1 : 1 sex ratio in the natural population of various copepod species (Moraitou-Apostolopaulou 1972; Hirst et al. 2010) and also on the factors responsible for the biasness in sex ratio (Gusmão et al. 2013), the evaluation of the influence that sex ratio has on the abundance pattern and population dynamics of the estuarine copepod community is mostly overlooked. In this context, we aimed to study the variability in sex ratio of the dominant species among the copepod community in the CE and to assess the determining role that sex ratio has on their seasonal community structure and population maintenance in a tropical monsoonal estuarine system.|$|E
40|$|Although sex ratios {{close to}} unity are {{expected}} in dioecious species, biased sex ratios are common in nature. It is essential to understand causes of skewed sex ratios in situ, as they can lead to mate limitation and have implications {{for the success of}} natural populations. Female-skewed sex ratios are commonly observed in copepods in situ. Here we discuss the challenges of copepod sex ratio research and provide a critical review of factors determining copepod sex ratios, focusing on 2 main objectives. The first is a critique of the male predation theory, which is currently the main process thought to be responsible for female-skewed sex ratios. It assumes that males have higher mortality because of increased vulnerability to predation during their search for mates. We show that there is little support for the male predation theory, that sex ratios skewed toward females occur in the absence of predation, that sex ratios are not related to predation pressure, and that where sex-skewed predation does occur, it is biased toward females. Our second objective is to suggest alternative hypotheses regarding the determination of sex ratios. We demonstrate that environmental factors, environmental sex determination and sex change have strong effects on copepod sex ratios, and suggest that differential <b>physiological</b> <b>longevity</b> of males and females may be more important in determining sex ratios than previously thought. We suggest that copepod sex ratios are the result of a mixture of factors. Australian Research Council (ARCLP 0883663) FAPESP (2012 / 20322 - 0...|$|E
40|$|The cyclopoid copepod Oithona similis {{is highly}} {{abundant}} and ubiquitous {{in the marine}} epipelagic environment, yet rates of mortality in this species have rarely been quantified; indeed we are lacking such measurements for Copepoda in general in cold waters. In the present study we examined O. similis stage structure, egg production and mortality rates across the Scotia Sea, Southern Ocean, sampling from the ice edge to the Polar Front in the austral spring of 2006, The population stage structure near the retreating ice edge was indicative of a recruitment pulse moving through the younger stages; therefore, the assumptions of the vertical life table (VLT) approach were not met and mortality was not estimated for those stations. At all other stations the assumptions of VLT were largely met, and mortality rates were determined as across-station averages, The highest rates of mortality occurred across the egg to NIT stages at around 0. 04 d(- 1), falling to < 0. 03 d(- 1) in subsequent stages, and then increasing again to 0. 11. d(- 1) across copepod stage V to adult males. The ratio of adult males to females suggested that males have a mortality rate similar to 12 times greater than females (i. e. the adult male to female abundance ratio is 0. 08). It is unlikely that these differences can be attributed simply to the males' shorter <b>physiological</b> <b>longevity</b> (longevity when free of predators); the primary cause is likely elevated predation mortality due to {{the risks associated with}} mate locating behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Bat {{biologists}} {{have long known}} about the exceptional longevity of bats (Order: Chiroptera), which is unusual for mammals of such a small size and a high metabolic rate. Yet relatively few mechanistic {{studies have focused on}} this longevity. On average, species of Chiroptera live three times longer than predicted by their body size. In addition, bats have other life history traits that are characteristic of large, long-lived mammals such as few and large offspring and slow growth rates. Bats fit the evolutionary theory of ageing, as their extended longevity is predicted by their ability to escape extrinsic mortality through flight and, in some species, hibernation. They also show tradeoffs between longevity and reproduction, as predicted by the disposable soma theory of ageing. From a <b>physiological</b> perspective, bat <b>longevity</b> reportedly correlates with replicative longevity, low brain calpain activity, and reduced reactive oxygen species production.

40|$|Underlying {{causes of}} species {{differences}} in maximum life span (MLS) are unknown, although differential vulnerability of membrane phospholipids to peroxidation is implicated. Membrane composition and longevity correlate with body size; membranes of longer-living, larger mammals have less {{polyunsaturated fatty acid}} (PUFA). We determined membrane phospholipid composition of naked mole-rats (MLS. 28. 3 years) and similar-sized mice (MLS 3 – 4 years) by gas–liquid chromatography to assess if the; 93 MLS difference could be explained. Mole-rat membrane composition was unchanged with age. Both species had similar amounts of membrane total unsaturated fatty acids; however, mice had 9 times more docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Because this n- 3 PUFA is most susceptible to lipid peroxidation, mole-rat membranes are substantially more resistant to oxidative stress than are mice membranes. Naked mole-rat peroxidation indices, calculated from muscle and liver mitochondrial membranes, concur with those predicted by MLS rather than by body size, suggesting that membrane phospholipid composition is an important determinant of longevity.

Methods: Plasma mtDNA was quantified by real-time PCR every 2 mo in 12 professional volleyball players (PVPs) during 2 consecutive seasons. As comparison, 20 healthy nonathlete male volunteers (NAs) were analyzed. Results: The authors found lower levels of mtDNA in plasma of PVPs than in NAs. However, PVPs showed a decrease of circulating mtDNA only in the first season, while no appreciable variations were observed during the second season. No correlation was observed among mtDNA, hematochemical, and anthropometric parameters.

This paper {{presents}} the life tables for sexually isolated {{males and females}} of the ''tobacco beetle", Lasioderma serricorne F., based on insects that lived in vials maintained in an incubator at 30 °C and 85 % of relative humidity, in the dark. The adults were obtained from three different cultures; the immature stages were fed on wheat flour. For each culture the females were always longer-lived than the males (P =. 01). The mean life durations for males from cultures a, b and c were respectively 23. 06, 24. 63 and 19. 66 days. Males from cultures a and b showed no statistical difference in their life duration (P =. 01). The mean life durations for females from cultures a, b, and c were respectively 33. 63, 26. 53 and 21. 18 days. Those means are statistically different (P =. 01). Males and females from cultures c were shorter lived (P =. 01) than males and females of both cultures a and b. Considering {{the fact that the}} original number of beetles from culture c (382 males and 330 females) was much larger than the original number of beetles from culture a (171 males and 157 females) or b (146 males and 184 females), we know that the density of the larval population in the culture c was higher than in the culture a or b. Competition during the larval stage must be the chief factor responsible for the shortening of the mean adult life for both sexes of L. serricorne F. from culture c as compared with the mean adult life of adults from cultures a and b, less densely populated during the larval stage. This observation agrees with the criticism of Wright, mentioned by Allee, Emerson, Park and others (1) concerning the importance of exogenous events in the pre-imaginal period of the life duration of the adults. The data show that L. serricorne F. is an excellent material for studies on <b>physiological</b> <b>longevity,</b> because the adult beetles do not feed. For toxicological studies this insect species also seems to be a very appropriate material, as it is well brought out by the survivorship curves...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{determine}} the sex-specific influence of mtDNA type (mitotype) and diet on mitochondrial functions and physiology in two Drosophila melanogaster lines.

These sex-specific influences {{may be caused by}} differences in evolutionary history and physiological functions. We predicted the influence of mtDNA mutations should be stronger in males than females {{as a result of the}} organelle's maternal mode of inheritance in the majority of metazoans. In contrast, we predicted the influence of diet would be greater in females due to higher metabolic flexibility. We included four diets that differed in their protein: carbohydrate (P:C) ratios as they are the two-major energy-yielding macronutrients in the fly diet. We assayed four mitochondrial function traits (Complex I oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species production, superoxide dismutase activity, and mtDNA copy number) and four <b>physiological</b> traits (fecundity, <b>longevity,</b> lipid content, and starvation resistance). Traits were assayed at 11 d and 25 d of age.

Also, consistent with predictions, we found that the diet influenced females more than males...|$|R
40|$|National audienceLife history theory {{predicts that}} females may adjust the {{selectivity}} expressed in mate choice as they age. Particularly {{in cases where}} time is limiting, females are expected to reduce selectivity and thereby avoid losing a terminal mating opportunity. Some evidence for this reduction {{has been found in}} vertebrates and long-lived insects, and several recent findings show that it may also exist in insects with very short adult lon-gevities. Theory also predicts that behavioural adjustments should respond to remaining <b>longevity</b> (<b>physiological</b> age) rather than chronological age, but very little information relevant to this issue exists. We studied age-related changes in mating behaviour in an acoustic moth species (Achroia grisella; Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in which females choose males based on the intensity, rhythm and other temporal features of the male song, with the objective of determining whether observed adjustments reflect chronological or physiological age. In accordance with theory, we found that females became less selective in their evaluation of male song rhythm as they aged and that this adjustment was predicted by physiological rather than chronological age. The reduction in selectivity may be due to decreased movement and searching, factors that can prevent a female from perceiving all of the male songs being broadcast locally in a complex environment where the transmission of some songs is blocked in some locations. We did not observe these age-related effects in a simpler, open environment...|$|R

In these studies we analyzed enzyme activities of ETC complexes, CI-CV and the coupled CI-CII and CII-CIII activities of mitochondria from several tissues of young, middle aged and old Ames dwarf mice and their corresponding wild type controls to identify potential mitochondrial prolongevity functions. Our studies indicate that post-mitotic heart and skeletal muscle from Ames and wild-type mice show similar changes in ETC complex activities with aging, with the exception of complex IV. Furthermore, the kidney, a slowly proliferating tissue, shows dramatic differences in ETC functions unique to the Ames mice. Our data show that there are tissue specific mitochondrial functions that are characteristic of certain tissues of the long-lived Ames mouse.

40|$|The {{mosquito}} Aedes aegypti is a {{well known}} vector of many viral diseases such as yellow fever, dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). In particular, dengue and DHF, though normally considered tropical diseases, are steadily increasing in prevalence throughout the world with cases being reported {{as far north as}} the Texas-Mexico border and in Florida. There is currently no vaccine for these diseases and vector control has proved challenging due to the urban preferences of A. aegypti. The insulin/insulin-growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway may provide an endogenous solution to vector control. In mosquitoes, the IIS {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of many <b>physiological</b> processes, including <b>longevity</b> and reproduction. Studies in several species, including Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabolitis elegans and Anopheles stephensi, have shown that decreasing insulin signaling leads to an increase in longevity [Hwangbo et al., 2004; Kimura et al., 1997]. Inversely, similar studies have shown that increasing insulin signaling results in a shortened lifespan and often an increase in reproduction [Corby-Harris et al., 2010]. Here we aimed to increase insulin signaling in the fat body of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes by creating a transgenic line that expresses an active form of Akt, a key component of the IIS, specifically in the fat body tissue. We observed the effects on longevity and reproduction in both a heterozygous and a homozygous line. However, contrary to the expected results, we observed an increase in the lifespan of heterozygous females positive for the transgene. We also observed no significant difference in the reproductive potential of heterozygous positive versus heterozygous negative females, although expression of vitellogenin was increased. This led us to consider the possibility that under these conditions insulin signaling may have been down-regulated or shut off completely, instead of being up-regulated as was expected. Further investigations need to be made into the possible causes of these results...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping {{was used}} to {{identify}} loci controlling various aspects of seed longevity during storage and germination. Similar locations for QTLs controlling different traits might be an indication for a common genetic control of such traits. For this analysis we used a new recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the accessions Landsberg erecta (Ler) and Shakdara (Sha). A set of 114 F 9 recombinant inbred lines was genotyped with 65 polymerase chain reaction-based markers and the phenotypic marker erecta. The traits analyzed were dormancy, speed of germination, seed sugar content, seed germination after a controlled deterioration test, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) treatment, and on abscisic acid. Furthermore, the effects of heat stress, salt (NaCl) stress, osmotic (mannitol) stress, and natural aging were analyzed. For all traits one or more QTLs were identified, with some QTLs for different traits colocating. The relevance of colocation for mechanisms underlying the various traits is discussed. The long-term storage of seeds, especially under unfavorable conditions, leads {{to a loss of}} viability. The nature of this physiological damage is variable, e. g. short-term deterioration in the field is different from long-term deterioration during storage, which in turn is different from mechanical damage (McDonald, 1999). All parts of the seed, such as the seed coat, which is of maternal origin and acts as a physical and chemical barrier, and the embryo are susceptible to <b>physiological</b> damage. Seed <b>longevity</b> has been related to various seed properties such as color, weight, and membrane composition. The correlation between seed longevity and these traits is often species or in some cases even variety specific (McDonald, 1999). The ability of seeds to withstand stresses that occur while stored is one aspect of seed longevity. To some extent these stresses may resemble those that occur when imbibed seeds are exposed to unfavorable conditions during germination. Very {{little is known about the}} genetic basis of differences in seed longevity because this trait is affected by environmental effects during seed formation, harvest, and storage, and is probably controlled by several genes. Only recently some studies on this complex trait have been initiated using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in crop plants like cabbage (Brassica oleracea; Bettey et al., 2000), tomato (Lycopersicon sp.; Foolad et al., 1999), rice (Oryza sativa; Cui et al., 2002; Miura et al., 2002), barley (Hordeum vulgare; Mano and Takeda, 1997), and Sorghum bicolor (Natoli et al., 2002). Arabidopsis can be a good model species for the identification of genes controlling seed longevity, because it is amenable to both classical and molecular genetic studies (Meinke et al., 1998; Page and Grossniklaus, 2002). This, combined with the multitude of publicly available molecular tools, including a complete genome sequence, implies that the cloning of genes can proceed relatively quickly in Arabidopsis. To investigate the genetics of seed viability and vigor one can identify mutants that either have improved or reduced seed longevity. Among Arabidopsis mutants that have a poor seed longevity, evidenced by their rapid loss of viability upon storage, are mutants that affect seed maturation such as leafy cotyledon 1 (lec 1), lec 2, fusca 3 (fus 3; Holdsworth et al., 1999; Finkelstein et al., 2002), and strong abscisic acid insensitive 3 (abi 3) alleles (Ooms et al., 1993). Mutants with smaller effects are weak alleles of abi 3 (Koornneef et al., 1984; Bies-Ethève et al., 1999), the aberrant testa shape (ats) mutant (Léon-Kloosterziel et al., 1994), the transparent testa (tt) mutants (Debeaujon et al., 2000), and the green seed mutant (Clerkx et al., 2003). Other sources of genetic variation can be found in naturally occurring populations. Arabidopsis is widely distributed in the world, thus encountering substantial variation in growth environments. Therefore, phenotypic variation is expected to reflect the genetic variation important for adaptation to specific environments as summarized by Alonso-Blanco and Koornneef (2000). Seed longevity and seed vigor are traits of complex nature and thus interesting to study by quantitative genetic methods. The advent of efficient molecular marker technologies and specific statistical methods in the past decade has allowed that map positions of QTLs can be established with sufficient accuracy (Alonso-Blanco and Koornneef, 2000). Mapping QTLs requires a segregating population for which a genetic map has been established and an accurate phenotyping of the trait. Immortal mapping populations such as recombinant inbred lines (RILs) are very useful because each genotype can be tested repeatedly and by applying different test systems. The latter allows studying the pleiotropic effects of loci, which are suggested by colocation of QTLs for different traits. A test commonly used to assess seed longevity is a controlled deterioration test (CDT), in which seeds are stored at high relative humidity and temperature. Tesnier et al. (2002) described such a test for Arabidopsis. Several mutants, but also different accessions, showed different responses to the applied treatments indicating the presence of genetic variation for the response to CDT (Tesnier et al., 2002). Bentsink et al. (2000) confirmed this by identifying several QTLs for survival after a CDT using a Landsberg erecta (Ler) /Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) RIL population. Quesada et al. (2002) simulated the effect of drought stress on germination by using NaCl and identified QTLs controlling this trait in the Ler/Columbia (Col) RIL population. In dry desiccation-tolerant seeds, protection of proteins and membranes during desiccation occurs by water replacement. Water molecules are replaced by sugars at the hydrogen bonding sites to preserve the native structure of proteins and the spacing between phospholipids (Hoekstra et al., 2001). Besides sugars, heat-inducible hydrophilic late-embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins might also play a role in protein and membrane stabilization by acting as molecular chaperones (Hoekstra et al., 2001). Bettey and Finch-Savage (1998) investigated the role of two subclasses of LEAs, dehydrins and small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) in B. oleracea seeds. Dehydrins did not show a positive relationship with seed performance. However, the protein HSP 17. 6 showed a positive correlation with seed performance (Bettey and Finch-Savage, 1998). Further evidence for the role of sHSPs could come from the fact that in Arabidopsis cytosolic sHSPs appear to respond to specific developmental signals associated with the acquisition of desiccation tolerance (Wehmeyer and Vierling, 2000). Seeds normally germinate in a wide range of temperatures. It seems that the major determinant of germination is the availability of water (Bewley and Black, 1994). Under stress conditions such as extreme temperatures, salt stress, and water deficit, germination is delayed or completely inhibited depending on the stress intensity and the genetic background (Foolad et al., 1999). To differentiate between loci involved specifically in germination under stress, Foolad et al. (1999) and Bettey et al. (2000) determined QTLs for speed of germination and argued that these loci are important for germination in general and are not specifically affected by stress. In the present study we analyzed the genetic control of the response to various stress treatments applied during seed storage and imbibition to investigate if tolerance to such factors has a common genetic basis. This study was performed using a newly developed RIL population derived from a cross of Ler × Shakdara (Sha). Ler originates from Poland and Sha from the Shakdara mountain range in Tadjikistan at 3, 400 m elevation (Khurmatov, 1982). Preliminary experiments indicated that Sha is one of the accessions most tolerant to various seed stresses. We were able to identify QTLs for various seed stresses viz, germination after a CDT, heat treatment and germination on NaCl, mannitol, H 2 O 2, and abscisic acid (ABA). Furthermore, QTLs were identified for seed dormancy, seed sugar content, natural aging, and germination speed. Some of these QTLs colocate, which might indicate possible common genetic regulations...|$|R
