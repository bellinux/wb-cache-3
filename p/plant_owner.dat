40|$|Manufacturing {{plants have}} a clear life cycle: they are born small, grow {{substantially}} as they age, and eventually die. Economists have long thought that this life cycle {{is driven by the}} accumulation of plant-specific knowledge, here called organization capital. Theory suggests that where plants are in the life cycle determines the size of the payments, or dividends, <b>plant</b> <b>owners</b> receive from organization capital. These payments are compensation for the interest cost to <b>plant</b> <b>owners</b> of waiting for their plants to grow. We build a quantitative growth model of the life cycle of plants and use it, along with U. S. data, to infer the overall size of these payments. They turn out to be quite large—more than one-third the size of the payments <b>plant</b> <b>owners</b> receive from physical capital, net of new investment, and more than 40 % of payments from all forms of intangible capital.

After seeing the show, Springfield Nuclear Power <b>Plant</b> <b>owner</b> Mr. Burns is so touched that he asks Smithers to hire Grimes as his Executive Vice President. However, the following day, Burns sees a sentimental story concerning a heroic dog and demands that it instead be appointed Executive Vice President. Consequently, Grimes is shuffled into Sector 7G, where he must work alongside Homer, Lenny, and Carl. Settling into his new job, Grimes is amazed and aghast at Homer's bad manners and general irresponsibility. When Grimes prevents Homer from drinking a beaker of sulfuric acid, dramatically slapping it out of Homer's hands into a wall, a passing Mr. Burns admonishes Grimes for destroying the wall and spilling his acid. Grimes is demoted and later angrily declares to Homer {{that the two of them}} are now enemies.|$|E

[...] Gutierrez did not find any commercial quality guavas in the isolated village of Tampa. The community’s main commercial activities were fishing and the shipping of Florida cattle and citrus from its small port. [...] The local economy was struggling; however, Henry <b>Plant,</b> <b>owner</b> of the Plant System and majority shareholder of the South Florida Railroad, {{was in the process of}} extending his network of railroad lines across the state, which would eventually connect Tampa directly with the rest of the U.S. rail system. Gutierrez left Tampa convinced that the area had the potential for development once the railroad was complete. Tampa would acquire its first direct rail connection to the rest of the country via a line built by the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway, which opened on February 20, 1886 and connected the Plant System at Jacksonville with the South Florida Railroad at Sanford. [...] This line would later be purchased by the Plant System in 1899.|$|E
2500|$|More specifically, the {{photovoltaic}} tariffs {{were reduced}} somewhat, {{but not enough}} to affect uptake. [...] The degression for PV was tightened from 5% to 8–10%, {{depending on the size of}} installation. [...] A new 'self-consumption incentive' granted a fixed tariff of 25.01¢/kWh for electricity consumed by a PV operator within their own house. [...] A 'flexible degression cap' was introduced, under which the degression rate could be adjusted to keep the uptake of photovoltaics within a specified corridor. [...] The support for onshore wind improved. [...] The initial tariff was raised, the repowering (when old turbines are replaced by new) bonus (Repoweringbonus) was increased, and an additional system service bonus was granted for specified technical contributions (Systemdienstleistungen or SDL), including the ability to maintain voltage if the transmission grid fails. [...] The tariff for offshore wind was raised substantially. [...] An additional 'early starter bonus' was offered for offshore wind farms entering operation before 2015. [...] In parallel to the EEG, a separate loan program of €5 billion was established, to be administered by the state-owned KfW bank, with the goal of reaching 25GW installed capacity for wind by 2030. [...] Support of biomass was also increased, with special bonuses for a number of different biomass types. [...] Biomass must also comply with specified ecological requirements to be eligible, these requirements being contained in a separate 'sustainability ordinance' (Nachhaltigkeitsverordnung or BioSt-NachV). [...] The hydroelectricity tariffs were raised considerably and particularly for micro and small power plants. [...] The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised considerably too, as was the cogeneration bonus. [...] An additional 'early starter bonus' was introduced for geothermal projects put into operation before 2016. [...] A 'green power privilege' (Grünstromprivileg) was introduced, which exempted electricity suppliers with a minimum quota of renewables from the EEG surcharge under certain circumstances. [...] New measures allowed grid operators to temporarily limit wind turbine output in times of network congestion, with compensation payable to the <b>plant</b> <b>owner</b> for lost remuneration.|$|E
