40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{evaluate}} user acceptance, educational potentials and face and construct validity of a dedicated Virtual <b>Patient</b> <b>system</b> for refugee trauma cases, designed to enhance clinical, interpersonal, social and cultural competence. Methods: We developed a Virtual <b>Patient</b> <b>system</b> portraying a female refugee - mediated by a still image and pre-recorded voice - that was evaluated by an invited group of physicians (n= 9) working as residents in Psychiatry (n= 8) and General Medicine (n= 1). The participants were invited to provide insights/feedback about the system's usefulness and its educational value. Results: Scores across our sample were high regarding the Virtual Patient system's realistic nature (median value: 5 on a 7 -point scale) {{as well as the}} Virtual Patient's ability to mirror the course of a real clinical investigation (median value: 6 on a 7 -point scale). The system was said to provide a good environment for safe training of clinical and communicative skills. The system's face and construct validity were also demonstrated. Proposed future improvements will include the implementation of detailed feedback from a Virtual Advisor and/or the Virtual Patient him/herself, the use of video-simulated patients and the ability to formulate clinical questions in free text. Conclusions: This dedicated Virtual <b>Patient</b> <b>system</b> was well received by the participants.

The first aim {{of this paper is to}} explore what factors the Norwegian population considered to be important when they filled in the entry form and selected their preferred GP. We question whether they considered the GP’s medical skill, practical matters or continuity of care, or if they felt that the opportunity set restricted their possibilities to make a choice.

The third aim of the study is to identify factors of importance as to whether people express satisfaction with their GP after the reform.

A goal of our current efforts to study virtual characters in health professions education is to develop a system that can be independently accessed and thus user satisfaction {{is an important factor in}} how readily this technology will be adopted. Twenty-three medical students participated in a study in which they interviewed a virtual patient and were asked to rate the educational value of the experience. Despite some of the limitations in this developing technology, students were generally receptive to its use as an educational tool. Further enhancements to the system, including increased fidelity of the interaction and novel feedback mechanisms, should improve learner satisfaction with and adoption of the virtual <b>patient</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|Work domain {{analysis}} (WDA) {{has been}} applied to a range of complex work domains, but few WDAs have been undertaken in medical contexts. One pioneering effort suggested that clinical abstraction is not based on means-ends relations, whereas another effort downplayed the role of bio-regulatory mechanisms. In this paper it is argued that bio-regulatory mechanisms that govern physiological behaviour must be part of WDA models of patients as the systems at the core of intensive care units. Furthermore it is argued that because the inner functioning of patients is not completely known, clinical abstraction is based on hypothetico-deductive abstract reasoning. This paper presents an alternative modelling framework that conforms to the broader aspirations of WDA. A modified version of the viable systems model is used to represent the <b>patient</b> <b>system</b> as a nested dissipative structure while aspects of the recognition primed decision model are used to represent the information resources available to clinicians in ways that support lsquoif [...] . thenrsquo conceptual relations.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} approach that enables online modification/adaptation of robot assisted rehabilitation exercises by continuously monitoring intention levels of patients utilizing an electroencephalogram (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). In particular, we use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) patterns associated with motor imagery; however, instead {{of providing a}} binary classification output, we utilize posterior probabilities extracted from LDA classifier as the continuous-valued outputs to control a rehabilitation robot. Passive velocity field control (PVFC) is used as the underlying robot controller to map instantaneous levels of motor imagery during the movement to the speed of contour following tasks. In other words, PVFC changes the speed of contour following tasks with respect to intention levels of motor imagery. PVFC also allows decoupling of the task and {{the speed of the}} task from each other, and ensures coupled stability of the overall robot <b>patient</b> <b>system.</b> The proposed framework is implemented on AssistOn-Mobile - a series elastic actuator based on a holonomic mobile platform, and feasibility studies with healthy volunteers have been conducted test effectiveness of the proposed approach.

40|$|Passive {{velocity}} field control is advantageous to deliver human-in-the-loop contour tracking rehabilitation exercises, since patients can {{be allowed to}} proceed with their preferred pace, while assistance can still be provided {{as determined by the}} therapist with ensured coupled stability. We introduce a framework based on passive {{velocity field}} control for robot assisted rehabilitation that includes prevention mechanisms against undesired slacking behavior of patients. This framework not only provides systematic approaches to prevent slacking, but also can do so while ensuring coupled stability of the overall robot <b>patient</b> <b>system,</b> a property that cannot be assured with any of the other ad-hoc slacking prevention methods. In particular, the proposed approach enables seamless on-line modification of the task difficulty, speed of contour following, and the level of assistance, while preserving passivity of the system with respect to external forces. The proposed slacking prevention schemes encourage active participation of the patients in rehabilitation protocols with even increased number of repetitions and thanks to flexibility introduced by the controller, render delivery of "repetitive tasks without repeating the same task" possible. Experiments with an haptic interface are included to demonstrate the passivity of the proposed control framework and preliminary human subject experiments with healthy volunteers are presented to validate feasibility and usability of the proposed approaches...|$|E

This is especially case with certain categories of people suffering from chronicle diseases that need 24 h access to medical care. Approach: To solve this challenging issue, a model of a system containing three levels: bionetwork, social community and primary and secondary health-care centers, was developed. The main purpose of the proposed methodology is to find the dependency of the users� health condition (obtained by bionetwork) and physical activity he/she perform (get by mobile application). To achieve this we consider datasets from the health history of users (obtained from clinical centers) and use classification algorithms on these datasets for grouping the users based on their similarity. Results: Developed model of a system which enables 24 h monitoring of the condition of patients and the possibility of sending an emergency call for sudden deterioration of his/her medical condition. In addition, the system enables the <b>patient</b> (<b>system</b> user) to contact other people with similar condition and exchange their experience.
