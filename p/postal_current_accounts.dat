40|$|Recent studies {{conclude}} that the ongoing global financial integration may have {{had little or no}} value in advancing economic growth, especially in poor countries. Capital is often found to flow "uphill" from poor to rich countries. And, when it does flow into the less developed economies, it is negatively correlated with growth, calling into question the desirability of foreign capital. In this paper we report that Europe-including the new member states of the European Union-provides a counterexample to these global anomalies. With increasing financial integration, capital in Europe has traveled "downhill" from rich to poor countries, and has done so with gathering strength. These inflows have been associated with significant acceleration of income convergence. <b>Current</b> <b>account</b> deficits;Capital inflows;Economic growth;Income distribution;current <b>account,</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance, <b>current</b> <b>accounts,</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances, capital account liberalization, capital <b>account,</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> surpluses, capital account openness, domestic growth, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> surplus, domestic savings, reserve bank, long term debt, external finance, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> imbalances, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> dynamics, global <b>current</b> <b>account,</b> external liabilities, domestic saving, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> positions, long-term debt...|$|R

This paper uses a parameterized small open economy model {{to quantify the}} role of precautionary savings in economies with {{exhaustible resources}}, when {{the only source of}} uncertainty is the price of the exhaustible resource. Results show that the precautionary motive can generate sizable external sector savings. When aggregated over the sample countries, precautionary savings in 2006 add up to 3. 2 percent of GDP. The quantitative importance of the precautionary motive varies considerably across the sample countries and is driven primarily by the weight of exhaustible resource revenues in future income.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a methodology for assessing external balance {{in countries with}} large stocks of non-renewable resources based on oil stock data, and applies it to selected oil producing countries. The methodology uses a stock approach (instead of the more traditional flow approach) to estimate the equilibrium non-oil <b>current</b> <b>account</b> consistent with optimal consumption smoothing. One {{of the benefits of}} the stock approach is that geological data for oil reserves can be used to estimate oil wealth; however, the methodology makes the estimated non-oil <b>current</b> <b>account</b> norm very sensitive to oil price projections. Based on an oil price about US$ 70 per barrel prevailing in the summer of 2007, the baseline estimates indicate that the non-oil <b>current</b> <b>accounts</b> for most of the countries in the sample are broadly in equilibrium. By the same token, using oil price projections as of the summer of 2008 implies large disparities between the equilibrium non-oil <b>current</b> <b>account</b> position and the medium term forecast for all countries in the sample except for Malaysia.

40|$|Limited {{empirical}} {{work has}} been done to the diverging <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances of the individual emerging Asian economies. Based on the intertemporal approach to <b>current</b> <b>account,</b> this paper empirically examines both the long-run and short-run impacts of initial stock of net foreign assets, degree of openness to international trade, real exchange rate and relative income on <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances for eight selected emerging Asian economies over the period 1980 - 2009, making use of the cointegrated VAR (Vector Autoregression) methodology. This paper finds that <b>current</b> <b>account</b> behaviours in emerging Asian economies are heterogeneous. Initial stock of net foreign assets and degree of openness to international trade are important factors in explaining the long-run behaviour of <b>current</b> <b>accounts.</b> Moreover, the <b>current</b> <b>accounts</b> of all sample economies have a self-adjusting mechanism except China. Short-run <b>current</b> <b>account</b> adjustment towards long-run equilibrium path is gradual, with the disequilibrium term being the main determinant of the short-run <b>current</b> <b>account</b> variations. <b>Current</b> account; Emerging Asia; Structural and macroeconomic determinants; Saving-investment balance; Cointegration...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{extends the}} {{standard}} intertemporal {{model of the}} <b>current</b> <b>account</b> to include two important stylised facts: (1) the persistence of <b>current</b> <b>account</b> positions and (2) {{the relevance of the}} fiscal balance. Specifically, the paper derives a closed form solution for consumption in the presence of habit persistence and liquidity constraints, which allows us to obtain a dynamic model for the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> where fiscal deficits have an effect. The model is estimated for a panel of 33 countries, including the ten EU acceding countries and structural <b>current</b> <b>account</b> positions are derived. A parsimonious specification including relative income, relative investment and the fiscal balance explains well past <b>current</b> <b>account</b> developments. A key finding of the paper is that, from an intertemporal perspective, <b>current</b> <b>accounts</b> in most acceding countries are currently broadly in line with their structural <b>current</b> <b>account</b> positions.

40|$|Empirical {{data shows}} that <b>current</b> <b>account</b> has the {{property}} of mean-reversion and the speed of <b>current</b> <b>account</b> convergence is heterogenous across countries. In order to explore the factors which affect the <b>current</b> <b>account</b> adjustment speed of a small country, this paper builds up a model to study how <b>current</b> <b>account</b> {{would be affected by}} factors such as labor supply and monetary policies. We found that labor market rigidity may have a significant effect, but monetary policies only have a small impact on <b>current</b> <b>account</b> adjustment...|$|R

On the {{contrary}} - if all simultaneously begin to cut down their imports {{they will have a}} decline of balance in their <b>current</b> <b>account</b> in the end.

30|$|Today {{the world}} {{aggregate}} <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances {{as a share}} of global output are twice as large as in mid- 1980 s, while the net foreign asset positions have boosted up threefold (Bracke et al. 2010). Global <b>current</b> <b>account</b> imbalance is also rising with the USA and other major developed economies running a persistent <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit against some emerging market countries with big surpluses. Notably, the 2007 US <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit has enlarged to 6  % from 2.4  % in 1998. Alike, the Eurozone <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit has widened over 4  % of GDP in 2008. This unexpected rise in <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit beyond historical standard has received a substantial attention in recent year.|$|R
40|$|We apply Fisher's (1994) {{concept of}} the {{aggregate}} generational <b>current</b> <b>account</b> to data from the Republic of Korea in the post-war era. A generation's net foreign assets is {{the present value of}} its expected net transfers from abroad, and the aggregate generational <b>current</b> <b>account</b> is the annual change in the sum of these <b>accounts</b> across all <b>current</b> and future generations. Although the conventional measure of the Korean <b>current</b> <b>account</b> shows a chronic deficit during this era, our measure indicates that expected military and economic transfers from abroad have actually created long periods of aggregate generational <b>current</b> <b>account</b> surpluses. Also, the aggregate generational <b>current</b> <b>account</b> is more volatile than the conventional <b>current</b> <b>account</b> for Korea. ...|$|R
