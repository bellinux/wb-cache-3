5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character {{is the result of the}} person's choices.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{anticipated}} that Labour would legislate for two years, then seek {{a general election}} and be returned with {{a majority of the}} seats. Were this to occur, he would be 67 when that term expired, and according to him <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> old to hold office. With no ministerial responsibilities, he departed on a three-month tour of East Africa, hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary. As the minority Labour Government attempted to grapple with the onset of the Depression, the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare, with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election, and for being too moderate. Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin, only to learn that the newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back. During the leadership crisis, Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman John Davidson to resign to relieve the pressure on Baldwin. Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} version of 1850, instead of the word 'self-annulment', Wagner used the words 'the bloody struggle of self-annihilation' - displaying a rather more aggressive approach which was <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> blatant for the more widely known figure he had become by 1869, {{the date of the}} second version.|$|E

25|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} Antilles {{catshark}} under Data Deficient, {{as there is}} little known of deepwater fishery activities within its range. It is <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> small to be captured by some types of fishing gear, though its limited distribution means any increased fishing within its habitat may merit concern.|$|E
25|$|In 480, Aeschylus {{was called}} into {{military}} service again, this time against XerxesI's invading forces at the Battle of Salamis, and <b>perhaps,</b> <b>too,</b> at the Battle of Plataea in 479. Ion of Chios was a witness for Aeschylus's war record and his contribution in Salamis. Salamis holds {{a prominent place}} in The Persians, his oldest surviving play, which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the Dionysia.|$|E
25|$|Enterprising and prolific, Robert also {{acted in}} a role {{similar to that of}} a modern-day art director, conceptualizing fashionably {{dilapidated}} gardens for several aristocratic clients, summarized by his possible intervention at Ermenonville; there he would have been working with the architect Morel for the marquis de Girardin, who was the author of Compositions des paysages (1777) and had distinct views of his own. In 1786 he began his better documented collaboration at Méréville, with his most significant patron, the financier Jean-Joseph de Laborde, who found François-Joseph Bélanger's plans too expensive and <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> formal.|$|E

25|$|The first {{definitive}} work (or {{at least}} oldest existent) on geometry in China was the Mo Jing, the Mohist canon {{of the early}} philosopher Mozi (470-390 BC). It was compiled {{years after his death}} by his followers around the year 330 BC. Although the Mo Jing is the oldest existent book on geometry in China, there is the possibility that even older written material existed. However, due to the infamous Burning of the Books in a political maneuver by the Qin Dynasty ruler Qin Shihuang (r. 221-210 BC), multitudes of written literature created before his time were purged. In addition, the Mo Jing presents geometrical concepts in mathematics that are <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> advanced not to have had a previous geometrical base or mathematic background to work upon.|$|E
25|$|Drinks {{especially}} high in simple sugars, such as {{soft drinks and}} fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration. A too rich solution in the gut draws water {{from the rest of}} the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water. Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable. Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.|$|E
25|$|The {{works of}} Asín Palacios are widely admired, {{notwithstanding}} criticism that his view point {{was of a}} Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of Islamic studies. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>too,</b> along with Louis Massignon and others, {{it can be said}} that the Professor Rev. Miguel Asín Palacios was instrumental in the open recognition by the Catholic Church of Islam as a legacy of Abraham, articulated in the Nostra aetate document of Vatican II (1962–1965).|$|E

25|$|Stonewall Jackson had {{acquired}} fame for his brilliant {{campaign in the}} Shenandoah Valley, but had performed poorly so far under Lee's command in the Seven Days. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>too</b> fatigued from his campaign and travel from the Valley, he arrived late at Mechanicsville (Beaver Dam Creek) and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night within clear earshot of the battle. He was late and disoriented at Gaines's Mill. He was late again at Savage's Station. The upcoming action in support of Lee's assault at Glendale would offer him another opportunity. Jackson and Lee met privately {{on the morning of}} June 30 at Savage's Station and Lee's exact orders were not recorded, but they apparently were for Jackson to march to White Oak Swamp and engage the Union forces there to prevent them from reinforcing the remainder of the rear guard at Glendale.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, by mid-afternoon, {{the rear}} of the column—believing the day's march to be nearly at an end—was dawdling. This {{resulted}} in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching it. At this point the Turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. The French, both soldiers and pilgrims, taken by surprise, were trapped. Those who tried to escape were caught and killed. Many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast into the canyon below. The chronicler William of Tyre, writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.|$|E
25|$|Most {{countries}} {{provide a}} variety of services to assist homeless people. They often provide food, shelter and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations (often {{with the help of}} volunteers) or by government departments. These programs may be supported by a government, charities, churches and individual donors. In 1998, a study by Koegel and Schoeni of a homeless population in Los Angeles, California, reported that a significant number of homeless do not participate in government assistance programs, and the authors reported being puzzled as to why that was, with the only possible suggestion from the evidence being that transaction costs were <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> high. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Administration have a special Section 8 housing voucher program called VASH (Veterans Administration Supported Housing), or HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans. The HUD-VASH program has shown success in housing many homeless veterans.|$|E

500|$|Tatar criticizes Bettelheim's views: [...] " [...] {{reading is}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> {{invested}} in instrumentalizing fairy tales, that is, in {{turning them into}} vehicles that convey messages and set forth behavioral models for the child. While the story may not solve oedipal issues or sibling rivalry as Bettelheim believes [...] "Cinderella" [...] does, it suggests the importance of respecting property {{and the consequences of}} just 'trying out' things that do not belong to you." ...|$|E
500|$|Farmer's {{determination}} to keep exploring forms of expression continued throughout his life. One comment on a concert given when Farmer was 67 was that [...] "his style was continuing to evolve"; he [...] "delivered several solos {{in which his}} characteristically flowing lines were interrupted by sudden, wide melodic leaps and disjunct rhythmic accents". A few months before his death, although faster numbers had become <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> challenging, The Guardian observed, Farmer's playing on slower tunes achieved {{a new level of}} emotional expression.|$|E

500|$|Mary Stuart {{thought the}} final {{conflict}} with Tom Riddle in the Chamber {{was almost as}} scary as in some of Stephen King's works, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> strong for young or timid children. She commented that [...] "there are enough surprises and imaginative details thrown in as would normally fill five lesser books." [...] Like other reviewers, she thought the book would give pleasure to both children and adult readers. According to Philip Nel, the early reviews gave unalloyed praise while the later ones included some criticisms, although they still agreed that the book was outstanding.|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the January 1802 Monthly Magazine stated, [...] "The fable or story of Thalaba is <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> marvellous: every incident is a miracle; every utensil, an amulet; every speech, a spell; every personage, a god; or rather a talismanic statue; of which destiny and magic overrule the movements, not human hopes and fears—not human desires and passions, which always must excite the vivid sympathy of men. It offers, however, scope beyond other metrical romances". The review concluded, [...] "Whatever loss of interest this poem may sustain, as a whole, by an apparent driftlessness of the vents and characters, is compensated by the busy variety, the picturesque imagery, and striking originality of the parts." ...|$|E
500|$|By mid-1848, van Hoëvell {{had become}} too {{controversial}} and <b>perhaps</b> <b>too</b> important to those who disagreed with the local government, and {{under pressure from the}} Governor-General he resigned his post on 19 July 1848. After a packed final service in the Willemskerk in August, he was sent off by [...] "half the population of Batavia"; his final sermon, based on Epistle to the Hebrews 13:18–19, suggested that he hoped to return to the Indies. Later, he characterized the Governor-General as more powerful than the Dutch king: [...] "he is the sun, at which all eyes are aimed; when he laughs, everyone laughs; if he looks serious, then the entire multitude frowns its face." ...|$|E
