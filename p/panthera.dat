5|$|Based on {{morphological}} evidence, British zoologist Reginald Pocock {{concluded the}} jaguar is most {{closely related to}} the leopard. However, DNA evidence is inconclusive and the position of the jaguar relative to the other species varies between studies. Fossils of extinct <b>Panthera</b> species, such as the European jaguar (<b>Panthera</b> gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (<b>Panthera</b> atrox), show characteristics of both the lion and the jaguar. Analysis of jaguar mitochondrial DNA has dated the species' lineage to between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago, later than suggested by fossil records.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Linnaeus {{described}} the tiger {{in his work}} Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris. In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus <b>Panthera</b> using the scientific name <b>Panthera</b> tigris.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar (<b>Panthera</b> onca) {{is a big}} cat, a feline in the <b>Panthera</b> genus, and is {{the only}} extant <b>Panthera</b> species native to the Americas. The jaguar is the third-largest feline species after the tiger and the lion, and the largest in the Americas. The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and {{northern}} Argentina. Though there are single cats now living within the western United States, the species has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar, <b>Panthera</b> onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus <b>Panthera.</b> DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and clouded leopard share a common ancestor, and that this group is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} <b>Panthera</b> just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group. The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, morphological, {{ecological}} and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely <b>Panthera</b> tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and <b>Panthera</b> tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E
5|$|P. l. europaea, {{known as}} the European lion, was {{probably}} identical with <b>Panthera</b> leo persica or <b>Panthera</b> leo spelea. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and over-exploitation. It inhabited the Balkans, the Italian Peninsula, southern France, and the Iberian Peninsula. It was a very popular object of hunting among ancient Romans and Greeks.|$|E
5|$|The tiger's closest living {{relatives}} were previously {{thought to be}} the lion, leopard and jaguar, all of which are classified under the genus <b>Panthera.</b> Genetic analysis indicates that the tiger and the snow leopard diverged from the other <b>Panthera</b> species about 2.88 million years ago, and that both species may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Onca is the Portuguese , {{with the}} cedilla dropped for {{typographical}} reasons, found in English as ounce for the snow leopard, <b>Panthera</b> uncia. It {{derives from the}} Latin lyncea lynx, with the letter L confused with the definite article (Italian lonza, Old French l'once).|$|E
5|$|P. l. youngi or <b>Panthera</b> youngi, flourished 350,000 years ago. Its {{relationship}} to the extant lion subspecies is obscure, and it probably represents a distinct species.|$|E
5|$|The lion (<b>Panthera</b> leo) {{is one of}} the big cats in the Felidae {{family and}} a member of genus <b>Panthera.</b> It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range {{countries}} declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. The West African lion population is listed as Critically Endangered since 2016. The only lion population in Asia survives in and around India's Gir Forest National Park and is listed as Endangered since 1986.|$|E
5|$|The tiger (<b>Panthera</b> tigris) is {{the largest}} cat species, most {{recognizable}} for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus <b>Panthera</b> with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled {{with the fact that}} they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.|$|E
5|$|The lion's closest {{relatives}} {{are the other}} species of the genus Panthera: the tiger, the snow leopard, the jaguar, and the leopard. Studies from 2006 and 2009 concluded that the jaguar is a sister species to the lion and the leopard is a sister taxon to the jaguar/lion clade while 2010 and 2011 studies have swapped the positions leopard and jaguar. P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the Holarctic region. It appeared in the fossil record in Europe {{for the first time}} 700,000 years ago with the subspecies <b>Panthera</b> leo fossilis at Isernia in Italy. From this lion derived the later cave lion (<b>Panthera</b> leo spelaea), which appeared about 300,000 years ago. Lions died out in northern Eurasia {{at the end of the}} last glaciation, about 10,000 years ago; this may have been secondary to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 the Iranian {{government}} {{collaborated with}} the Cheetah Conservation Fund, the IUCN, <b>Panthera,</b> United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey, to ensure that development projects do not hamper its survival, and to highlight {{the plight of the}} Asiatic cheetah. Iran declared 31August as National Cheetah Day in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (<b>Panthera</b> leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the omnivorous brown bear (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the Bluefish Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, caribou, wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E
5|$|Purring {{may have}} {{developed}} as an evolutionary advantage {{as a sign}}alling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr {{as a sign of}} contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. The cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound. It was, until recent times, believed that only the cats of the Felis genus could purr. However, felids of the <b>Panthera</b> genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, and leopard) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a survey}} in 1989–90, Tripura hosts 90 land mammal species from 65 genera and 10 orders, {{including}} such species as elephant (Elephas maximus), bear (Melursus ursinus), binturong (Arctictis binturong), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), porcupine (Artherurus assamensis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), sambar (Cervus unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), gaur (Bos gaurus), leopard (<b>Panthera</b> pardus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is {{the highest number of}} primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is extinct now. There are nearly 300 species of birds in the state.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (<b>Panthera</b> onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} <b>Panthera</b> species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E
5|$|P. l. mesopotamica or Mesopotamian lion, flourished {{during the}} Neo-Assyrian Period (approximately 1000–600 BC). It {{inhabited}} the Mesopotamian Plain where it probably represents a distinct sub-species. Nearly all ancient Mesopotamian representations of male lions demonstrate full underbelly hair in which until recently was only {{identified in the}} Barbary lion (<b>Panthera</b> leo leo) from Northern Africa and in most Asiatic lions (P. l. persica) from captivity in colder climates. Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly hair in this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Elam and ancient Persia) represent an extinct sub-species. Many of the images of these lions are derived from lion hunting sculptures so that the extinction of this sub-species likely resulted from overhunting {{in the ancient world}} (See the Cultural significance below).|$|E
5|$|The jaguar {{has been}} an American cat since {{crossing}} the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene epoch; the immediate ancestor of modern animals is <b>Panthera</b> onca augusta, which was larger than the contemporary cat. Its present range extends from Mexico, through Central America and into South America, including much of Amazonian Brazil. The countries included in this range are Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica (particularly on the Osa Peninsula), Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, the United States and Venezuela. The jaguar is now extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay. It occurs in the 400km² Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, the 5,300km² Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve in Mexico, the approximately 15,000km2 Manú National Park in Peru, the approximately 26,000km2 Xingu National Park in Brazil, and numerous other reserves throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the {{morphology}} of the cheetah differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus <b>Panthera).</b> The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull resembles that of the smaller cats. Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah. Interestingly, the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour. For example, the cheetah has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf. In the Puma lineage, the cheetah's skull morphology {{is similar to that of}} the pumaboth have short, wide skullswhile that of the jaguarundi is different.|$|E
5|$|An apex predator, Smilodon {{primarily}} hunted large mammals. Isotopes {{preserved in}} the bones of S.fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison (Bison antiquus, which was {{much larger than the}} modern American bison) and camels (Camelops) were most commonly taken by the cats there. In addition, isotopes {{preserved in the}} tooth enamel of S.gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the peccary Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia. In rare cases, Smilodon may have also targeted glyptodonts, based on a Glyptotherium skull that bears elliptical puncture marks consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth. This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor). Isotopic studies of dire wolf (Canis dirus) and American lion (<b>Panthera</b> leo atrox) bones show an overlap with S.fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa. As Smilodon migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the horses and proboscideans were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet S.populator thrived as well there as its relatives in North America. The differences between the North and South American species {{may be due to the}} difference in prey between the two continents. Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that Smilodon was a scavenger that mainly used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers.|$|E
25|$|A black panther is the melanistic color {{variant of}} any big cat species. Black panthers in Asia and Africa are leopards (<b>Panthera</b> pardus), {{and those in}} the Americas are black jaguars (<b>Panthera</b> onca).|$|E
25|$|Bengal is {{traditionally}} fixed as the typical locality for the binomen <b>Panthera</b> tigris, {{to which the}} British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the Bengal tiger in 1929 under the trinomen <b>Panthera</b> tigris tigris.|$|E
25|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, {{the decline}} of lions (<b>Panthera</b> leo) and leopards (<b>Panthera</b> pardus) {{has led to a}} {{population}} outbreak of olive baboons (Papio anubis). This case of mesopredator release has negatively impacted already declining ungulate populations and has led to increased conflict between baboons and humans as the primates raid crops and spread intestinal parasites.|$|E
25|$|The {{snow leopard}} {{is part of}} the <b>Panthera</b> lineage, one of the eight {{lineages}} of Felidae. This lineage comprises the species of <b>Panthera</b> and Neofelis. The Neofelis lineage diverged first remainder of the Felinae (see figure). Subsequent branching between the snow leopard and clouded leopard began two to three million years ago, but the details of this are disputed.|$|E
25|$|Other {{endangered}} species include the jaguar (<b>Panthera</b> onca) and the {{black-fronted piping guan}} (Pipile jacutinga).|$|E
25|$|A few predators species are: lion (<b>Panthera</b> leo), {{spotted hyena}} (Crocuta crocuta), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and serval (Leptailurus serval).|$|E
25|$|Since 2017, the IUCN recognizes P. t. altaica and {{the other}} tiger {{subspecies}} in mainland Asia as populations of <b>Panthera</b> tigris tigris.|$|E
25|$|The fertile soils of {{the delta}} {{have been subject to}} {{intensive}} human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitats for the endangered Bengal tiger (<b>Panthera</b> tigris). The forest also contains leopard (<b>Panthera</b> pardus fusca) and other smaller predators such as the jungle cats (Felis chaus), fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus), and leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis).|$|E
25|$|Species {{listed by}} the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources as {{threatened}} are the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), jaguar (<b>Panthera</b> onca) and bush dog (Speothos venaticus).|$|E
25|$|The faunal species {{reported}} {{from the park}} are giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis, elephant Loxodonta africana, aardvark Orycteropus afer, warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus, hyena Hyaena hyaena, lion <b>Panthera</b> leo, red-fronted gazelle Gazella rufifrons, waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, kob Kobus kob, topi Damaliscus lunatus, roan antelope Hippotragus equinus, impala Aepyceros melampus, vervet monkey Cercopithecus aethiops, patas monkey Erythrocebus patas, olive baboon Papio anubis, leopard <b>Panthera</b> pardus, and cheetah Acinonyx jubatus.
