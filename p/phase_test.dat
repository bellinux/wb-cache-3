The light output of the bacteria is measured using a photometer after five and 15 minutes from exposing the bacteria to the samples.

The fact that mice are naturally nocturnal animals raises a critical question of whether behavioral experiments should be strictly conducted in the dark phase and whether light <b>phase</b> <b>testing</b> is a major methodologically mistake.

40|$|The {{results of}} 2 years {{experiments}} on thermophilic single and two-phase anaerobic co-digestion process on activated sludge and agro-wastes are presented. Solid agro-waste (mainly {{fruit and vegetable}} residuals from markets) and waste activated sludge were used as substrates. A pilot scale CSTR of 200 l working volume was used for single <b>phase</b> <b>test,</b> while an 0. 8 m 3 digester was added to study two-phase experiments. Treating only wasted sludge, the initial organic loading rate (OLR) was 0. 7 kgTVS/m 3 d; then it was increased up to 2, 4 and 6 kgTVS/m 3 d by OFMSW addition. Following OFMSW increase in the feed, it was found out the increase of GPR from 0. 12 to 3. 12 m 3 /m 3 d and SGP from 0. 16 to 0. 51 m 3 /kgTVS in single phase. The stability of the process was showed also in the most critical operative conditions. Two phase experiments didn’t show important differences to the single <b>phase</b> <b>test</b> {{in the range of}} OLRs studied up to now (up to 4 kgTVS/m 3 d), clearly showing that these are not critical conditions for the process, that can be carried out in single phase in all the range studied.

40|$|Recruitment and {{retention}} {{is a major}} problem within Electrical Engineering at undergraduate level. Experience at the University of Brighton has shown that the majority of students recruited to these programmes struggle to cope with modelling and analysis of electrical circuits, which is critical to their design capability. Hence it is necessary to offer a study package of remedial input to bring them up to the standard required for progression to subsequent years. It has become progressively more difficult to achieve the required level of engagement with this study package. The problem came to a head in 2006 / 7 when most students failed to achieve a pass mark in the <b>phase</b> <b>test</b> used to gauge the success of its assimilation. Hence a programme of action was initiated to improve engagement with the study package as it was delivered, in near real-time, and to reduce the reliance of assessment upon examinations only. Computer moderated quizzes were introduced to stimulate engagement with guided reading materials very soon after those materials were delivered to the students. This new strategy gave pleasing results. The performance of the cohort on the <b>phase</b> <b>test</b> {{at the end of the}} material was very much improved. The addition of a ‘Coursework Element ’ from the quizzes gave all students a significant lift on their overall marks, and this improved their confidence and gave them encouragement throughout the remainder of the year with their application-oriented studies, which built on this material...|$|E

The robot platform used was the TraxxasTM E-Maxx RC electric mon-ster truck. gRAPI was developed to control four main components: servo, motor, range sensor, and compass sensor. gRAPI was subjected to a two-phase testing process to ver-ify its correctness and functionality.

40|$|Five {{ionic liquid}} {{stationary}} <b>phases</b> were <b>tested</b> {{for the gas}} chromatographic (GC) analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). In comparison with a non-polar DB 5 MS stationary phase, which is normally used in single-column GC for these compounds, all <b>phases</b> <b>tested</b> provided a different elution pattern. Mono-ortho substituted PCBs showed longer retention times, whereas di-ortho PCB congeners eluted earlier. These different patterns provide a potential for use of these columns for single-column PCB analysis, but in particular for use in comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC. ×. GC). The SLB-IL 111 phase showed the most striking differences in elution of PCBs compared to DB 5 MS.

30|$|The {{amount of}} {{variation}} between laboratories in this ring test is considered normal when compared with previous test results from both aerobic and anaerobic ring tests [9]. It is apparent that laboratory 3 appeared to suffer consistently lower results for the test substances {{compared to the other}} laboratories, which suggests that the sludge inoculum may have been less active. The AnBUSDiC test shows a greater degree of reproducibility than the DIN 38414 part 8 and ISO 11734 anaerobic methods [4, 5, 9]. Issues during the DIN 38414 part 8 test with unspecific sludge degradation leading to degradation values over 100 % were to a large extent solved with the two <b>phase</b> <b>test</b> design of the AnBUSDiC test. However, mean degradation values of over 100 % were still encountered in the second test phase with FA+ 7 EO and FAS, albeit to a lesser extent. The 1 st phase addition of test substance appears to have released most of the organic carbon ‘trapped’ in the sludge (via the solubilising action of the surfactant test item), the two phase design was implemented to reduce this unspecific degradation during the second phase addition (however, some still occurs) [5]. Using a two-phase addition of test substance (rather than three dosings) was deemed a compromise between the test length and the potential to overestimate test substance degradation. It was therefore expected that highly degradable test substances would display values close to or over 100 %; however, values in some tests did exceed 120 %. When developing the AnBUSDiC test {{it was clear that the}} two <b>phase</b> <b>test</b> did not totally eliminate the release of organic carbon from the sludge during the second addition; however, values over 120 % were not expected anymore.|$|E
