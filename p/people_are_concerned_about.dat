5000|$|In {{addition}} to {{concerns about the}} physical reproduction of community members, indigenous <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> how environmental contamination impacts the reproduction of cultural knowledge. In Aamjiwnaang, oral traditions once passed down from grandfathers during fishing or grandmothers during berry picking and medicine gathering are being lost as those activities are no longer practiced {{because of concerns about}} these foods being contaminated. Rocks once used for sweat lodges are no longer being collected from local streams because the streams have become contaminated. The cedar used for making tea, smudging, and washing babies contains vanadium at concentrations as high as 6 mg/kg..., reflecting local releases to air of > 611 tons of vanadium between 2001 and 2010.... At Akwesasne, community members report a loss of language and culture around subsistence activities like fishing, which have been largely abandoned because of fears of exposure to contaminants.|$|E

Ontario politician George Smitherman criticized the study and the Ontario Mental Health Foundation for funding the project, because the study subjects would receive money for agreeing to participate ($60 Canadian).Seto responded that he was unsurprised the study has generated controversy. He said [...] "I do understand why <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> this, but I hope they don't {{lose sight of the fact}} that we're doing this research to understand pedophilia and sexual offending," [...] and that it is standard practice to pay people to take part in clinical studies.

Ron Suskind noted in his book, The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11 (2006), that Zubaydah was mentally ill or disabled due to a severe head injury. He described Zubaydah as keeping a diary [...] "in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3"—a boy, {{a young man and}} a middle-aged alter ego. Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail [...] "what he ate, or wore, or trifling things people said." [...] Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, [...] "This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality." [...] According to Suskind, this judgment was [...] "echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President."

5000|$|Humans vs. Zombies {{games have}} at times come under {{scrutiny}} by concerned members of communities {{in and around}} colleges. Many colleges have banned the game outright due to concerns about gun violence. Goucher College and other universities playing the game came under particular scrutiny after the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007; reporter Laura Wexler of The Washington Post stated that since the games are occurring {{in the midst of}} several shootings, [...] "has been a heightened sensitivity and fear, and desire to prevent such occurrences. The reaction may not be completely rational, but it is understandable". For instance, Alfred University was locked down on April 8, 2008 after reports that a young man was carrying a gun around before police determined the gun was a toy and the student was a participant in a Humans vs. Zombies game. Goucher college president Sanford J. Ungar released a statement saying:It is unfortunate that the latest round of [...] "Humans vs. Zombies" [...] was playing itself out {{on the day of the}} events at Virginia Tech, and it is true that the student organizers of the game must be more vigilant about keeping it from interfering with classes and disrupting the daily lives of those who would prefer not to be involved in it. We are working with them to assess the game and its future at Goucher.In response to these complaints, game moderator Max Temkin said, [...] "It's unfortunate that people feel threatened at Goucher[...] [...] If <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> their well-being, they should probably go to Public Safety and report the nature of their concern.

5000|$|In a BBC {{interview}} Bowler {{complained that}} he and other expert historians had been [...] "duped" [...] into participating in an [...] "anti-Darwinian" [...] film presenting a historically distorted portrait of Darwin without realising it was being produced by a creationist organisation.

In the same interview, Philip Bell, CEO of Creation Ministries UK, stated that his organisation had established a [...] "front company" [...] called Fathom Media for the purposes of approaching experts such as Bowler, who would not agree {{to take part in the}} film if they realised it was an [...] "overtly Creationist" [...] production. [...] "At the end of the day," [...] he said, [...] "when people see 'Creationist', instantly the shutters go up and that would have shut us off from talking to the sort of experts, such as Professor Bowler, that we wanted to get to."

50|$|The private {{residential}} property prices {{has increased by}} 19% from September 2009 to September 2010, this phenomenon is attributable to the progressive economic recovery, low interest rate environment and the relatively tight supply of private residential flats {{in the past few}} years. The mortgage-to-income ratio in the second quarter was 41%, though it was lower than the average ratio of 53% over the past 20 years. This figure reveals the concern of the public on the recent increase on property prices. As the price of housing property in Hong Kong is skyrocketing, the amount of available mass market flats at affordable prices and overall supply of land for flat production in the long term is worrying. The Transport and Housing Bureau (THB) conducted a series of public consultations. Opinions on whether to subsidize home ownership were collected from May to 17 September 2010. Stakeholders and members of the public engage through different channels to look at matters related to the subject, in order to identify a way that can reassure concerns of the public.The outcome of the public consultation showed that a lot of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the rise in property prices and the difficulties in purchasing their first flat.The Hong Kong Government recognizes the importance of home ownership to the public. It is the common will of the people to secure a stable home and to improve their quality of life. The Legislative Council of Hong Kong is of the view that the Government should introduce measures to help the sandwich class purchase their own flats, regarding the high property price. It is asserted that providing relief measures to sandwich class home buyers to give them time to save up is suitable. As a result, the Government, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), will introduce My Home Purchase Plan.|$|E

Social media has accustomed them to watching and being watched. Albrechtslund (2013) describes this type of surveillance as "participatory surveillance", where people willingly keep watch on each other through social media. An anonymous focus group and online survey of 80 Australians aged between 18 and 34 investigated their use of participatory surveillance, that is, of their surveillance techniques on others and their awareness {{of the level of}} surveillance they themselves are under.

40|$|Why {{do people}} support tough {{sentencing}} of criminal offenders? Three explanations dominate the literature. The first is an instrumental perspective: <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> becoming {{a victim of}} crime and they look to punishment to reduce future harm. The second is a relational perspective: <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> community breakdown, and they support punishment to restore moral boundaries. The third is a psychological model based on ideological preferences: people desire conformity and authority in society, and they look to institutions to punish transgressions that threaten collective security. Building {{on the work of}} Tyler & Boeckmann (1997), two studies of London citizens (n 1 = 13, 929, n 2 = 283) suggest a way of integrating these three perspectives. We show that right-wing authoritarianism predicts both the extent to which people worry about social threats {{and the extent to which}} they support harsh punitive measures. Bridging research from political psychology and criminology, we conclude with the idea that popular punitive sentiment is grounded in an uncritical submission to authorities, an adherence to conservative moral values, and consonant concerns about collective security and cohesion...|$|E
