However, most existing ecological economy studies use physical trade balance (PTB) directly or use <b>physical</b> <b>imports</b> and exports individually to analyze national material metabolization. Neither the individual analysis of <b>physical</b> <b>imports</b> and exports nor the direct analysis of PTB is capable of portraying the comprehensive contributions of a certain product to total physical trade. This study introduced an indicator, i. e., the physical contribution to the trade balance (PCB), which evolved from the traditional index of contribution to the trade balance (CB). In addition, trade balance (TB), PTB, CB, and PCB were systematically related and combined. An analysis was conducted using the four tools to obtain overall trade trends in China. This study discovered that both physical trade value and quantity exhibited different characteristics when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2002 and experienced the global economic crisis in 2009. Finally, the advantages of a supporting policy decision by applying multiple analytical tools to physical trade were discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel {{study on the}} historical evolution of socioeconomic metabolism of biomass in Jamaica {{in the context of}} trade and national food security. The goal {{of this study was to}} provide empirical insight into the structure of Jamaica biomass system by analyzing biomass material flows (domestic extraction, imports, and exports) from 1961 to 2013, and on this basis establish a link to the issue of national food security in Jamaica. A biomass material database in time series was constructed for Jamaica based on Eurostat methodological guidelines and general principles of economy-wide material flow account and analysis (EW-MFA). The constructed database allowed for the characterization of biomass production and consumption using the calculated material flow indicators- domestic extraction (DE), domestic consumption (DMC) and physical trade balance (PTB). The degree of import dependency was also calculated. To establish a link between patterns of biomass metabolism, trade and national food security, the scope of MFA was expanded to conduct a time series analysis of national food availability and progress towards food self-sufficiency based on analysis of dietary energy supply (DES) and dietary energy production (DEP) in Jamaica. Results obtained revealed a declining trend in both metabolic scale and metabolic rate of biomass use in Jamaica. MFA calculated indicators showed two alternating phases of growth and decline in the evolution of biomass use- peak growth (1966 and 1996) and steep decline (1981 and 2006). Primary crops dominated DE (48 %) and DMC (47 %). Cereals (74 %) dominated <b>physical</b> <b>imports</b> flows and export flows were dominated by sugar cane (76 %). Jamaica agro-food system is characterized by export oriented production as the share of mainstay food crops in overall primary crop extraction was less than 10 %. A high food Import dependency ratio was observed. Food energy availability has significantly improved since 1961 from 1740 kcal/cap/day to 2470 kcal/cap/day in 2013. Jamaica is yet to achieve food self-sufficiency as DEP remains critically below the minimum dietary energy requirement threshold for Jamaica. This study contributes to the growing body of research on material flow analysis and socioeconomic metabolism. It offers a starting point for methodological enhancement of the MFA framework towards adapting it for food security studies...|$|E

We show that the Tolman-Ehrenfest effect (in a stationary gravitational field, temperature is not constant in space at thermal equilibrium) can be derived very simply by applying the equivalence principle to a key property of thermal time: at equilibrium, temperature is the rate of thermal time with respect to proper time - the `speed of (thermal) time'.

40|$|Hydrogeological {{systems are}} earth systems {{influenced}} by water. Their behaviors {{are governed by}} interacting processes, including flow of fluids, deformation of porous materials, chemical reactions, and transport of matter and energy. Here, coupling among three of these processes is considered: flow of water, heat, and deformation, {{each of which is}} represented by a diffusion-type of partial differential equation. One side of the diffusion-type equation relates to motion of matter or energy, while the other relates to temporal changes of state variables at a given location. The coupling arises from processes that govern motion as well as those that relate to change of state. In this work, attention is devoted to coupling arising from changes in state. Partial derivatives of equations of state constitute the capacitance terms of diffusion-type equations. Of the many partial derivatives that are mathematically possible in physical systems characterized by several variables, only a few are physically significant. Because the state variables are related to each other through an equation of state, the partial derivatives must collectively satisfy a closure criterion. This framework offers a systematic way of developing the coupled set of equations that govern hydrogeological systems involving the flow of water, heat, and deformation. Such systems are described in terms of four variables, and the associated partial derivatives. The <b>physical</b> <b>import</b> of these derivatives are discussed, followed by a description of partial derivatives that are of practical interest. These partial derivatives are then used as the basis to develop a set of coupled equations. A brief discussion is presented on coupled equations from a perspective of energy optimization. 1...|$|R

The fact that these objectives may be reinforcing or conflicting has made a critical difference in the choice of tariff rates across commodities and over time. Another interesting feature of prewar tariffs is that most import duties were specific, charging a nominal amount of domestic currency per <b>physical</b> unit <b>imported.</b> Existing historical accounts focus on dates of legislative change and miss the cyclical variation in tariff rates that results from the impact of changing prices on the real value of specific duties. These price effects are quantitatively important during the 1900 to 1940 period. For example, the Fordney-McCumber Act of 1922 which has been interpreted as very protectionist simply corrected the erosion of real tariff rates occurring during the inflation of World War I. The opposite is true of the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act; the deflation of the 1930 s added considerably to the legislated increases.

Although mtDNA mutations {{have been identified}} in many patients, there are currently no effective treatments. A number of human diseases result from mutations in mtDNA-encoded proteins, a group of proteins that are hydrophobic and have multiple membrane-spanning regions. One method that has great potential for overcoming the pathogenic consequences of these mutations is to place a wild-type copy of the affected gene in the nucleus, and target the expressed protein to the mitochondrion to function in place of the defective protein. Several respiratory chain subunit genes, which are typically mtDNA encoded, are nucleus encoded in the chLorophyte algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Polytomella sp. Analysis of these genes has revealed adaptations that facilitated their expression from the nucleus. The nucleus-encoded proteins exhibited diminished <b>physical</b> constraints for <b>import</b> as compared to their mtDNA-encoded homologues.

The details of a small-scale model can have large impact on the flow on larger scales, and upscaling is therefore {{an essential part of}} reservoir modeling. We consider upscaling on the field-scale, investigate the balance of forces during the water-ooding of a reservoir, and use this to asses the applicability of different upscaling methods, and in particular steady- state methods. Two novel upscaling methods based on the steady-state assumption are suggested, and a comparison study is performed between different methods through realistic field-scale simulations. Established two-phase upscaling techniques are also extended to include polymer properties. As an alternative to upscaling, we also consider the application of a multiscale method to run polymer flooding simulations more efficiently.

The DHS and USDA are required to cooperate with each other for proper regulation and inspection practice.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Image sharing {{technologies}} {{may reduce}} unneeded imaging by improving provider access to imaging information. A systematic review and meta-analysis {{were conducted to}} summarize the impact of image sharing technologies on patient imaging utilization. METHODS: Quantitative evaluations {{of the effects of}} PACS, regional image exchange networks, interoperable electronic heath records, tools for <b>importing</b> <b>physical</b> media, and health information exchange systems on utilization were identified through a systematic review of the published and gray English-language literature (2004 - 2014). Outcomes, standard effect sizes (ESs), settings, technology, populations, and risk of bias were abstracted from each study. The impact of image sharing technologies was summarized with random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression models. RESULTS: A total of 17 articles were included in the review, with a total of 42 different studies. Image sharing technology was associated with a significant decrease in repeat imaging (pooled effect size [ES] = - 0. 17; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = [- 0. 25, - 0. 09]; P <. 001). However, image sharing technology was associated with a significant increase in any imaging utilization (pooled ES = 0. 20; 95 % CI = [0. 07, 0. 32]; P =. 002). For all outcomes combined, image sharing technology was not associated with utilization. Most studies were at risk for bias. CONCLUSIONS: Image sharing technology was associated with reductions in repeat and unnecessary imaging, in both the overall literature and the most-rigorous studies. Stronger evidence is needed to further explore the role of specific technologies and their potential impact on various modalities, patient populations, and settings...|$|R
40|$|The task of {{managing}} hydrogen entry into elevated temperature structural materials employed in turbomachinery {{is a critical}} engineering area for propulsion systems employing hydrogen or decomposable hydrocarbons as fuel. Extant structural materials, such as the Inconel series, are embrittled by the ingress of hydrogen in service, leading {{to a loss of}} endurance and general deterioration of load-bearing dependability. Although the development of hydrogen-insensitive material systems is an obvious engineering option, to date insensitive systems cannot meet the time-temperature-loading service extremes encountered. A short-term approach that is both feasible and technologically sound is the development and employment of hydrogen barrier coatings. The present project is concerned with developing, analyzing, and physically testing laminate composite hydrogen barrier systems, employing Inconel 718 as the structural material to be protected. Barrier systems will include all metallic, metallic-to-ceramic, and, eventually, metallic/ceramic composites as the lamellae. Since space propulsion implies repetitive engine firings without earth-based inspection and repair, coating durability will be closely examined, and testing regimes will include repetitive thermal cycling to simulate damage accumulation. The target accomplishments include: generation of actual hydrogen permeation data for metallic, ceramic-metallic, and hybrid metallic/ceramic composition barrier systems, practically none of which is currently extant; definition of <b>physical</b> damage modes <b>imported</b> to barrier systems due to thermal cycling, both transient temperature profiles and steady-state thermal mismatch stress states being examined as sources of damage; and computational models that incorporate general laminate schemes as described above, including manufacturing realities such as porosity, and whatever defects are introduced through service and characterized during the experimental programs...|$|R
40|$|Global biomass {{potentials}} are considerable but unequally distributed {{over the}} world. Countries with Kyoto targets could import biomass {{to substitute for}} fossil fuels or invest in bio-energy projects {{in the country of}} biomass origin and buy the credits (Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI)). This study analyzes which of those options is optimal for transportation fuels and looks for the key variables that influence the result. In two case studies (Mozambique and Brazil), the two trading systems are compared for the amount of credits generated, land-use and associated costs. We found costs of 17 – 30 euro per ton of carbon for the Brazilian case and economic benefits of 11 to 60 euros per ton of carbon avoided in the Mozambique case. The impact of carbon changes related to direct land-use changes was found to be very significant (both positive and negative) and can currently only be included in emission credit trading, which can largely influence the results. In order to avoid indirect land-use changes (leakage) and consequent GHG emissions, it is crucial that bioenergy crop production is done in balance with improvements of management of agriculture and livestock management. Whatever trading option is economically most attractive depends mainly on the emission baseline in the exporting (emission credit trading) or <b>importing</b> (<b>physical</b> trading) country since both bio- and fossil fuel prices are world market prices in large scale trading systems where transportation costs are low. Physical trading could be preferential since besides theGHGreduction one could also benefit from the energy. It could also generate considerable income sources for exporting countries. This study could {{contribute to the development of}} a methodology to deal with bio fuels for transport, in Emission Trading (ET), CDM and the certification of traded bio fuels...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{opportunities}} and problems created for an oil economy by the price rise of 1973 with a special reference to Iran, and it is, {{as far as the}} author is aware, the first study to analyse the socio-economic performance of the Shah's regime in the subsequent period. We studied the Government's policies in the use of oil revenues, stressing the failure to pursue productive and social goals which would have been feasible. The data employed are based mainly on the Government budget, supplemented by figures on trade, national income, prices, employment, etc. The study includes two conceptual chapters, and the rest is empirical. The conceptual chapters argue that the opportunities provided by oil cannot last for ever; an oil economy should gradually diversify output and exports 'out of' this exhaustible resource, specialisation in which involves risks. We envisage diversification in a novel sense, as a dynamic concept interrelated with oil price and depletion policies, as a part of general development strategy. The economy may first go 'into' oil to raise revenues with the intention of diversifying 'out of' it in the long run. The revenues should be spent on accelerating the growth of non-oil GDP, paying due attention to basic needs. Development is the ultimate aim, diversification is the result; it is also the means through which development takes place. Developing the Kalecki approach to explain problems of acceleration of growth in an oil economy, we hypothesise that while the OPEC agreement raises the means toÂ· diversification, its achievement is limited by i) various 'physical bottlenecks', and ii) institutional factors. Iran's experience shows that Kalecki over-stressed the role of imports in accelerating growth and combating inflation. Even where foreign exchange is ample, an increase in the rate of growth could nevertheless be limited by the <b>physical</b> capacity for <b>imports,</b> the shortage of skilled labour, the lack of infrastructure, and the ceiling on the rate of growth of 'supply determined' commodities, particularly non-tradeable inputs and agricultural goods. Moreover, a mixture of demand-pull and cost-push inflation may arise as a result of imbalances in both the commodity and labour markets. At the same time, given a strong exchange rate made possible by oil, inflation would reduce the competitiveness of non-oil exports in foreign markets. Outlining a socio-economic frameworkfor Iran, we showed also that both the pace of development and the pattern of distribution of its benefits were adversely affected by Government policies. Oil made the role of the Government in the Iranian economy more decisive than in many socialist countries; but the objectives of the Government diverged from the aspirations of the masses. Its various policies exacerbated shortages and inflation, and they were also responsible for the slow growth of agriculture. In particular, a large diversion of public expenditures to 'nonproductive' uses, together with a rapid expansion of private consumption and investment in housing, limited the supply of physical resources to productive sectors. Further, Government policies biased the distribution of social services and private consumption heavily in favour of a minority 'governmental class'; and 'despotism' was intensified through militarism. The bias against Â·rural areas too was pronouncede The study indicates that the factorial distribution of income changed in favour of profit earners owing to the increase in the 'degree of monopoly', as hypothesised by Kalecki and Riach. The results of Government policies were fast depletion of oil, yet disappearance of the surplus in the balance of payments. Economic failure accompanied by social frustration led to the collapse of the regime, leaving the economy more than ever dependent on oil and imports of necessities. One conclusion is that the new regime would be well advised to aim at a strategy of slower economic growth associated with a slower rate of depletion; this allows more time to remove the structural bottlenecks. </p...|$|R
