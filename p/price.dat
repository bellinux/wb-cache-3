5|$|When the <b>price</b> {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is relatively inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in <b>price.</b> Hence, when the <b>price</b> is raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the <b>price</b> elasticity of demand for the good.

If demand is <b>price</b> inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect <b>price.</b> These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
