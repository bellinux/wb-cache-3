25|$|Aix-en-Provence {{was part}} of Marseille-Provence 2013, the year-long {{cultural}} festival when the region served as the European Capital of Culture. Aix hosted several major cultural events including {{one half of the}} Grand Atelier du Midi gala exhibition and an episode of the Révélations <b>pyrotechnical</b> performance. The city also unveiled major new cultural infrastructure to coincide with Marseille-Provence 2013, including the Darius Milhaud Conservatory designed by Kengo Kuma.|$|E

The city hosted a segment of the opening ceremony with a <b>pyrotechnical</b> performance by Groupe F on the banks of the Rhône. It also unveiled the new wing of the Musée Départemental Arles Antique as part of Marseille-Provence 2013.|$|E

500|$|Three {{different}} teams {{handled the}} three {{different types of}} special effects used in the film. Nick Allder was placed in charge of mechanical and <b>pyrotechnical</b> effects, Nick Dudman was placed in charge of 'creature' effects and Mark Stetson headed the visual effects team. Visual effects company Digital Domain was hired for the film, and Karen Goulekas was given the role of digital effects supervisor. Alias, Autodesk Softimage, Arete, Side Effect's Prisms, RenderMan, as well as in-house software, were used by Digital Domain to create effects. Some individual shots used a combination of live action, scale models, computer-generated imagery and particle systems. [...] The lanes of traffic in the scenes in New York City were created with particle systems: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" [...] is the second-most {{performed}} {{song from}} the album. The live performance is often accompanied by lasers, <b>pyrotechnical</b> effects and film screens. [...] "Battery" [...] is usually played {{at the beginning of}} the setlist or during the encore, accompanied by lasers and flame plumes. [...] "Disposable Heroes" [...] is featured in the video album [...] (2009) filmed in Mexico City, in which the song was played on the second of three nights at the Foro Sol. [...] "Orion" [...] is the least-performed {{song from the}} album. Its first live performance was during the Escape from the Studio '06 tour, when the band performed the album in its entirety, honoring the 20th anniversary of its release. The band performed the album in the middle of the set. [...] "Battery", [...] "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)", [...] "Damage, Inc." [...] and the full-length [...] "Master of Puppets" [...] were revived for the band's concerts in 1998 and 1999, after having been retired for a number of years.|$|E
500|$|Production {{began in}} February 2007 in South Africa, where the {{majority}} of filming took place. South Africa was chosen as a primary filming location for economic reasons, costing a third of estimated production in the United Kingdom. Shooting in South Africa lasted 56 days out of 66 days, with the remaining ten taking place in Scotland. Marshall said of South Africa's appeal, [...] "The landscape, the rock formations, I thought it was about as close to Scotland as you're likely to get, outside of Ireland or Wales." [...] In Scotland, secondary filming took place in the city of Glasgow, including Haghill in the city's East End, and at Blackness Castle in West Lothian, the latter chosen when filmmakers were unable to shoot at Doune Castle. The entire shoot, involving thousands of extras, included a series of complex fight scenes and <b>pyrotechnical</b> displays. The director sought to minimise the use of computer-generated elements in Doomsday, preferring to subscribe to [...] "old-school filmmaking". In the course of production, several sequences were dropped due to budgetary concerns, including a scene in which helicopter gunships attacked a medieval castle.|$|E
500|$|Solo {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Andrew Liengard of Jazz Houston stated that Rubalcaba played [...] "at once a <b>pyrotechnical</b> and thunderous two-handed assault, he also demonstrates a profound awareness {{of space and}} dynamics," [...] and finally called the album [...] "stunning". Joey Guerra of Amazon said that Solo [...] "finds Rubalcaba soaring {{on the strength of}} his own talent", creating a [...] "unique experience." [...] Website Allmusic stated that the album is a spellbinding collection of improvisations with [...] "remarkable stylistic display." [...] Harvey Siders of JazzTimes commented that the album did not need elaborate arrangements, being a [...] "spontaneous inner dialogue from a brilliant inquisitive mind" [...] and that on Solo [...] "elegance trumps excitement." [...] PopMatters Robert R. Calder stated that the record was [...] "a very remarkable solo piano recital." [...] David Miller of All About Jazz gave the album a mixed review, being critical of the entertainment value, stating that the performer [...] "is more introspective than ever, frequently using silence as his means of expression. The only problem is, it doesn't necessarily work." [...] Miller also suggested that [...] "Rubalcaba should develop his ideas in more conventional settings. He still has time to become a great solo artist, and this writer has every confidence that he will." [...] In a separate review, Jim Santella, also of All About Jazz, praised Solo, commenting that Rubalcaba [...] "finds space in his exploratory interpretation for dreamy soliloquies, but the excitement is all there, and it's powerful. The pianist makes us wait for this moment, and it's always worth the anticipation. Ultimately he lights an inspiring fire." [...] Mark Corroto, in a third review of the album by All About Jazz, compared Rubalcaba's work to fellow Cuban artist Bebo Valdés, asseverating that both performers [...] "blurred the lines between jazz, classical and folk, easily convincing you there need be no distinction." [...] Timothy Sprinkle of Jazz Review declared that the performer [...] "carries the disc with a light, breezy ease that's surprising, especially given all of the slow selections." ...|$|E

Shatner is involved in the American Tinnitus Association. His treatment for this condition involved wearing a small electronic device that generated a low-level, broadband sound (white noise) that [...] "helped his brain put the tinnitus in the background" [...] – a process known as habituation.|$|E
2500|$|Three of {{the four}} B-1A prototypes {{featured}} a single crew escape capsule for the crew members. For the fourth prototype and for the B-1B, this was changed to use conventional ejection seats. One source gives the reason [...] "due to concerns about servicing the <b>pyrotechnical</b> components of the system," [...] while another says this was done [...] "to save cost and weight." [...] On August 29, 1984, B-1A prototype #2 crashed and the capsule was ejected at low altitude. The parachute deployed improperly {{and one of the}} three crew died.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characters}} in The Sorcerer have family names that characterise them. Pointdextre is French for dexter point, a heraldic term; Sangazure is French for blue blood. Partlet means hen. [...] The two characters sing a duet, [...] "Welcome, joy, adieu to sadness!" [...] that contrasts and combines a [...] "Mozart-like minuet" [...] and rapid-fire patter. [...] Other musical numbers that characterise the opera are the quintet in Act II, [...] "I rejoice that it's decided", which is [...] "one of the prettiest things Sullivan ever {{wrote in the}} Mendelssohnian manner ... while in the duet that follows between Mr. Wells and Lady Sangazure there is a divertingly sepulchral andante and a no less comic tarentello-like allegro". [...] The Sorcerer has certain technical difficulties in its production. [...] It is the only Savoy opera to require trap, which many modern theatres do not have, and requires a <b>pyrotechnical</b> effect for a flash in the incantation scene.|$|E
60|$|And so {{the history}} of that mine became once more plunged in darkness, lit only by some monster <b>pyrotechnical</b> {{displays}} of gossip. And perhaps the most curious feature of the whole matter is this: {{that we should have}} dwelt in this quiet corner of the mountains, with not a dozen neighbours, and yet struggled all the while, like desperate swimmers, in this sea of falsities and contradictions. Wherever a man is, there will be a lie.|$|E
60|$|Nature {{and fortune}} had vied {{with one another}} in heaping on Ivor Lombard all their choicest gifts. He had wealth and he was {{perfectly}} independent. He was good looking, possessed an irresistible charm of manner, and was the hero of more amorous successes than he could well remember. His accomplishments were extraordinary for their number and variety. He had a beautiful untrained tenor voice; he could improvise, with a startling brilliance, rapidly and loudly, on the piano. He was a good amateur medium and telepathist, and had a considerable first-hand knowledge of the next world. He could write rhymed verses with an extraordinary rapidity. For painting symbolical pictures he had a dashing style, and if the drawing was sometimes a little weak, the colour was always <b>pyrotechnical.</b> He excelled in amateur theatricals and, when occasion offered, he could cook with genius. He resembled Shakespeare in knowing little Latin and less Greek. For a mind like his, education seemed supererogatory. Training would only have destroyed his natural aptitudes.|$|E
6000|$|I snatch a {{few moments}} from my arduous labors to reply. The Colorado {{has been on the}} biggest boom I have seen since '39. In the <b>pyrotechnical</b> and not {{strictly}} grammatical language of the Statesman--"The cruel, devastating flood swept, on a dreadful holocaust of swollen, turbid waters, surging and dashing in mad fury which have never been equalled in human history. A pitiable sight was seen the morning after the flood. Six hundred men, out of employment, were seen standing {{on the banks of the}} river, gazing at the rushing stream, laden with débris of every description. A wealthy New York Banker, who was present, noticing the forlorn appearance of these men, at once began to collect a subscription for them, appealing in eloquent terms for help for these poor sufferers by the flood. He collected one dollar, and five horn buttons. The dollar he had given himself. He learned on inquiry that these men had not been at any employment in six years, and all they had lost by the flood was a few fishing poles. The Banker put his dollar in his pocket and stepped up to the Pearl Saloon." ...|$|E

50|$|The R-23 cannon has an {{automatic}} charging mechanism that fires the cannon {{in case of}} a misfire. When one of the two <b>pyrotechnical</b> cartridges is fired, a small bolt inside that cartridge is accelerated to penetrate the side wall of the R-23 cartridge. The hot propellant gases of the <b>pyrotechnical</b> cartridge follow the bolt into the dud R-23 cartridge and ignite the propellant charge to fire the round. This unique and curious mechanism was used in the R-23 cannon for the first time. The same kind of mechanism with a single <b>pyrotechnical</b> cartridge was later incorporated into the 30 mm GSh-301 aircraft cannon.|$|E
