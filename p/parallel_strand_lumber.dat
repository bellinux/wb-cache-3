The I- 77 / 51 clone had better properties and was found to be more suitable for PSLs manufacturing compared to the I- 214 clone. PSLs properties were higher than those of solid woods (SWs) and laminated veneer lumbers (LVLs) of the same poplar clones. This increase may be due to materials, densification as a result of high pressure use, and the manufacturing techniques. The degree of contribution of SWs properties to the PSLs properties was lower than that of LVLs. This indicated that factors other than SWs properties played more important roles in the strength increase of PSLs...|$|R
30|$|As a {{promising}} wood substitute, bamboo’s structural forms {{in which it}} can be used are limited due to the diameter of the bamboo culm and the low rigidity of the bamboo. To solve these problems, modern industrial bamboo materials appeared in different forms, such as Glubam [1, 2], <b>parallel</b> bamboo <b>strand</b> <b>lumber</b> (PBSL) [3, 4], laminated bamboo lumber (LBL) [5 – 10], and so on. Bamboo tubes can be disassembled into bamboo filament bundles by passing them through a roller press crusher and then gluing it together with adhesive to form certifiable structural members. The composite material is called PBSL [3, 4]. As for LBL [5 – 10], original bamboo tubes can be disassembled into thin flat laminae first and then laminated together with adhesive to form certifiable structural members. Both the cross section and length can be controlled freely in the factory, and thus, LBL is competitive with commonly used building materials, whilst also having renewable characteristics.|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} the mechanical performance under two eccentric compression directions, 80 laminated bamboo lumber (LBL) column specimens were tested and analysed. Mechanical properties along two directions were compared. Bamboo nodes and drill hole {{are two main}} failure reasons for the specimens under two eccentric directions. More crack layers appeared for radial eccentric direction group specimens due to the layer structure. No matter which eccentric directions they are, the lateral deflection curves {{are close to the}} sine line, and the strain across the cross section of the LBL column for each specimen is basically linear throughout the loading process, following standard normal section bending theory. The mechanical properties for two directions are similar with each other and could follow the same design rules. Although the mechanical properties are similar for both LBL columns and <b>parallel</b> bamboo <b>strand</b> <b>lumber</b> (PBSL) columns as a whole, there are still some clear performance differences between the two kinds of materials. Combined all the test data under two eccentric directions, an equation for calculating the radial eccentricity influencing coefficient φ_e of LBL columns is proposed.

PSL is made from veneers that are cut up into long strands and oriented parallel to its length before compressed into its final shape.

It {{is a member of the}} structural composite lumber (SCL) family of {{engineered wood}} products.The design strength of PSL is greater than that of sawn lumber made from the same species because knots and other imperfections are randomly dispersed throughout the product. As a result, strength variability from one piece of PSL to another is less than in solid-sawn wooden beams. Since materials are commonly graded to the lowest 5th percentile of the material's strength curve, this gives PSL much higher usable values for bending, tension parallel to grain, and compression parallel to grain.|$|E

Its market share in the residential construction industry is considerable, being used primarily as main load bearing members such as beams and columns. Unlike the fast-paced market growth of these products, computational development has been slow. The highly heterogeneous mesostructure of this material must be known and quantified {{in order to develop}} advanced computational tools for limit state analysis of PSL. Void heterogeneities {{play an important role in}} determining the failure modes and strength of PSL, in addition to material phase aberrations such as grain angle variations and defects.

40|$|The shear {{strengths}} of structural glued laminated timber (glulam) have been traditionally evaluated in the United States {{based on the}} procedures set forth in ASTM Standards D 3737 and D 2555 using small block shear values of clear wood specimens. For most glulam products, the design shear stresses so derived are conservative. In recent years, the demand to optimize the design shear stress has been increased due to a higher design shear stress offered by competing structural wood composites, such as laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and <b>parallel</b> <b>strand</b> <b>lumber</b> (PSL). Since 1997, APA has {{conducted a series of}} full-size shear tests on glulam manufactured with Douglas fir, Southern pine, and Spruce-Pine-Fir. A four-point load method with a clear distance between the edge of the reaction bearing plate {{to the edge of the}} nearest curved load bearing block of at least 2 times the specimen depth was used to test all specimens. Based on this experience, the full-size shear test method has been adopted in ASTM D 3737 as a standard test method for determining the horizontal shear strength of glulam. This paper provides detailed descriptions of the test methods, experimental results, and data analyses. The test results obtained from this study indicate that the characteristic shear strength values based on full-size shear tests are approximately 70 % of the values determined from small block shear tests. However, the allowable horizontal shear stress could be increased by a factor of at least 1. 25, including a 10 % reduction to allow for occasional seasoning checks. This increase can be attributed in part to the difference in the procedures used to derive the design value between the full-size and small block shear tests...|$|E
40|$|Over recent decades, {{the public}} {{tendency}} toward using the structural composite lumber (SCL), a common composite of wood {{made of wood}} strands or veneers glued and compressed together, as structural members (especially the main load bearing members such as beams and columns) has risen considerably. In contrast to the fast-paced market growth of these products, development is slow. The experimental development is gradual and time-consuming and the computational development is even slower. The objective of this project is to introduce appropriate numerical models for limit state analysis of {{a certain type of}} SCL material called PSL. ^ <b>Parallel</b> <b>strand</b> <b>lumber</b> (PSL), has mesostructures characterized by the presence of voids that renders the mesostructure highly heterogeneous. In addition to material phase aberrations such as grain angle variations and defects, void heterogeneities {{play an important role in}} determining the failure modes and strength of PSL. In this study, virtual void structures were defined to form part of the input to finite element analysis of PSL for the purpose of investigating the sensitivity of strength to the void structure. Assuming the wood phase to be homogeneous and orthotropic, the following 2 D and 3 D characteristics of voids were investigated: volume fraction, volume, alignment and moments of inertia of voids, as well as second moment properties, lineal path function and chord length functions of the two phase mesostructure. In addition, a method was developed to generate virtual voids in order to simulate PSL and investigate the possible effects of the void distribution on material strength. ^ An experimental program along with a statistical survey was conducted to quantify the mentioned characteristics of the voids in two 133 mm * 133 mm * 610 mm 2. 0 E Eastern Species PSL billets. As expected, most of the voids lie on the longitudinal direction of the specimen and have approximately an ellipsoidal shape. Based on this shape data, the characteristics of the ellipsoids which best fit the voids were calculated. Using the statistical data of the fitted ellipsoids, a random field of virtual ellipsoid shaped voids to simulate the mesostructure of PSL was generated. ^ In this study, the simulation of PSL material is based on two simplifying assumptions: 1) The wood phase is continuum, homogeneous and orthotropic. While in reality, the wood phase consists of glued wood strands that are heterogeneous due to their mechanical variability and only roughly orthotropic on a macro scale as a result of the varying fiber angle; 2) Voids are the mere source of uncertainty. The linear elastic analysis of carefully defined (in mesostructural aspect) PSL models can be the first step of mechanical study of the material. The effective modulus of elasticity of material in presence of voids and the distribution of conventional, principal and effective stresses considering the effect of volume fraction and shape of the voids are the target of this preliminary study. Linear elastic uniaxial analyses showed good mechanical consistency between the models including actual void shapes and the models including ellipsoidal void representations. Also, they showed that the stress mutliaxiality at the tip of the voids is negligible. ^ The study of mechanics of PSL is incomplete unless the question of material anisotropy is taken into consideration. PSL is brittle in tension and ductile in compression. The material heterogeneity increases the complexity of the problem by affecting the stress distribution in the member. A detailed nonlinear approach has been proposed in order to investigate the mechanical behavior of PSL structural members under different uniaxial loading scenarios. This approach introduces proper constitutive models for the wood phase along with good void generation techniques. In other words, this approach suggests what models should be used for the continuum-assumed wood phase to simulate its brittle behavior in tension and ductile behavior in compression; and moreover, tests the applicability and accuracy of ellipsoidal void representation. The models are calibrated using the results of experiments on PSL material. ^ Because of the brittle behavior, all wood products show significant mechanical dependency to the member 2 ̆ 7 s size under tensile loading. Once good constitutive model and mesostructural simulation is found for tensile loading, it is easy to make and analyze PSL models with different sizes and investigate the effect of size on mechanical behavior. The simulation results have been compared to the available results of a previously done experimental study. ...|$|E
