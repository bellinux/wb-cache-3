The aim is {{to study}} the pharmacological activity dependence upon the chemical structure, to discover the high-effective substances among 57 derivatives of 7 -alkyl- 8 -halogen- 3 -methyl xantine. The structural-pharmacological analysis of the pharmacological activity types among 57 newly synthesized original derivatides of 7, 8 -di-substituted- 3 -methyl xantine has been performed firstly with use of the computer forecast. The pharmacological activity and some harmlessness parameters of the new pharmacological substance brobexaverine (7 -benzyl- 8 -bromine- 3 -methyl xantine) have been studied, and its hypotensive and de-priming activity has been proved.

40|$|Objectives To {{explore and}} {{identify}} the key determinants influencing the uptake of medicines use reviews (MURs), a new community pharmacy service in England. Methods Survey of all primary care organisations (PCOs) in England (nÂ =Â  303, response rateÂ =Â  74 %) and case study investigations of 10 PCOs, involving interviews with a purposive sample of 43 key stakeholders, including PCO, Local <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Committee</b> and community pharmacy representatives. National data on MUR activity were also analysed and multiple linear regression {{was used to test}} determinants of MUR uptake. Results The ownership category of the pharmacy was shown to be the most significant determinant of MUR uptake. Rates of MUR provision by multiple pharmacies were almost twice that of independent pharmacies. Interview data corroborated this finding, suggesting that organisational pressure within multiple pharmacies was driving forward MUR activity in some PCOs. Interviewees expressed concern about this quantity driven approach. The PCO survey respondents perceived the greatest barrier to MUR implementation to be a lack of support from general practitioners (GPs). Interviewees reported a lack of communication about MURs between community pharmacists and GPs. Conclusions The findings suggest that the organisational setting of the pharmacy is an important factor influencing the uptake of MURs. There is also a need for greater communication and collaboration with GPs regarding the MUR service.

40|$|Patients {{want and}} need {{comprehensive}} and accurate information about their medicines {{so that they can}} participate in decisions about their healthcare: In particular, they require information about the likely risks and benefits that are associated with the different treatment options. However, to provide this information in a form that people can readily understand and use is a considerable challenge to healthcare professionals. One recent attempt to standardise the Language of risk has been to produce sets of verbal descriptors that correspond to specific probability ranges, such as those outlined in the European Commission (EC) <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Committee</b> guidelines in 1998 for describing the incidence of adverse effects. This paper provides an overview of a number of studies involving members of the general public, patients, and hospital doctors, that evaluated the utility of the EC guideline descriptors (very common, common, uncommon, rare, very rare). In all studies it was found that people significantly over-estimated the likelihood of adverse effects occurring, given specific verbal descriptors. This in turn resulted in significantly higher ratings of their perceived risks to health and significantly lower ratings of their likelihood of taking the medicine. Such problems of interpretation are not restricted to the EC guideline descriptors. Similar levels of misinterpretation have also been demonstrated with two other recently advocated risk scales (Caiman's verbal descriptor scale and Barclay, Costigan and Davies' lottery scale). In conclusion, the challenge for risk communicators and for future research will be to produce a language of risk that is sufficiently flexible to take into account different perspectives, as well as changing circumstances and contexts of illness and its treatments. In the meantime, we urge the EC and other legislative bodies to stop recommending the use of specific verbal labels or phrases until there is a stronger evidence base to support their use...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In England and Wales, the Department of Health {{introduced}} a primary prevention programme, NHS Health Checks, to provide screening for cardiovascular risk amongst people aged 40 - 74. The {{aim of this}} programme is to offer treatment and advice to those identified with {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The North East of England has some of the highest rates of CVD in the UK and prevention is therefore a priority. NHS Tees funded this programme of work under the local branding of Healthy Heart Checks (HHC). These were initially implemented principally through GP practices from October 2008 but, in order to mitigate the possibility that some hard to reach communities would be reluctant to engage with some primary care settings, plans were also developed to deliver the programme through workplace settings and through community pharmacies. This paper reports specifically on the findings from the evaluation in respect of the setting up of HHCs in community pharmacies and aims to offer some lessons for other service settings where this option is seen as a way of providing low threshold services which will minimise inequalities in intervention uptake. Methods In assessing the community pharmacy component of HHCs, a selection of staff having direct involvement in the process was invited {{to take part in the}} evaluation. Interviews were carried out with representatives from community pharmacy, staff members from the commissioning Primary Care Trusts and with Local <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Committee</b> members. Results Evaluation and analysis identified challenges which should be anticipated and addressed in initiating HHC in community pharmacies. These have been categorised into four main themes for discussion in this paper: (1) establishing and maintaining pharmacy Healthy Heart Checks, (2) overcoming IT barriers, (3) developing confident, competent staff and (4) ensuring volume and through flow in pharmacy. Conclusions Delivering NHS health checks through community pharmacies can be a complex process, requiring meticulous planning, and may incur higher than expected costs. Findings from our evaluation provide insight into possible barriers to setting up services in pharmacies which may help other commissioning bodies when considering community pharmacy as a location for primary prevention interventions in future. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Almost all (17 / 20) Swedish {{counties}} have <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>committees</b> that establish {{recommendations for the}} use of antibiotic prophylaxis in oral healthcare. Objective To evaluate the evidence {{for the use of}} antibiotic prophylaxis in oral healthcare and the agreement between Swedish recommendations and evidence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The MeSH terms 'antibiotic prophylaxis' and 'dentistry' were used in the database search. Abstracts were reviewed according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 186 articles were read in full text by the four authors independently. Data extraction and interpretation of data was carried out using a pre-defined protocol. In the end, one case-control study was included for evaluation of evidence. RESULTS: The case-control study included patients with specific cardiac conditions. The study reported a 49 % protective efficacy (odds ratio: 0. 51) of antibiotic prophylaxis for first-time episodes of endocarditis within 30 days of procedure. This result was not statistically significant. The quality of the evidence was low. No studies were evaluated on patients with other medical conditions. The recommendations included several cardiac and other medical conditions for which {{there is a lack of}} evidence or no evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. To avoid the risk of adverse events from antibiotics and the risk of developing resistant bacterial strains, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis should be minimised and recommendations in Sweden should be revised to be more evidence-based...|$|R
