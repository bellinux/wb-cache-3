In the kitchen she stared, lips trembling, at the pitiful, half prepared meal. The fire had gone out. The water had boiled away from the potatoes. When she lifted the lid, a burnt smell arose. Methodically she scraped and cleaned the pot, put things in order, and <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>sliced</b> the potatoes for next day's frying. And just as methodically she went to bed. Her lack of nervousness, her placidity, was abnormal, so abnormal that {{she closed her eyes and}} was almost immediately asleep. Nor did she awaken till the sunshine was streaming into the room.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{and construction of}} an electrically operated cassava <b>peeling</b> <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> machine was described in this paper. The objective was to design, construct and test an electrically operated machine that will <b>peel</b> <b>and</b> <b>slice</b> cassava root into chips, to aid the processes of drying, pelletizing and storage. The methodology adopted includes; design, construction, calculation, specification, assembly of component parts and performance test. The machine was able to <b>Peel</b> <b>and</b> <b>slice</b> cassava to fairly similar sizes. Performance test reveals that 7 kg of cassava tuber was <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> chipped in one minute, which shows that, the machine developed can significantly {{reduce the cost of}} labour and time wastage associated with traditional processing of cassava tubers into dried cassava pellets, and finished products, such as; garri, and cassava flour. The machine has a capacity of 6. 72 kg/min, with <b>peeling</b> <b>and</b> chipping efficiency of 66. 2 % and 84. 0 % respectively. The flesh loss of the peeled tuber was 8. 52 %, while overall machine efficiency obtained as 82. 4 %. The machine is recommended for use by small scale industries and by cassava farmers in the rural areas. It has an overall cost of N 46100 ($ 150). The machine can easily be operated by an individual and maintained, by using warm water to wash the component parts, and sharpening of the chipping disc when required...|$|R

60|$|Lunch went on methodically, until each of {{the seven}} courses was left in {{fragments}} and the fruit was merely a toy, to be <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>sliced</b> as a child destroys a daisy, petal by petal. The food served as an extinguisher upon any faint flame of the human spirit that might survive the midday heat, but Susan sat in her room afterwards, turning over and over the delightful fact that Mr. Venning had come to her in the garden, and had sat there quite half an hour while she read aloud to her aunt. Men and women sought different corners where they could lie unobserved, and from two to four it might be said without exaggeration that the hotel was inhabited by bodies without souls. Disastrous would have been the result if a fire or a death had suddenly demanded something heroic of human nature, but tragedies come in the hungry hours. Towards four o'clock the human spirit again began to lick the body, as a flame licks a black promontory of coal. Mrs. Paley felt it unseemly to open her toothless jaw so widely, though there was no one near, and Mrs. Elliot surveyed her found flushed face anxiously in the looking-glass.|$|E

60|$|We {{left this}} town towards evening, {{and took the}} road to Marseilles. A dusty road it was; the houses shut up close; and the vines {{powdered}} white. At nearly all the cottage doors, women were <b>peeling</b> <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> onions into earthen bowls for supper. So they had been doing last night {{all the way from}} Avignon. We passed one or two shady dark chateaux, surrounded by trees, and embellished with cool basins of water: which were the more refreshing to behold, from the great scarcity of such residences on the road we had travelled. As we approached Marseilles, the road began to be covered with holiday people. Outside the public-houses were parties smoking, drinking, playing draughts and cards, and (once) dancing. But dust, dust, dust, everywhere. We went on, through a long, straggling, dirty suburb, thronged with people; having on our left a dreary slope of land, on which the country-houses of the Marseilles merchants, always staring white, are jumbled and heaped without the slightest order: backs, fronts, sides, and gables towards all points of the compass; until, at last, we entered the town.|$|R

Restructured fruit also suffer the discoloration during aerobic storage either at room temperature or under refrigeration. The objective {{of this study was to}} find alternatives for preventing or retarding the discoloration rate of calcium-alginate restructured fruits during aerobic refrigerated storage using anti browning additives. Four different fruits including avocado, mango, jack fruit, and soursop were restructured using sodium alginate (1 % w/w) and calcium lactate (1 % w/w). The additives tested were citric acid 0. 5 % (w/w), ascorbic acid 0. 05 % (w/w), sodium disulfite 0. 01 % (w/w), N-acetyl-cysteine 0. 05 % (w/w), and combination of citric acid 0. 05 % (w/w) and N-acetyl-cysteine 0. 05 % (w/w). Addition of anti browning additives at the specified concentration was effective in delaying the discoloration of restructured fruits during aerobic storage at 4 ºC for up to 6 days. Among the additives tested the use of combination of citric acid 0. 05 % (w/w) and N-acetyl-cysteine 0. 05 % (w/w) was the most effective in retarding the discoloration across the fruits. Restructured soursop, in particular, was not undergoing significant sidcoloration for 11 days of refrigerated storage...|$|R

40|$|In the Congo Basin, up {{to one-third}} of the total wood market is sourced from {{traditional}} (or artisanal) woodcutting, with these products primarily destined for domestic markets. Due to the informal nature {{of much of the}} domestic value-added wood product market, the sector's real contribution to GDP and to local livelihoods is challenging to measure. However, urban timber markets contribute to economic growth and provide jobs, with an annual turnover of at least USD 15 million and employment of some 5, 000 individuals in Yaoundé, Douala, and Kinshasa alone. Boosting the share of locally-processed wood used in domestic construction and furniture-making could represent a significant business opportunity for small, medium and large-sized enterprises in wood fiberbased value chains: smallholders, community forest holders, forest concessionaires, as well as SMEs and larger companies involved in transportation logistics, wood processing industries (large or small), wood workers, builders, and even designers, with the right policy incentives and enabling environment. Domestic processing capacities are low, almost entirely limited to primary processing: sawnwood, <b>peeling</b> <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> for plywood, <b>and</b> veneer production. Industrial and semi-industrial wood transformation enterprises are well equipped, but have difficulties competing on the domestic market as they are subject to higher taxes than smaller enterprises, operating informally. This report aim to improve knowledge and prioritize options for policies and targeted investments for improved domestic timber utilization in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The report builds on prior knowledge to better understand the solutions needed to overcome barriers to expanding the market for legal (and possibly sustainable) timber and processed wood products used in the domestic furniture and construction markets in the two countries.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{heat pump}} dryer {{has been developed}} for drying {{of fruits and vegetables}} at low temperature and relative humidity to maintain the quality of dried product. Onions, of Nasik red variety were <b>peeled,</b> trimmed <b>and</b> <b>sliced</b> to 2 mm thickness. The onion slices were dried in the heat pump dryer at 35 ◦C (32 % R. H.), 40 ◦C (26 % R.

The drying rate increased with increase in drying air temperature, associated with reduced R. H., in the heat pump dryer. Drying took place mainly under the falling rate period. The Page equation, resulting in a higher coefficient of determination and lower root mean square error, better described the thin-layer drying of onion slices than the Henderson and Pabis equation. Heat pump drying took less drying time of 360 min and yielded better quality dried product, with higher retention of ascorbic acid and pyruvic acid and lower colour change, as compared to a hot air dryer at the same drying air temperature of 50 ◦C...|$|R
