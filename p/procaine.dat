5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin sodium, penicillin G <b>procaine,</b> cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Procaine</b> {{penicillin}} G {{is given}} intramuscularly for 14 days (300,000 U/d for patients weighing <10nbsp&kg and 600,000 U/d for those weighing >10nbsp&kg); patients with allergies to penicillin G or erythromycin can use rifampin or clindamycin.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the herbs, the Hoxsey treatment now also includes antiseptic douches and washes, laxative tablets, and nutritional supplements. A mixture of <b>procaine</b> hydrochloride and vitamins, along with liver and cactus, is prescribed. During treatment, patients are asked to avoid consumption of tomatoes, vinegar, pork, alcohol, salt, sugar, and white flour products.|$|E
25|$|A {{bone marrow}} biopsy may {{be done in}} a health care provider's office or in a hospital. Informed consent for the {{procedure}} is typically required. The patient is asked to lie on their abdomen (prone position) or on their side (lateral decubitus position). The skin is cleansed, and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine or <b>procaine</b> is injected to numb the area. Patients may also be pretreated with analgesics and/or anti-anxiety medications, although this is not a routine practice.|$|E
25|$|In Peru, {{the ancient}} Incas are {{believed}} to have used the leaves of the coca plant as a local anaesthetic in addition to its stimulant properties. It was also used for slave payment and is thought {{to play a role in}} the subsequent destruction of Incas culture when Spaniards realized the effects of chewing the coca leaves and took advantage of it. Cocaine was isolated in 1860 and first used as a local anesthetic in 1884. The search for a less toxic and less addictive substitute led to the development of the aminoester local anesthetics stovaine in 1903 and <b>procaine</b> in 1904. Since then, several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use, notably lidocaine in 1943, bupivacaine in 1957, and prilocaine in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Special {{departments}} {{were prepared}} engineers for industries which {{were still being}} created {{in the first five}} years. At the time, were of great importance establishment of a domestic pharmaceutical industry and the country's liberation on imports of medicines. Were developed and implemented methods of production of such drugs as atophan, benzocaine, <b>procaine,</b> bromural, thiokol, ichtyol, validol, antipyrine, caffeine, alkaloids and others. In 1938, in MITHT under the leadership of academic A. N. Nesmeyanov (later President of the RAS) began work in the field of organometallic compounds. Also, the Institute prepared professionals for the companies producing such important national defense materials, such as tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, and rare-earth elements. So, Professor I. Ya. Bashilov created the production technology of uranium and radium. And under the guidance of Professor G. A. Meyerson were carried out important work on carbothermy and getting super-hard alloys.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, <b>procaine,</b> tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} shot as one long take, {{shot in a}} mostly dark room. Ocean sits in the room, smoking an {{unspecified}} drug. Eventually, {{he gets up and}} begins to smear an unknown substance onto his face. Random shots of pandas and rain forest imagery are also spliced into the video, and it ends with Ocean being slapped by the ghostly image of a woman. MTV further summarized the video; [...] "Ocean is surrounded by ghostly incarnations of beautiful women, tigers and pandas. At one point, Ocean smears what appears to be novocaine — or <b>Procaine</b> — on his solemn-looking face." [...] Supposedly, it required several takes to achieve the correct angle for the slapping moment, and the spliced images were placed in the video because Ocean asked the director whether or not they [...] "can we put some kind of Asian-rain-forest stuff in there?" [...] Billboard wrote that the video was [...] "minimalist" [...] and [...] "eerie". Pitchfork named the video amongst the best of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Intoxication {{accounts}} for {{a small percentage of}} musical hallucination cases. Intoxication leads to either withdrawal or inflammatory encephalopathy, which are major contributors to musical hallucinations. Some of the drugs that have been found to relate to musical hallucinations include salicylates, benzodiazepines, pentoxifylline, propranolol, clomipramine, amphetamine, quinine, imipramine, a phenothiazine, carbamazepine, marijuana, paracetamol, phenytoin, <b>procaine,</b> and alcohol. [...] General anesthesia has also been association with musical hallucinations.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudocholinesterase (also called butyrylcholinesterase or [...] "BCHE") hydrolyzes {{a number}} of choline-based {{compounds}} including cocaine, heroin, <b>procaine,</b> and succinylcholine, mivacurium, and other fast-acting muscle relaxants. Mutations in the BCHE gene lead to deficiency in the amount or function of the protein, which in turn results in a delay in the metabolism of these compounds, which prolongs their effects. Succinylcholine is commonly used as an anaesthetic in surgical procedures, and a person with BCHE mutations may suffer prolonged paraylasis. Between 1 in 3200 and 1 in 5000 people carry BCHE mutations; they are most prevalent in Persian Jews and Alaska Natives. As of 2013 there are 9 genetic tests available.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to what {{is often}} believed, some patent {{medicines}} did, in fact, deliver the promised results, albeit with very dangerous ingredients. [...] For example, medicines advertised as [...] "infant soothers" [...] contained opium, then a legal drug. Those advertised as [...] "catarrh snuff" [...] contained cocaine, also legal. [...] While various herbs, touted or alluded to, were talked up in the advertising, their actual effects often came from <b>procaine</b> extracts or grain alcohol. Those containing opiates were at least effective in relieving pain, coughs, and diarrhea, though they could result in addiction. This hazard was sufficiently well known that many were advertised as causing none of {{the harmful effects of}} opium (though many of those so advertised actually did contain opium).|$|E
2500|$|Beck {{realized}} that ventricular fibrillation often occurred in hearts that were basically sound and he coined the phrase [...] "Hearts {{too good to}} die." [...] In 1947, Beck accomplished his first successful resuscitation of a 14-year-old boy using open chest massage and internal defibrillation with alternating current. The boy was being operated on for a severe congenital funnel chest. In all other respects the boy was normal. During {{the closure of the}} large incision in the chest, the pulse suddenly stopped and the blood pressure fell to zero. The boy was in cardiac arrest. Dr. Beck immediately reopened the chest and began manual heart massage. As he looked at and felt the heart, he {{realized that}} ventricular fibrillation was present. Massage was continued for 35minutes at which time an electrocardiogram was taken that confirmed the presence of ventricular fibrillation. Another 10minutes passed before the defibrillator was brought to the operating room. The first shock using electrode paddles placed directly {{on the sides of the}} heart was unsuccessful. Beck administered <b>procaine</b> amide, a medicine to stabilize the heart’s rhythm. Beck gave a second shock that wiped out the fibrillation. In a very few seconds a feeble, regular, and fast contraction of the heart occurred. The blood pressure rose from zero to 50millimeters of mercury. Beck noted that the heartbeat remained regular and saw that the pressure slowly began to rise. Twenty minutes after the successful defibrillation, the chest wound was closed. By three hours, the blood pressure rose to a normal level, and the child awoke and was able to answer questions. The boy made a full recovery, with no neurological damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procaine</b> {{blockade}} is {{a medical}} treatment, where <b>procaine</b> solution affects the peripheral nervous system. <b>Procaine</b> blockade was developed by Aleksandr Vasilyevich Vishnevsky in 1929. There are lumbar, jugular, sacral, extremity and short neural blockades used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procaine</b> is an {{occasional}} additive in illicit street drugs, such as cocaine. MDMA manufacturers also use <b>procaine</b> as an additive at ratios ranging from 1:1 up to 10% MDMA with 90% <b>procaine,</b> {{which can be}} life-threatening.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "penicillin" [...] {{is often}} used generically to refer to {{benzylpenicillin}} (penicillin G, the original penicillin found in 1928), <b>procaine</b> benzylpenicillin (<b>procaine</b> penicillin), benzathine benzylpenicillin (benzathine penicillin), and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V). <b>Procaine</b> penicillin and benzathine penicillin have the same antibacterial activity as benzylpenicillin but act {{for a longer period}} of time. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is less active against gram-negative bacteria than benzylpenicillin. Benzylpenicillin, <b>procaine</b> penicillin and benzathine penicillin can be given by intravenous or intramuscular injections, but phenoxymethylpenicillin can be given by mouth because of its acidic stability.|$|E
50|$|Procainamide is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} <b>procaine,</b> but {{in place of}} an ester group, procainamide contains an amide group. This substitution {{is the reason why}} procainamide exhibits a longer half-life time than <b>procaine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Application of <b>procaine</b> {{leads to}} the {{depression}} of neuronal activity. The depression causes the nervous system to become hypersensitive, producing restlessness and shaking, leading to minor to severe convulsions. Studies on animals have shown the use of <b>procaine</b> led to the increase of dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain. [...] Other issues may occur because of varying individual tolerance to <b>procaine</b> dosage. Nervousness and dizziness can arise from the excitation of the central nervous system, which may lead to respiratory failure if overdosed. <b>Procaine</b> may also induce weakening of the myocardium leading to cardiac arrest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procaine</b> {{can also}} cause {{allergic}} reactions causing individuals to have problems with breathing, rashes, and swelling. Allergic reactions to <b>procaine</b> are usually not in response to <b>procaine</b> itself, but to its metabolite PABA. About one in 3000 white North Americans is homozygotic (i.e. has two copies of the abnormal gene) for the most common atypical form of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and do not hydrolyze ester anesthetics such as <b>procaine.</b> This results in a prolonged period of high levels of the anesthetic in the blood and increased toxicity. However, certain populations in the world such as the Vysya community in India commonly have a deficiency of this enzyme.|$|E

5000|$|Mepivacaine [...] {{is a local}} {{anesthetic}} of the amide type. Mepivacaine has {{a reasonably}} rapid onset (more rapid than that of <b>procaine)</b> and medium duration of action (shorter than that of <b>procaine)</b> and is marketed under various trade names including Carbocaine and Polocaine.|$|E
50|$|Side effects include pain at {{the site}} of injection, blood {{clotting}} problems, seizures, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. When used to treat syphilis a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer may occur. It is not recommended in those with a history of penicillin allergy or <b>procaine</b> allergy. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is relatively safe. <b>Procaine</b> benzylpenicillin is in the penicillin and beta lactam family of medications. It works via benzylpenicillin and results in bacterial death. <b>Procaine</b> makes the combination long acting.|$|E

50|$|<b>Procaine</b> {{benzylpenicillin}} {{also known}} as penicillin G <b>procaine,</b> is an antibiotic useful {{for the treatment of}} a number of bacterial infections. Specifically it is used for syphilis, anthrax, mouth infections, pneumonia, diphtheria, cellulitis, and animal bites. It is given by injection into a muscle.|$|E

50|$|A 1% <b>procaine</b> {{injection}} {{has been}} recommended {{for the treatment}} of extravasation complications associated with venipuncture (along with moist heat, steroids, and antibiotics). It has likewise been recommended for treatment of inadvertent intra-arterial injections (10 ml of 1% <b>procaine),</b> as it helps relieve pain and vascular spasm.|$|E
50|$|Finally, pseudocholinesterase {{metabolism}} of <b>procaine</b> {{results in}} formation of paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA). If the patient receiving <b>procaine</b> is on sulfonamide antibiotics such as bactrim the antibiotic effect will be antagonized {{by providing a}} new source of PABA to the microbe for subsequent synthesis of folic acid.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Procaine</b> is used less {{frequently}} today since more effective (and hypoallergenic) alternatives such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) exist. Like other local anesthetics (such as mepivacaine, and prilocaine), <b>procaine</b> is a vasodilator, thus is often coadministered with epinephrine {{for the purpose}} of vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction helps to reduce bleeding, increases the duration and quality of anesthesia, prevents the drug from reaching systemic circulation in large amounts, and overall reduces the amount of anesthetic required. Unlike cocaine, a vasoconstrictor, <b>procaine</b> does not have the euphoric and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary use}} for <b>procaine</b> is as an anaesthetic.|$|E
