30|$|Following White et al., {{this author}} then re-tested {{individual}} bandwidth responses on two northwest Montana fires that burned in 1994, {{using the same}} pixel locations in pre- and post-fire TM datasets. The results of all three investigations were quite similar regarding TM bandwidth response to burning within generally forested cover types. In essence, all found that Band 4 reflectance decreased the most of all bands, while Band 7 increased the most and had the greatest variation when comparing unburned to burned pixels. These responses were linked to the physical properties of reflectance in Band 4 shown to increase with increasing green vegetation cover and vigor, and the opposite response in Band 7, which decreases with vegetation cover and moisture content, but increases with greater cover of soil, ash or carbon (Knipling 1970; Tucker 1980; Ahern et al. 1991; Cibula et al. 1992; van Wagtendonk et al. 2004). The high Band 4 reflectance in spectra of vegetation is slightly reduced when vegetation is scorched, and dramatically reduced when vegetation is replaced by soil, ash and carbon (Kokaly et al. in press). Conversely, the very low Band 7 reflectance over spectra of green vegetation is about equal to Band 4 when vegetation is scorched, but very high when vegetation is burned to ash, carbon and soil (Kokaly et al. in <b>press).</b> <b>Band</b> 5 {{has been shown to}} have similar absorption and reflective trends as Band 7, and has been used to gauge vegetation damage and moisture content (Vogelmann and Rock 1988; Collins and Woodcock 1994; Hunt and Rock 1989). However, the three studies agreed that the empirical measures for Band 5 response to burning, though similar to Band 7, were not as great and contained less variation than Band 7. Band 5 typically has reflectance levels intermediate between Bands 4 and 7 in the spectra of vegetation and ash/char areas (Kokaly et al. in press). Thus, the response of Band 4 relative to Band 5 was observed to be less extreme than the response of Band 4 relative to Band 7.|$|E
