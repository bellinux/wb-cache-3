25|$|Neurons {{are known}} as excitable cells because on its surface {{membrane}} there are an abundance of proteins known as ion-channels that allow small charged particles to pass {{in and out of}} the cell. The structure of the neuron allows chemical information to be received by its dendrites, propagated through the <b>perikaryon</b> (cell body) and down its axon, and eventually passing on to other neurons through its axon terminal. These voltage-gated ion channels allow for rapid depolarization throughout the cell. This depolarization, if it reaches a certain threshold, will cause an action potential. Once the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it will cause an influx of calcium ions into the cell. The calcium ions will then cause vesicles, small packets filled with neurotransmitters, to bind to the cell membrane and release its contents into the synapse. This cell is known as the pre-synaptic neuron, and the cell that interacts with the neurotransmitters released is known as the post-synaptic neuron. Once the neurotransmitter is released into the synapse, it can either bind to receptors on the post-synaptic cell, the pre-synaptic cell can re-uptake it and save it for later transmission, or it can be broken down by enzymes in the synapse specific to that certain neurotransmitter. These three different actions are major areas where drug action can affect communication between neurons.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the neurogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), periodontal liga-ment stem cells (PDLSCs), and stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP). Materials and Methods: After induction of neurogenic differentiation using commercial differentiation medium, expression levels of neural mark-ers, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP 2), class III β-tubulin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were identified using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, and immunocytochemistry. Results: The induced cells showed neuron-like morphologies, similar to axons, dendrites, and <b>perikaryons,</b> which are composed of neurons in DPSCs, PDLSCs, and SCAP. The mRNA levels of neuronal markers tended to increase in differentiated cells. The expression of MAP 2 and β-tubulin III also increased at the protein level in differentiation groups, even though GFAP was not detected via immunocytochemistry. Conclusion: Human dental stem cells including DPSCs, PDLSCs, and SCAP may have neurogenic differentiation capability in vitro. The presented data support the use of human dental stem cells as a possible alternative source of stem cells for therapeutic utility in the treatment of neurological dis-eases...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the esophagus, including procorpus, metacorpus, isthmus, gland lobe, and esophago-intestinal junction, is examined in males of Sarisodera hydrophila. A cuticle-lined lumen extends most {{of the length of}} the esophagus, broadens to form a pump chamber in the metacorpus, and posteriorly is continuous with junctional complexes among four esophago-intestinal cells. These four cells are partially enveloped by the gland lobe which basically consists of three gland cells, one dorsal and two subventral. Each gland cell has an anterior process which opens into the lumen of the esophagus through a cuticle-lined duct. The dorsal gland joins the lumen in the anterior portion of the procorpus, whereas ducts of the subventral glands terminate {{at the base of the}} metacorpus pump chamber. The subventral glands are predominant in the posterior portion of the gland lobe and are partially ensheathed by a narrow portion of the dorsal gland which extends to within 5 μm of the posterior terminus of the gland lobe. Contents of the dorsal gland include primarily electron dense granules, although rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is predominant posteriorly. Secretory granules within the subventral glands vary in morphology and are evenly distributed throughout the two ceils among other organelles, including RER and a large Golgi apparatus. Innervation of the esophagus includes nerve processes which originate from several <b>perikaryons</b> (cell bodies) located in the anterior portion of the gland lobe. The esophagus of males of S. hydrophila is compared with that of other Heteroderoidea, Heterodera glycines and Meloidogyne incognita...|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{presents}} {{a review of}} the morphology and functions of tanycytes. The name “tanycyte,” derived from the Greek word “tanus,” which means “elongated,” was chosen to stress the shape of these bipolar cells, in relation at their apical pole with the infundibular recess of the third ventricle and, at their distal pole, with the portal vessels of the median eminence and the floor of the brain. The morphology of tanycytes has been thoroughly explored by means of photonic observations as well as by transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy. The review of the chapter will be restricted to the tanycytes lining the ventral region of the third ventricle in mammals, thus, excluding the study of similar cells lining the circumventricular organs (subfornical organ, subcommissural organ, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis), the aqueduct, and the floor of the fourth ventricle. The possible functions of the tanycytes will also be reviewed. The Golgi impregnation has been used by several authors to study the morphology of the tanycytes in mammals. Because of the thickness of the sections impregnated by this method, it is possible in favorable incidences to follow the entire length of these elongated cells, allowing a dissection in situ. This method demonstrates two main types of tanycytes according to their location and their morphology. The ventral tanycytes are located on the floor and lower third of the infundibular recess. Dorsal tanycytes have a longer tail process, starting {{from the base of the}} tanycyte and arching ventrolaterally in the neuropil of the arcuate nucleus. Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and glucosed-phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) are more active in the <b>perikaryons</b> of β tanycytes as compared to α. © 1985, Elsevier Science & Technology.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{morphological}} changes of neurocytes in spinal cord of rats in hypokinesia and subsequent physical loading. Studies were performed on 55 laboratory rats of Wistar line. Materials of the research were the anterior horns of the gray matter of L 5 -S 2 spinal segments. Preparations stained by Nissl and Viktorov were examined histologically. Hypokinesia was modeled following on the author’s technique. It was established that during prolonged hypokinesia in neurocytes of spinal cord of rats morphological changes in cell size and shape of the motor nuclei of all segments under study have been recorded. The number of hypochromic, hyperchromic destructively unchanged and hyperchromic destructively altered neurocytes increase; shadow cells appears, as well as cases of satellitosis and neuronophagia. Decrease in of albumen synthetical neurocyte function has been recorded. Physical loading of the average aerobic capacity leads to normalization of structural and functional state of neurocytes and enhances the reparative processes, as evidenced by a number of positive changes in morphometric parameters: increase in the number of normochromic neurocytes and decreasing the number of hyper- and hypochromic neurocytes with destructive signs, absence of pyknotic forms. Morphological parameters of neurocytes and their nuclei after physical loading of average aerobic capacity do not differ from those in the control group of intact animals. In neurocytes of this group of rats RNA concentration increases by 12. 6 % compared to animals after prolonged hypokinesia. Neurocytes of spinal cord of rats after prolonged hypokinesia develop significant morphological changes which are characterized by emergence of a significant number of hyperchromic neurocytes with signs of destructive changes and shadow cells, as well as and hypochromic neurocytes with signs of destructive changes, reduction in size and change of shape of <b>perikaryons</b> of neurocytes and their nuclei. Morphological changes of neurocytes after prolonged hypokinesia are accompanied by violations of biosynthetic processes, as evidenced by RNA decrease in the cytoplasm of efferent neurocytes of spinal cord of rats.

40|$|Intracellular pH (pHi) was {{measured}} in oligodendrocytes (OLs) using ratiometric pH indicator dye. The results indicate that OLs contain numerous alkaline pH microdomains in the <b>perikaryon</b> and proximal dendrites and acidic pH microdomains in distal dendrites. Alkaline pH microdomains are generated by the combined activities of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) and carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), whereas acidic pH microdomains are generated by activities of Na+/HCO 3 − cotransporter (NBC) and CAII. NHE is concentrated in the <b>perikaryon</b> and NBC and CAII are in most dendrites. Subcellular segregation of the three proteins results in the differential distribution of transport metabolons, which causes spatially non-uniform intracellular pH. ^ RNA trafficking in oligodendrocytes (OLs) involves directional movement along microtubules (MTs) using conventional kinesin. Time lapse analysis of RNA trafficking in OLs reveals velocity fluctuations during translocation in dendrites. Using an in vitro motility assay it was shown that, for conventional kinesin, MT binding decreases and velocity increases reciprocally with increasing pH from 6. 4 to 7. 4. Co-visualization of pH and RNA showed that RNA granules are co-localized with acidic pH microdomains.

Hypophyses from 25 male and 6 female adults, and 21 fetuses ranging in gestational age from 6 to 23 weeks were studied. In the adult two morphological forms of mammotropes were observed. Mammotrope I possessed a small <b>perikaryon</b> that commonly was located centrally in parenchymal cell cords. From the <b>perikaryon</b> long cytoplasmic processes extended toward neighboring capillaries. Mammotrope I reached its highest incidence in the posterolateral zones of the pars distalis.

However, the pathogenic formation of α-syn aggregates in different brain areas of PD patients is poorly understood. Most experimental models of PD are valuable to assess specific aspects of its pathogenesis, such as toxin-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, new models are required that reflect the widespread and progressive formation of α-syn aggregates in different brain areas. Such α-syn aggregation is induced in only a few animal models, for example <b>perikaryon</b> inclusions are found in rats administered rotenone, aggregates with a neuritic morphology develop in mice overexpressing either mutated or wild-type α-syn, and in Smad 3 deficient mice, aggregates form extensively in the <b>perikaryon</b> and neurites of specific brain nuclei.

In contrast, the axon emerged {{from one of the}} dendrites in 75 % of the neurons in the intermediate zone and the ventral horn of the spinal cord and in 68 % of the neurons in the hypothalamus. In the case of the antenna-type neurons in the spinal dorsal horn, the axon often originated from one of the dendrites, but never from a dorsally oriented dendrite. The mean distance of the axon hillock of dendritic origin was the longest in the neurons in the intermediate zone and the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The size of the axon hillock was proportional {{to the size of the}} <b>perikaryon.</b> The impregnated portion of the axon was longest in the large ventral horn neurons...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} for neuronal apoptosis after axotomy and target deprivation {{in the adult}} central nervous system are poorly understood. We used a unilateral occipital cortex ablation model in the adult rat {{to test the hypothesis}} that apoptotic retrograde neurodegeneration in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus occurs in association with oxidative stress and mitochondrial abnormalities. Immunodetection of 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine, a marker for oxidative injury to DNA, demonstrated that these apoptotic neurons undergo oxidative stress. Dual immunolabeling for the retrograde tracer Fluorogold to identify projection neurons and for 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine demonstrated that apoptotic, oxidatively damaged neurons are geniculocortical projection neurons. By electron microscopy, degeneration of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus neurons evolved in association with a transient increase in mitochondria within the <b>perikaryon</b> of dying neurons during the transition between chromatolysis and early apoptosis. The morphological integrity of mitochondria was preserved until late in the progression of apoptosis. The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ipsilateral to the cortical lesion had a transient increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity, and geniculocortical neurons at the transitional, early apoptotic stage accumulated cytochrome c oxidase activity. We conclude that axotomy-induced, retrograde neuronal apoptosis in the adult central nervous system occurs in association with the accumulation of functionally active mitochondria within the <b>perikaryon</b> and oxidative damage to nuclear DNA...|$|E
