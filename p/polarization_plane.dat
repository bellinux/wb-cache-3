25|$|The effect honey has {{on light}} {{is useful for}} {{determining}} the type and quality. Variations in the water content alter the refractive index of honey. Water content can easily be measured with a refractometer. Typically, the refractive index for honey ranges from 1.504 at 13% water content to 1.474 at 25%. Honey also {{has an effect on}} polarized light, in that it rotates the <b>polarization</b> <b>plane.</b> The fructose gives a negative rotation, while the glucose gives a positive one. The overall rotation can be used to measure the ratio of the mixture. Honey may vary in color between pale yellow and dark brown, but other bright colors may occasionally be found, depending on the source of the sugar harvested by the bees.|$|E
2500|$|Lorentz violating {{dispersion}} relations due to {{the presence}} of an anisotropic space might also lead to vacuum birefringence and parity violations. For instance, the <b>polarization</b> <b>plane</b> of photons might rotate due to velocity differences between left- and right-handed photons. In particular, gamma ray bursts, galactic radiation, and the cosmic microwave background radiation are examined.

2500|$|Both Einstein's {{theory of}} special and general {{relativity}} state that light should pass freely through a vacuum without being altered, a principle known as Lorentz invariance. Yet, in theory, large nonlinear self-interaction of light due to quantum fluctuations {{should lead to}} this principle being measurably violated if the interactions are strong enough. Nearly all theories of quantum gravity predict that that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature. [...] It is predicted {{the speed at which}} light travels through the vacuum depends on its direction, polarization and the local strength of the magnetic field. There {{have been a number of}} inconclusive results which claim to show evidence of a Lorentz violation by finding a rotation of the <b>polarization</b> <b>plane</b> of light coming from distant galaxies. The first concrete evidence for vacuum birefringence was published in 2017 when a team of astronomers looked at the light coming from the star RX J1856.5-3754, the closest discovered neutron star to Earth.|$|E
