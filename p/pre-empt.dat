5|$|These geopolitical {{calculations}} were debated {{and discussed}} in the following years. Historians agree that the British believed that expressing support would appeal to Jews in Germany and the United States, given two of Woodrow Wilson's closest advisors {{were known to be}} avid Zionists; they also hoped to encourage support from the large Jewish population in Russia. In addition, the British intended to <b>pre-empt</b> the expected French pressure for an international administration in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard is {{a poem by}} Thomas Gray, {{completed}} in 1750 and first published in 1751. The poem’s origins are unknown, but it was partly inspired by Gray’s thoughts {{following the death of}} the poet Richard West in 1742. Originally titled Stanzas Wrote in a Country Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was living near St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751, to <b>pre-empt</b> a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the poem.|$|E

5|$|The Compulsory Process Clause {{guarantees}} the defendant {{the right to}} obtain favorable witnesses at trial. For example, the Clause prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses. Similarly, the Clause prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable to the defense. The right does not <b>pre-empt</b> reasonable procedural rules. Thus, the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom and France {{declared}} war on Germany in 1939, following the German invasion of Poland, but no major land operations occurred in Western Europe during the period known as the Phoney War {{in the winter of}} 1939–1940. During this time, the British and French built up their forces in expectation of a long war, and the Germans completed their conquest of Poland. On 9 October, Adolf Hitler ordered plans to be made for an invasion of the Low Countries, to use them as a base against Great Britain and to <b>pre-empt</b> a similar attack by the Allied forces, which could threaten the vital Ruhr Area.|$|E
5|$|Khánh's deposal of {{the prime}} {{minister}} nullified a counter-plot involving Hương, which had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to <b>pre-empt</b> his deposal, Hương had backed a plot led by some Dai Viet-oriented Catholic officers, reported to include Generals Thiệu and Nguyễn Hữu Có. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiêm back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to give full support. They regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiêm, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for Hương if the plot failed.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of {{rudimentary}} training in Australia, the first contingent of the AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914. Although they were originally bound for England to undergo further training prior to employment on the Western Front, the Australians were instead sent to British-controlled Egypt in order to <b>pre-empt</b> any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal, and {{with a view to}} opening another front against the Central Powers. Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following {{a period of}} training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps—commanded by British general William Birdwood—subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill-conceived and shortly after the landing a blood stalemate developed. This ultimately lasted eight months before Allied commanders decided to evacuate the troops without having achieved the campaign's objectives. Australian casualties totalled 26,111, including 8,141 killed.|$|E
5|$|Following Theodore's coronation, {{there were}} four rulers who claimed the {{imperial}} title and vied for control of Constantinople: Theodore, the Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea, and the young but ambitious John II Asen (r. 1218–41) of Bulgaria. The Latin Empire was a shadow of its former strength: following Poimanenon, the Latins had lost most of their territories in Asia, while in Europe, it was soon reduced to the environs of Constantinople itself. Already in 1224, {{or at least in}} 1225, Theodore captured Chalcidice with Mount Athos, and in spring 1225, he advanced through eastern Macedonia and western Thrace, seizing Christopolis, Xanthi, Gratianopolis, Mosynopolis and Didymoteicho. In an attempt to <b>pre-empt</b> him and block his advance onto Constantinople, the Nicaeans had answered the summons of the inhabitants of Adrianople and taken over the city from the Latins. Theodore however crossed the Evros River and blockaded the city, until it agreed to surrender. The Nicaean army, under the protostrator John Ises and John Kammytzes, was allowed to withdraw unmolested to Asia with ships provided by Theodore.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Caliph {{was brought}} to Raqqa for greater safety, while Husayn ibn Sa'id tried to secure control over {{northern}} Syria and <b>pre-empt</b> Egypt's ruler Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid {{taking control of the}} region. The attempt failed, as al-Ikhshid himself advanced into Syria, took Aleppo and marched to Raqqa, where he met the Caliph. Al-Ikhshid tried to persuade al-Muttaqi to come to Egypt under his protection, but the Caliph refused, and al-Ikhsid returned to Egypt. Instead, al-Muttaqi, persuaded by Tuzun's assurances of loyalty and safety, returned to Baghdad, where Tuzun deposed and blinded him, replacing him with al-Mustakfi (r. 944–946). At the news of this crime, Nasir al-Dawla again refused payment of tribute, but Tuzun marched against him and forced his compliance. Henceforth, Nasir al-Dawla would be tributary to Baghdad, but he would find it difficult to resign himself to his loss of power over the city he once ruled, and the subsequent years would feature several attempts to regain it.|$|E

5|$|The poem is a twelve book {{work with}} {{irregular}} stanzas and lines {{that are not}} rhymed. The poem deals with Harun al-Rashid {{and a group of}} sorcerers at Domdaniel that live under the sea. It was foretold that Thalaba, a Muslim, would be God's champion and conquer the sorcerers. To <b>pre-empt</b> the prophecy, the sorcerers kill the Hodeirah family. Unknown to them, Thalaba was able to escape from harm with his mother Zeinab. They flee through the desert and arrive at Irem, a ruined city. After Zeinab dies, Thalaba is raised by a leader of Irem named Moath. The sorcerers find out that Thalaba is still alive, and Abdaldar, one of their members, goes to find out Thalaba's location. When Abdaldar arrives, he is stopped a simoom, a sand storm, and his magic ring is lost. Thalaba finds the ring, which grants him great power.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War, Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge communists {{had formed}} an {{alliance}} to fight U.S.-backed regimes {{in their respective}} countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to <b>pre-empt</b> {{an attempt by the}} Vietnamese to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer Rouge, began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc. In spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. As such, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978, the Vietnamese military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved—the Khmer Rouge remained unwilling to seriously negotiate.|$|E
