To apply Theorem 1 to smart metering, i.e., a {{distributed}} setting, we use the gamma distribution suggested for distributed noise generation by Ács et al. (Acs and Castelluccia 2011). The following Lemma 1 leads to the generation of gamma noise that satisfies the Laplace mechanism. We use this divisibility to formulate a distributed differentially <b>private</b> <b>metering</b> process in “Differentially <b>private</b> <b>metering</b> process” section.|$|R

The differentially <b>private</b> <b>metering</b> process is detailed in “Differentially <b>private</b> <b>metering</b> process” section. The customer interprets the privacy level coupled with the tariff by deriving her own effective privacy protection in terms of Differential Identifiability. Using that assessment, she can perform an informed decision about her energy tariff and how much privacy she is willing to trade. This is described in “Application of differential privacy” section.|$|R

The property owner or manager then places their own <b>private</b> <b>meters</b> on individual tenant spaces to determine individual usage levels and bill each tenant for their share. In some cases, the landlord might add the usage cost to the regular rent or lease bill. In other cases, a third party might read, bill, and possibly even collect for the service.

Unmetered autos ply across the city charging flat rates. Economical alternative to the auto rickshaws are the share autos, in which passengers pay a shared fee to their destination. In 2012, according to estimates, 66,679 auto rickshaws and over 2,000 share autos were running in the city. Of these, about 10,000 are operated using diesel. About 41,700 auto rickshaws run on LPG.

30|$|In this paper, we {{discussed}} that energy providers {{are interested in}} smart metering data to refine the forecast of domestic loads of their customers. As this conflicts with the privacy loss incurred by the acquisition of individual load profiles, we designed a differentially <b>private</b> <b>metering</b> process based on building blocks already proposed in previous works. Using three well-documented load forecasting approaches, we evaluate whether using smart metering data provides an actual benefit for the energy provider. We found {{out that this is}} not always the case and that the forecasting approaches are variously susceptible to noise. If smart metering data actually provides a utility to the energy provider, Differential Privacy allows to gradually trade-off utility against forecasting performance. Our results show that for one forecasting approach, reasonable utility can be reached while providing a strong privacy guarantee. In that case, Differential Identifiability even provides an intuitive interpretation of the amount of privacy loss.|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} natural {{extensions}} to the presented work: Firstly, for utility evaluation, we used three well-documented point forecasting methods. Point forecasting outputs {{only a single}} (the likeliest) load value for one time interval. An extension to this work would be to evaluate differentially <b>private</b> <b>metering</b> with probabilistic forecasting methods (cf. (Hong and Fan 2016)). Secondly, our concept perturbs and transmits the complete zonal time series to the energy provider and the forecasting model training is performed by the energy provider. In the future, we plan to integrate Differential Privacy directly into a distributed model training approach on the customer side using objective-function perturbation for less privacy loss and tighter guarantees. Thirdly, lowering the local sensitivity by minimizing the household’s peak load leads to a stronger privacy level. Incidentally, automatic energy management systems like the ones described in (Egarter et al. 2014) and (Mauser et al. 2016) are able to shift controllable loads or control battery storages and {{combined heat and power}} plants to facilitate this idea. Fourthly, with the continual release of load data in practice, the privacy loss quantified by ε would slowly add up over the course of time. To be aware of one owns privacy situation, one needs to keep track of how much privacy was already leaked to which party. The data custodian proposed by (Rigoll and Schmeck 2017) provides such an accounting service. Finally, the perturbed data could be filtered (e.g., using moving average or Kalman filters) to compensate the noise as already proposed in (Bao and Lu 2015; Eibl and Engel 2017).|$|R
30|$|Several {{important}} points have to considered when our concept {{is to be}} applied safely in practice: Firstly, there is no privacy guarantee for individual smart metering data of a single household. In particular, the sum of individual load and Gamma noise is still sensitive, therefore secure aggregation with other households is crucial. That is why we stated homomorphic encryption and masking or mixing as minimum requirement (cf. “Differentially <b>private</b> <b>metering</b> and load forecasting” section). Secondly, we considered privacy guarantees from a static snapshot of the scenario when the energy provider has collected approximately 4.5 years of zonal load profiles. Applying our approach in practice continuously would mean that the privacy guarantee is stronger if less than 4.5 years of data was collected from the customer. After 4.5 years our evaluated privacy guarantees would slowly degenerate. Thirdly and tightly connected to the second point, the historic and forecasted load profiles of our used data set were given with hourly readout intervals. However in Europe, load profiles are acquired in 15 min intervals. Our findings also apply to this case with the only difference that the privacy guarantee would hold for slightly more than one year instead of 4.5 years. Finally, if the privacy level offered by the energy provider is not high enough to protect the electricity usage of the whole household, the protection can still be interpreted for single household appliances. In this case, one has to be aware that the usage of this single appliance is not allowed to correlate to the (parallel) usage of other appliances.|$|R

Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) {{enables a}} set of users to {{evaluate}} certain functionalities on their respective inputs while keeping these inputs encrypted throughout the computation. Inmanyscenarios, however, outsourcingthesecomputations toanuntrustedserver is desirable, sothattheservercanperform thecomputationonbehalfoftheusers. Unfortunately, existing solutions are either inefficient, rely heavily on user interaction, or require the inputs to be encrypted under the same key—drawbacks making the employment in practice very limited. We propose the first general-purpose construction that avoids all these drawbacks: it is efficient, it requires no user interaction whatsoever (except for data up- and download), and it allows evaluating any dynamically chosen function on inputs encrypted under different independent public keys. Our solution assumes the existence of two non-colluding but untrusted servers that jointly perform the computation {{by means of a}} cryptographic protocol. This protocol is provably secure in the semi-honest model. We demonstrate the applicability of our result in two real-world scenarios from different domains: Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition and <b>Private</b> Smart <b>Metering.</b> Finally, we give a performance analysis of our general-purpose construction to highlight its practicability...|$|R

In many applications, however, outsourcing these computations to an untrusted server is desirable, so that the server can perform the computation {{on behalf of the}} users. Unfortunately, existing solutions are either inefficient, rely heavily on user interaction, or require the inputs to be encrypted under the same public key - drawbacks making the employment in practice very limited. We propose a novel technique based on additively homomorphic encryption that avoids all these drawbacks. This method is efficient, requires no user interaction whatsoever (except for data upload and download), and allows evaluating any dynamically chosen function on inputs encrypted under different public keys. Our solution assumes the existence of two non-colluding but untrusted servers that jointly perform the computation by means of a cryptographic protocol. This protocol is proven to be secure in the semi-honest model. By developing application-tailored variants of our approach, we demonstrate its versatility and apply it in two real-world scenarios from different domains, privacy-preserving face recognition and <b>private</b> smart <b>metering.</b> We also give a proof-of-concept implementation to highlight its feasibility...|$|R
40|$|Restructuring the {{electricity}} market may secure efficiencies by {{moving away from}} cost-of-service regulation, with typically (but not necessarily) time-invariant prices, and allowing prices to reflect how costs change. Charging "real time" prices requires that electricity use be measured according to when one uses it. Arguments that such real-time metering should be a policy objective promoted by subsidizing meters or delaying restructuring until meters are installed, require more than these potential benefits. They require positive externalities to imply that too few meters would be installed through <b>private</b> transactions. Real-time <b>metering</b> presents no systematic externalities when utilities must serve peak period users, and may present negative externalities under some conditions. Positive externalities are likely when electricity is rationed through blackouts.

30|$|The closest {{related to}} our work are {{differentially}} <b>private</b> smart <b>metering</b> concepts. Ács and Castelluccia {{were the first}} to apply Differential Privacy on smart metering data. In their work (Acs and Castelluccia 2011), a distributed Laplace mechanism is applied using Gamma distributions before the data is mixed with other smart meters in an aggregation group. Bao and Lu (2015) investigated further the security and fault tolerance properties of the aggregation and mixing protocol. Eibl and Engel (2017) introduced post-processing to be applied on the perturbed data to improve the utility while still guaranteeing the same privacy level. They also discuss the required number of households in an aggregation group in order to be useful to the data analyst. Böhler et al. (2017) suggest using Differential Privacy with relaxed sensitivity and a privacy-preserving correction algorithm in IoT scenarios to still allow outlier detection while protecting the majority of households. Barbosa et al. (2016) also discussed filtering techniques to improve utility after the noise has been added to the aggregate. Their work evaluates the protection of individual appliances in single households by considering multiple device sensitivities in load profiles and by using Differential Identifiability. However, they do not address the compatibility condition m= 2 to allow utilizing Differential Identifiability in Differential Privacy scenarios. Besides Differential Identifiability, another method for rationally choosing ε was proposed in (Hsu et al. 2014). Yet, this approach is purely economically driven and introduces a handful of new parameters depending again on subjective assumptions on a given scenario. In contrast, focusing more on unconditional privacy, we further analyze Differential Identifiability. From Ács et al. (2011) we borrowed the way how to generate Laplacian noise in a distributed way. While in (Acs and Castelluccia 2011) {{the focus is on the}} aggregation protocol, we further improve composition and connect to Differential Identifiability and load forecasting with utility guarantees.|$|R
40|$|What {{economic}} and political factors have made cost recovery for rural water systems so difficult in the Nsuuka district of Anambra State? This paper found that households in the region {{do not want to}} pay for water in advance or commit themselves to a fixed monthly payment for water. They want the freedom to buy water only when they use it - partly because {{they do not want to}} buy water in the rainy season and partly because they want control of their cash flow in the event of more pressing needs. Equally important, they do not trust the government to provide a reliable public water supply. If required to pay a fixed fee every month, households are willing to pay only relatively small amounts for improved services. Current arrangements for cost recovery - fixed monthly fees for both public taps and unmetered private connections - are inappropriate. Kiosk systems or kiosk systems with <b>metered</b> <b>private</b> connections for some households are the most promising way to improve cost recovery and meet consumers's cash flow needs. Kiosk systems can provide less expensive, more reliable, and better quality water than water vendors do. It is not yet possible to generalize these results to other parts of Nigeria or other developing countries, but the advantages are likely to be equally valid in many other places.

40|$|International audienceThe reclaiming by Paris of {{its water}} back into public hands is a paradox in the {{homeland}} of transnational water companies {{and at a}} time when the European Commission rather favours the liberalisation of public services of general economic interest. Yet what has happened is more complex. A quick historical review of management formulas in Europe reveals both the specific model of delegation to private companies made in France, and also the maintained direct labour management formula (with direct public procurement by municipalities) used in several French cities to be presented. Paris has a long history of public procurement of water, whilst using a <b>private</b> company for <b>metering</b> and billing customers. Mayor Chirac changed to a semi-public company with public production and private distribution contracted out to two private companies (with responsibility for the right and left banks). Mayor Delanoë managed to reclaim the distribution in a commercial but public institution called an Établissement Public à caractère Industriel et Commercial (EPIC); this had unsuspected impacts on water supply issue in the suburbs. While Paris can obviously run its services directly, the emerging issue appears to be multi-level governance at the metropolitan level, rather than just a publicprivate debate. This paper also discusses in detail the arguments put forward by Anne le Strat, Deputy Mayor for Water, in favour of returning to public control, and presents the difficulties of assessing the performance of a service operator, under both delegation and direct management...|$|R
