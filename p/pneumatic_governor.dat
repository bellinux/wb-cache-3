50|$|Centrifugal: a {{flyweight}} mechanism {{driven by}} the engine {{is linked to the}} throttle and works against a spring in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>governor,</b> resulting in essentially identical operation. A centrifugal governor is more complex to design and produce than a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>governor.</b> However, the centrifugal design is more sensitive to speed changes and hence is better suited to engines that experience large fluctuations in loading.|$|E
50|$|The {{camshaft}} in the crankcase has {{a flange}} {{to hold the}} camshaft gear. Between this flange and the camshaft gear, the camshaft has another gear that drives the injection pump. In {{the center of the}} camshaft, a third gear drives the oil pump. The overhead valves have double valve springs; each cylinder has one inlet and one outlet valve of the same size. The valves are pushed by tappets, pushrods and rocker arms. The rocker arms, which are supported in bronze bearings, are lubricated by the wet sump lubrication system. They are secured with a horizontal screw each. The fuel is pumped to the injection nozzels by a Bosch size A injection pump, that is driven by the gear between the flange and camshaft gear on the camshaft. The injection pump has a Hele-Shaw clutch and a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>governor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic: the {{governor}} mechanism detects air {{flow from the}} flywheel blower used to cool an air-cooled engine. The typical design includes an air vane mounted inside the engine's blower housing and linked to the carburetor's throttle shaft. A spring pulls the throttle open and, as the engine gains speed, increased air flow from the blower forces the vane back against the spring, partially closing the throttle. Eventually a point of equilibrium will be reached and the engine will run at a relatively constant speed. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>governors</b> are simple in design and inexpensive to produce. However, they do not regulate engine speed very accurately and are affected by air density, as well as external conditions that may influence airflow.|$|R
