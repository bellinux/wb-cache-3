40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Electrical {{stimulation}} of the vagus nerves produces an excitatory contraction response in the isolated rat stomach. This contraction response was abolished by atropine to unmask the vagal inhibitory response (VIR) elicited during low frequency vagal stimulation. Babring and Gershon (1967), after working on guinea-pigs and mice, hypothesized that both serotonin (5 -HT) and acetylcholine (ACh) are neurotransmitters acting on the same ganglion cell in the vagal inhibitory pathway. This hypothesis {{for the role of}} 5 -HT was tested in the rat after the VIR of the isolated stomach was characterized. The hypothesis was tested with 5 -HT depletory, parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and reserpine, and a ganglionic blocking agent, hexamethonium (C₆). If the hypothesized role for 5 -HT is true, the depletion of 5 -HT from stomach tissues should influence the VIR. Furthermore, if both 5 -HT and ACh are neurotransmitters acting on the same ganglion cell in the vagal inhibitory pathway, the addition of C₆ should only block the action of ACh but not the actions of 5 -HT in the ganglia. Thus, vagal stimulation after the addition of C₆, in the presence of atropine, should still produce a VIR due to the action of 5 -HT. The VIR was present in all groups of rats tested and remained unchanged even though large amounts of 5 -HT were depleted from the stomach tissues. The possibility still exists that the small amounts of 5 -HT remaining after treatment with PCPA and reserpine could be sufficient to maintain the vagal inhibitory pathway. However, the VIR of the rat was completely abolished by C₆. These results indicate that serotonin is not involved either pre- or postganglionically in the vagal inhibitory pathway of the rat stomach. Stimulation of the vagus nerves of the in situ rat stomach elicited a gastric relaxation response in contrast to the contraction response observed with the isolated stomach. This in situ relaxation response was elicited by {{stimulation of}} the intact vagi as well as by peripheral vagal stimulation. The in situ relaxation response was characterized and an effort was made to determine the relationship between the in situ relaxation response and the VIR. Some experimental conditions which may influence the in situ relaxation response were investigated. The influence of age and sex, lowered body temperature, starvation and <b>partial</b> <b>evisceration</b> by removal of the intestines, on the in situ relaxation response were examined. None of the above conditions appeared to affect this response except the <b>partial</b> <b>evisceration</b> of the animal. The in situ relaxation response was abolished following the removal of the intestines and succeeding {{stimulation of the}} vagi elicited only gastric contractions. Subsequent treatment with guanethidine, reserpine and 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 - OHDA), all resulted in the reversal of the in situ relaxation response into a contraction response to vagal stimulation. Atropine abolished the contraction response to reveal the VIR. The evidence indicates that the in situ relaxation response is a composite response by three different gastric responses manifested in the following order of dominance: (1) an adrenergic inhibitory response, (2) a cholinergic excitatory response, (3) a non-adrenergic vagal inhibitory response...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 80 ’s, a {{systematic}} investigation was started {{of the series}} of mummies from Central and Southern Italy, in particular from important Renaissance depositions. Radiological exams were carried out on each individual, not only to determine the age at death of those subjects lacking any indication of age, but also to detect possible pathological findings. Furthermore, X-rays allow {{greater understanding of the}} techniques and the substances used for embalming, including the type of craniotomy, the <b>partial</b> or complete <b>evisceration,</b> and the identification of the embalming substances used to fill the body cavities. The great number of artificial mummies allowed the study of human embalming techniques, related to methods and procedures described by medical and non-medical authors in Early Modern age. The history of the art of mummification has been here reconstructed, from the ‘clyster’ techniques to the <b>partial</b> or total <b>evisceration</b> of the corpses, to the introvascular injection of drying and preserving liquors...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s a {{systematic}} investigation was begun by G. Fornaciari {{and his staff}} {{of a series of}} mummies from central and southern Italy, and in particular of important Renaissance remains. The study of a substantial number of artificial mummies has shed light on the human embalming techniques connected with the methods and procedures described by medical and non-medical authors in the early modern period. This has made it possible to reconstruct the history of the art of mummification, from the 'clyster' techniques to the <b>partial</b> or total <b>evisceration</b> of the corpse, to the intravascular injection of drying and preserving liquors. In addition to the bodies of Aragonese princes and members of the Neapolitan nobility, interred in the Basilica of San Domenico in Naples are the remains of important French personages dating to the modern age. Among the tombs arranged in two parallel rows {{to the right of the}} balcony are four sarcophagi containing the bodies of the wife and three children of Jean Antoine Michel Agar, who served as the Minister of Finance of the Kingdom of Naples from 1809 to 1815. The type of wrapping used for the corpses of the children presents strong analogies to those of ancient Egyptian mummies. © 2012 by Koninklijke Brill N. V., Leiden, The Netherlands...|$|R
