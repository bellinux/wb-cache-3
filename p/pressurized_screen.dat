40|$|Pressure {{sensitive}} adhesive (PSA) {{materials have}} significant {{negative impact on}} paper recycling. PSA materials are hard to remove in recycling and deposit on equipment and are retained in the product, severely hampering operations. This research had as an objective to evaluate if some PSA properties could be predictors of the removal of PSA materials with pressure screens in paper recycling. Several PSA materials were pulped, characterized for particle size and then subjected to a single slot screening experiment. The PSA materials properties of glass transition temperature, contact angle, yield strain, yield stress, and modulus were determined. Statistical modeling determined that the particle size after pulping was not significantly related to any individual PSA property. Statistical modeling determined that particle passage in a <b>pressurized</b> <b>screen</b> was negatively related to both yield stress and particle dimensions. A hot melt adhesive PSA had a very different screenability than did acrylate based adhesives. The hot melt adhesive was found to fold upon itself into a more spherical shape and to also to contain more attached fibers, in agreement with a higher tack for this adhesive than acrylate adhesives. The passage of the PSA adhesives particles could be modeled with moderate accuracy using a simple extrusion model. The model had yield stress as a fitting parameter and the calculated yield stress from the model was {{in agreement with the}} yield stresses measured for the PSA materials. These findings indicate that particle size and cohesive energy are critical to the design of PSA materials that will not extrude through a <b>pressurized</b> <b>screen...</b>|$|E

40|$|It is {{believed}} {{that in the next}} decade or so, several nuclear reactor pressure vessels (RPVs) may exceed the reference temperature limits set by the <b>pressurized</b> thermal shock <b>screening</b> criteria. One of the options to mitigate the effects of irradiation on RPVs is to thermally anneal them to restore the toughness properties that have been degraded by neutron irradiation. This paper summarizes recent experimental results from work performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to study the annealing response, or ``recovery`` of several irradiated RPV steels. The fracture toughness is one of the important properties used in the evaluation of the integrity of RPVs. Optimally, the fracture toughness is measured directly by fracture toughness specimens, such as compact tension or precracked Charpy specimens, but is often inferred from the results of Charpy V-notch impact specimens. The experimental results are compared to the predictions of models for embrittlement recovery which have been developed by Eason et al. Some of the issues in annealing that still need to be resolved are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{model of a}} passive pressure screen fish bypass system was evaluated at the University of Washington Harris Hydraulics Laboratory, Seattle, during 1984 and 1985. Stainless steel wedgewire screen inclined at 10. 5, 16. 5, or 30 degrees to horizontal, was tested in a Plexiglass conduit. Velocity profiles were measured by pitot tube traverses. Dye tracers were also released to visually track the streamline patterns. Fish were monitored by video camera and recorder as they passed through the <b>pressurized</b> model. The <b>screen</b> angles, water velocities, and screen types were varied. Scale loss was evaluated for smolted fish contacting the screen. Species tested included rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) and smolts of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and steelhead trout (S. gairdneri). Scale loss did not occur to coho, chinook, or steelhead smolts which contacted the screen. No delayed mortality was observed within 72 hours after testing. All fish were successfully passed when velocities through the model were maintained at greater than 5 feet (1. 5 m) per second. Small fish (fry size) passed through the model more swiftly than larger ones. Rainbow trout were used for impingement tests over a range of test section velocities from 3. 0 feet (0. 9 m) to 10 feet (3 m) per second Impingement was predictably produced or avoided by manipulation of velocities, and was most prevalent at test section velocities under 4 feet (1. 2 m) per second. Variations in the velocity vector perpendicular to the screen did not affect fish passage over the range tested of 0. 4 to 3. 0 feet (0. 1 to 0. 9 m) per second. [URL]...|$|R
