5|$|The couple's {{original}} {{plan was to}} fly into Asia; however, this was not accomplished due to the damaging of the plane and Meader's pregnancy with a second child, Timothy. The two returned to Kalamazoo in February 1938. In all, Meader took over 2,000 <b>photographs</b> <b>on</b> her two flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} {{continued through}} the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams in 1952–61. In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white <b>photographs</b> <b>on</b> board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.|$|E

5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original <b>photographs</b> <b>on</b> the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E
5|$|Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs) are two or {{more police}} {{officers}} who are deployed by UK police forces to gather intelligence {{on the ground and}} in some circumstances, to disrupt activists and deter anti-social behaviour. They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of overt surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled that they must justify retention of <b>photographs</b> <b>on</b> a case-by-case basis. Any retained information is recorded on the Crimint database.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted {{back and forth between}} views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between <b>photographs.</b> <b>On</b> February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from <b>photographs</b> <b>on</b> film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{then moved}} to Vaiden, Mississippi to film scenes set in the Carroll County Courthouse, where several courtroom scenes, as well as scenes set in Sheriff Ray Stuckey's office were filmed. The production moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a funeral procession. On April 11, 1988, the crew filmed a scene set in the Cedar Hill Cemetery. From April 15 to April 16, the production moved to the Mississippi River valley to depict the FBI and United States Navy's search for the three civil rights workers. The art department recreated a Choctaw Indian Village on the location, based on old <b>photographs.</b> <b>On</b> April 23, the crew filmed a scene depicting a Citizens' Councils rally with 750 extras. On April 25, the crew returned to Jackson, Mississippi, where an unused building was to recreate a diner that was found in Alabama during location scouting. A day later, Hackman and Dafoe filmed their opening scene, in which the characters Anderson and Ward drive to Jessup County, Mississippi.|$|E

25|$|In 1887, {{flash powder}} was invented, {{enabling}} journalists such as Jacob Riis to photograph informal subjects indoors, {{which led to}} the landmark work How the Other Half Lives.

25|$|As the {{enclosed}} lower level is {{more vulnerable to}} hazardous material (HAZMAT) incidents than the upper level, most HAZMATs have long been prohibited there. Following the September 11 attacks, the Port Authority also prohibited people from taking <b>photographs</b> <b>on</b> the premises of the bridge {{out of fear that}} terrorist groups might study photographs to plot an attack on the bridge, but the photography ban has since been lifted.|$|E
25|$|Muybridge often {{travelled}} back to England and Europe to publicise his work. The {{opening of}} the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, {{and the development of}} steamships made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the Royal Institution in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the Royal Family, notably the future King Edward VII. He displayed his <b>photographs</b> <b>on</b> screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{is often}} {{associated}} with the Black 1960 Les Paul Custom, with white/parchment (rather than black) coloured pick guard, featured in <b>photographs</b> <b>on</b> the Live and Dangerous album and subsequent video.

The pickups are without the normal German-silver pick-up covers.|$|E
