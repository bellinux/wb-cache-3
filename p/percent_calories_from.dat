40|$|Self-monitoring has {{traditionally}} been done using a paper record, which can be tedious and burdensome. A personal digital assistant (PDA) with dietary software can provide an alternative to a paper record. The study aimed to describe the differences in dietary changes at 6 months between participants randomly assigned to use a paper record or PDA for self-monitoring in a clinical trial of weight-loss treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and changes in weight and diet were assessed between 2006 and 2009. The sample (n= 192) was 84 % female and 78 % white, {{with a mean age}} of 49 years and body mass index (calculated as kg/m 2) of 34. 1. At baseline, the groups did not differ in energy intake, <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat, and number of servings of the examined food groups. At 6 months, both groups had significant reductions in weight, energy intake, and <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> total fat and saturated fatty acids (P < 0. 001); no between-group differences were found. Compared to the paper record group, the PDA group significantly increased consumption of fruit (P= 0. 02) and vegetables (P= 0. 04) and decreased consumption of refined grains (P= 0. 02). Interactions among self-monitoring and the two groups were found in relation to changes in <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> total fat (P= 0. 02), monounsaturated fatty acids (P= 0. 002), and trans-fatty acids (P= 0. 04). Frequent self-monitoring was significantly associated with total sugar (P= 0. 02) and added sugar (P= 0. 01) intake in both groups. Our findings suggest that use of a PDA for self-monitoring might improve self-awareness of behavior and dietary changes. © 2011 American Dietetic Association...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to describe the associations of number of eating episodes and proportion of meals eaten away from home with total serum cholesterol. Data from 499 participants, recruited from a health maintenance organization in central Massachusetts, aged 20 - 70, were used for this analysis. Dietary information and total blood cholesterol were obtained at five sampling points (baseline and four consecutive quarters) during the one-year follow-up. A cross-sectional study was conducted. The results from the study {{do not support the}} hypothesis that the number of eating episodes per day is associated with total blood cholesterol. However, we noted that the mean concentration of total cholesterol decreased with increasing number of eating episodes among women, although the adjusted mean among three categories of number of eating episodes per day was not statistically significant. On the other hand, the results of our study suggest that increased frequency of meals (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) eaten away from home is positively associated with mean total blood cholesterol concentration. Furthermore, meals eaten away from home, especially breakfast and dinner, were significantly higher in total calories, and <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> total and saturated fat, but lower in <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> protein and carbohydrate, and grams of fiber, than corresponding meals eaten at home.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background: A {{full time}} {{child-care}} program {{is expected to}} provide at least one-half to two-thirds of a child's daily nutrient requirements. As such, child-care settings have been acknowledged as an important setting for the assurance of children's nutrition and {{for the prevention of}} childhood obesity. It has been suggested that an increase in the use of in-house food preparation in child-care settings could improve the nutrient profile of menus and decrease food costs. However, a limited number of studies have examined the effect of meal preparation time on nutritional quality and food expenditure in the general population, and no studies have assessed this relationship in child-care settings. Objective: To investigate the association between meal preparation time and food expenditure and nutritional quality of menus in family child-care homes. Methods: Fifty-nine family child-care providers participated in this study. Participants recorded time spent in meal preparation and menus served over a period of five consecutive days of operation, and collected receipts for food items purchased. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of breakfast and lunch preparation time with each - food expenditure, and nutritional quality of the menu adjusting for covariates. Nutritional quality of the menu was quantified using mean adequacy ratio (MAR), sodium Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) ratio, <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> sugar, and <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> trans fat. Results: There was no observed relationship between breakfast preparation time and food expenditure (p = 0. 499), although there was an inverse trend between lunch preparation time and lunch food expenditure (p = 0. 110). There was no statistically significant relationship between breakfast or lunch preparation time and indicators of nutritional quality of the menus. There was a direct trend between breakfast preparation time and percent of calories from trans fat (p = 0. 073) and a direct trend between lunch preparation time and MAR (p = 0. 073). Conclusion: In this sample, there is insufficient evidence to posit that there is a relationship between time spent in food preparation and food expenditure or measures of the nutritional quality of menus. Future research is needed to understand the role of time spent in food preparation in determining food expenditure and nutritional quality of the menus served at family child-care homes...|$|E

The aims of this study were to assess the association of antidepressant use with energy intake, macronutrient diet composition, and physical activity. We used data on medication use, energy intake, diet composition, and physical activity for 3073 eligible adults from the 2005 – 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Potential confounding variables, including depression symptoms, were included in the models assessing energy intake, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Antidepressant users reported consuming an additional (mean ± S. E.) 215 ± 73 kcal/day compared to non-users (p = 0. 01). There were no differences in <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> sugar, fat, or alcohol between the two groups.

40|$|Rates of {{overweight}} and obesity {{continue to rise}} each year with serious associated health risks. This {{study was conducted to}} explore gender differences between behavior change variables for both dietary fat reduction and exercise behaviors in a weight loss population. This research also investigated relationships between these psychosocial behavior change variables. Over 300 overweight and obese men and women enrolled in weight loss programs in the greater Boston area completed self-administered surveys. The behavior change variables surveyed included validated Transtheoretical Model (TTM) measures of stage of change for dietary fat reduction, situational confidence and temptation for dietary fat reduction, as well as the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire restraint scale (TFEQ-R). Exercise variables included stage of change and situational confidence. Although significant gender differences were detected by multivariate analysis of variance (p 3 ̆c. 05), weak effect sizes suggest that gender differences for dietary confidence, temptations, or restraint were not clinically relevant. Gender was not found to {{have a significant effect on}} exercise confidence (p 3 ̆e. 05). Stage of change was found to have a significant and strong effect on each of the dietary and exercise behavioral variables under investigation (p 3 ̆c. 05). Through structural equation modeling methods, dietary restraint was found to mediate the effect between the self-efficacy variables of dietary confidence and temptations and <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> fat intake. Restraint, however, was not found to be a moderator or have an interaction effect with self-efficacy variables affecting <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> fat intake. Dietary restraint was not found to be a moderating or mediating variable for the exercise behavior models under investigation. Dietary restraint has not been previously studied with regard to constructs of the TTM. Stage of change was found to have a strong and significant effect on predicting dietary restraint (p 3 ̆c. 001). Results of this study suggests that while men have higher confidence scores and lower scores for temptations and restraint, weight reduction programs do not need to change intervention techniques based on gender. Results also indicate that weight loss programs would benefit from first targeting self-efficacy behaviors which could thereby influence dietary restraint leading to behavior change such as dietary fat reduction. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Food {{insecurity}} among Mexican-origin and Hispanic households is {{a critical}} nutritional health issue of national importance. At the same time, nutrition-related health conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, are increasing in Mexican-origin youth. Risk factors for obesity and type 2 diabetes are more common in Mexican-origin children and include increased intakes of energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods. This study assessed the relationship between children's experience of food insecurity and nutrient intake from food and beverages among Mexican-origin children (age 6 - 11 y) who resided in Texas border colonias. Methods Baseline data from 50 Mexican-origin children were collected in the home by trained promotora -researchers. All survey (demographics and nine-item child food security measure) and 24 -hour dietary recall data were collected in Spanish. Dietary data were collected in person on three occasions using a multiple-pass approach; nutrient intakes were calculated with NDS-R software. Separate multiple regression models were individually fitted for total energy, protein, dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, potassium, sodium, Vitamin C, and percentage of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat and added sugars. Results Thirty-two children (64 %) reported low or very low food security. Few children met the recommendations for calcium, dietary fiber, and sodium; and none for potassium or vitamin D. Weekend intake was lower than weekday for calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and vitamin C; and higher for <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat. Three-day average dietary intakes of total <b>calories,</b> protein, and <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> added sugars increased with declining food security status.

40|$|Sugar {{consumption}} in the United States exceeds recommendations from the American Heart Association. Overconsumption of sugar is linked to risk for obesity and metabolic disease. Animal studies suggest that high-sugar diets alter functions in brain regions associated with reward processing, including the dorsal and ventral striatum. Human neuroimaging {{studies have shown that}} these regions are responsive to food cues, and that the gut-derived satiety hormones, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), and peptide YY (PYY), suppress striatal food-cue responsivity. We aimed to determine the associations between dietary added sugar intake, striatal responsivity to food cues, and postprandial GLP- 1 and PYY levels. Twenty-two lean volunteers underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan during which they viewed pictures of food and non-food items after a 12 -h fast. Before scanning, participants consumed a glucose drink. A subset of 19 participants underwent an additional fMRI session in which they consumed water as a control condition. Blood was sampled for GLP- 1, and PYY levels and hunger ratings were assessed before and ~ 75 [*]min after drink consumption. In-person 24 -h dietary recalls were collected from each participant on three to six separate occasions over a 2 -month period. Average <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> added sugar were calculated using information from 24 -h dietary recalls. A region-of-interest analysis was performed to compare the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to food vs. non-food cues in the bilateral dorsal striatum (caudate/putamen) and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens). The relationships between added sugar, striatal responses, and hormone changes after drink consumption were assessed using Spearman’s correlations. We observed a positive correlation between added sugar intake and BOLD response to food cues in the dorsal striatum and a similar trend in the nucleus accumbens after glucose, but not water, consumption. Added sugar intake was negatively associated with GLP- 1 response to glucose. Post hoc analysis revealed a negative correlation between GLP- 1 response to glucose and BOLD response to food cues in the dorsal striatum. Our findings suggest that habitual added sugar intake is related to increased striatal response to food cues and decreased GLP- 1 release following glucose intake, which could contribute to susceptibility to overeating...|$|E

In particular, eating breakfast away from home decreases intake of fruit, whole grains and dairy and increases the <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated fats and solid fats, alcohol and added sugar. Eating lunch and dinner away from home also reduce diet quality, affecting similar dietary components, with dinner away from home also reducing vegetable intake. Unlike past studies based on correlation analyses, this study shows how FAFH can have a causal impact on weight gain. obesity, food choice, obesity, fixed effects, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

The consumption of added sugars, which are sweeteners added to processed and prepared foods, has been associated with measures of cardiovascular disease risk among adolescents, including adverse cholesterol concentrations (1). Although the <b>percent</b> of daily <b>calories</b> derived <b>from</b> added sugars declined between 1999 – 2000 and 2007 – 2008 (2), consumption of added sugars remains high in the diets of Americans. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommend limiting total intake of discretionary calories, which include added sugars and solid fats, to 5 %– 15 % of daily caloric intake (3), yet many Americans continue to exceed these recommendations (2).

40|$|Objective: To examine {{differences}} in diet and food purchasing behaviors between Black and White older {{women living in}} urban neighborhoods. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Urban neighborhoods in Washington, DC, USA. Participants: Community-dwelling White and Black women of age 65 and older. Measurements: Participants were queried on diet via 24 -hour recalls, food purchasing habits, their use of neighborhood resources and local travel patterns. Frequency and location of self-reported food purchasing and consumption were compared by race. Results: In 2014 and 2015, 49 White and 44 Black older women {{were enrolled in the}} study. Compared to Whites, Blacks reported lower daily caloric intake (mean (SD) 1314 (404) vs. 1529 (448), p= 0. 02), with a higher <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> protein and fat 1. 8 (7. 0), p= 0. 03), and a slightly higher polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio (p= 0. 05). Blacks had substantially lower alternate healthy eating index (AHEI) (33. 5 (10. 2) vs. 43. 9 (10. 8) of 80 possible points. Conclusions: In an urban setting, food consumption and purchasing behaviors differed substantially between older Black and White women, which should be further investigated and considered to promote healthy eating in older populations...|$|R
40|$|Food {{away from}} home (FAFH) has been {{associated}} with poor diet quality in many studies. It is difficult, however, to measure the effect of FAFH on diet quality since many unobserved factors, such as food preferences and time constraints, influence not just our choice of where to eat but also the nutritional quality of what we eat. Using data from 1994 - 96 and 2003 - 04, this study applies fixed-effects estimation to control for such unobservable influences and finds that, for the average adult, FAFH increases daily caloric intake and reduces diet quality. The effects vary depending on which meals are consumed {{away from home}}. On average, breakfast away from home decreases the number of servings of whole grains and dairy consumed per 1, 000 calories and increases the <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated and solid fat, alcohol, and added sugar (SoFAAS) in a day. Dinner away from home reduces the number of servings of vegetables consumed per 1, 000 calories for the average adult. Breakfast and lunch away <b>from</b> home increase <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated fat and SoFAAS on average more among dieters than among nondieters. Some of the overall negative dietary effects decreased between 1994 - 96 and 2003 - 04, including those on whole grain, sodium, and vegetable consumption.

40|$|Abstract Background Overweight {{increased}} among Filipino {{mothers and}} offspring from 1994 to 2005 however, {{a higher rate}} of increase among mothers resulted in a prevalence 4 times higher than that among offspring in 2005. Our aim was to explore the differential effects of changing income, assets, maternal education, and urbanicity on dietary behaviors of mothers and offspring that may affect overweight risk. Methods The study included a cohort of Filipino offspring and their mothers participating in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey at four time points from 1994 (n = 1, 885 pairs) to 2005 (n = 1, 349 pairs). The effect of socioeconomic factors and urbanicity, on dietary behaviors including energy adequacy, percent fat and carbohydrates were examined using longitudinal random-effects regression models. Results Mothers and offspring were consistently more likely to consume more calories relative to basal needs as well as a higher <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat and a lower percent from carbohydrates with higher socioeconomic status and urbanization. Despite the substantially higher rates of overweight among mothers compared to offspring, offspring consumed a significantly more obesogenic diet than mothers experiencing the same increases in wealth and urbanicity. Conclusion Family-based interventions should be developed to counteract the shift towards a more obesogenic diet observed for both Filipino mothers and offspring. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} study, eleven healthy human adults were fed a {{constant}} laboratory-controlled diet providing 30 <b>percent</b> of the <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat. Two-thirds {{of the fat}} (20 {{percent of the total}} dietary fat) in each period for each subject was provided by one of the four test oils: palm oil, soybean oil, palm olein oil and palm stearin oil. All treatments resulted in a low level of T-chol, LDL, VLDL, HDL, triglyceride and phospholipid compared to normal recommended upper values of 200, 40, 130, 65, 250 and 250 mg/dl, respectively. The different types of palm oil showed higher fecal fat excretion in comparison to soybean oil treatment. Results of this study indicated significant differences in blood serum lipid concentrations and in fecal fatty acid excretions due to alterations in dietary fats. However the alterations in total fecal fat and in fatty acid excretions were too small to account for the lower blood serum lipid values observed in study. ^ In the second study, ten healthy adult human subjects were fed a constant laboratory-controlled diet providing 30 <b>percent</b> of the <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat; however, two-thirds of the fat (20 percent of the total dietary fat) in each period for each subject was provided by one of the four test oils: palm oil, soybean oil plus palm olein oil (1 : 1), soybean oil plus palm stearin oil (1 : 1), soybean oil plus palm oil (1 : 1). The addition of soybean oil to the different types of palm oil did not show any significant increase in the mean blood cholesterol and lipoprotein levels of subjects. ^ In the third study, four different test oils were employed: palm oil, palm stearin oil, palm olein oil, and soybean oil to evaluate acceptability of fried chin chin. The three types of palm oil were shown by the evaluators to be more acceptable in flavor/odor and overall acceptability when compared to soybean oil. ...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four hour dietary {{recall data}} from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1976 - 80) were used to {{estimate}} the numbers of servings of fruit and vegetables consumed by Black and White adults, to examine the types of servings (e. g., potatoes, garden vegetables, fruit, and juice), and to estimate the mean intake of calories, fat, dietary fiber, and vitamins A and C by number of servings. An estimated 45 {{percent of the population}} had no servings of fruit or juice and 22 percent had no servings of a vegetable on the recall day. Only 27 percent consumed the three or more servings of vegetables and 29 percent had the two or more servings of fruit recommended by the US Departments of Agriculture and of Health and Human Services; 9 percent had both. Consumption was lower among Blacks than Whites. The choice of vegetables lacked variety. Diets including at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit contained about 17 grams of dietary fiber. Although caloric and fat intake increased with increasing servings of fruit and vegetables, the <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat remained relatively constant. Although these data are 10 years old, more recent surveys have shown similar results.

40|$|The {{concept of}} food {{addiction}} (FA) is a potentially important contributing factor {{to the development}} of obesity in the general population; however, {{little is known about the}} hormonal and dietary differences between obesity with and without FA. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore potential biomarkers, including various hormones and neuropeptides, which regulate appetite and metabolism, and dietary components that could potentially differentiate obesity with and without FA. Of the 737 adults recruited from the general Newfoundland population, 58 food-addicted and non-food-addicted overweight/obese individuals (FAO, NFO) matched for age, sex, BMI and physical activity were selected. A total of 34 neuropeptides, gut hormones, pituitary polypeptide hormones and adipokines were measured in fasting serum. We found that the FAO group had lower levels of TSH, TNF-α and amylin, but higher levels of prolactin, as compared to NFO group. The total calorie intake (per kg body weight), the dietary intake of fat (per g/kg body weight, per BMI and per percentage of trunk fat) and the <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> intake <b>from</b> fat and carbohydrates (g/kg) was higher in the FAO group compared to the NFO group. The FAO subjects consumed more sugar, minerals (including sodium, potassium, calcium and selenium), fat and its components (such as saturated, monounsaturated and trans fat), omega 3 and 6, vitamin D and gamma-tocopherol compared to the NFO group. To our knowledge, this is the first study indicating possible differences in hormonal levels and micro-nutrient intakes between obese individuals classified with and without food addiction. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which FA could contribute to obesity...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{ascertain}} its possible use as an alternative fuel substrate in total parenteral nutrition, sebacate (Sb) metabolism was studied in seven overnight-fasting healthy male volunteers, who received a constant iv infusion (99 mmoles over 8 hours) of disodium sebacate. Sb oxidation rate was determined using an isotopic sebacate (disodic salt of (1 - 10) 14 C-sebacic acid) infusion (100 mu Ci from the fourth to the eighth hour of the cold sebacate infusion). Blood samples were collected during and after sebacate infusion at intervals of 30 minutes and Sb serum concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Excreted radioactivity (mu Ci/min) was measured by bubbling the expired air into an apparatus containing 3 mEq hyamine to trap CO 2 from a 20 -L Douglas-bag. CO 2 production and O 2 consumption were measured before and at 4 and 8 hours after starting the infusion. Twenty-four hour nitrogen excretion with urine was obtained. The RQ and the <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> derived <b>from</b> lipid oxidation were calculated by indirect calorimetry. The Sb serum level at the plateau phase was (mean +/- SD) 4. 54 +/- 0. 71 mumole/mL, the overall rate of tissue uptake was 180. 89 +/- 4. 50 mumole/min, and the percent oxidation was 6. 14 +/- 0. 44 %. At the end of Sb infusion the RQ dropped to 0. 839 +/- 0. 043, the <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> due to sebacate oxidation was 1. 59 +/- 0. 52 %, and the <b>calories</b> derived <b>from</b> lipids increased to 37. 77 +/- 12. 90 %.

40|$|International audienceShared {{environmental}} factors may confer to spouses a similar risk for cardiovascular disease. We aimed at investigating in pairs the concordance in {{risk factors for}} cardiovascular disease and in global risk of cardiovascular events. In {{the framework of the}} IMMIDIET Project, married couples, recruited randomly from general practice, were studied. One thousand six hundred and four apparently healthy subjects aged 25 - 74 years from three different European populations were enrolled. Individual cardiovascular risks were estimated using SCORE risk equations. Age was strongly correlated within couples (r = 0. 86, P < 0. 0001). In multivariate model, within-pair correlation was high for social status (r = 0. 49; percentage of explained variation = 24 %) and <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> lipids (r = 0. 34; 12 %). Concerning conventional metabolic risk factors, percentage of explained variation varied from 0. 5 % (triglycerides) to 11 % (glucose). Among new risk factors, activated factor VII showed the strongest correlation (r = 0. 28) and C-reactive protein the lowest (r = 0. 13). Either total, coronary or non-coronary risk estimates at 10 years were strongly correlated within pairs: the risk of a member explained about two thirds of the cardiovascular risk of the partner. Spouse pairs share common lifestyle habits, common and new metabolic risk factors and the predicted global risk of cardiovascular events. If the individual risk of a person is influenced by the risk of his/her partner, decreasing the risk in a member of the pair should also decrease the risk in the partner. These concepts may have important public health consequences in targeting screening or disease prevention measures towards partners of people with cardiovascular risk...|$|R
