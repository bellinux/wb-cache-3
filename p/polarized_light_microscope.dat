Previous research showed that by using a <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> researchers were better able to detect haemozoin in mouse liver histology section. Thus, {{the aim of this}} research was to compare the haemozoin area observed by a conventional vs. simple <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> by using image processing analysis. A total of 40 images produced from both conventional light microscope and simple <b>polarized</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> were collected. All images were analyzed using ImageJ 1. 47 software to measure the haemozoin areas. Our results showed that non birefringent haemozoin and birefringent haemozoin area was significantly different. This was because when using conventional light microscope the brown area that contained images of non birefringent haemozoin images also contained Kupffer cells which appeared as the same brown color as haemozoin. In contrast, haemozoin gave bright effect and can be easily differentiated with Kupffer cells in the birefringent haemozoin images.

Similar structures also have been observed in the tissues of patients suffering from amyloid disorders. The ability of amyloid fibrils to form such higher-order assemblies supports the hypothesis that they represent a generic form of polypeptide structure with properties that are analogous to those of classical synthetic polymers...|$|R

The observation of thin sections under the <b>polarizing</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> reveals that the Honduran opal is characterized by pleochroism and sharp birefringence, together with striae, "twins" and zoning.

We probe that it is possible to induce orientation of the chromophores subjected to irradiation with UV/Vis light and that it is proportional to the amount of monomers without the OH group within the copolymers. This is so far a unique manifestation of polar ordering due to the syndiotactic lateral distribution of mesogens bearing an OH group in a tilted smectic C- 2 phase.

However, for many valuable and common specimens we observe a strong growing of non-destructive techniques coupled to the large chambers of modern microscopes including new chemical, molecular, luminescent, metrical, imaging and structural probes.

40|$|Frozen {{sections}} prepared {{from human}} aortic tissue containing fatty streak lesions were examined on a thermally controlled stage with a <b>polarizing</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> Distinct birefringent droplets, 0. 5 - 5 mum in diameter, were observed, many apparently aggregated into clusters. The clusters were about 20 X 20 mum in diameter (the approximate size of foam cells). Upon being heated, each smectic droplet exhibited a sudden change of birefringence, indicating {{a change of}} state. The transition temperatures were compared to assess compositional distributions in the tissue. We found that for 52 % of the clusters the standard deviation of the cluster's droplet melting point distribution was {{less than half that}} observed in the surrounding microscopic field. If clusters were intracellular lipid inclusions, this observation indicates that the lipid composition within a foam cell is more homogeneous than that of the overall field. However, using statistical methods, we compared droplet melting populations from cluster to cluster and found significant heterogeneity. The observations can be interpreted to suggest that many foam cells modify the cholesteryl ester fatty acid composition of their accumulations be selective uptake, temporal sampling, or chemical reaction. Furthermore, the intercellular heterogeneity suggests that different cells in the lesion may have different metabolic and transport enzyme affinities or be in different states...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregation}} of misfolded proteins into amyloid fibrils, and {{the importance}} of this step for various diseases, is well known. However, it is becoming apparent that the fibril is not the only structure that aggregating proteins of widely different types may adopt. Around the isoelectric point, when the net charge is essentially zero, rather monodisperse and quasi-amorphous nanoscale particles form. These particles are found to contain limited runs of β-sheet structure, but their overall organization is random. These nanoparticles have the potential to be useful for such applications as the slow release of drugs. The amyloid fibrils form away from the isoelectric point, but over certain ranges of, e. g., pH, the fibrils themselves do not exist freely, but form suprafibrillar aggregates termed spherulites. These consist of fibrils radiating from a central nucleus, and form by new species attaching to the ends of growing fibrils, rather than by the aggregation of pre-existing fibrils. Under the <b>polarizing</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> they exhibit a Maltese cross shape due to their symmetry. The rate of aggregation is determined by factors involving (at least) protein size, concentration, presence of salt and charge. The occurrence of spherulites, which have been found in vivo as well as in vitro, appears to be generic, although the factors which determine the equilibrium between free fibril and spherulite are not as yet clear...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} new {{approach}} to locate and quantify cryptotephra in sedimentary archives using a continuously-imaging Flow Cytometer and Microscope (FlowCAM_). The FlowCAM rapidly photographs particles flowing in suspension past a microscope lens and performs semi-automated analysis of particle images. It has had primarily biological applications, although the potential sedimentological applications are numerous. Here we test the ability of this instrument to image irregularly shaped, vesicular glass shards and to screen sediment samples for the presence of cryptotephra. First, reference samples of basalt and rhyolite tephra (sieved 3 ̆c 633 ̆emicrons) were analyzed with the FlowCAM, demonstrating the ability of the instrument to photograph individual tephra shards. The highest-quality images were used to create a reference library of tephra particles, against which other particle morphologies could be automatically compared. Lake sediment samples with known concentrations of tephra were then analyzed. The tephra image library was used to perform pattern recognition calculations, automatically distinguishing tephra-like images from other particles in the sediment samples. The number of tephra shards identified by the FlowCAM technique was compared to manual counting using a <b>polarizing</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> demonstrating that this rapid approach is capable of determining the relative concentrations of tephra in a given sediment sample. However, the FlowCAM systematically underestimates tephra concentrations relative to manual counts. We conclude that with a well-developed image library, the FlowCAM can be an effective tool for cryptotephra and sedimentological applications, but it may be inappropriate for large volume samples or if particle morphologies are outside the range of the image library...|$|R
