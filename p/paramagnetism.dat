5|$|Curium has {{peculiar}} magnetic properties. Whereas {{its neighbor}} element americium shows no deviation from Curie-Weiss <b>paramagnetism</b> {{in the entire}} temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 65–52 K, and β-Cm exhibits a ferrimagnetic transition at about 205 K. Meanwhile, curium pnictides show ferromagnetic transitions upon cooling: 244CmN and 244CmAs at 109 K, 248CmP at 73 K and 248CmSb at 162 K. The lanthanide analogue of curium, gadolinium, {{as well as its}} pnictides, also show magnetic transitions upon cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become ferromagnetic, and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.|$|E
25|$|Since the Fermi level must be {{identical}} for both bands, {{this means that}} there will be a small surplus of the type of spin in the band that moved downwards. This effect is a weak form of <b>paramagnetism</b> known as Pauli <b>paramagnetism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pauli <b>paramagnetism</b> {{is called}} after the {{physicist}} Wolfgang Pauli. Before Pauli's theory, {{the lack of}} a strong Curie <b>paramagnetism</b> in metals was a open problem as the leading free electron model could not account for this contribution without the use of quantum statistics.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} it is {{difficult}} to calculate the effective moment. For example, uranium(IV), f2, in the complex 2− has a measured effective moment of 2.2 μB, which includes a contribution from temperature-independent <b>paramagnetism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{field theory}} {{may be used}} to explain the {{relative}} stabilities of transition metal compounds of different coordination geometry, as well as {{the presence or absence of}} <b>paramagnetism,</b> whereas VSEPR may be used for complexes of main group element to predict geometry.|$|E
25|$|The Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem {{proves that}} there cannot be any {{diamagnetism}} or <b>paramagnetism</b> in a purely classical system. The paramagnetic response has then two possible quantum origins, either coming from permanents magnetic {{moments of the}} ions or from the spatial motion of the conduction electrons inside the material. Both description are given below.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{which are}} {{expected}} to be diamagnetic may exhibit this kind of weak <b>paramagnetism.</b> It arises from a second-order Zeeman effect in which additional splitting, proportional to the square of the field strength, occurs. It is difficult to observe as the compound inevitably also interacts with the magnetic field in the diamagnetic sense. Nevertheless, data are available for the permanganate ion. It is easier to observe in compounds of the heavier elements, such as uranyl compounds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Para{{magnetism}}</b> {{is a form}} of magnetism whereby certain {{materials are}} weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields {{in the direction of the}} applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.|$|E
25|$|Magnetochemistry is {{concerned}} with the magnetic properties of chemical compounds. Magnetic properties arise from the spin and orbital angular momentum of the electrons contained in a compound. Compounds are diamagnetic when they contain no unpaired electrons. Molecular compounds that contain one or more unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. The magnitude of the <b>paramagnetism</b> is expressed as an effective magnetic moment, μeff. For first-row transition metals the magnitude of μeff is, to a first approximation, a simple function of the number of unpaired electrons, the spin-only formula. In general, spin-orbit coupling causes μeff to deviate from the spin-only formula. For the heavier transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, spin-orbit coupling cannot be ignored. Exchange interaction can occur in clusters and infinite lattices, resulting in ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the relative orientations of the individual spins.|$|E
25|$|Some {{materials}} show induced magnetic {{behavior that}} follows a Curie type law but with exceptionally large {{values for the}} Curie constants. These materials are known as superparamagnets. They are characterized by a strong ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary <b>paramagnetism</b> (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu2Se2 or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.|$|E
25|$|A {{metal ion}} {{with a single}} {{unpaired}} electron, such as Cu2+, in a coordination complex provides the simplest illustration of the mechanism of <b>paramagnetism.</b> The individual metal ions are kept far apart by the ligands, {{so that there is}} no magnetic interaction between them. The system is said to be magnetically dilute. The magnetic dipoles of the atoms point in random directions. When a magnetic field is applied, first-order Zeeman splitting occurs. Atoms with spins aligned to the field slightly outnumber the atoms with non-aligned spins. In the first-order Zeeman effect the energy difference between the two states is proportional to the applied field strength. Denoting the energy difference as ΔE, the Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of the two populations as , where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in kelvins. In most cases ΔE is much smaller than kT and the exponential can be expanded as 1 – ΔE/kT. It follows from the presence of 1/T in this expression that the susceptibility is inversely proportional to temperature.|$|E
500|$|Drude's {{classical}} {{model was}} augmented by Wolfgang Pauli, Arnold Sommerfeld, Felix Bloch and other physicists. [...] Pauli {{realized that the}} free electrons in metal must obey the Fermi–Dirac statistics. [...] Using this idea, he developed the theory of <b>paramagnetism</b> in 1926. [...] Shortly after, Sommerfeld incorporated the Fermi–Dirac statistics into the free electron model and made it better able to explain the heat capacity. [...] Two years later, Bloch [...] used quantum mechanics to describe the motion of a quantum electron in a periodic lattice. The mathematics of crystal structures developed by Auguste Bravais, Yevgraf Fyodorov and others was used to classify crystals by their symmetry group, and tables of crystal structures were {{the basis for the}} series International Tables of Crystallography, first published in 1935. Band structure calculations was first used in 1930 to predict the properties of new materials, and in 1947 John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley developed the first semiconductor-based transistor, heralding a revolution in electronics.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Paramagnetism</b> {{is due to}} the {{presence}} of unpaired electrons in the material, so all atoms with incompletely filled atomic orbitals are paramagnetic. [...] Due to their spin, unpaired electrons have a magnetic dipole moment and act like tiny magnets. [...] An external magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction. [...] Paramagnetic materials include aluminium, oxygen, titanium, and iron oxide (FeO).|$|E
2500|$|For some {{alkali metals}} and noble metals, conductions {{electrons}} are weakly interacting and delocalized in space forming a Fermi gas. For this materials one {{contribution to the}} magnetic response [...] comes from the interaction with the electron spins and the magnetic field known as Pauli <b>paramagnetism.</b> For a small magnetic field , the additional energy per electron added from the interaction between an electron spin and the magnetic field is given by: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} three-electron bonding {{can be found}} in the helium dimer cation, [...] It is considered a [...] "half bond" [...] because it consists of only one shared electron (rather than two); in molecular orbital terms, the third electron is in an anti-bonding orbital which cancels out half of the bond formed by the other two electrons. Another example of a molecule containing a 3-electron bond, in addition to two 2-electron bonds, is nitric oxide, NO. The oxygen molecule, O2 can also be regarded as having two 3-electron bonds and one 2-electron bond, which accounts for its <b>paramagnetism</b> and its formal bond order of 2. Chlorine dioxide and its heavier analogues bromine dioxide and iodine dioxide also contain three-electron bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Constituent atoms or {{molecules}} of paramagnetic materials have permanent magnetic moments (dipoles), {{even in the}} absence of an applied field. The permanent moment generally is due to the spin of unpaired electrons in atomic or molecular electron orbitals (see Magnetic moment). [...] In pure <b>paramagnetism,</b> the [...] dipoles do not interact with one another and are randomly oriented in the absence of an external field due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net magnetic moment. When a magnetic field is applied, the dipoles will tend to align with the applied field, resulting in a net magnetic moment in the direction of the applied field. In the classical description, this alignment can be understood to occur due to a torque being provided on the magnetic moments by an applied field, which tries to align the dipoles parallel to the applied field. However, the true origins of the alignment can only be understood via the quantum-mechanical properties of spin and angular momentum.|$|E

The tendency to form a (homoeopolar) chemical bond (this means: {{the formation of a}} symmetric molecular orbital, i.e. with the + sign) results [...] through the Pauli principle automatically in an antisymmetric spin state (i.e. with the − sign). In contrast, the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, i.e. the tendency [...] that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion, would lead to an antisymmetric orbital function (i.e. with the − sign) of these two particles, and complementary to a symmetric spin function (i.e. with the + sign, one of the so-called [...] "triplet functions"). Thus, now the spins would be parallel (ferromagnetism in a solid, <b>paramagnetism</b> in two-atomic gases).|$|E
