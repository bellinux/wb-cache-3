25|$|Since {{the start}} of Operation Olive, Eighth Army had {{suffered}} 14,000 casualties. As a result, British battalions had to be reduced from four to three rifle companies due to a severe shortage of manpower. Facing the Eighth Army LXXVI Panzer Corps had suffered 16,000 casualties. As the Eighth Army <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of September to reorganise Leese was reassigned to command the Allied land forces in South-East Asia, and Lieutenant-General Richard L. McCreery was moved from commanding British X Corps {{to take over the}} army command.|$|E
25|$|The unfurling of the arrays {{started at}} 15:06 UTC, {{beginning}} with the channel 1B array. Commanding the unit from the station, Philips <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> halfway point, and allowed the array {{to rest in the}} sun for approximately 45 minutes, and then completed the extension. After successfully extending the 1B array, the astronauts started the 3B array extension at 16:35 UTC. The 3B array was expected to be more difficult to extend, as it had been packed in the blanket box for eight years. As with the first, a pause at halfway was performed to allow the arrays to heat up in the sun. While some stiction was seen, once the final extension began all the slats flattened out, and the arrays were fully deployed at 17:17 UTC. The addition of the final set of solar panels brings the station's power output to 120 kilowatts, and doubles the scientific power to 30 kilowatts. The station's surface area of the arrays is just under one acre, or 38,400 square feet.|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since an}} impromptu {{procession}} formed around Jefferson's second inauguration, every United States president except Ronald Reagan has paraded down the Avenue {{after taking the}} oath of office (Reagan paraded up the avenue for his first inauguration, in 1981, but not for the second in 1985 because of freezing temperatures which high winds made it dangerous). From William Henry Harrison to Gerald Ford, the funeral corteges of seven of the eight presidents who died in office and two former presidents followed this route. Franklin Roosevelt was the only president who died in office whose cortege did not follow this route. Lyndon B. Johnson and Ford were the former presidents whose funeral cortege followed this route. For LBJ, it was along the route from the Capitol to the National City Christian Church, where he worshiped often, because the funeral was held there. Ford's went up Pennsylvania Avenue because it <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House en route to the Washington National Cathedral, where the funeral was held. Abraham Lincoln's funeral cortege solemnly proceeded along Pennsylvania Avenue in 1865; only weeks later the end of the American Civil War was celebrated when the Army of the Potomac paraded more joyously along the avenue.|$|E
500|$|Canadian Paralympic athlete Rick Hansen, who had {{recruited}} Fox {{to play on}} {{his wheelchair}} basketball team in 1977, was similarly inspired by the Marathon of Hope. Hansen, who first considered circumnavigating the globe in his wheelchair in 1974, began the Man in Motion World Tour in 1985 {{with the goal of}} raising $10 million towards research into spinal cord injuries. As Fonyo had, Hansen <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spot Fox's run ended to honour the late runner. Hansen completed his world tour in May 1987 after 792 days and he travelled through 34 countries and raised over $26 million.|$|E
500|$|At around 11 a.m., Doubleday {{sent his}} reserve regiment, the 6th Wisconsin, an Iron Brigade regiment, {{commanded}} by Lt. Col. Rufus R. Dawes, {{north in the}} direction of Davis's disorganized brigade. The Wisconsin men <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fence along the pike and fired, which halted Davis's attack on Cutler's men and caused many of them to seek cover in the unfinished railroad cut. The 6th joined the 95th New York and the 84th New York (also known as the 14th Brooklyn), a [...] "demi-brigade" [...] commanded by Col. E.B. Fowler, along the pike. The three regiments charged to the railroad cut, where Davis's men were seeking cover. The majority of the 600-foot (180 m) cut (shown on the map as the center cut of three) was too deep to be an effective firing positionas deep as 15 feet (4.5 m). Making the situation more difficult was the absence of their overall commander, General Davis, whose location was unknown.|$|E

2500|$|In 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, {{returned}} to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs {{to attempt to}} reach the summit. The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within [...] of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second and final assault on the summit with its second climbing pair, the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali sherpa climber from Darjeeling, India. They reached the summit at 11:30 local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed {{a few years later}} that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first. They <b>paused</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.|$|E
