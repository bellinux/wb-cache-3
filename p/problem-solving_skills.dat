40|$|Abstract- Teaching {{computer}} programming to novices has always posed {{a major challenge}} to educators. Many novices acquire basic programming skills but {{they are unable to}} utilize them in a meaningful way to solve non-routine problems. As a result, they do not achieve any level of programming fluency. Collaboration has been identified as a useful tool to help overcome this problem if utilized at the right times during the programming/problem solving process. This paper presents a model for a synchronous gaming CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) application aimed at improving <b>problem-solving</b> <b>skill.</b> The model addresses some major issues in CSCL such as unequal participation among group members, increasing argumentative discussion and promoting positive interdependence and individual accountability. A game, Collaborative Online Problem Solving (COPS), which was developed using this model, is presented.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of case {{segmentation}} schemes in problem-based learning (PBL) on the development of <b>problem-solving</b> <b>skill,</b> self-directedness and technical knowledge. Seventy-four dental education students were randomly assigned to 12 PBL groups. Six groups experi-enced PBL cases that were formatted in short segments and six groups experienced PBL cases that were formatted in long segments. Pretest measures of <b>problem-solving</b> <b>skill,</b> self-direct-edness and technical knowledge were administered at the begin-ning of the Fall 1998 semester. Students studied three PBL cases in their assigned groups in the ensuing semester. Posttest mea-sures were administered at the conclusion of the semester. Analysis of the data found that students who experienced PBL with a short case segmentation scheme were better able to solve problems highly similar to the problems in the teaching cases than students who experienced PBL with a long case segmenta-tion scheme. No significant differences were found for self-directedness, technical knowledge, or ability to solve problems distinctly different from the teaching cases. Explanations of these findings and their implications for research and practice in PBL are discussed. Key words: problem-based learning; problem-solving instruction; case tutorials...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{outcome of}} formal {{education is the}} acquisition of knowledge that will facilitate domain specific <b>problem-solving</b> <b>skill.</b> Theories of human intelligence identify general reasoning as a cognitive ability that is strongly associated with solving novel problems where learning about the problem is necessary. This dissertation investigates individual differences, such as general reasoning, that may influence how an individual structures knowledge within a domain, such as bicycle gears, and subsequent <b>problem-solving</b> <b>skill.</b> Special focus is given to identifying the structural characteristics of the acquired bicycle gear knowledge and relating these characteristics to general reasoning and skill at solving bicycle gear problems. College participants (N = 174, 111 female) completed a general reasoning test, reported the bicycle parts they knew, and their mechanical self-efficacy was assessed before they watched a training video on bicycle gear adjustment. After training, {{the extent of their}} procedural knowledge was tested, the structure of their knowledge was elicited, and then their skill at fixing bicycle gear problems was tested. Professional bicycle mechanics (N = 3) were recruited to provide a criterion for evaluating the structural characteristics of bicycle gear knowledge. The results from regression analysis indicated that bicycle gear <b>problem-solving</b> <b>skill</b> had a stronger relation with how knowledge was structured, as compared to the extent of procedural knowledge, general reasoning, mechanical self-efficacy, or problem-solving effort. Regression analysis of knowledge structure indicated that general reasoning was associated with acquiring an expert-like knowledge structure, as was learning effort and pre-training bicycle part knowledge, but not mechanical self-efficacy. These results support the view that general reasoning is associated with problem solving because it facilitates the acquisition of knowledge that is structured similarly to experienced professionals. If it is the structure of knowledge that facilitates or hinders problem-solving, as suggested by this study’s results, mechanical training may be enhanced by an explicit focus on structuring knowledge to replicate that of experts. A focus on using educational materials that impart the desired knowledge structure may significantly reduce the need of general reasoning in achieving mechanical expertise...|$|R

500|$|Although {{some people}} who self-harm {{do not have any}} form of {{recognised}} mental disorder, many people experiencing various forms of mental illnesses do have a higher risk of self-harm. The key areas of disorder which exhibit an increased risk include autism spectrum disorders, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, phobias, and conduct disorders. Schizophrenia may also be a contributing factor for self-harm. Those diagnosed with schizophrenia have a high risk of suicide, which is particularly greater in younger patients as they may not have an insight into the serious effects that the disorder can have on their lives. Substance abuse is also considered a risk factor as are some personal characteristics such as poor <b>problem-solving</b> <b>skills</b> and impulsivity. There are parallels between self-harm and Münchausen syndrome, a psychiatric disorder in which individuals [...] illness or trauma. There may be a common ground of inner distress culminating in self-directed harm in a Münchausen patient. However, a desire to deceive medical personnel in order to gain treatment and attention is more important in Münchausen's than in self-harm.|$|E
500|$|Culverhouse {{quickly became}} one of the most {{influential}} NFL owners; he served as a member of the Player Club Relations Committee that handled player grievances, and of the NFL Congressional Committee. He was a member of the Executive Committee that handled negotiations during the 1982 NFL strike, an experience that earned him great praise from NFL negotiator Jack Donlan. Donlan praised Culverhouse's logic, analytical, and <b>problem-solving</b> <b>skills,</b> and his effectiveness [...] "at getting his way". Culverhouse was credited with having a big hand in the owners' course of direction during the strike, and was responsible for recruiting Donlan as negotiator. He repeated the role during the 1987 players' strike, after which NFLPA President Gene Upshaw described him as [...] "formidable", and said that [...] "at times, the whole league seemed to flow from this one guy". He was chairman of the NFL Finance Committee and the Management Council Executive Committee. His efforts were instrumental in bringing Super Bowl XVIII to Tampa, despite a lack of adequate hotel space in the city. Culverhouse was also a pioneer in using computers to handle team finances and scouting reports. He was a member of the four-man committee that stripped ownership of the New England Patriots from the Sullivan family when their debt became too great. Patriots founder Billy Sullivan later accused Culverhouse of blocking his effort to propose a stock sale that would have eased the debt. Culverhouse distanced himself from the NFL power core in later years, stung by other owners' criticisms of the Management Council. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue credited Culverhouse for building much of the strength and unity of the modern NFL.|$|E
