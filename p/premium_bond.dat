25|$|The Post Office Savings Bank was {{introduced}} in 1861, when there were few banks outside major towns. By 1863, 2,500 post offices were offering a savings service. Gradually more financial services were offered by post offices, including government stocks and bonds in 1880, insurance and annuities in 1888, and war savings certificates in 1916. In 1909 old age pensions were introduced, payable at post offices. In 1956 a lottery bond called the <b>Premium</b> <b>Bond</b> {{was introduced}}.|$|E

50|$|In {{simple terms}} the {{notional}} principal amount is essentially {{how much of}} the asset or bonds a person has. For example, if a <b>premium</b> <b>bond</b> was bought for £1 then the notional principal amount would be the face value amount of <b>premium</b> <b>bond</b> that your £1 was able to purchase. Hence the notional principal amount is the quantity of the assets and bonds.|$|E

50|$|<b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds</b> were {{introduced}} by Harold Macmillan in his Budget of 17 April 1956, to control inflation and {{encourage people to}} save. On 1 November 1956, {{in front of the}} Royal Exchange in the City of London, the Lord Mayor of London, Alderman Sir Cuthbert Ackroyd, bought the first bond from the Postmaster-General, Dr Charles Hill, for £1. Councillor William Crook, the mayor of Lytham St Anne's, bought the second. The <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds</b> office was based in St Annes-on-Sea until it moved to Blackpool in 1978.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Premium</b> <b>Bond</b> is {{a lottery}} bond {{issued by the}} United Kingdom {{government}}'s National Savings and Investments agency. The bonds are entered in a regular prize draw and the government promises to buy them back, on request, for their original price. The bonds were introduced by Harold Macmillan in 1956.|$|E
50|$|Harrell saved Seattle City Taxpayers $57 {{million by}} {{refinancing}} its revenue bonds.

50|$|Early lotteries {{were done}} by drawing numbers, or winning tickets, from a container. In the UK, numbers of winning <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds</b> (which were not {{strictly}} a lottery, but very similar in approach) were generated by an electronic machine called ERNIE.|$|R
50|$|NS&I's {{head office}} is in Pimlico, London, with {{operational}} sites in Blackpool, Glasgow and Durham. However, its entire {{back office operation}} is contracted out to a French company, Atos IT Solutions and Services. Until July 2011, the contract was held by Siemens IT and Solutions. In the past, it offered many of its services through post offices, and was founded in 1861 as a postal savings system. In November 2011, {{it was announced that}} most products would only be available by telephone, online, or by post. <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds</b> would be the only remaining product sold in post offices. From 1 August 2015, NS&I stopped selling <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds</b> through post offices, and became a purely direct business.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Harold Macmillan {{appointed}} Marples Postmaster General. At {{that time}} the telephone network was controlled by the General Post Office, and Marples introduced subscriber trunk dialling (STD), which eliminated the use of operators on national phone calls. On 2 June 1957, Marples started the first draw for the new <b>Premium</b> <b>Bond</b> scheme. He also introduced the first postcodes to the UK.|$|E

5000|$|The British system first {{offered only}} savings accounts. In 1880, it {{also became a}} retail outlet for {{government}} bonds, and in 1916 introduced war savings certificates, which were renamed National Savings Certificates in 1920.In 1956, it launched a lottery bond, the <b>Premium</b> <b>Bond,</b> which became its most popular savings certificate. [...] Post Office Savings Bank became National Savings Bank in 1969, later renamed National Savings and Investments (NS&I), an agency of HM Treasury. While continuing to offer National Savings services, the (then) General Post Office, created the National Giro in 1968 (privatized as Girobank and acquired by Alliance & Leicester in 1989).|$|E
50|$|Certain {{investments}} via {{the state}} owned National Savings scheme {{are not subject}} to tax including Index linked Certificates (up to £15,000 per issue) and <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds,</b> a scheme that issues monthly prizes in place of interest on individual holdings up to £40,000.|$|R
50|$|St Annes is the {{original}} home of <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds</b> and their prize-selecting computer ERNIE, which were situated on a site between Shepherd Road and Heyhouses Lane. <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds</b> operated from there for more than 40 years and then moved to Blackpool. The shopping area declined {{towards the end of}} the 20th century and was redeveloped in an attempt to attract more retailers and shoppers. As part of this project a restaurant quarter was established, centred around Wood Street. Work began on a £2m restoration project in Ashton Gardens, a park situated near the town centre. As this is where many of the activities for St Annes Carnival are held, the 2009 carnival was cancelled and the 2009 carnival queen's title was extended by one year.|$|R
50|$|The {{sixth and}} final series of Hugh and I showed Terry and Hugh on a cruise, Hugh having won £5,000 on the <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds.</b> In Hugh and I Spy, they have {{returned}} {{but they get}} unwillingly involved in espionage and double-dealing. Each episode ended in a cliffhanger.|$|R
5000|$|While Blackpool hosts a {{large number}} of small {{businesses}} and self-employed people, there are some large employers. The government-owned National Savings and Investments is based at Marton, together with their Hardware random number generator, ERNIE ( [...] "Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment"), which picks the <b>Premium</b> <b>Bond</b> numbers, while other government agencies are based at Warbreck and Norcross further up the Fylde coast. Burton's Biscuit Company Tangerine Confectionery produce biscuits and other confectionery products, Klarius UK manufactures automotive components, Victrex manufactures high performance polymers and the Glasdon Group is a plastics manufacturer making litter bins, park benches and reflective road signs.|$|E
50|$|After the Mini Market {{goes into}} admin Scarlett asks Molly to invest her <b>Premium</b> <b>Bond</b> {{winnings}} in the shop, {{leading to a}} family argument which apparently causes Big Bob to suffer a heart attack. It {{turns out to be}} merely a kidney stone but as he had to wait for special ambulances and equipment because of his weight (and was humiliated by some teenagers using their mobiles to film him as he was being carried to the ambulance) Big Bob finally decides to do something about it. Molly instead gives her winnings to him so he can go to rehab and Tom Urie leaves the show. Scarlett is furious as she feels Molly has broken her promise.|$|E
50|$|As {{postmaster}} general, he saw {{the introduction}} of the <b>Premium</b> <b>Bond</b> scheme and of postcodes. His period as Minister of Transport was controversial. He both oversaw significant construction (he opened the first section of the M1 motorway) and the closure of a considerable portion of the national railway network with the Beeching cuts. His involvement in the road construction business Marples Ridgway, of which he had been managing director, was one of repeated concern regarding possible conflict of interest. It was Marples who appointed Richard Beeching to head British Railways. Beeching went on to publish a report which closed more than 4,000 miles of railway lines in the UK with a resulting rise in the amount of road traffic.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{innovations}} at the Treasury was {{the introduction}} of <b>premium</b> <b>bonds,</b> announced in his budget of 17 April 1956. Although the Labour Opposition initially decried them as a 'squalid raffle', they proved an immediate hit with the public, with £1,000 won in the first prize draw in June 1957.|$|R
50|$|Governments borrow {{by issuing}} bonds. In the UK, the {{government}} also borrows from individuals by offering bank accounts and <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds.</b> Government debt seems to be permanent. Indeed, the debt seemingly expands rather than being paid off. One strategy used by governments to reduce {{the value of the}} debt is to influence inflation.|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Brown {{discusses}} <b>Premium</b> <b>Bonds</b> {{in comparison}} with equity-linked, commodity-linked and other [...] "added risk" [...] bonds. His conclusion {{is that it makes}} little difference, either to a retail investor or from a theoretical finance perspective, whether the added risk comes from a random number generator or from fluctuations in financial markets.|$|R
