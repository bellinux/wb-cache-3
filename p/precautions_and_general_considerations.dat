40|$|Neural {{stimulation}} is {{a critical}} technique in treating neurological diseases and investigating brain functions. Traditional electrical stimulation uses electrodes to directly create intervening electric fields {{in the immediate vicinity}} of neural tissues. Second-generation stimulation techniques directly use light, magnetic fields or ultrasound in a non-contact manner. An emerging generation of non- or minimally invasive neural stimulation techniques is enabled by nanotechnology to achieve a high spatial resolution and cell-type specificity. In these techniques, a nanomaterial converts a remotely transmitted primary stimulus such as a light, magnetic or ultrasonic signal to a localized secondary stimulus such as an electric field or heat to stimulate neurons. The ease of surface modification and bio-conjugation of nanomaterials facilitates cell-type-specific targeting, designated placement and highly localized membrane activation. This review focuses on nanomaterial-enabled neural stimulation techniques primarily involving opto-electric, opto-thermal, magneto-electric, magneto-thermal and acousto-electric transduction mechanisms. Stimulation techniques based on other possible transduction schemes <b>and</b> <b>general</b> <b>consideration</b> for these emerging neurotechnologies are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction <b>and</b> <b>General</b> <b>Considerations</b> It is a {{great honor}} to present the keynote address at this March 2001 meeting of the Society for Nonlinear Dynamics in Economics. I thank James Ramsey for {{inviting}} me to join you and {{for the opportunity to}} share my ideas with you. Since the field of nonlinear dynamics is so broad, it is impractical to attempt to discuss the entire field. Thus, I have decided to limit my discussion to a description of my experiences with nonlinear dynamic models in some of my past research projects. As will be seen, in each instance the nonlinear properties of models were critical in achieving the goals of these research projects. The first project, undertaken in the late 1950 's jointly with James Crutchfield involved the economic evaluation of the world's most famous marine conservation program, the International Pacific Halibut Conservation Program.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the preliminary results of field investigations of pesticide behaviour in the UK, Barbados and Sri Lanka. Field observations of groundwater pesticide concentrations {{in these studies}} range up to 100 µg/L, but are commonly less than 5 µg/L. The risk of pesticide concentrations in pumped water reaching 10 or 100 times guideline values from normal agricultural use at recommended application rates is probably small. Simple laboratory determinations of degradation rates support earlier studies <b>and</b> <b>general</b> <b>considerations</b> of subsurface environmental conditions suggest that pesticides {{are more likely to}} be persistent in groundwater than in soils. Simple modelling of the saturated zone movement of pesticides towards wells indicates that concentrations in pumped discharge are highly senstitive to aquifer porosity, pesticide half-life and extent of cultivated area. The greatest risk to groundwater from normal usage of pesticides in agriculture will occur where persistent compounds are applied over aquifers which are shallow, permeable and thin, and overlain by permeable soils...|$|R
