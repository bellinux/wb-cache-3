5|$|In John's gospel, Jesus and {{his disciples}} go to Judea early in Jesus' {{ministry}} before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. The Jesus Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information. According to the biblical historians at the Jesus Seminar, John likely had a larger {{presence in the}} <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> than Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Gompers of the AFL {{recognized}} that the strike was damaging the cause of labor in the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> and advised the strikers to return to work. Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. The strike proved a setback for labor unions, and the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, {{sending them to}} Nicholas Pocock {{to be used for}} Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the <b>public</b> <b>mind,</b> so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E

5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the <b>public</b> <b>mind,</b> as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
25|$|The Gospel of John remarks, in , that, though Jesus drew {{many people}} to his baptism, they still did not accept his testimony, and the Jesus Seminar concludes, {{on the basis of}} Josephus's accounts, that John the Baptist likely had a larger {{presence}} in the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> than Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{suicide of}} the People's Temple has helped embed {{the idea that}} all New Religious Movements are {{destructive}} in the <b>public</b> <b>mind.</b> Bryan R Wilson argues against that view {{by pointing out that}} only five such events have occurred in similar religious groups: the Branch Davidians, Solar Temple, Aum Shinrikyo and Heaven's Gate.|$|E

25|$|The disc {{companies}} had superior advertising and promotion, {{most notably the}} Victor Talking Machine Company in the United States and the Gramophone Company/HMV in the Commonwealth. Great singers like Enrico Caruso were hired to record exclusively, helping put the idea in the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> that that company's product was superior. Edison tried {{to get into the}} disc market with hill-and-dale discs, Edison Disc Records.|$|E
25|$|When {{the news}} reached Europe, Christians were horrified and Pope Sergius IV sent a {{circular}} letter to all churches {{calling for a}} holy fight in the Middle East and expulsion of Muslims from the Holy land. The events would later be recalled by Pope Urban II in his preaching for the Crusade at Clermont. Although the crusades happened almost a century after the desecration and caused by various other complex political intrigues, it was {{still very much in}} the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> as a cause. It was considered so by William of Tyre.|$|E
25|$|Within a few years, {{the focus}} of {{spamming}} (and anti-spam efforts) moved chiefly to email, where it remains today. Arguably, the aggressive email spamming {{by a number of}} high-profile spammers such as Sanford Wallace of Cyber Promotions in the mid-to-late 1990s contributed to making spam predominantly an email phenomenon in the <b>public</b> <b>mind.</b> By 1999, Khan C. Smith, a well known hacker at the time, had begun to commercialize the bulk email industry and rallied thousands into the business by building more friendly bulk email software and providing internet access illegally hacked from major ISPs such as Earthlink and Botnets.|$|E

25|$|Naturism can {{sometimes}} contain aspects of eroticism, although {{the debate about}} this is often simplified and seen negatively {{in the media and}} the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience and discussion of erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.|$|E
25|$|Years {{after the}} war, {{memories}} faded {{and in the}} <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> it became popular {{to assume that the}} few pillboxes and other concrete objects that could easily be seen were all that was done to defend Britain; that their purpose was just to bolster morale and that {{there would have been no}} realistic hope of resisting a German assault. Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E
25|$|The {{police were}} {{convinced}} that Chang was running a large operation and several staff from his restaurant were found selling drugs and convicted. He sold {{his interest in the}} Regent Street restaurant and opened the Palm Court Club in nearby Gerrard Street, in what is now London's Chinatown, but which then was just another London street. Police interest continued, however, and after a number of raids Chang was forced to move to Limehouse in October 1923, a poor area near the London docks that contained the original small Chinese community of London and which had been connected in the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> with opium smoking since Victorian times.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of the court's decision, {{months of}} {{unfavorable}} press reports fixed {{in much of}} the <b>public's</b> <b>mind</b> a certainty of McPherson's wrongdoing.

25|$|Vestiges was {{initially}} well received by polite Victorian society {{and became an}} international bestseller, but its unorthodox themes contradicted the natural theology fashionable {{at the time and}} were reviled by clergymen – and subsequently by scientists who readily found fault with its amateurish deficiencies. The ideas in the book were favoured by Radicals, but its presentation remained popular with a much wider public. Prince Albert read it aloud to Queen Victoria in 1845. Vestiges caused a shift in popular opinion which – Charles Darwin believed – prepared the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> for the scientific theories of evolution by natural selection which followed from the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859.|$|E
25|$|The {{reputation}} of the author was confirmed and extended by the appearance, in 1827, of Hope Leslie, the most decided favourite of all her novels. She wrote other things afterward, that {{in the opinion of}} some of the critics are superior to either Redwood or Hope Leslie. But these later writings had to jostle their way among a crowd of competitors, both domestic and foreign. Her earlier works stood alone, and Hope Leslie, especially, became firmly associated in the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> with the rising form of a native literature. It was not only read with satisfaction but familiarly quoted and applauded as a source of national pride. Her subsequent novels followed at about uniform intervals, Clarence, a Tale of our Own Times appearing in 1830.|$|E
25|$|Dana {{made the}} Sun a Democratic newspaper, {{independent}} and outspoken in {{the expression of}} its opinions respecting the affairs of either party. His criticisms of civil maladministration during General Grant's terms as president led to a notable attempt {{on the part of}} that administration, in July 1873, to take him from New York on a charge of libel, to be tried without a jury in a Washington police court. Application was made to the United States District Court in New York for a warrant of removal, but in a memorable decision Judge Blatchford, later a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, refused the warrant, holding the proposed form of trial to be unconstitutional. Perhaps {{to a greater extent than}} in the case of any other conspicuous journalist, Dana's personality was identified in the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> with the newspaper that he edited.|$|E

25|$|Gable {{made three}} {{pictures}} with Spencer Tracy, which boosted Tracy's career and cemented {{them in the}} <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> as a team. San Francisco (1936) featured Tracy in a brief but Oscar-nominated role in which he played a priest who knocks Gable, by then the studio's foremost leading man, down in a boxing ring. Despite being onscreen for only 17 minutes, the appearance immediately catapulted Tracy, whose career had floundered for years despite delivering superb performances in quality films, into major stardom {{in the wake of}} the picture becoming the year's biggest box-office attraction. Test Pilot (1938) gave Tracy a larger supporting part as the agonizing friend of Gable's glamorous pilot while Boom Town (1940) depicted an epic rivalry between Gable and Tracy's characters and their oil businesses. Each pairing was a box-office phenomenon. MGM had teamed Tracy with Gable every two years until Tracy finally insisted upon a star billing clause in his contract, ending any further Gable-Tracy collaborations.|$|E
25|$|It was however at Her Majesty's, London on 20 May 1851, {{that she}} and Reeves won very great acclaim for their Fidelio, the first of five {{performances}} which established her in the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> as a leading tragédienne: critics compared her with her great predecessors in the role, Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient and Maria Malibran. Gardoni and Calzolari led the Chorus of Prisoners. For this production, musical recitatives were composed by Michael Balfe imitating Beethoven's style, pointing {{the content of the}} dialogue with motifs drawn from the principal arias. Most appreciated them, but James William Davison, critic of The Times, was angered because he claimed that Cruvelli had altered the music 'in {{such a way as to}} bring it within range of mediocre capabilities.' Chorley, never an admirer, thought this was the turning-point, where her decline began. Then three performances of Norma, in which Cruvelli gave herself free rein, generated much enthusiasm in London. Cruvelli sang at Buckingham Palace on 7 June 1851, and was invited again the following year.|$|E
25|$|In 1822, a bill {{to authorize}} the {{collection}} of tolls on the Cumberland Road (which provided for yearly improvements to the road) was vetoed by the President. In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it could not undertake the construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation {{of the national government}} in internal improvements was stayed. Two years later, Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than Henry Clay. He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country. Of the other presidential candidates, Jackson voted in the Senate for the general survey bill; and Adams left no doubt in the <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> that he did not reflect the narrow views of his section on this issue. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples which were everywhere being voiced in the South, and followed the old expedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements.|$|E
