5|$|Cartman's {{involvement}} with the fried chicken black market closely mirrors the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman {{in the role of}} Tony Montana, and Colonel Sanders in the role of Alejandro Sosa. In the episode, Cartman travels to a foreign land to meet a dealer, usurps the illegal operation from his local boss, and is ultimately brought down because he becomes addicted to his own product, plot points that mirror the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Scarface. Specific scenes patterned after ones in Scarface, include one in which Cartman watches Tommy being executed by being hanged from a helicopter, and the final scene in which Cartman's compound is attacked by gunmen. The episode also includes references to the 1991 crime film New Jack City.|$|E

40|$|Globodera rostochiensis {{population}} densities {{and potato}} root growth were measured in field <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> one susceptible and two resistant potato cultivars. Root growth and nematode densities were estimated from soil samples taken at three depths between plants within the rows, three depths 22. 5 cm from the rows, and at two depths midway between rows (furrows). Four weeks after plant emergence (AE), nematode densities in the rows had declined 68 % in <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> the susceptible cultivar {{and up to}} 75 % in <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> both resistant cultivars. Significant decline in nematode densities in the furrows 4 weeks AE occurred only in <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> the susceptible cultivar. Total decline in nematode density in fallow soil was 50 %, whereas in <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> the resistant cultivars, decline was more than 70 % in the rows and more than 50 % in the furrows.

40|$|In {{this report}} we study {{estimation}} of time-delays in linear dynamical systems with additive noise. Estimating time-delays {{is a common}} engineering problem, e. g. in automatic control, system identification and signal processing. The purpose with this work is to test and evaluate a certain class of methods for time-delay estimation, especially with automatic control applications in mind. The class of methods consists of estimating the time-delay from the Laguerre transform of the input and output signals. The methods are evaluated experimentally with the aid <b>of</b> simulations and <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> approximation error, <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> original and Laguerre approximated input and output signals, <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> estimates, <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> RMS error, tables <b>of</b> ANOVA and <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> confidence intervals for different cases. The results are: Only certain input signals, e. g. steps, are useful. Systems with a not too fast dynamics give better estimation quality than pure time-delay systems {{despite the fact that}} the estimation methods were derived for pure time-delay systems. The Laguerre pole should be chosen in a certain way. The number of Laguerre functions should be as a high as possible...|$|R
