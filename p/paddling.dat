5|$|River otters swim by quadrupedal <b>paddling,</b> forelimb <b>paddling,</b> {{alternate}} hind-limb <b>paddling,</b> simultaneous hind-limb <b>paddling,</b> or {{body and}} tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, {{is used for}} stability while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed above water. It must remain in motion to maintain its position at the surface.|$|E

5|$|Fishing, {{including}} ice fishing, is {{a common}} pastime on Lake Chillisquaque. Fishing and boating are permitted on the lake {{at any time of}} day, although boats fuelled by gasoline are forbidden. Boating of any kind is also forbidden annually between March 15 and April 30 and is also forbidden in Goose Cove year-round. The only area for boating access on the lake is on {{the eastern side of the}} lake, at the Heron Cove Boat Access Area. The <b>paddling</b> and running stages of the Chilli Challenge triathlon are on Lake Chillisquaque and the Chillisuagi Trail, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Cheaper kayak <b>paddles</b> have an {{aluminium}} shaft {{while more}} expensive ones use a lighter fibreglass or carbon fibre shaft. Some <b>paddles</b> have a smaller diameter shaft {{for people with}} smaller hands. <b>Paddle</b> length varies with a longer <b>paddle</b> being better suited for stronger people, taller people, and people using the <b>paddle</b> in a wider kayak. Some <b>paddle</b> makers have an online <b>paddle</b> size calculator. Blades vary in size and shape. A blade with a larger surface area may be desirable for a strong person with good shoulder joints, but tiring for a weaker person or a person with less than perfect shoulder joints. Some <b>paddle</b> makers offer blades in three sizes.|$|R
50|$|The British Admiralty used {{diesel-electric}} <b>paddle</b> tugs {{in recent}} times.

5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and <b>paddling</b> and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of Psittacosaurus were more terrestrial than others.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{industries}} in the watershed of Spring Brook included timbering, coal mining, and agriculture. Two railroads also passed through the watershed in the early 1900s, {{at least one of}} which was established by the 1880s. The stream's watershed has served as a water supply since at least the early 1900s and still serves as a water supply for the Lackawanna Valley. Several bridges have also been constructed across the stream in the 20th century. The stream has been part of several studies since 1970. Part of its length is navigable by kayaking, <b>paddling,</b> and rafting.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Transthoracic {{impedance}} (TTI) is {{a factor}} determining {{the magnitude of the}} transmyocardial current during external defibrillation. Minimising TTI increases the chances of successful defibrillation. Most external defibrillation <b>paddles</b> are rectangular in shape and can, therefore, be placed in a transverse or longitudinal orientation. The apical <b>paddle</b> is often placed in a transverse orientation. This may theoretically result in a higher TTI than a longitudinal orientation because of poorer contact at the lateral <b>paddle</b> edges. We compared TTI with the apical <b>paddle</b> in both a transverse and longitudinal orientation. Materials and methods: Twenty sequential anaesthetised patients were studied. A pair of defibrillator <b>paddles</b> were instrumented to measure <b>paddle</b> force. TTI was recorded pre-operatively at end-expiration with the apical <b>paddle</b> in both longitudinal and transverse orientations. The sternal <b>paddle</b> was placed in a longitudinal orientation for all measurements. Results: TTI decreased in both transverse and longitudinal orientations as <b>paddle</b> force increased. Transverse <b>paddle</b> orientation resulted in a significantly (P< 0. 01) higher TTI than longitudinal orientation at all <b>paddle</b> forces below 12 kg force. Conclusion: The longitudinal orientation of a rectangular defibrillation <b>paddle</b> provides a lower TTI than orientation horizontally...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: to {{determine}} whether <b>paddle</b> force applied during defibrillation meets the 12 kg (? 120 N) force recommended by the advanced life support (ALS) guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC). Materials and methods: an adult mannequin was ‘defibrillated’ using standard defibrillation <b>paddles</b> instrumented to measure <b>paddle</b> force. <b>Paddle</b> force was recorded {{at the time the}} discharge buttons on the <b>paddle</b> handles were depressed. Results: 54 doctors and nurses performed simulated defibrillation on a mannequin. Median sternal <b>paddle</b> force was 60. 6 N (range 26. 1 – 132. 8 N) and median apical <b>paddle</b> force was 59. 5 N (range 18. 6 – 118. 5 N). Only 3 / 54 operators (5. 6 %) applied sternal <b>paddle</b> force equal to or in excess of ERC recommendations. No operator applied apical <b>paddle</b> force equal to or in excess of ERC recommendations. Conclusions: force applied to defibrillation <b>paddles</b> does not meet guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council. Greater emphasis during advanced life support training should be placed on the importance of firm <b>paddle</b> force during defibrillation...|$|R

Kate and Sawyer land on the main island and question Karl about the Others. Karl reveals that the Others work on the Hydra island, but live on the main island. The next morning, Sawyer finds Karl crying in the jungle. Karl {{says that he is}} crying because he misses Alex. Sawyer asks Karl if he is in love, which Karl affirms to be true. Sawyer tells him that love is worth the risks of getting caught by the Others and lets Karl go into the jungle to find Alex.|$|E
5|$|The Famous Five series {{gathered}} such {{a following}} that readers asked Blyton {{if they might}} form a fan club. She agreed, on condition that it serve a useful purpose, and suggested that it could raise funds for the Shaftesbury Society Babies' Home in Beaconsfield, on whose committee she had served since 1948. The club was established in 1952, and provided funds for equipping a Famous Five Ward at the home, a <b>paddling</b> pool, sun room, summer house, playground, birthday and Christmas celebrations, and visits to the pantomime. By the late 1950s Blyton's clubs had a membership of 500,000, and raised £35,000 in the six years of the Enid Blyton Magazines run.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater had {{a series}} of {{swimming}} pools from 1890 until 2009. The first pool, in Old Taunton Road, was replaced by the Bridgwater Lido on Broadway, opened in 1960 by Princess Alexandra. The lido, which had three pools, a diving bay and <b>paddling</b> pool, was demolished in the late 1980s {{to make way for a}} supermarket, and to fund the indoor Sedgemoor Splash swimming pool in Mount Street, which opened in 1991. In 2009, after the local council were unable to raise the funds needed to upgrade the pool, it was closed and demolished to make way for another supermarket. A new pool was planned as part of the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) rebuild of Chilton Trinity School, however, the government's review of the BSF programme may result in the cancellation of the new school and pool build.|$|E
5000|$|Kayak <b>paddles</b> having blades in {{the same}} plane (when viewed down the shaft) are called [...] "un-feathered." [...] <b>Paddles</b> with blades in {{different}} planes (such as in the image) are called [...] "feathered".

Many modern <b>paddles</b> are made of two pieces which can be snapped together in either feathered or unfeathered settings. The shaft is normally straight {{but in some cases}} a 'crank' is added with the aim of making the <b>paddle</b> more comfortable and reducing the strain on the wrist. Because the kayak <b>paddle</b> is not supported by the boat, <b>paddles</b> made of lighter materials are desired; {{it is not uncommon for}} a kayak <b>paddle</b> to be two pounds (32 oz [...] ) or less and very expensive <b>paddles</b> can be as light as 22 oz.

5|$|On land, {{the river}} otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the {{sequence}} of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding {{is the result of}} simultaneous lifting of the limbs off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. Sliding occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg <b>paddling</b> enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.|$|E
5|$|Philipp {{participated in}} various {{sporting}} events {{organized by the}} Christlicher Verein Junger Männer (CVJM—the German equivalent of YMCA) such as hiking, bicycling, skiing, <b>paddling</b> and rowing. He also {{was a member of}} the Hitlerjugend (HJ—Hitler Youth) and received the HJ-Ehrenzeichen (Honor Badge). Philipp learned to fly glider aircraft in the Hitler Youth and received his A and B glider license, leading the local HJ-Fliegerschar (Flying Squad) in Meissen. Adolf Hitler officially re-established the Luftwaffe in March 1935. Following this event, Philipp then changed his mind and decided he did not want to become a journalist. He passed his physical examination to become a pilot, observer, aircraft mechanic and or radio operator on 6 September 1935 in Dresden. The financial situation of the Philipp family was always a cause for concern. When Alma's mother was paralyzed and required nursing care, the financial situation became severe. Alma's monthly income was 225 RM and the annual school fee of 180 RM was a big burden. She wrote to the city council multiple times asking for the fees to be waived. By early 1935, the family was behind on their payments which had accumulated to a debt of 390 RM by 31 March 1935. Philipp's graduation from school was at risk as he was threatened with expulsion on financial grounds. Philipp's decision to opt for military service in the Wehrmacht eased the financial tension. He was permitted to graduate, provided that his mother paid back the debt in instalments of 10 RM per month.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{this paper}} is to study and analyze the {{performance}} parameters of conveyor, which is fed coal by the <b>paddle</b> feeders, with use of VFD in <b>paddle</b> feeder motors and comparison with other type of coupling used previously in <b>paddle</b> feeders. <b>Paddle</b> feeders are used in coal handling plant of a thermal power station to evacuate coal from track hoppers. In a track hopper conveyor two no. of <b>paddle</b> feeders are available of the 1250 MT per hour coal evacuation capacity each. Initially the <b>paddle</b> feeders were operated with eddy current couplings, which were very much maintenance prone and costly due to that the same had been replaced with the fluid couplings. The fluid coupling has the fixed speed operation. Hence, the <b>paddle</b> feeders were operated at fixed speed and due to that the coal evacuation from a <b>paddle</b> feeder was fixed and there was no possibilities to run two nos. of <b>paddle</b> feeders at a time. Now by use of VFD in <b>paddle</b> feeders utilization of the conveyor has increased as two no. of <b>paddle</b> feeders are running at a time and running time of the system reduced. By the use of VFD in <b>paddle</b> feeder motor power consumption is less and same time the coal evacuation also increased...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, sailing {{ships were}} {{commanded}} from the quarterdeck, aft of the mainmast. With {{the arrival of}} <b>paddle</b> steamers, engineers required a platform from which they could inspect the <b>paddle</b> wheels and where the captain's view would not be obstructed by the <b>paddle</b> houses. A raised walkway, literally a bridge, connecting the <b>paddle</b> houses was therefore provided. When the screw propeller superseded the <b>paddle</b> wheel, the bridge was retained.|$|R
50|$|The <b>paddle</b> {{wheel is}} a large steel {{framework}} wheel. The {{outer edge of the}} wheel is fitted with numerous, regularly-spaced <b>paddle</b> blades (called floats or buckets). The bottom quarter or so of the wheel travels underwater. An engine rotates the <b>paddle</b> wheel in the water to produce thrust, forward or backward as required. More advanced <b>paddle</b> wheel designs feature feathering methods that keep each <b>paddle</b> blade closer to vertical while in the water to increase efficiency. The upper part of a <b>paddle</b> wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing.|$|R
