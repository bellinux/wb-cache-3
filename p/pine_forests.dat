5|$|Large fruitings of {{the fungus}} are often {{associated}} with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies {{were more likely to}} be found in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in <b>pine</b> <b>forests,</b> where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.|$|E

5|$|Russula densifolia is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Descriptions {{have been}} published of the morphology of the ectomycorrhizae that it forms with European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Its mushrooms grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in both mixed and deciduous forests, and tend {{to appear in the}} summer and autumn. In Spain, it is common in dune <b>pine</b> <b>forests.</b> Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the fungus Asterophora lycoperdoides. Widely distributed, Russula densifolia is known from Asia (including China, India, Japan, and Thailand), Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local <b>pine</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the surface}} of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. Pumice Valley, {{directly}} to the west, is covered by sagebrush scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey <b>pine</b> <b>forests</b> also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.|$|E

5|$|The Central Highlands rise {{sharply to}} the north of the Grijalva, to a maximum {{altitude}} of , then descend gradually towards the Yucatán Peninsula. They are cut by deep valleys running parallel to the Pacific coast, and feature a complex drainage system that feeds both the Grijalva and the Lacantún River, which feeds into the Usumacinta River. The Central Highlands feature high rainfall and diverse vegetation dependent upon altitude, from high-altitude <b>pine</b> <b>forests</b> to lowland tropical forest further north and east towards the plains of Tabasco and Petén. At the eastern end of the Central Highlands is the Lacandon Forest, which is largely mountainous with lowland tropical plains at its easternmost extreme.|$|E

5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole <b>pine</b> <b>forests</b> dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by spruce and <b>pine</b> <b>forests</b> and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by spore print color, fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the color change with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in jack pine and Scotch <b>pine</b> <b>forests.</b> The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E

5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of <b>pine</b> <b>forests.</b> This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The {{highest elevation}} forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa <b>pine</b> <b>forests</b> grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{forests are}} {{dominated}} by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100years as a forest matures. In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established. The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s much of the lodgepole <b>pine</b> <b>forests</b> in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250years old and approaching {{the end of their}} lifecycle.|$|E
