Community members were concerned that beach erosion and seasonal river flooding were destroying many of the nests deposited annually and thought that a hatchery was a possible solution. Over the 2001 turtle nesting season, the Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of nests using the Global Positioning System recorded to refer-ence points, and beach dynamics using <b>permanent</b> <b>bench</b> <b>mark</b> profile stations, to determine areas of high risk and more stable areas for nesting. A total of 1449 leatherback nests were positioned. It was evident that {{at the start of}} the season in March, the majority of leatherback nests were deposited at the eastern section of the beach. After May, there was a continuing westward shift in nest distribution as the season progressed until August and beach erosion in the eastern section became predominant. The backshore remained relatively stable along the entire beach throughout the nesting season, and erosion was predominant in the foreshore at the eastern section of the beach, from the middle to the end of the season. Similar trends in accretion and erosion were observed in 2000. River flooding did not occur during the study period or in the previous year.

La playa de Grande Riviere en Trinidad y Tobago es un sitio importante de anidación en el Caribe de la tortuga baula,Dermochelys coriacea;una tortuga marina en peligro de extinción. Los residentes estaban preocupados de que la erosión de la playa y las inundaciones estacionales estaban destruyendo muchos de los nidos y pensaron que un criadero era una solución. Durante la temporada de anidación del 2001,el Instituto de Asuntos Marinos de Trinidad y Tobago (Institute of Marine Affairs:IMA) determinó la distribución espacial y temporal de los nidos referenciados con respecto a varios puntos fijados por satélite (Global Positioning System),y la dinámica de la playa usando marcas permanentes del perfil de la playa, para determinar áreas de alto riesgo y áreas estables para los nidos. Se ubicó 1449 nidos. Fue evidente que al inicio de la temporada (marzo),la mayoría de los nidos estaban ubicados en el sector oriental de la playa. De abril a agosto la anidación se fue desplazando hacia el oeste conforme avanzaba la temporada,mientras que la erosión de la playa aumentaba en el sector oriental. La parte trasera se mantiene estable a lo largo de toda la playa durante toda la temporada de anidación. La erosión es predominante en el frente de playa del sector oriental,desde mediados hasta finales de la época de anidación. Patrones similares de "acreción "y erosión fueron observados en el 2000. No hubo inundaciones durante el estudio o en el año anterior. Como hay zonas de alto riesgo y zonas estables,no hay evidencia contundente para hacer un criadero...|$|E

Countries take their nearby sea levels as datum planes for calculations of Reduced levels [...] For example Pakistan takes sea near Karachi as its datum while India takes sea near Mumbai as its datum for calculation of Reduced levels of different places in their respective countries.

A given landmark's "height above sea Ievel" is the distance measured in a plumb line from the Iandmark itself to the surface of the sea, which continues beneath the surface of the continents. Until the mid nineteenth century, the topographical surveying of countries did not include the measurement of elevations. This practice only ensued after the mean sea Ievel of each country was determined at nearby coastal tide gauging sites and <b>marked</b> by <b>permanent</b> <b>bench</b> <b>marks.</b> The mean sea Ievel at a tide gauging site is influenced by several factors including tides, currents and winds. As it is difficult to monitor these influences, the mean sea Ievels of different countries vary somewhat.
