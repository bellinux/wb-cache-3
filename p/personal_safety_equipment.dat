40|$|An {{inventory}} of the safety and security features of 2, 123 U. S. hotels found an uneven distribution of these key amenities in various hotel types, with differences relating to such factors as hotel size, age, price segment, hotel type and location. Although safety features are essentially a subset of security features, the two can be distinguished from each other. Safety considerations involve protecting people, while security factors embrace protecting the hotel property and guests’ possessions, in addition to ensuring employees and guests’ <b>personal</b> <b>safety.</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>equipment</b> includes items such as sprinklers and smoke detectors, while security features include electronic locks and security cameras. By assigning weights to {{the two sets of}} items, the authors created two indexes, one for <b>safety</b> <b>equipment</b> and one for security equipment. The higher the hotel’s score on each index, the greater the level of its <b>safety</b> and security <b>equipment.</b> Analyzing the hotels’ scores on those indexes across several different categories, the authors found considerable diversity in safety and security index scores for various types of hotel. About one-third of all hotels scored relatively high on both scales (85 or higher out of 100), but 16 percent scored 25 or less on the security scale. Luxury and upscale hotels recorded the highest scores for safety and security, while economy and midprice full-service hotels scored lower than most segments on the safety scale-even though a large proportion have sprinklers. The age of the property has a strong influence on its safety and security scores. In general, the newer the hotel, the higher its safety and security scores. This is because electronic locks, sprinklers, and interior corridors are relatively less common in old hotels (over 29 years) than in hotels built in the last decade. The exception to that rule occurs in luxury hotels, which are renovated frequently regardless of their age. A hotel’s location type has considerable influence. Airport hotels earned the highest safety and security scores (because they tended to have a full panoply of safety and security devices), while resorts were one of the lowest scoring sectors (chiefly because so many of them lack sprinklers and electronic door locks). While hotels’ safety and security indexes differed only slightly by geographic region, one area that did record relatively low security (but not safety) scores is New England. This may be a function of the many small inns and B 2 ̆ 6 Bs in this region, properties that typically score low on security equipment. The survey turned up marked differences in the safety and security indexes by property type. All-suite properties, conference and convention hotels, and standard full-service hotels tended to score high on the indexes. On the other hand, motels as a group had the lowest safety and security scores, and condos and (as mentioned) B 2 ̆ 6 Bs also scored low. A parallel finding is that large hotels generally scored higher than small hotels on both indexes...|$|R

40|$|In {{photovoltaic}} AC-systems {{for residential}} applications influences the inverter's part load efficiency the average system efficiency {{to a high}} degree. This {{is due to the}} fact that the main energy in a typical stand-alone residential system is provided in a power range between 5 % and 20 % of peak load. In this part load range tare loss is the main parameter, which affects inverter efficiency. Transformerless inverters offer significantly lower tare loss and improved part load efficiency over designs employing a transformer. However, disposing of an isolating transformer necessitates careful consideration of <b>personal</b> <b>safety</b> and household <b>equipment</b> protection. Experiences with a transformerless inverter design, developed by the "Fraunhofer-Institute für Solare Energiesysteme", show that all requirements of the electric safety can be met by employing standard ground fault interrupters.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the circumstances preceding severe occupational injuries {{as a consequence of}} impacts has shown that well-known risks are of great importance in 75 per cent of the cases. This indicates that the subjective cause "neglect" is common. The negligence is distributed to the same extent among employers as among employees. Negligence by the employers was defined as obvious violations according to the Law of Workers’ Safety or Regulations issued by The National Board of Occupational Health and Safety. Negligence by employees was defined as actions against specific orders or common sense. As a result of this study additional research concerning the execution of Criminal Law in occupational accidents has been carried out. The law has also been changed regarding prosecution in cases of breaking the Law on the working environment. In situations where elimination of risks is not possible it is a most important task to minimize the risk of severe injury. In four of the studies there are examples of minimization of injuries by increased usage of <b>personal</b> <b>safety</b> <b>equipment,</b> improved rescue and by modifying the environment. If <b>personal</b> <b>safety</b> <b>equipment</b> could be used in all relevant situations the incidence of severe injuries at the place of work would decrease by more than 25 per cent. However, the crucial insufficiencies as to the specifications of personal protective equipment must be emphasized. This should stimulate the development of environmental changes, thus preventing the build-up and release of potentially dangerous energy. Working alone and late rescue for other reasons, together with other circumstances following the injury made the injuries worse in a little more than 10 per cent of the cases. In the studies concerning injuries as the result of impacts in trucks and buses it is shown that a lot of trucks turn over and {{that a large number of}} injuries occur as a result of deformation of the cabins. A safety belt would offer good protection against injury in about half of the cases. Safety in trucks and buses could be improved by the introduction of a deformative zone in front of the occupants. Front designs of cab-over vehicles should be changed and the use of seat belts in trucks and buses should be made compulsory. Passive seat belts, knee bars and air bags are interesting alternatives and additions to manual seat belts for commercial drivers. Diss.

30|$|Ruyra et al. (2015) {{worked on}} an {{uncoated}} nanoscale MOFs which was tested for its vitro toxic {{effects on the}} HepG 2 and MCF 7 cells, {{as well as its}} in vivo toxic effects on the zebra-fish embryos. The results obtained from the work show that the toxic effect of this nanoscale MOFs is determined {{by the nature of the}} MOF and the ability of its contents to be soluble in the medium be used for the test. The in vitro and in vivo toxic effect of the MOFs was found to have a high level of correlation. Its toxicological effects were found to be due to some leached metal ions. The formation of new species upon degradation, nature of crystals (e.g., size, shape, charge) concluded may contribute to the toxicological effects of nanoscale MOFs. Occupational exposure which is most likely to occur during the synthesis, characterization, packaging, transportation, and applications of these materials is still the major source of exposure to these materials by human. Therefore, dermal penetration, inhalation and ingestion are still the most likely route for these materials to get into the human body. Exposure to these materials occupationally can be reduced to a large degree by adopting good lab practices which include the use of special <b>personal</b> <b>safety</b> <b>equipment</b> and proper control of working environment. The personnel exposed to these materials should be tested periodically for possible health risks related to handling these materials; the working environment should be monitored regularly (Sajid 2016).|$|E
5000|$|According to NIOSH and OSHA, a {{combination}} of engineering controls, protective <b>personal</b> <b>equipment,</b> <b>safety</b> education, alternative proppant, and work site safety practices {{are the key to}} protecting workers from respirable crystalline silica exposure. One particular engineering control that is used in field testing is the mini-baghouse that reduces the silica dust produced by the sand movers. Personal protective equipment is normally used in jobs with silica exposure, however NIOSH discovered that incorrect respirators, a half mask type, was used and did not meet the silica exposure levels. [...] NIOSH and OSHA recommend a full face air purifying respirator (PAPR) for all workers exposed to high levels of silica. Another control measure is using a silica substitute proppant such as sintered bauxite, ceramics, or resin-coated sand, however OSHA notes that the safety testing must be performed on these alternatives. Besides these controls measures, the recommend exposure limits (REL) and permissible exposure levels (PEL) need to be set lower than current levels. By June 2016, new regulations for silica will take effect, which lower the PEL to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of silica in the air.|$|R

40|$|The first aim of Fondazione Montagna sicura (www. fondazionemontagnasicura. org) is the moun-tain safety improvement. Fondazione {{employs a}} pool of experts working on the western Italian Alps {{to collect data on}} snow cover and on glaciers in order to issue the {{avalanche}} Bulletin of the Valle d’Aosta Region, to update the glaciers and avalanche cadasters, but also to disseminate a safe approach to mountain activities. The first step is ensuring the employees safety by assesing hazards related to the field surveys. For this reason Fondazione Montagna sicura drew up the ‘Risk Assessment Document’, which screens the different outdoor working activities, the related hazards, the preventive measures taken to reduce possible damages. This document outlines the different steps for each survey planning, which begins the day before a survey analysing in details the terrain and the specific hazards (e. g., the choice of the itinerary, the area for the snow/glacier surveys, the specific skills of the people involved), the meteorological condi-tions, the <b>personal</b> <b>safety</b> <b>equipment</b> (Artva, shovel, probe, abs, avalung, crampons etc). All these data are collected in a specific form and are validated by the office supervisor. In case of avalanche danger level 4 or 5 (on the basis of the snow and avalanche Bullettin) specific behaviors are taken in account: heli-surveys with mountain guides. Every year Fondazione Montagna sicura organizes for its employees training courses on first aid, avalanche safety, ski-mountaineering, glacier hiking, off-road driving. Moreover, last year Fondazione became the referent institution for the mountain safety training courses of the Valle d’Aosta Region...|$|E
