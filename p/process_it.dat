40|$|Information {{technology}} <b>processes</b> (<b>IT</b> <b>processes)</b> are {{key elements}} for using IT {{as an asset}} or mechanism for achieving organization’s business goals. Organizations constitute a complex sociological and technological system. In order to make optimal use of available resources, <b>IT</b> <b>processes</b> have to be tailored according to the need of particular organization. In practice, when designing <b>IT</b> <b>processes,</b> many important decisions about the structure of an <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> are made according to the consultant’s subjective opinion and personal experience. Negative effects of such decisions could result as inappropriate, with negative effects on whole organization. The search of the literature in IT and related fields revealed no relevant research or methods to <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> construction. The field of IT governance lacks a systematic, scientifically-based approach to process construction. Hence, {{the goal of the}} thesis is to develop a systematic, scientifically-based method to <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> construction. The method, suggested in the thesis, is called <b>IT</b> <b>Process</b> Engineering. The method is based on method engineering principles, tailored to <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> construction. <b>IT</b> <b>Process</b> Engineering uses Holistic <b>IT</b> <b>processes</b> as a starting point, i. e. referential <b>IT</b> <b>processes</b> that include <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> elements identified in literature or previously implemented in organizations. <b>IT</b> <b>Process</b> Engineering is based on the analysis of the technical and social characteristics of a particular organization. Accordingly, possible <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> elements, suitable for a particular organization, are selected from the Holistic <b>IT</b> <b>processes.</b> The Holistic <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> conditions define the appropriateness of <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> elements for a particular organization by considering different organization’s socio-technical characteristics. This thesis focuses on organization’s social characteristics which are in practice often neglected. The results of <b>IT</b> <b>Process</b> Engineering are presented as a diagram of activities with their dependencies, a definition of the risks of unsuccessful implementation of the suggested <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> elements, and suggested scenarios for reducing the risk. The dissertation also introduces the basis for the development of support tool for <b>IT</b> <b>Process</b> Engineering. The method for <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> construction was demonstrated by having three organizations use <b>IT</b> <b>Process</b> Engineering to each construct two IT processes: “Manage service desk and incidents” and “Manage problems”. To test the validity of <b>IT</b> <b>Process</b> Engineering case study method was used, combined with direct observation and interviews. The case study results demonstrate that <b>IT</b> <b>Process</b> Engineering can provide useful guidance for <b>IT</b> <b>processes</b> improvement. This confirms that <b>IT</b> <b>processes,</b> suitable for a particular organization, should be constructed with a systematic, scientifically-based method to <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> construction. Furthermore, method engineering principles, used as a basis for <b>IT</b> <b>process</b> construction, were successfully applied in research fields other than information system development. ...|$|R

5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic <b>process,</b> <b>it</b> is assumed that the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E
5|$|During {{the design}} <b>process,</b> <b>it</b> {{was decided that}} the utmost concern was that the ships could be built quickly and placed into service. The ships were to discard the use of {{broadside}} belt armor below the waterline, the attachment of which was an extremely long <b>process.</b> <b>It</b> was believed that the higher speed of the class——would {{make up for the}} vulnerability to torpedo attack and make the armor unnecessary.The initial designs called for three main battery turrets, each mounting a pair of new 42cm guns, though this was later increased to four twin turrets. However, the work that would have been necessary to design and test the new turret clashed with U-boat construction, which had become the priority of the Navy. Krupp, the firm that had been awarded the contract to conduct the testing, informed the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—the Imperial Navy Office) that design work on the new turret would have to wait. Capelle accepted the news without much objection. Nevertheless, the ships were never built. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918, which stated that capital ship construction had ground to a halt, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war.|$|E

As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E

5|$|An {{approaching}} trough {{over the}} central United States induced high wind shear over Sandy as it traversed the Bahamas, causing the hurricane to weaken to {{a tropical storm}} while turning more northeastward. The {{southern part of the}} trough detached, causing the shear to decrease late on October28 and allowing Sandy to regain strength. It attained a secondary peak of Category2 strength the following day, and later turned toward the west. During this change in direction, Sandy began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, a <b>process</b> <b>it</b> completed before making landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey, late on October29. The extratropical remnants weakened gradually overland, and the center of circulation was declared indistinguishable over western Pennsylvania two days later. In addition to becoming the largest Atlantic hurricane, Sandy broke records for the lowest pressures ever observed in many cities across the Northeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this <b>process,</b> <b>it</b> reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E

Three days after its initial landfall, the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique. Throughout northern parts of the country, Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals. Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges, isolating some locations. A meteorological rarity, Bonita continued inland for several days, persisting as a distinct tropical low; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the South Atlantic Ocean. In the <b>process,</b> <b>it</b> dropped unseasonably heavy rainfall over Zimbabwe and Zamibia. A paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department asserted that Bonita was the first storm confirmed to have tracked across the African continent from the South-West Indian Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
