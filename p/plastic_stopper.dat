50|$|Carbon {{footprint}} studies {{committed by}} Corticeira Amorim, Oeneo Bouchage of France and the Cork Supply Group of Portugal concluded that cork {{is the most}} environmentally friendly wine stopper in comparison to other alternatives. The Corticeira Amorim’s study, in particular ("Analysis {{of the life cycle}} of Cork, Aluminum and Plastic Wine Closures"), was developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, according to ISO 14040. Results concluded that, concerning the emission of greenhouse gases, each <b>plastic</b> <b>stopper</b> released 10 times more CO2, whilst an aluminium screw cap releases 26 times more CO2 than does a cork stopper.|$|E

5000|$|Modern vials {{are often}} {{made out of}} plastic or {{sometimes}} glass. There are often used as storage for small quantities of liquid used in medical or molecular biology applications. There are several different types of commonly used closure systems. For glass vials, options include screw vials (closed with a screw cap or dropper/pipette), lip vials (closed with a cork or <b>plastic</b> <b>stopper)</b> and crimp vials (closed with a rubber stopper and a metal cap). [...] Plastic vials, which can be moulded in plastic, can have other closure systems, such as 'hinge caps' which snap shut when pressed. These are sometimes called flip-tops or snap caps.|$|E
50|$|If {{the base}} is removable, it may be {{possible}} to store other items, or specially designed cook sets within the chimney during transport. Devices normally come with a swinging or fixed handle depending on the design. A cork, <b>plastic</b> <b>stopper</b> or in some cases a whistle are used to seal the water container spout, however the cork and stoppers should only be used when transporting water and NOT be used while the water is being heated. If left in place even loosely the hot water vapor can make the cork swell and hold fast, and then the pressure builds up until the cork pops out followed by a jet of hot/boiling water gushing out.|$|E
50|$|A plastic cord lock (also {{known as}} cord fastener, <b>plastic</b> <b>stopper</b> or cord toggle) {{attaches}} to drawstrings and tightens {{without the use}} of knots. Cord locks allow mountaineers to fasten clothing and camping equipment quickly in cold conditions when the fingers are encased in heavy gloves. They consist generally of three parts: a barrel, a toggle (plunger), and a spring. Squeezed together, tension is released and the cord lock can move freely up and down the cords. Released, the tension is engaged and the cord lock stays in place. They come in many sizes and shapes to suit to any purpose, including plastic cord lock, mini size cord lock, no spring cord lock, with spring cord lock, with rim cord lock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{evaluation}} of the impact forces imparted due to wind flow onto and across walls is necessary to improve the safety of stopper components in swing-type windows. A strong wind test was performed to measure the impact force imparted by wind, and {{the characteristics of the}} wind energy and resulting impact force were clarified. An impact force evaluation method based on a simple mechanical model was proposed. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the deformation of a <b>plastic</b> <b>stopper</b> component due to an impact force could be modeled via an empirical linear formula, derived experimentally using the impact force imparted in a drop weight load test. The proposed evaluation method is considered to be useful for the safety design of swing-type windows...|$|E

Traps baited with phenylacetaldehyde, benzyl acetate, and a blend of phenylacetaldehyde, benzyl acetate, and benzaldehyde collected more soybean looper moths, Pseudoplusia inclu-dens (Walker), than benzaldehyde-baited or unbaited traps. Females comprised over 67 % of the moths captured and most were mated. At peak capture, over 90 male and female moths per night were collected. In another experiment, phenylacetaldehyde delivered in <b>plastic</b> <b>stoppers</b> attracted more P. includens moths than traps baited using other substrates, but this chemical delivered in wax attracted more velvetbean caterpillar moths (Anticarsia gemmatalis Hübner). Other noctuid male and female moths collected included Agrotis subterranea (F.), Argyrogramma verruca (F.), Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and several Spodoptera species.

40|$|ABSTRACT Since {{temperature}} {{is a key}} condition in the initiation of cercarial emergence, {{the objective of the}} work reported here was to evaluate the effect of that variable on the shedding of two morphologic and taxonomic types of cercariae. Bioassays were accordingly performed with snails naturally infected with either monostome or pleurolophocercous cercariae because those two cercarial types were found to be the most prevalent in the environment under study. The snails were placed in 6 -ml circular plastic dishes with soft <b>plastic</b> <b>stoppers</b> containing 3 ml of reconstituted water and then sequentially exposed for 24 h to a 14 : 10 -h light:dark cycle at 20, 25, or 30 °C. The data were analyzed at a significance level of p < 0. 05 by means of the InfoStat program. The optimum temperature for cercarial emergence was typically in the range of 25 °C and decreased significantly at 30 °C.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} a highly selective analysis method for {{the determination of}} traces of BPA in wine {{and the results of}} its application to 59 wine samples sourced from vats (steel, wood and plastic), glass bottles and Tetra Briks. The procedure consists of sample clean-up by sol-gel immunoaffinity chromatography followed by determination of BPA by high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection. The method has a LOD (S/N= 3) of 0. 1 ng/ml and a LOQ (S/N= 6) of 0. 2 ng/ml. In 13 of 59 wine samples the BPA concentration was below the LOQ The mean and median for all wine samples with BPA concentrations above the LOQ were 0. 58 and 0. 40 ng/ml, respectively. These values – the first set of data on BPA in wine - are far lower than previously published BPA levels derived from migration experiments using wine simulants. Experiments carried out by submerging <b>plastic</b> <b>stoppers</b> in ethanol-water (11 : 89, v/v) up to 11 weeks indicated that detectable amounts of BPA can be leached from some stoppers...|$|R
40|$|The {{spin and}} configurational {{structure}} of excited states of 127 Cd, 125 Cd and 129 Cd, having two proton and three, five and one neutron holes, respectively in the doubly magic 132 Sn core have been studied. The isomeric states in Cd isotopes were populated in {{the fragmentation of}} a 136 Xe beam at an energy of 750 MeV/u on a 9 Be target of 4 g/cm 2. The experiment was performed at GSI Darmstadt. The neutron-rich Cd isotopes were selected using the Bρ-∆E-Bρ method at the FRagment Separator (FRS). Event by event identification of fragments {{in terms of their}} A (mass) and Z (charge) was provided by the standard FRS detectors. The reaction residues were implanted in a <b>plastic</b> <b>stopper</b> surrounded by 15 Ge cluster detectors from the RISING array to detect the gamma decays. In 127 Cd, an isomeric state with a half-life of 17. 5 (3) μs has been detected. This yrast (19 / 2) + isomer is proposed to have mixed proton-neutron configurations and to decay by two competing stretched M 2 and E 3 transitions. Experimental results are compared with the isotone 129 Sn. In 125 Cd, apart from the previously observed (19 / 2) + isomer, two new metastable states at 3896 keV and 2141 keV have been detected. A half-life of 13. 6 (2) μs was measured for the (19 / 2) + isomer, having a decay structure similar to the corresponding isomeric state in 127 Cd. The higher lying isomers have a half-life of 3. 1 (1) μs and 2. 5 (15) ns, respectively. Time distributions of delayed gamma transitions and gamma-gamma coincidence relations were exploited to construct decay schemes for the two nuclei. Comparison of the experimental data with shell-model calculations is also discussed. The new information provides input for the proton-neutron interaction in nuclei around the doubly magic 132 Sn core. The gamma decays of the isomeric states in 129 Cd were not observed experimentally. The reasons for the non-observation of delayed gamma rays for 129 Cd are either an isomeric half-life of less than 93 ns based on the experimentally obtained isomeric ratios of the (19 / 2) + in 127, 125 Cd, or an E 3 spin trap emerging from shell-model calculations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Whole-protein {{extracts}} from peripheral blood leukocytes {{are ideal for}} basic and clinical research. However, lack of a simple preparation technique has limited {{the use of such}} extracts. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a simple and easy system that can selectively obtain leukocyte extracts without hemoglobin. Methods A filter that captures the leukocytes but not RBCs was set at the bottom of a 10 -mL medical syringe by sandwiching it between <b>plastic</b> <b>stoppers.</b> The capturing efficiency of leukocytes with this tool, called LeukoCatch, was examined using human macrophage cells (MONO-MAC- 6). The abilities of LeukoCatch system to capture the leukocyte proteins and to remove the hemoglobin from RBCs were tested by western blot analysis using human blood samples. Results This study presents the development of LeukoCatch, a novel tool that allows the preparation of leukocyte {{extracts from}} blood samples within 3 min without centrifugation. Tissue-cultured human macrophage cells were tested to determine the optimal filter numbers and pass-through frequencies of LeukoCatch, which was then applied to 2 -mL blood samples. Samples were passed 2 ~ 5 times through a LeukoCatch equipped with 5 filters, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline for red cell removal, and leukocyte proteins were extracted with 0. 5 mL of elution buffer. Western blot analysis of the purified extract indicated that more than 90 % of hemoglobin was removed by the LeukoCatch and that the protein recovery rate of leukocytes was at least 4 times better than that of the conventional centrifugation method. Conclusion We conclude that LeukoCatch is useful not only for diagnosis at the bedside but also for basic research using blood samples or tissue culture cells. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{a number}} of wine brands have {{switched}} to alternative wine closures such as <b>plastic</b> <b>stoppers,</b> screw caps, or other closures. During 1972 {{more than half of}} the Australian bottled wine went bad due to corking. A great deal of anger and suspicion was directed at Portuguese and Spanish cork suppliers who were suspected of deliberately supplying bad cork to non-EEC wine makers to help prevent cheap imports. Cheaper wine makers developed the aluminium [...] "Spelvin" [...] cap with a polypropylene stopper wad. More expensive wines and carbonated varieties continued to use cork, although much closer attention was paid to the quality. Even so, some high premium makers prefer the Spelvin as it is a guarantee that the wine will be good even after many decades of ageing. Some consumers may have conceptions about screw caps being representative of lower quality wines, due to their cheaper price; however, in Australia, for example, much of the non-sparkling wine production now uses these Spelvin caps as a cork alternative, although some have recently switched back to cork citing issues using screw caps. These alternatives to cork have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, screwtops are generally considered to offer a trichloroanisole (TCA) free seal, but they also reduce the oxygen transfer rate between the bottle and the atmosphere to almost zero, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the wine. TCA is the main documented cause of cork taint in wine. However, some in the wine industry say natural cork stoppers are important because they allow oxygen to interact with wine for proper aging, and are best suited for wines purchased with the intent to age. Stoppers which resemble natural cork very closely can be made by isolating the suberin component of the cork from the undesirable lignin, mixing it with the same substance used for contact lenses and an adhesive, and molding it into a standardized product, free of TCA or other undesirable substances. [...] Composite corks with real cork veneers are used in cheaper wines.|$|R

The super-natant solutions {{were removed from the}} clay minerals and analyzed for SiO 2, A 1203, CaO, MgO, Na~ 20, and K 20. All the solutions removed some SiO 2, A 1 ~O 3, and Fe 203 from the samples, but the quantities were small. Sodium hydroxide attacked the kaolin group minerals more strongly than it did montmorillonite, metabentonite, or illite. Halloysite was more strongly attacked by hydrochloric acid than was any of the other experimental minerals. Hydrochloric acid removed iron oxide coatings from soil clay minerals, but acetic acid did not remove them completely. The samples most strongly attacked by HCI and NaOH were examined by X-ray diffraction. Acid treatment did not destroy the structure of the clays, but the halloysite structure was partially destroyed. Sodium hydroxide attacked the halloysite structure, as shown by chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction. These experiments show that treatment in dilute acids has no harmful effect in the preparation of clays for X-ray diffraction. Acetic acid is preferred to hydrochloric acid for this purpose. Hydrochloric acid cleans clay minerals by removing free iron oxide from the surface; acetic acid is less effective...|$|R

(Nashes strain) was assessed after storage of infective juveniles in sterile sand at 5 "C and 15 "C and was measured by their motility (ability to be extracted by mini Whitehead trays). Infectivity after storage at the two temperatures was measured in bioassays with Galleria larvae at 15 "C and was documented {{as the number of}} nematodes that infected each larva. Bioassays used single larvae in <b>stoppered</b> <b>plastic</b> vials containing 25 ml of sand and 200 - 258 infective nematodes. The larvae were replaced in each via 1 every 4 days until infections ceased. Survival of both nematode species was high in sand at 5 "C. However, the numbers that infected the Galleria larvae at 15 "C after storage at 5 "C produced a curve. That is, fewer nematodes infected as the period of storage increased, but after a time, the numbers that invaded the Gallerialarvae increased and eventually attained the original level. Survival of the Nashes strain was tested at 15 "C and the number of infective juveniles declined until few could be extracted from the sand after 16 weeks storage. The number of nematodes per host showed a similar pattern. It appears that storage at 5 "C induces most of the nematodes into a state in which they lose their ability to parasitise a host. Infectivity is regained after a period of cooling. These effects of storage temperature on infectivity were not reflected in the data for mortality of the insects, which generally remained high in al 1 tests. These studies should be repeated and extended to oth r species because entomopathogenic nematodes are frequently stored at low temperatures before use in experiments or in biocontrol programmes. This practice may affect virulence of the parasites and the period of storage may be critical...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays the {{selection}} and {{the treatment of the}} glass waste is implemented in processing plants where, through sorting the foreign bodies and separation from Pb crystal, opaque bodies and the metals, a secondary raw material (SRM) - named cullet - is obtained, suitable for glass products and a glassy waste (glass waste 2) still not accepted by the glass factories. While the recovery of primary glass waste is already spread and technological known, the secondary glass waste (glass waste 2) is recovered by few companies in Italy from some years. Consequently the recovery of the waste of this secondary recovery process of glass waste is new (glass waste 3) and therefore to optimize, in order to reach an economic and sustainable industrial process solution. With the aim of optimizing the plant of SASIL already existing for the recovery of the "glass waste 3 ", innovative technologies have been studied and executed. The major difficulty is in the automatic separation of materials as <b>plastic</b> lightweight, synthetic <b>stoppers</b> and cork stoppers that can nowadays find a market. In particular the solved problem is the separation for materials whose density is < 1, using non-impacting methods. The particle distribution and characterization of the waste in entrance in plant and the products obtained in different stage of treatment have been used to dimension the new plant and to suggest new kind of treatment. Among the innovative process suggested two density separation have been performed: - separation by means jig concentrators; - separation of new method of bath suction. In this research the jig concentrator, at difference of the previous research don't use floatation principle but only fluid motion (without chemical addition and collectors). The same is for the "bath suction apparatus" that it needs only of water to execute the separation. The separation of efficiencies are major than 80 % both for jig concentrators, for the separation of heavy plastic and glass from plastic lightweight and synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers, and for bath suction apparatus that led to separate plastic lightweight from synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers.

The materials to be trade as secondary raw materials (SRM) are about 87. 5 % of the total feeding and they are glass, plastic lightweight, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers.
