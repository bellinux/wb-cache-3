By mid April 2011, Sciancalepore was linked in an affair with her dance partner, which she had always denied, until Alfonso said that he was in a relationship with Argentine top model Paula Chaves. Towards the middle of the year she started rehearsing for the musical Hembras, a play about Contemporary dance and Lyrical Jazz which represents the universe of women in different emotional states, whatever their ethnicity, anatomy, creed and religion. The cast consists of Cleria Zangari, Pilar de Santadina, Maria Mercedes Speroni, Sol Maria Montero, Yvonne Jaureguialzo, Luciana Larocca and Jorgelina Balerdi. Julieta has always been {{recognized as one of the}} most beautiful women on the competition and as a great dancer as well.

40|$|Dix enfants sourds-aveugles, âgés de 13 à 15 ans, sont filmés lors d'interactions avec un éducateur adulte dans une {{situation}} semi-structurée de résolution de problème. Deux facteurs sont manipulés : la disponibilité du <b>partenaire</b> adulte (disponible / non disponible) et son statut (familier / non familier). Un logiciel détecte automatiquement les combinaisons non aléatoires (patterns) d'au moins deux comportements élémentaires relevés pour chacun des interactants. L'analyse de contenu des patterns montre les compétences sociales des sujets (attirer l'attention; indiquer un réfèrent; requérir la coopération autrui [...] .) et l'adaptation de leurs conduites à la disponibilité et au statut du <b>partenaire,</b> plutôt qu'un fonctionnement pathologique des interactions. Social {{interactions between}} deaf and blind {{children and their}} educators Ten deaf and blind children aged between thirteen and fifteen years old were videotaped while interacting with an adult educator in a semi-structured solving problem situation. Two factors are operated : the adult's status - Familiar vs Unfamiliar - and the familiar adult's availability for interacting - Available vs Unavailable. The elementary behavioral events observed in the dyads were coded and processed by a program which allows the detection of hidden behavior patterns through automatic detection of special relations between the time distribution of behavioral event types. The content analysis of these patterns showed that the deaf-blind children were {{able to participate in}} structured interactions. Those structures demonstrated important social skills as drawing others' attention, referring and requiring for others' cooperation and their capacities to adapt their behaviors {{as a function of the}} partner 's availability and status. Although the interactions were brief and weakly structured, we can't describe them as abnormal. Sèvre Sabine. Les interactions sociales des enfants sourds-aveugles.

40|$|Objective: This {{pilot study}} {{examines}} the potential {{utility of the}} Perception of Interprofessional Collaboration Model and the Shared Decision Making scales in {{evaluating the quality of}} partnership in child mental health collaborative care.   Methods: 96 primary care professionals working with children and youth responded to an internet survey which included the Perception of Interprofessional Collaboration Model scale (PINCOM-Q) and an adapted version of a Shared Decision Making scale (Échelle de confort décisionnel, <b>partenaire</b> - ECD-P). The perceptions of child mental health professionals were compared with those of other professionals working with children.   Results: The PINCOM- Q and the ECD-P scales had an excellent internal consistency and they were moderately correlated. Child mental health professionals' Individual Interprofessional Collaboration scores from the PINCOM-Q Individual aspects subscale were better than that of other child professionals. Conclusion: These scales may be interesting instruments to measure the quality of partnership in child mental health collaborative care settings. Research needs to replicate these findings and to determine whether the quality of collaboration is a predictor of mental health outcome. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} a result of a joint project in social economy {{research}} between a community partner—an independent school—and academic partners. The school is a democratic organization, run by teachers and parents. The goal of the project was to find ways to improve communication and reporting about general performance of the school as part of the school’s accountability to its members. Starting from lessons of the balanced scorecard approach for non-profits, we describe the process of development of survey-based measures for the particular organization. The direction of the tool development and subsequent organizational changes were carried out in a participatory process between the school’s staff, the parents, and the board. We identify the limitations and challenges of this process, and outline its successes to draw lessons for other similar democratic organizations.
