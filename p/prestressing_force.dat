Even in this case, {{it is possible to}} see the initial hardening effect produced by <b>prestressing</b> <b>force</b> in the element flexural stiffnesses with the 1 st frequency of vibration that increases as the value of <b>prestressing</b> <b>force</b> increases (Fig. 16).

However, the smart strand cannot give a representative indication of the whole <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> when used in multi-strand systems since each strand sustains a different <b>prestress</b> <b>force.</b> In this paper, the actual distribution of the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> in a multi-strand system is examined using elastomagnetic (EM) sensors to develop a method for tracking representative indicators of the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> using smart strands...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed smart strand {{can be used}} to measure the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> in the prestressed concrete (PSC) structure from the construction stage to the in-service stage. The higher cost of the smart strand compared to the conventional strand renders it unaffordable to replace all the strands by smart strands, and results in the application of {{only a limited number of}} smart strands in the PSC structure. However, the <b>prestress</b> <b>forces</b> developed in the strands of the multi-strand system frequently adopted in PSC structures differ from each other, which means that the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> in the multi-strand system cannot be obtained by simple proportional scaling using the measurement of the smart strand. Therefore, this study examines the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> distribution in the multi-strand system to find the correlation between the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> measured by the smart strand and the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> distribution in the multi-strand system. To that goal, the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> distribution was measured using electromagnetic sensors for various factors of the multi-strand system adopted on site in the fabrication of actual PSC girders. The results verified the possibility to assume normal distribution for the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> distribution per anchor head, and a method computing the mean and standard deviation defining the normal distribution is proposed. This paper presents a meaningful finding by proposing an estimation method of the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> based upon field-measured data of the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> distribution in the multi-strand system of actual PSC structures...|$|R

For {{the purpose of the}} <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> identification accuracy, we first look for the appropriate method to solve the free vibration equation of externally prestressed concrete beam and then combine the measured frequencies with frequency equation to identify the <b>prestress</b> <b>force.</b> To obtain the exact solution of the free vibration equation of multispan externally prestressed concrete beam, an analytical model of externally prestressed concrete beam is set up based on the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory and the function relation between prestress variation and vibration displacement is built. The multispan externally prestressed concrete beam is taken as the multiple single-span beams which must meet the bending moment and rotation angle boundary conditions, the free vibration equation is solved using sublevel simultaneous method and the semi-analytical solution of the free vibration equation which considered the influence of prestress on section rigidity and beam length is obtained. Taking simply supported concrete beam and two-span concrete beam with external tendons as examples, frequency function curves are obtained with the measured frequencies into it and the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> can be identified using the abscissa of the crosspoint of frequency functions.

40|$|In {{order to}} manage the full {{lifecycle}} of bridges effectively, {{it is necessary to}} grasp reasons that may possible damage bridge members. Pre-stressed beams are broadly applied in the urban, railway and highway bridges. During the design process, <b>prestress</b> <b>forces</b> are decided through existing norms or theoretical formula. Within their serviceability life, after the construction, many factors such as relaxation of tendons, shrinkage and creep of concrete, friction between tendons and tendon ducts, anchorage slip and ambient temperature can lead to the change of the applied pre-stress forces. So, in order to control the status of pre-stressed bridges, the identification of <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> is inevitable. This study conducted the <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> identification by using displacements measured after applying a vertical load in the mid-span of the beam. The identification of <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> can be made on pre-stressed steel box beam and pre-stressed concrete beam, respectively.

The performance test was conducted on a 3. 7 [*]m × 1. 8 [*]m pretensioned deck specimen through wheel loading tests to verify the applicability of the measurement method. In addition, a 12. 3 [*]m long and 4. 8 [*]m wide bridge with a pretensioned UHPC deck was erected and long-term monitoring was conducted over three years to verify the applicability of the method to real bridges.

These changes are caused by the external forces acting on the bridge in service and provide sufficient durability for long-term sensing. The analysis of the <b>prestressing</b> <b>force</b> obtained through long-term monitoring reveals the necessity of conducting temperature compensation for the consistency of the data acquired using the FBG sensor.

End-zone reinforcement and tendon partial blanketing were used to determine their effect on concrete stress field intensity and on cracking due to <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> transfer. It was found that steel stirrups do not prevent cracking, but they limit its propagation. A carbon FRP coil of small pitch inhibits crack formation, but the concrete tensile strain remains high. Partial blanketing is the most effective solution, causing only a limited increase in transfer length (approximately 20 %). An analytical solution to the experiment was obtained by using the finite clement method, assuming a partly cracked elastic concrete ring model.

40|$|This {{research}} embodied a three-prong {{approach for}} directly determining the residual <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> of prestressed concrete bridge girders. For bridges that {{have yet to}} be constructed, outfitting girders with instrumentation is a highly effective means of determining residual <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> in prestressed concrete bridge girders. This constitutes the first prong. Still, many bridges are constructed without such instrumentation. For these bridges, a destructive technique can be used to directly determine the residual prestress in a prestressed concrete bridge girder. This implies that the girder(s) being tested have already been taken out of service. This constitutes the second prong. For bridges that are anticipated to remain in service that are lacking embedded instrumentation, the development of a non-destructive technique used to estimate the remaining force in the tendons of prestressed bridge girders is extremely important. This constitutes the third prong used to directly determine residual <b>prestress</b> <b>force.</b> The flexural capacity was also determined from field tests and compared to analytical estimates. By design, the code estimates are meant to be conservative. Alternatively, the residual <b>prestress</b> <b>force</b> for in-service members can be determined directly through the non-destructive technique presented in this research. As such, bridge service capacities can be determined directly and {{do not need to be}} conservatively estimated. (231 pages...|$|R
