5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, {{the brightest star}} in Pavo. Its <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was assigned by the British Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a <b>proper</b> <b>name.</b> Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} I provide novel {{arguments}} for the predicative approach to <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> which claims that argument <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are definite descriptions containing a naming predicate (the individual called X). I first argue that modified <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> {{such as the}} incomparable Maria Callas or the other Francis Bacon cannot be handled on the hypothesis that argument <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> have no internal structure and uniformly denote entities. I then discuss cases like every Adolf, which would normally be interpreted as every individual named Adolf and show that the predicative approach to <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> can straightforwardly account for the distribution of a detectable <b>naming</b> component in <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> Finally, I {{address the issue of}} <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> used as common nouns (such as a Rembrandt or the new Madonna) and plural <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> (e. g., the Beatles) and demonstrate that they do not form a homogenous group yet can be clearly distinguished on both syntactic and semantic grounds from <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> involving a detectable naming component...|$|R

Ruth Barcan Marcus advanced a theory of direct reference for <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> at a symposium in which Quine and Kripke were participants: published in Synthese, 1961 with Discussion in Synthese 1962.

5000|$|Because {{they are}} used to refer to an {{individual}} entity, <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are, by their nature, definite; so a definite article would be redundant, and personal names (like John) are used without an article or other determiner.

According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means fragrant, charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a Matrika ("mother") goddess. Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are Sabala ("the spotted one") and Kapila ("the red one").|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhile <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in {{argument}} positions {{have received}} a lot of attention, this cannot be said about <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in the naming construction, as in “Call me Al”.

If <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> can enter syntax as predicates, then in argument positions they should have a complex structure, consisting of a determiner and its restriction, like common nouns (cf. “definite description theories of proper names”). Further consideration of the compositional semantics of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in the naming construction also shows that they have another argument slot, that of the naming convention.

40|$|In both {{linguistics}} and philosophy, <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> {{have sometimes}} posed a perplexing problem, as <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> obviously {{belong to a}} system of linguistic signs, and yet they seem to lack 2 ̆ 2 meaning 2 ̆ 2. They do not signify, but they only point. As meaning or sense of a sign is its relations to other signs, with language being a system of the closely interrelated signs, their apparent lack of meaning has made <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> in being isolated from the other signs, look particularly anomalous in a system of linguistic signs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show, from anthropological perspective, that this particular conception of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> is wrong due to its inappropriate assumptions on language and communication. Anthropological interests in <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> have been largely descriptive, concerning culturally diverse systems of allocation of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> to individual members of a society. However when anthropologists stop to dwell on the nature of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> more theoretically, they have been under strong influences of on-going linguistic and philosophical discussion. Many tend to argue, following Levi=Strauss, that <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> do have meanings, i. e., <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> do not just point, but signify by classifying individuals named and by relating them to the group and society they belong to. In short they try to show, in vain, that <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are actually not 2 ̆ 7 proper 2 ̆ 7 at all. In this paper I examine Levi=Strauss 2 ̆ 7 s unsuccessful attempt to locate <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> within a system of classification, thus to rid them of their anomalous linguistic positions. Another well-known attempt to incorporate <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> into the signifying system of linguistic signs is Russell 2 ̆ 7 s theory of descriptions, where definite descriptions assure <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> of their meaningfulness. By examining Kripke 2 ̆ 7 s refutation of Russell 2 ̆ 7 s theory, <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> will be shown again to resist their incorporation into a signifying system of signs, but I will also show how Kripke, and those who follow his argument, have gone so far as to overemphasize the anomaly of <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> I will argue that both those who try to reduce the anomaly of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> and those who overemphasize it are erred in seeing <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in their signifying or referring relation to the named, i. e., seeing them as a kind of describing of the latter. Instead I will show the relation between <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> and the named is essentially that of ownership, therefore names are signs of indexical nature, not ones of symbolic nature as other nouns are. I will conclude the so-called problem of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> is pseudo problem based on confusing indexical signs with symbolic signs. This will lead us finally to recognize our tendency to overlook or underestimate ontogenetically and philogenetically indexical nature of our language...|$|R

Perhaps the most significant mention of the gandingan in an epic tale is in the Maguindanao epic Diwatakasalipan, where word “gandingan” actually refers to the instrument itself. In the epic, a young princess, Tintingan na Bulawan, uses the gandingan to inform her sister, Initulon na Gambal, about a hero prince, Diwatakasalipan, who {{was looking for a}} wife. Thanks to that message, Initulon na Gambal was able to entertain the hero prince using a kulintang into her heart.

5|$|The {{traditional}} name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; {{the alternative}} name Capra was {{more commonly used}} in classical times.

5|$|By far, {{the most}} {{important}} source of ancient Tamil history is the corpus of Tamil poems, referred to as Sangam literature, generally dated from the last centuries of the pre-Christian era to the early centuries of the Christian era. It consists of 2,381 known poems, {{with a total of}} over 50,000 lines, written by 473 poets. Each poem belongs to one of two types: Akam (inside) and Puram (outside). The akam poems deal with inner human emotions such as love and the puram poems deal with outer experiences such as society, culture and warfare. They contain descriptions of various aspects of life in the ancient Tamil country. The Maduraikkanci by Mankudi Maruthanaar contains a full-length description of Madurai and the Pandyan country under the rule of Nedunj Cheliyan III. The Netunalvatai by Nakkirar contains a description of the king’s palace. The Purananuru and Akanaṉūṟu collections contain poems sung in praise of various kings and also poems that were composed by the kings themselves. The Sangam age anthology Pathirruppaththu provides the genealogy of two collateral lines for three or four generations of the Cheras, along with describing the Chera country, in general. The poems in Ainkurnuru, written by numerous authors, were compiled by Kudalur Kizhar at the instance of Chera King Yanaikkatcey Mantaran Ceral Irumporai.The Chera kings are also mentioned in other works such as Akanaṉūṟu, Kuruntokai, Natṟiṇai and Purananuru. The Pattinappaalai describes the Chola port city of Kaveripumpattinam in great detail. It mentions Eelattu-unavu – food from Eelam – arriving at the port.

Onomatopoeia in onomastics is seen form the viewpoint of sociolinguistics. Being an aspect of literary onomastics, onomatopoetic <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are considered to be a functional and semantic word mark (meaning-creating and text-forming) that serves as an individualizing and characteristic device. However examples of onomatopoeia in onomastics are seen not only in imaginative literature but also in advertisements and commercials. Onomatopoetic component is a unique device that allows to verbalize lingvocultural aspects of <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> These names are pleasant to hear and easy to remember. They help to make up brand names. Translation strategies include two techniques: translator often resorts to borrowings, in other words transliterateration or transcription of the original onomatopoeia, or makes situational equivalents like occasionalisms or oral speech equivalents to render the expressive, stylistic and evaluative components of meaning of such <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> This article will give an example of both these techniques and deduce the most affective strategies that can be applied to translation of onomatopoetic component of <b>proper</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R

It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha.

Elias Magnus Fries later (1828) called it Guepinia helvelloides in his Elenchus Fungorum, based on Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's Tremella helvelloides, both being names he sanctioned. This has made Tremella rufa and all names based on it unavailable for use, {{as they are}} conserved. Later, Lucien Quélet erected a separate monotypic genus Phlogiotis for Jacquin's species, whereas Julius Oscar Brefeld placed it (as Gyrocephalus rufa) in Persoon's small genus Gyrocephalus (rejected name for Gyromitra). The <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> for the fungus was debated for some time, as the name Guepinia is a homonym (pointed out by Fries in 1828), {{because it had been}} used by Toussaint Bastard in 1812 for a genus of flowering plants in the Cruciferae family. To further complicate matters, the generic name Teesdalia, originally considered to have priority over the name Guepinia for the plant genus, was later determined to have been validly published after Guepinia, rendering Teesdalia an illegitimate name. In 1982, changes in the International Code for Botanical Nomenclature gave protected status to all names adopted by Fries in the Elenchus Fungorum, and established Guepinia as the correct genus name.|$|E
