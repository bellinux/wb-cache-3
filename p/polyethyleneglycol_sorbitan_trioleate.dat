40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examine the effects of}} {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the ability of the hyperaccumulator plant Alyssum lesbiacum to phytoextract nickel from co-contaminated soil. Planted and unplanted mesocosms containing the contaminated soils were repeatedly amended with <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate,</b> salicylic acid and histidine in various combinations to enhance the degradation of two PAHs (phenanthrene and chrysene) and increase nickel phytoextraction. Plant growth was negatively affected by PAHs; however, there was no significant effect on the phytoextraction of Ni per unit biomass of shoot. Exogenous histidine did not increase nickel phytoextraction, but the histidine-extractable fraction of soil nickel showed a high correlation with phytoextractable nickel. These results indicate that Alyssum lesbiacum might be effective in phytoextracting nickel from marginally PAH-contaminated soils. In addition, we provide evidence for the broader applicability of histidine for quantifying and predicting Ni phytoavailability in soils. Alyssum lesbiacum was shown to phytoextract nickel from PAH-contaminated soils from which the pool of nickel accessed for phytoextraction is closely modelled by a histidine-soil extract...|$|R

In humans, MF 59 is well tolerated and enhances the immunogenicity of recombinant protein subunit or particle vaccines. Its effect on the immunogenicity of polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines is unknown. Baboons 1 to 4 months of age were immunized intramuscularly with Neisseria meningitidis group C and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) oligosaccharide-CRM 197 conjugate vaccines. The lyophilized vaccines were reconstituted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Al(OH) 3 (alum), or MF 59. Groups of five animals each were given three injections of the respective formulations, with one injection every 4 weeks. Four weeks after each immunization, the MF 59 group had up to 7 -fold-higher geometric mean anticapsular-antibody titers than the alum group and 5 - to 10 -fold-higher N. meningitidis group C bactericidal-antibody titers. Twenty-one weeks after the third immunization, the MF 59 group still showed 5 - to 10 -fold-higher anticapsular-antibody titers. The antibody responses of the animals given the vaccines reconstituted with PBS were low at all times measured. Both the MF 59 and alum groups, but not the PBS group, showed booster antibody responses to unconjugated Hib and N. meningitidis group C polysaccharides, results consistent with induction of memory B cells.

A phase-transfer-separation route was used to prepare the ultra-fine powder of LSGM, the specific surface area of the powder was obtained at 22. 4 m~ 2 /g. And the preparing conditions of the process were optimized. A non-ion surfactant, <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> (Span- 85), was selected to replace the commonly used dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid sodium salt. As the existence of Na in the salt would deteriorate sintering and electrochemical properties of the LSGM electrolyte. The sintered density of LSGM was measured at 6. 28 g/cm~ 3, which is 94 % of theoretical density, and the oxygen ion transference numbers were close to unity at all testing temperatures. Moreover, the relationship between the ion conductivity and absolute temperature obeyed the classical Arrhenius equation. The power density and maximum current density of the testing SOFC cell, which was constructed with Ni anode, La_(0. 8) Sr_(0. 2) MnO_ 3 (LSM) cathode and LSGM electrolyte, were 68 mW/cm~ 2 and 126 mA/cm~ 2 respectively. Energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) was used to detect the contents of different elements across the intersection of the Ni-LSGM-LSM. The diffusion of Ga from LSGM to LSM was detected, which effected the composition and ion conductivity of LSGM. Furthermore, the presence of Ga in LSM possibly deteriorated electro-catalytic properties of the cathode. The diffusion of La and Ni across the interface of LSGM and Ni was also detected.

Three single agents (silicone aerosol, freon, and ethyl alcohol vapor) proved beneficial; their combination did not enhance the beneficial effect. A new agent (silicone aerosol) and a new combination (10 per cent ether in alcohol by aerosol) are now ready for clinical triiil. A NTIFOAMING agents in paroxysmal / % pulmonary edema were advocated in J. A. 1950 by one of us (A. A. L.) following animal experimentation. 1 Several substances having effect on surface tension were tested in-cluding ether, octyl alcohol, capryl alcohol, <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate,</b> and ethyl alcohol. Pulmonary edema was induced in rabbits by intravenous injection of epinephrine while the various sub-stances were administered by inhalation by means of an atomizer. Further experiments were conducted in ex-perimental pulmonary edema of the rat caused by intraperitoneal injection of thiourea, in pul-monary edema of the guinea pig caused by ingestion of ammonium chloride, and in pulmo-nary edema of the dog caused by rapid intra-carotid infusion of physiologic salt solution. 2 The general conclusion was that the heavy alcohols failed to develop any favorable effect, that ether had a moderate beneficial action, and that ethyl alcohol exerted an important favorable effect. This effect was attributed to modification of the surface tension of the foam followed by decrease of its volume and better oxygenation of the lungs. As systemic effects of the inhaled alcohol vapor were minimal, the method was particularly indicated for patients with pulmonary edema in shock or for those who might develop this syndrome.

Solutions of OLOA 11000 ® [poly(isobutylene succinimide) ] in dodecane were fit to an equivalent circuit model having four elements including a constant-phase element representing the double-layer capacitance. Using Gouy-Chapman theory for small zeta potentials and assuming univalent charge carriers, the double-layer capacitances were converted into charge carrier concentration. The impedance of dodecane doped with <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> (Span 85 ®), sorbitan monooleate (Span 80 ®) and sorbitan monolaurate (Span 20 ®) was also measured in a thin cell. Nyquist plots of all three surfactants showed the high frequency semicircle characteristic of parallel resistance and capacitance but often exhibited a second semicircle at low frequencies which was attributed to charge adsorption and desorption. The adsorption rate constants were independent of surfactant concentration while the desorption rate constants were proportional to the surfactant concentration. The surfactants AOT®, OLOA 11000 ®, Span 85 ®, Span 80 ®, and Span 20 ® all increased the conductivity of dodecane. Phase analysis light scattering was used to find the hydrodynamic diameter of the micelles formed by the surfactants. For each surfactant the measured conductivity increased linearly with concentration above the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The molar conductivity of the different surfactants increased exponentially with the estimated diameter of the polar core of the surfactants.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} enhance the textural {{properties}} of the synthetic hectorite clay Laponite RD. In the early 1990 s Mobil Research and Development Corporation produced the first ordered mesoporous molecular sieves. This family of materials, M 41 S, were fabricated via liquid crystal templating (LCT), a technique involving the condensation and hydrolysis of a silica source around an organic template. As clays are primarily silicates, the question arises "Why not apply the same principles to enhance porosity characteristics of other silicates such as clays?" Optimization of reagent concentrations, template choice, synthesis protocol and template removal strategy led to a maximum total pore volume of 0. 95 cm 3 g- 1. This was achieved through templating Laponite RD with the neutral surfactant polyoxyethylene (20) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>trioleate</b> (Tween 85). This more than trebled the original total pore volume of Laponite RD, 0. 27 cm 3 g- 1. An increase in modal pore diameter was also observed after use of this template; from 36. 6 A to 52. 3 A. Synthesis of Laponite-like compounds within the laboratory led to enhancement of porosity characteristics without templating; a total pore volume of 0. 44 cm 3 g- 1 was observed for this synthetic hectorite (KP). Use of a template further enhanced the porosity characteristics of these samples. The cationic surfactant CTMA+ (used in the original Mobil synthesis) led to a total pore volume of 0. 60 cm 3 g- 1 for modified hectorite KP. A similar result, 0. 65 cm 3 g- 1, was achieved through templating Laponite RD with this same surfactant.

Thus, it becomes even more relevant the physicochemical characterization of lipid materials {{with respect to their}} polymorphism, lipid miscibility and stability, as well as the assessment of the effect of surfactant on the type and structure of these nanoparticles. This work focuses on the physicochemical characterization of lipid matrices composed of pure stearic acid or of mixtures of stearic acid-capric/caprylic triglycerides, for drug delivery. The lipids were analyzed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD), Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) in combination with selected surfactants to determine the best solid-to-liquid ratio. Based on the results obtained by DSC and WAXD, the selected qualitative and quantitative composition contributed for the production of stable nanoparticles, since the melting and the tempering processes provided important information on the thermodynamic stability of solid lipid matrices.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis deals with the symbiosis of Frankia spp. and Alnus glutinosa. Frankia spp. are actinomycetes giving rise {{to the formation of}} nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of a number of non-leguminous plants. In these nodules Frankia spp. live within the plant cells and obtain all sources of carbon and energy from the plant, giving fixed nitrogen in exchange. To answer the question what compounds Frankia spp. obtain from the plant, insight into the metabolism of this microorganism is required. To obtain this insight, researches have been made with the free-living Frankia AvcI 1, isolated from root nodules of Alnus viridis ssp crispa by Baker et al. (1979). This organism has been isolated and cultivated on complex media. In order to obtain insight into the C- and N-source requirements of Frankia AvcI 1, a simple and well-defined growth medium is needed. The composition of this medium and the C- and N-metabolism of Frankia AvcI 1 are the subjects of Chapter II of this thesis. In Chapter II. 1 it is shown that Frankia AvcI 1 is able to grow on a medium containing Tween 80 (an oleate ester of <b>polyethyleneglycol</b> <b>sorbitan)</b> as sole C-source and either glutamic acid or NH 4 Cl as sole N-source. The growth yield of Frankia AvcI 1 on various media is reported. It is shown that the doubling time of Frankia AvcI 1 growing on QMOD/Tween medium is about 2 days, which is slow, even for an actinomycete. When growing with Casamino acids as nitrogen source, Frankia AvcI 1 selectively takes up glutamic acid and aspartic acid, leaving the concentrations of the other detectable amino acids unchanged. The mechanism of this selection is still unclear. Chapter II. 2 contains further data on the C-sources utilized by Frankia AvcI 1 It is shown that Frankia AvcI 1 can utilize as C-source also other Tweens, viz. Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 85, and in addition several fatty acids, viz. acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, caproic, caprylic, capric, palmitic and stearic acids. No growth of Frankia AvcI 1 was observed on media containing triglycerides as C-sources. The dependence of the growth yield {{on the nature of the}} carbon source and the concentration of NH 4 + in the media is shown. Utilization of NH 4 + as nitrogen source of Frankia AvcI 1 growing in the Tween/NH 4 + medium is confirmed by incorporation experiments with 15 N-NH 4 Cl. The results reported in Chapter II. 3 show that Frankia AvcI 1 does not take up glucose from a medium containing both glucose and Tween 80. In agreement with this observation, it is demonstrated that the activities of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in cells grown on the QMOD/Tween medium (containing both glucose and Tween 80) are of the same order ofmagnitude as in cells grown on the Tween/NH 4 + medium (containing Tween 80 as sole C-source). Organisms growing on fatty acids, and degrading these compounds to acetyl-CoA, start gluconeogenesis with the action of the glyoxylate cycle (Kornberg and Krebs, 1957) leading to the conversion of 2 acetyl-CoA molecules to 1 molecule of succinate. The presence of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in Frankia AvcI 1 cells grown with Tween 80 as C-source is therefore not surprising. The succinate formed in the glyoxylate cycle can be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by the subsequent action of the enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase, malic enzyme and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, which are found in cell-free extracts of Frankia AvcI 1 From phosphoenolpyruvate, gluconeogenesis can continue with the action of phosphoglycerate kinase and 3 -phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase. For energy generation, Frankia AvcI 1 can oxidize the acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid breakdown in the citric acid cycle, although the low activity of the enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase leaves room for the presumption that the citric acid cycle is not very operative in Frankia AvcI 1 This is not impossible since the oxidation of fatty acids yields many reducing equivalents. The data contained in Chapter II. 4 show that Frankia AvcI 1 does not take up succinate from a medium containing acetate plus succinate or succinate alone. In accordance, no repressing effect of succinate on the activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes was observed, whereas in cells grown on propionate these enzymes were not found, indicating that they are hot constitutive in Frankia AvcI 1 Frankia AvcI 1 is able to utilize several amino acids as sole nitrogen source, viz. alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, leucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and valine. No differences in C- and N-source requirements were observed for the three Frankia strains AvcI 1, CPI 1 (isolated by Callaham et al., 1978, from Comptonia peregrina root nodules) and AgSp+ 1 (isolated by Quispel and Burggraaf, 1981, from Alnus glutinosa spore-(+) type root nodules). These three strains were shown to utilize either Tween 80 or acetate, but no ethanol, lactate, glucose or succinate as sole C-source, and either NH 4 Cl, Casamino acids, aspartic acid or alanine as N-source. From the data given in Chapter II it will be clear that Frankia AvcI 1 is able to grow on a well-defined medium, which is a prerequisite for obtaining a clear insight into the physiology of the organism. The alcoholic root extract (Quispel and Tak, 1978) or the soybean lecithin (Lalonde and Calvert, 1979), added to the medium as growth factors, can be replaced by Tween 80 or fatty acids which are utilized as carbon source, while NH 4 Cl or amino acids can be utilized as nitrogen source. It is unknown whether Frankia spp. grow with the same growth rate on media with different constituents. The growth yields presented in Chapter II are usually small as compared to the amount of carbon present in the media. This suggests that either an additional component of the medium is present in limiting concentrations or that Frankia spp. can only grow for a limited time after inoculation. The only group of compounds known so far to be utilized as C-source by free-living Frankia AvcI 1 are fatty acids, either free or esterified. The question what carbon source Frankia spp. living symbiotically in the nodule obtain from the plant, still remains to be answered. Based on the data obtained for free-living Frankia spp. it is not unlikely that some fatty acid functions as C-source under such conditions. Other possible candidates for this function are plant lipids like the alcoholic root extract (Quispel and Tak, 1978) or the soybean lecithin (Lalonde and Calvert, 1979). It is unlikely that sugars like glucose or dicarboxylic acids like succinate are playing this role, unless the ability of Frankia spp. to take up one or more of these compounds should alter during the transition from the free-living to the symbiotic stage. The cultivation of free-living Frankia spp. is a powerful tool in discovering symbiotic interactions of the endophyte and the host. In Chapter II. 4 of this thesis it is shown that by replacing acetate as C-source of the medium by propionate, the activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes are repressed. Other authors (Tjepkema, Ormerod and Torrey, 1980 and 1981, Gauthier, Diem and Dommergues, 1981) reported a medium in which free-living Frankia spp. show vesicle formation and N 2 -ase activity. The present knowledge thus enables one to influence regulation in freeliving Frankia spp., which is important in studying the symbiotic interactions mentioned above. In Chapter III attention is paid to the assimilation of the ammonia produced by the endophyte living symbiotically in the root nodules of Alnus glutinosa grown in the greenhouse from seeds collected in Wageningen. In Chapter III. 1 the composition of the pool of free amino acids in root nodules and the xylem tissue of stems is reported. It is shown that citrulline is the predominant free amino acid in nodules, while serine also occurs in relatively large amounts. In xylem tissue citrulline and glutamic acid are prominent. The activities of N 2 -ase, GS, GDH and OCT in root nodule homogenates are reported. From the K m values of GDH for NH 4 + (16 mM) and glutamate (0. 9 mM) and the concentrations in the nodule of NH 4 + (1. 5 mM) and glutamate (0. 5 mM) it is concluded that GDH in alder nodules probably is responsible for the deamination of glutamate and not for the synthesis of this key amino acid. The important function of GDH in the nitrogen metabolism of alder nodules is confirmed by the much higher activity of this enzyme in homogenates of nodules as compared to that in homogenates of root-tips and leaves. The vesicle clusters, which contain the N 2 -ase activity, did not show activity of GS, GDH and OCT. The cytoplasm of the host cells was shown to possess the GS activity, while GDH and OCT are localized in the organelles of the host cells. No activity of NADH-dependent GOGAT was observed. In Chapter 111. 2 it is shown that the activity of NADH-dependent GOGAT from root nodules of lupins is inhibited by some compound in the homogenate of alder nodules. Simultaneously with and independently of the present research, Schubert et al. (1981) analyzed the composition of the pool of free amino acids in nodules and the xylem tissue of Alnus glutinosa grown in the field in East Lansing, Michigan. The only difference with respect to these amino acid pools between the American alders and the European alders studied in the present research, is the relatively high amount of serine in nodules of the latter, whereas in nodules of the former this amino acid is not found. The results of both Schubert et al. (1981) and the present research confirm the hypothesis that in alder,citrulline is the main transport vehicle of fixed nitrogen (Miettienen and Virtanen, 1952; Leaf, Gardner and Bond, 1958; Wheeler and Bond, 1970). From the results shown in Chapter 111. 2 it can be concluded that our failure to find any GOGAT activity may be ascribed to the presence of an inhibiting compound in the homogenate of alder nodules, so that it is not excluded that GOGAT is active in alder nodules in vivo. The data reported in Chapter III are in accordance with the following model: The nitrogen fixed as ammonia in the vesicle clusters of the endophyte, is assimilated in the cytoplasm of the host cell into glutamate by the action of GS and presumably GOGAT. Glutamate is in part deaminated in the plant organelles by the action of GDH to supply the NH 4 + required for the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate. Another part of the glutamate is converted to ornithine, which in the organelles of the host cellreacts with carbamyl phosphate to form citrulline according to the OCT reaction. Citrulline is excreted from the nodule and serves as nitrogen source for the plant. ...|$|R
