The proposed circuit consists of a voltage-to-current converter, a precision current-mode rectifier with operating in class-AB, and two current-to-voltage converters. A voltage input signal is changed into a current signal by the voltage-to-current converter. The class-AB current mode rectifiers rectify these current signals, resulting in <b>positive</b> and negative <b>half-wave</b> current signals that are converted to <b>positive</b> and negative <b>half-wave</b> voltage signals by the current-to-voltage converters.

40|$|Slow {{oscillations}} (< 1 Hz) in the non-rapid {{eye movement}} (NREM) sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) result from slow membrane potential fluctuations of cortical neurones, alternating between a depolarized up-state and a hyperpolarized down-state. They {{are thought to}} underlie the restorative function of sleep. We investigated the behaviour of slow oscillations in humans under increased sleep pressure to assess their contribution to sleep homeostasis. EEG recordings (C 3 A 2) of baseline and recovery sleep after sleep deprivation (eight healthy males, mean age 23 years; 40 h of prolonged wakefulness) were analysed. Half-waves were defined as positive or negative deflections between consecutive zero crossings in the 0. 5 - 2 Hz range of the band-pass filtered EEG. Increased sleep pressure resulted in a redistribution of half-waves between 0. 5 and 2 Hz: the number of half-waves per minute was reduced below 0. 9 Hz while it was increased above 1. 2 Hz. EEG power was increased above 1 Hz. The increase in frequency was accompanied by increased slope of the half-waves and decreased number of multi-peak waves. In both baseline and recovery sleep, amplitude and slope were correlated highly over a broad frequency range and <b>positive</b> <b>half-waves</b> were characterized by a lower frequency than the negative ones, pointing to a longer duration of up- than down-states. We hypothesize that the higher frequency of slow oscillatory activity after prolonged wakefulness may relate to faster alternations between up- and down-states at the cellular level under increased sleep pressure. This study does not question slow-wave activity as a marker of sleep homeostasis, as the observed changes occurred within the same frequency range...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of energy, electricity, and transportation industries {{has created a}} market for steel pipes; however, buried steel pipelines near high-voltage transmission lines and electrified railways often experience alternating current (AC) corrosion at the damaged coating of pipelines; such phenomenon is mostly due to the resistance between the capacitance and inductance coupling, especially for long-distance pipelines in parallel operation. AC corrosion can cause pipeline corrosion perforation and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in some cases, {{which has been a}} vital threat to the pipeline safety. In this work, the influence of AC on corrosion behavior of X 80 pipeline steel was investigated in NS 4 near-neutral solution by data acquisition technique, electrochemical test, immersion tests and surface analysis techniques. Results show that with the increasing of AC density, corrosion morphology changed from uniform corrosion to localized corrosion with many pits. Under the full AC interference, X 80 steel occurred cathodic and anodic polarization which resulted in iron dissolution and hydrogen precipitation. The negative half wave AC would lead to hydrogen evolution and hydrogen induced anodic dissolution, the pits in X 80 steel surface present sharp. However, under disturbance of <b>positive</b> <b>half-wave</b> AC, only anodic dissolution occurred and the pitting appeared spill shape and smoothly. Under various AC waveform interference, the corrosion products of X 80 steel surface were different.

It {{has been found that}} the emission is not continuous over the entire AC period, but occurs once per half period. Each of the observed emission phases shows a self-pulsing of the discharge, with several bursts of emission of fixed width and repetition rate. The number of emission bursts depends on applied voltage and frequency.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{models of}} texture {{processing}} use low level, spatially parallel computations to extract texture properties. The rapid, preattentive nature of texture segregation {{suggests that these}} computations are bottom–up in nature. However, the immunity of texture judgments to top–down influences remains to be tested. Here we investigate {{the degree to which}} judgments of texture orientation are susceptible to top–down attentional control. Observers view a brief display composed of variously luminant texture elements (line segments) alternately (in checkerboard arrangement) oriented up/right (at 71. 5 °) or up/left (at 108. 5 °), and are asked to make various judgments. In a given task, the observer attempts on each trial to judge which oriented population of line segments has an intensity histogram that best matches a given target histogram. Performance demonstrates adaptive flexibility across different tasks, suggesting that observers are able to exercise significant top–down control over texture orientation computations. Specifically, observers can attend selectively to positive contrast texture elements, to negative contrast texture elements, or to high (positive and negative) contrast texture elements. More generally, observers perform well if the target histogram can be approximated by a weighted average of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>half-wave</b> rectifiers. Performance is poor for histograms that cannot be captured in this way. These results suggest that attentional control in these tasks is limited to adjusting the relative gain of the on- and off-center systems...|$|R

To gain insight into {{the contributions of the}} heteroatoms, we developed a facile and reproducible method for constructing Fe, N, S-codoped carbon frameworks derived from self-assembled Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystal superlattices. The material constructed by the suggested method exhibited excellent ORR activity with more <b>positive</b> <b>half-wave</b> potential (∼[*] 0.869 V, vs RHE), higher diffusion-limiting current density (∼[*] 5.88 mA/cm 2) and smaller Tafel slope (45  mV/dec) compared with Fe, N-codoped carbon frameworks and Pt/C. Notably, Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals served as both the building blocks for constructing carbon frameworks and the source of Fe residues leaving in the frameworks at the same time. By artificially tailoring the doping type and level as well as the homogeneousness of heteroatoms, the results discussed herein prove the importance of each kind of heteroatom in boosting ORR activity.|$|E

This method {{can be used to}} receive time and frequency iMormation that is contained in the TV signal by a meteor-burst channel. At the present time, the most widespread and accessible method of time-frequency information transfer (among those using global longwave nets, meteor and satellite systems) is by television. For transmission of time-frequency information, the standard time-frequency signals (STFS) containing standard frequency signals (SFS), standard time signal (STS), and signals of current time code (CTC) are transmitted in the time slot of the sixth line of the regular extinguishing impulse of each odd TV signal frame. Moreover, the line synchroimpulses (LSP) and frame synchroimpulses of the TV signal are tied to the time scale [l]. To transmit SFS, the first interval of the line with 15 ps duration is used. SFS are transmitted as signal packets of 1 MHz frequency, an elementary phase of which is tied to television synchrosignals.

This modem is mainly composed of an AT 89 C 51 microcontroller, a simple two order passive low-pass filter, and a shaping circuit. Modulation is achieved {{on the basis of}} the principle of pulse width modulation (PWM). By executing PWM signal generating program, a digital base band signal is converted into the corresponding PWM signal after it is input into an I/O port of the microcontroller. Then the PWM signal is outputted from another I/O port and sent into the two order passive low-pass filter. On the output side of the filter, the 2 FSK signal can be obtained. For demodulation, the 2 FSK signal shaped by the shaping circuit is input into microcontroller from its I/O port. Then the widths of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>half-waves</b> are measured by the microcontroller internal timer.

Structural and morphological characterizations revealed the successful preparation of O-doped g-C 3 N 4 with a layered spongy-like micro-nanostructure, which favored the enhancement of O- 2 adsorption and active sites. The UV-vis spectra and Mott-Schottky analysis indicated that the introduction of oxygen leaded to a narrow bandgap, a negative shift of valance band maximum and an increased electrical conductivity. As a result, the O-doped g-C 3 N 4 exhibited a higher mass activity (14. 9 mA/mg(catalyst) at - 0. 60 V and 1800 rpm) and 60 mV <b>positive</b> shift of <b>half-wave</b> potential toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) {{as well as a}} better electron transfer efficiency than did the g-C 3 N 4 without oxygen doping.

40|$|Monophonic tele-conferencing systems employ {{acoustic}} echo cancellation (AEC) to reduce echoes {{that result from}} coupling between loudspeaker and microphone. Acoustic echo cancellation is simple to develope {{as there is a}} single channel. But future tele conferencing systems are expected to have multi channel communication which is necessary in hands-free multi user tele communication systems. Stereophonic echo cancellation (SEC), has been studied since the early 1990 s, in hands-free tele communication applications such as tele conferencing, multi user desktop conferencing, and tele video gaming. To enhance the sound realism in order to increase the speech intelligibilty it is necessary to use two channel (stereo) audio systems. This requires SEC systems. In SEC there is a fundamental problem that the adaptive algorithm used can not identify correct echo path responses due to strong correlation between stereo signals and also the convergence is slow. In this case it is necessary to identify two echo paths for each channel thus there are four echo paths to identify which is very difficult. In this thesis, the problems with stereo echo cancellation is explained and echo cancellation with emphasis on two channel affine projection algorithm (APA) is studied. The signal de-correlation techniques are reviewed and compared. The idea behind signal decorrelation techniques is to introduce nonlinearity into each channel. This can be done by using half-wave rectifiers or time varying all-pass filters. Three methods were developed to reduce correlation between stereo signals. One, is to use two <b>positive</b> <b>half-wave</b> rectifiers on both channels considered as NLP 1. Second, is to use positive and negative half-wave rectifiers on each channel (NLP 2). Third, is to use time varying all-pass filters (TV-APF) on both channels with delays. Experiments were performed using MATLAB and observed echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) and misalignment(MIS) with different scenarios. The euclidean norm distance calculation has been used to find out MIS between filter coefficients and true echo path models. It is observed that NLP 1 and NLP 2 lack signal perception even though ERLE was good. The MIS falls down below 25 dB with decorrelated stereo signals.
