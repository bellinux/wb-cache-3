50|$|For {{community}} applications, UltraBattery {{can be used}} as back-up in {{the event}} of grid outage (see Section 5.1) and for peak shaving. Also known as <b>peak</b> <b>lopping,</b> peak shaving is the ability to charge batteries during off-peak time, and use the power from the batteries during peak times to avoid higher charges for electricity. Another example of a community application is a 300 kW smart grid demonstration system set up by Furukawa Battery in the Maeda Area in Kitakyushu, Japan. This load-levelling application uses 336 UltraBattery cells (1000 Ah, 2 volts). The company has also installed two smart grid demonstrations of UltraBattery peak shifting technology at Kitakyushu Museum of Natural History & Human History.|$|E
5000|$|The total {{capacity}} of reliably operable standby generation in Britain {{is estimated to}} be around 20 GW, nearly all of which is driven by diesel engines. This is equivalent to nearly 29% of the British system peak, although only a very small fraction will ever be generating at the same time. Most plant is for large offices blocks, hospitals, supermarkets, and various installations where continuous power is important such as airports. Therefore, most is in urban areas, particularly city and commercial centres. It is estimated that around 10% of plant exceeds 1 MW, about 50% is in the 200 kW-1 MW range, and the remaining 40% is sub-200 kW. Although it is growing, only a very small proportion is believed to be used regularly for <b>peak</b> <b>lopping,</b> the vast majority just being only for standby generation.

40|$|Best economy (lean of <b>peak</b> or <b>LOP)</b> {{operation}} of aircraft engines rather than best power (rich of peak or ROP) has been suggested {{as a means to}} reduce fuel consumption in light aircraft with modest speed reduction leading to reduced operating cost (increased miles per gallon), and to reduce cylinder head temperatures (CHTs) leading to improved engine longevity and reduced maintenance cost. A recent study by Chrisman (2011) using a limited number of data sets from aircraft in the Purdue University fleet of Cirrus SR 20 training aircraft demonstrated statistically significant reduced fuel consumption and reduced CHT but no statistically definite speed reduction. This study confirms the earlier results for fuel consumption and CHTs using expanded data sets. It suggests that the failure to derive a statistically significant reduction in speed is a consequence of inherent experimental limitations rather than the lack of any reduction...|$|R

Ofgem has released £ 500 m {{of funding for}} DNOs to trial innovative techniques and share the learning {{with the rest of}} the industry. One of the techniques under study is the addition of Energy Storage at key substations to the network to help with <b>peak</b> load <b>lopping.</b> This paper looks in detail at the sizing algorithm for use in the assessment of alternatives to traditional reinforcement and investigates a method of sizing a battery for use on a Network taking into account load growth, capacity fade and battery lifecycle issues. A further complication to the analysis is the method of operation of the battery system and how this affects the Depth of Discharge (DoD). The proposed method is being trialled on an area of 11 kV network in Milton Keynes Central area and the simulation results are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work {{is part of}} {{a bigger}} project which aims to {{research}} the potential development of commercial opportunities for the re-use of batteries after their use in low carbon vehicles on an electricity grid or microgrid system. There are three main revenue streams (<b>peak</b> load <b>lopping</b> on the distribution Network to allow for network re-enforcement deferral, National Grid primary/ secondary / high frequency response, customer energy management optimization). These incomes streams are dependent on the grid system being present. However, there is additional opportunity to be gained from also using these batteries to provide UPS backup when the grid is no longer present. Most UPS or ESS on the market use new batteries in conjunction with a two level converter interface. This produces a reliable backup solution in the case of loss of mains power, but may be expensive to implement. This paper introduces a modular multilevel cascade converter (MMCC) based ESS using second-life batteries for use on a grid independent industrial plant without any additional onsite generator as a potentially cheaper alternative. The number of modules has been designed for a given reliability target and these modules could be used to minimize/eliminate the output filter. An appropriate strategy to provide voltage and frequency control in a grid independent system is described and simulated under different disturbance conditions such as load switching, fault conditions or a large motor starting. A comparison of the results from the modular topology against a traditional two level converter is provided to prove similar performance criteria. The proposed ESS and control strategy is an acceptable way of providing backup power in the event of loss of grid. Additional financial benefit to the customer may be obtained by using a second life battery in this way...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{power is}} one of the cleanest and safest of all the {{renewable}} commercial methods of generating electricity. However, wind energy is difficult to use due to its stochastic variability. Energy storage can overcome the main drawback, allowing energy production to match energy demand. In this paper, new hydrogen storage systems are investigated as a way to solve this problem. A new methodology, based on the differences between wind power generation and load variability, was developed in this study to optimize the technology, energy capacity and power transfer of the hydrogen energy storage method for specified applications. The dynamics of the complete hydrogen cycle energy storage and recovery mechanism was investigated, specifically for potential applications such as power smoothing and <b>peak</b> <b>lopping.</b> A time dependant model of the efficiency of various hydrogen storage technologies, including high pressure compression, low temperature liquefaction, metal hydrides and complex hydrides, has been developed. Based on this study, a practical hydrogen energy storage system for a 5 MW micro-grid application was designed. The micro-grid's electrical load requirements and the available wind energy in the local area are used as an example to demonstrate the new methodology. Using these results, the paper demonstrates that a practical system to provide hydrogen energy storage within this micro-grid using high temperature water electrolysis and high pressure compression tank storage is the best way forward...|$|E
40|$|Community-based social {{marketing}} (CBSM) has {{shown to be}} very effective at inducing behavioural change due to its pragmatic approach. It {{has been found that}} nonintegrated intensive approaches towards changing individual's behaviour, such as education and economic self-interest are not successful. This paper will explain how a large urban electricity meter replacement program can achieve a reduction in peak demand and overall energy consumption through the use of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI or 'smart meters') coupled with CBSM, which in turn enables the progression towards a 'smart grid'. In order to measure success the following targets were set: • Peak demand reduction (<b>peak</b> <b>lopping)</b> of 20 % from the households participating in the Behaviour Change Programs (BCPs). • Peak demand shifting (load shifting) to reduce energy consumption during 'super peak' by 10 % in BCP participating households. • Average total energy use reduction of 10 % in BCP participating households. The energy efficiency actions discussed with householders during eco-coaching, and other feedback communications, are identified by utilising the information regarding barriers and benefits generated from the research phase prior to coaching. These actions can include referral to other initiatives such as the provision of reduced cost solar PV power systems, direct load control devices for domestic air-conditioners, the time-of-use pricing product, the provision of in-home-displays (IHD) and other devices necessary for development of a 'smart grid'...|$|E
40|$|CD {{held with}} Reference copyA number of {{electricity}} assets used in rural New Zealand yield {{a very low}} return on investment. According to {{the provisions of the}} Electricity Act 1992, after 01 April 2013, lines companies may terminate supply to any customer to whom they cannot provide electricity lines services profitably. This research was undertaken to assist the policy makers, lines companies, rural investors on the viability of distributed generation in a rural setting {{from the point of view}} of the lines company and the investor as well as to provide recommendations to the problem areas. A dynamic distributed generation model was developed to simulate critical distributed generation scenarios relevant to New Zealand, such as diverse metering arrangements, time dependent electricity prices, peak shaving by load control, <b>peak</b> <b>lopping</b> by dispatchable distributed generation and state subsides, which are not addressed in commercial software. Data required to run the model was collected from a small rural North Island sheep and beef farming community situated at the end of a 26 km long radial distribution feeder. Additional operational data were also collected from the community on distributed resources such as solar hot water systems. A number of optimum distributed generation combinations involving a range of technologies under different metering arrangements and price signals were identified for the small and the medium investor. The effect of influencing factors, such as state initiatives and technological growth, on the investor and the lines companies were discussed. Recommendations for future implementation in order to integrate distributed generation on to rural networks were also given. Several key research areas were identified and discussed including low cost micro hydro, wind resource assessment, diversification of the use of the induction generators, voltage flicker and dynamic distributed generation techno-economic forecasting tools...|$|E
40|$|Fossil fuel will {{eventually}} become exhausted. Also, fossil fuels produce {{large amounts of}} carbon dioxide, which cannot only bring environment pollution, but can also cause global warming. Therefore, clean and renewable energy sources should be investigated. In this project, renewable wind power was considered. Wind energy is free, clean and available in large quantities, although {{it is difficult to}} use due to its stochastic variability. Energy storage can reduce this variability allowing energy production to match energy demand. In this study, different kinds of energy storage approaches were introduced, compared, and simulated by using half hourly wind data from the Met Office, UK, and half hourly load data from the University of Bath, UK. Hydrogen has higher mass energy density than all other energy storage methods. It is seen as a versatile energy carrier of the future, complementary to electricity and with the potential to replace fossil fuels due to its zero carbon emissions and abundance in nature. On the other hand, because hydrogen is the lightest element under normal conditions; the same amount of hydrogen must occupy a huge volume compared to other elements. The mature technology for converting hydrogen into electricity has high cost and low efficiency. These are big issues that limit the usage of hydrogen energy storage methods. Using wind and load data, a new algorithm was developed and used for sizing the wind turbine, and energy storage requirements. The traditional way to supply energy is distributing electricity, but in this PhD research, there are some discussions about a new method, hydrogen transport-hydrogen pipeline. From the results of the comparison and algorithm, a practical hydrogen energy storage system for the University of Bath network was proposed and designed. In the proposed design the energy from a wind turbine was directed to the load and the remaining excess power was used to produce hydrogen by water electrolysis. The hydrogen was stored in a high pressure compressed tank, and finally a hydrogen fuelled combined cycle gas turbine was used to convert the hydrogen to electricity. In this thesis, the dynamics of the complete hydrogen cycle energy storage and recovery mechanism are discussed, identifying potential applications such as power smoothing, <b>peak</b> <b>lopping</b> and extending power system controller ranges. The results of calculations of the payback time and revenue verify the feasibility of the designed hydrogen energy storage system. The main objective of the PhD was to design a practical hydrogen energy storage system for micro-grid applications. During this research, hydrogen energy storage was investigated to show that it does solve the problems arising from renewable energy...|$|E
40|$|Global {{awareness}} for {{cleaner and}} renewable energy is transforming the electricity sector at many levels. New technologies are being increasingly integrated into the electricity grid at high, medium and low voltage levels, new taxes on carbon emissions are being introduced and individuals can now produce electricity, mainly through rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems. While leading to improvements, these changes also introduce challenges, and a question that often rises is ‘how can we manage this constantly evolving grid?’ The Queensland Government and Ergon Energy, {{one of the two}} Queensland distribution companies, have partnered with some Australian and German universities on a project to answer this question in a holistic manner. The project investigates the impact the integration of renewables and other new technologies has on the physical structure of the grid, and how this evolving system can be managed in a sustainable and economical manner. To aid understanding of what the future might bring, a software platform has been developed that integrates two modelling techniques: agent-based modelling (ABM) to capture the characteristics of the different system units accurately and dynamically, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the most economical mix of network extension and integration of distributed generation over long periods of time. Using data from Ergon Energy, two types of networks (3 phase, and Single Wired Earth Return or SWER) have been modelled; three-phase networks are usually used in dense networks such as urban areas, while SWER networks are widely used in rural Queensland. Simulations can be performed on these networks to identify the required upgrades, following a three-step process: a) what is already in place and how it performs under current and future loads, b) {{what can be done to}} manage it and plan the future grid and c) how these upgrades/new installations will perform over time. The number of small-scale distributed generators, e. g. PV and battery, is now sufficient (and expected to increase) to impact the operation of the grid, which in turn needs to be considered by the distribution network manager when planning for upgrades and/or installations to stay within regulatory limits. Different scenarios can be simulated, with different levels of distributed generation, in-place as well as expected, so that a large number of options can be assessed (Step a). Once the location, sizing and timing of assets upgrade and/or installation are found using optimisation techniques (Step b), it is possible to assess the adequacy of their daily performance using agent-based modelling (Step c). One distinguishing feature of this software is that it is possible to analyse a whole area at once, while still having a tailored solution for each of the sub-areas. To illustrate this, using the impact of battery and PV can have on the two types of networks mentioned above, three design conditions can be identified (amongst others) : · Urban conditions o Feeders that have a low take-up of solar generators, may benefit from adding solar panels o Feeders that need voltage support at specific times, may be assisted by installing batteries · Rural conditions - SWER network o Feeders that need voltage support as well as <b>peak</b> <b>lopping</b> may benefit from both battery and solar panel installations. This small example demonstrates that no single solution can be applied across all three areas, and there is a need to be selective in which one is applied to each branch of the network. This is currently the function of the engineer who can define various scenarios against a configuration, test them and iterate towards an appropriate solution. Future work will focus on increasing the level of automation in identifying areas where particular solutions are applicable...|$|E
