5|$|When Rome had {{received}} word of Germanicus' death, the people began observing a iustitium before the Senate had officially declared it. Tacitus says this shows the true grief {{that the people}} of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people already knew the <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|According to Danish tradition, burning is the <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> {{to dispose}} of a worn Dannebrog flag. According to tradition, care must be {{observed}} {{to ensure that a}} flag never touches the ground, i.e., even when being disposed of, it should be placed on top of a fire. Flying the flag after sundown is also inappropriate behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Because of this, {{cooking oil}} {{should never be}} dumped in the kitchen sink or in the toilet bowl. The <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to dispose of oil is {{to put it in}} a sealed {{non-recyclable}} container and discard it with regular garbage.

25|$|Like Jovinian, Pelagians {{insisted that}} human {{affections}} and desires were not {{touched by the}} fall either. Immorality, e.g. fornication, is exclusively a matter of will, i.e. a person does not use natural desires in a <b>proper</b> <b>way.</b> In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained {{it as one of}} the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God.|$|E
25|$|Conservative Judaism {{holds that}} Orthodoxy has {{deviated}} from historical Judaism through excessive concern with recent codifications of Jewish law.

25|$|When Bolesław's {{mother died}} his father married, without {{permission}} from the Church, a nun from the monastery in Kalbe, daughter of Margrave Dietrich. Oda was her name and her guilt was great. For she scorned her vows to God, and gave preference to the man of war before him (...). But because of the concern {{for the well-being of}} the homeland and the necessity to secure its peace, the event caused no break of relations, instead a <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> was found to restore concord.

The song's protagonist says that going by measures such as what his favourite clothes, books and food are, he's just a regular person, and that him thinking about the morning's rain {{that led to a}} woman's shirt becoming set were inelegant thoughts. A scene is depicted in the lyrics where someone {{at the beginning of a}} concert compares himself with the other members of the audience, and realises that comparing yourself to others is not a <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to live. Later, he thinks about childhood memories of defeat, and realises that these memories are his pure self. After understanding this, he feels like he wants to scream, and begins to cry.|$|E
25|$|Mammals are a clade, and {{therefore}} the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just {{a section of the}} clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the <b>proper</b> <b>way.</b> Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{during each}} fiscal year, a {{prefecture}} that has nuclear power stations in its territory is legally bound to hold nuclear accident disaster drills, demonstrating how {{to evacuate the}} population out of the 10-kilometer evacuation zone according to the governmental anti-disaster guidelines. The Fukishima Daiichi accidents proved this 10-kilometer zone to be an underestimation of the evacuation zones that would actually be needed to protect {{the population of the}} prefecture from escaping radiation in a <b>proper</b> <b>way.</b> On 5 September 2011, three prefectures—Aomori, Fukushima and Ibaraki—were unable to hold the drills before March 2012. Six prefectures, including Hokkaido and Fukui, had not taken a decision to hold a drill and were awaiting new governmental guidelines on how far to evacuate. Four other prefectures, including Ehime and Saga, planned to hold drills by establishing temporary guidelines and by expanding evacuation zones on their own. The Nuclear Safety Commission aimed to review the evacuation zones and other policies by the end of October.|$|E

25|$|In October 2011 the Japanese Ministry of Science {{launched}} a phone hotline {{to deal with}} concerns about radiation exposure outside Fukushima Prefecture. Concerned Japanese citizens had been walking with Geiger-counters through their locality in search of all places with raised radiation levels. Whenever a site was found with a radiation dose at one meter above the ground more than one microsievert per hour and higher than nearby areas, this should be mentioned at the hotline. One microsievert per hour is the limit above this topsoil at school playgrounds would be removed, subsidized {{by the state of}} Japan. Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. When radiation levels would remain more than one microsievert higher than nearby areas even after the cleaning, the ministry offered to help with further decontamination. On the website of the ministry a guideline was posted on how to measure radiation levels in a <b>proper</b> <b>way,</b> how to hold the dosimeter and how long to wait for a proper reading.|$|E

25|$|Veeck {{once again}} came to Paige's rescue when, after {{taking control of}} the Phillies' triple-A farm team, the Miami Marlins of the International League, he signed Paige to a {{contract}} for $15,000 and a percentage of the gate. Marlins manager Don Osborn did not want Paige and said that he would only use him in exhibition games. Veeck made a deal with Osborn that he could line up his best nine hitters, rotating them in from their positions in the field, and Veeck agreed to pay ten dollars to any of them who get a clean hit off of Paige. Paige retired all nine and Osborn agreed to make Paige a roster player. In Paige's first game as a Marlin, he pitched a complete-game, four-hit shutout. Osborn, a former minor league pitcher, taught Paige the <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to throw a curveball, which allowed Paige to tear through the International League. Paige finished the season 11–4 with an ERA of 1.86 with 79 strikeouts and only 28 walks. This time, when Veeck left the team, Paige was allowed to stay on, for two more years.|$|E

25|$|The Tamil people practiced a very {{systematic}} {{method of}} cultivation during the Sangam age. It was known that ploughing, manuring, weeding, irrigation and crop protection {{need to be}} followed in a <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> for the yield to be rich. Tiruvalluvar, in his Tirukkural, emphasizes the need {{for all of these}} steps to be undertaken in a careful manner {{in order to get a}} good yield. A paddy field was also known as Kalam and was ploughed with the help of oxen. Ploughed lands were leveled by the peasants using their feet, followed by the planting of the paddy seeds. Once the seeds grew into saplings, they were transplanted and when the crop was mature, it was harvested. Weeds were removed periodically. Paddy was removed from the harvested stalks by beating on the ground or by getting bullocks to tread on them. Cleared paddy was collected, measured and stored in proper containers. Millets were grown on the Pinpulam or the dry lands and in the Kurinji region. Crop rotation was followed – for instance, cotton and millets were grown simultaneously on the same plot and after that, beans were cultivated on it.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} {{phases of the}} Sangam period, people {{depended}} heavily on rains as {{the primary source of}} water for agriculture. But, increasing demand stemming from a growing population {{led to the development of}} better methods of irrigation. Since the rivers of the region were not perennial, the primary goal was to procure an adequate and continuous supply of water. Tanks, lakes and dams were important water storage systems that were developed for this purpose. Sluices and shutters were constructed for regulating water for irrigation. Sometimes, buckets made of reeds were used for watering the lands. In order to control the flooding of rivers, sand mounds were raised so that water could be diverted for irrigation. Direct irrigation from canals was possible on the basins of the Kaveri, the Periyar and the Tamaraparani. Kallanai, a dam built on river Kaveri during this period, is considered the oldest water-regulation structure in the world. Kaveri, Pennai, Palaru, Vaigai and the Tamaraparani were the major rivers spreading their fertilizing water on the fields of Tamilakam. Water stored in tanks and reservoirs was delivered to the fields through channels. There is a considerable amount of spring channel irrigation in the Palar, Kaveri and Vaigai beds. To raise a second crop, well water was very useful. People of this era knew how to divine the spots where there was flow of underground water and dug wells there. Men and oxen were used to irrigate the lands from well water. When water supply was limited and demand was more, it became the duty of the village authorities to distribute the available water in a <b>proper</b> <b>way.</b> Day and night watchmen were employed to guard the tanks and reservoirs and regulate the water supply. Surface irrigation, sprinkler mechanism and drip irrigation methods were followed to prevent wastage of water.|$|E
