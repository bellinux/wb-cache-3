The school has since shut the street down and replaced it with a <b>pedestrian</b> friendly <b>walk</b> <b>way</b> to improve <b>pedestrian</b> safety and help upgrade the area aesthetically. In 2015, a school spirit shop, The Duhawk Shop, and Einstein Bros. Bagels opened at the corner of Loras Boulevard and the new Loras Parkway.|$|R
40|$|The National Road {{network of}} Sri Lanka {{consists}} of 4326 bridges. There are 365 bridges which Have the length more than 30 m. Only 800 bridges {{are made of}} prestressed concrete superstructures and all others are with reinforced concrete, steel and arches. The most popular types of prestressed beams used in Sri Lanka are inverted T, M, I, and the box beams. The inverted T and M beams are widely used. Further, for 30 m span simply supported bridges, space rectangular box beams and spaced trapezoidal box beams were used. For the continuous bridges big spine beams also have been used with post tension pre-stressing system in recent bridge constructions. For longer span bridges, box beams are highly suitable. Generally box beam has higher torsional capacity because of its closed geometry. The enhanced torsional stiffness of the box beam sections improves the load distribution properties for the superstructure. It has higher bending carrying capacity and requires reduced beam height compared to other beam section for a particular span. Hollow spaces in box beams {{can be used for}} services and it is also aesthetic. In Sri Lanka 19 % of the existing bridges are with prestressed concrete and presently many highway projects are under construction. Therefore, the usage of box beams will improve the effect on the time of construction, cost, construction easiness, aesthetic considerations and utility services. There are different types of box beams available {{that can be used for}} this simply supported span range. They are standard box beam, standard U beam and spaced box beams. The rectangular spaced box beam has been used for a two lane bridge in a 30 m simply supported span and the trapezoidal spaced box beam has been used for a four lane elevated flyover in Sri Lanka. Comparative analysis and design on all these box beams are useful for future bridge constructions. This research is concentrated on the design of 30 m simply supported four lane bridge super structures using the above different types of prestressed box beams separately. The results of analysis and design and the properties of the beams are compared. The total width of the designed bridges is 17. 4 m. It has a central reserve of 1. 2 m. There are four lanes; each lane is 3. 5 m width. There are two <b>pedestrian</b> <b>walk</b> <b>ways</b> of 1. 1 m width. All the bridge decks were modeled in SAP 2000 for the grillage analysis. Loading was done according to BS 5400 : Part 2, 1978, and bending moments, shear forces and torsional moments were found for critical load combination. Prestressing designs were carried out for all beams and the final results are compared. Cost for each deck also compared. The different launching methods adapted for these Bridges are also compared. Conclusions and recommendations are laid down based on these compared results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examined}} pedestrian {{characteristics in}} two urban facilities namely a teaching hospital and a university campus. The {{aim was to}} determine if pedestrian flow features in these facilities differed from those in downtown areas. The objectives were to measure pedestrian flow rates and model their walking behaviour. Eleven sites located within these facilities were selected for study. The results indicated that the male walked faster than the female in the university campus while the female was faster in the hospital environment. Also the university campus saw more groups of pedestrians in the traffic mix than {{was the case in the}} hospital environment where 93 % of the pedestrians were in single files. The male walked faster than the female by 7 % in the university environment while the female were faster by 4 % in the hospital environment. The modelling effort showed that the free walking speed in the university environment was 68. 052 m/min with a critical density of 3. 15 ped/m 2. That of the hospital environment was 75. 099 m/min and a critical density of 4. 36 ped/m 2. Since the speed-density relationships for the two facilities revealed a highly randomized plot, the data was fit to the normal distribution and pdf and cdf were used to assess the quality of the flow. For the university environment the results showed that 15 % of the combined <b>pedestrians</b> <b>walked</b> below 56. 88 m/min while 50 % of the <b>pedestrians</b> <b>walked</b> below 66. 67 m/min and 85 % walked below 72. 50 m/min. Similarly, the results of the hospital environment showed that 15 th percentile of the combined <b>pedestrians</b> <b>walked</b> below 69. 75 m/min. The median speed of pedestrians was 72. 50 m/min while 85 % of the <b>pedestrians</b> <b>walked</b> below 75. 25 m/min. In both cases, the 15 percentile speeds were 14 % and 18. 5 % less than the median speeds in both facilities respectively. Thus flow breakdowns are unexpected in the two facilities...|$|R
