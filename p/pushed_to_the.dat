5|$|A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{study in}} January 2009 found that emperor {{penguins}} could be <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink of extinction {{by the year}} 2100 due to global climate change. The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica. The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony's population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Pusan Perimeter was a {{large-scale}} battle between United Nations and North Korean forces lasting from August 4 to September 18, 1950. It {{was one of}} the first major engagements of the Korean War. An army of 140,000 UN troops, having been <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink of defeat, were rallied to make a final stand against the invading North Korean army, 98,000 men strong.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sides of the main airway.|$|E

5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left or right, indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a subduction zone. A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1943, Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allied powers. Hoping to occupy {{as much of the}} country as possible before the German Army could react, the U.S. Fifth Army prepared to attack Salerno. On 10 September, elements of the division conducted its second landing at Agropoli and Paestum with the 36th Infantry Division, on the southernmost beaches of the attack. Opposing them were elements of the German 29th Panzergrenadier Division and XVI Panzer Corps. Against stiff resistance, the 45th <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Calore River after a week of heavy fighting. The Fifth Army was battered and pushed back by German forces until 20 September, when Allied forces were finally able to break out and establish a more secure beachhead.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} released in early 2009 for Microsoft Windows, and later for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The team partnered with Edge of Reality to develop the console versions of the game. However, its release date was <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latter half of that year {{in order to have a}} simultaneous launch. BioWare announced that the game would be released on October 20, 2009, but pushed it back again to November 6, 2009, as the team wanted additional time to finalize some last-minute decisions. The PlayStation 3 version was at one point delayed to November 17, but did end up launching alongside the other versions. A Mac version of the game, developed by TransGaming, was released on December 21, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface feeders, obtaining food {{that has been}} <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E

5|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} that albatrosses were predominantly surface feeders, swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface by currents, predators, or death. The deployment of capillary depth recorders, which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird, has shown that while some species, like the wandering albatross, do not dive deeper than a metre, some species, like the light-mantled albatross, have a mean diving depth of almost 5m and can dive as deep as 12.5m. In addition to surface feeding and diving, they have also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1830s, Réunion was deforested for plantations. Former slaves joined white peasants in {{cultivating}} pristine areas after {{slavery was}} abolished in 1848, and the hoopoe starling was <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edges {{of its former}} habitat. According to Hume, over-hunting was the final blow to the species; with forests more accessible, hunting by the rapidly growing human population may have driven the remaining birds to extinction. In 1821, a law mandating the extermination of grain-damaging birds was implemented, and the hoopoe starling {{had a reputation for}} damaging crops. During the 1860s, various writers noted that the bird had almost disappeared, but it was probably already extinct by this time; in 1877, Vinson lamented that the last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires. No attempts to preserve the species in captivity seem to have been made. The hoopoe starling survived longer than many other extinct Mascarene species, and was the last of the Mascarene starling species to become extinct. The Rodrigues and Mauritius species probably disappeared with the arrival of rats; at least five species of Aplonis starlings have disappeared from the Pacific Islands, with rats contributing to their extinction. The hoopoe starling may have survived longer due to Réunion's rugged topography and highlands, where it spent much of the year.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the terrain}} around the ridge, the Australians had to {{allocate}} {{a significant amount}} of resources to bring in supplies to the forces later stationed around Pearl Ridge. The rate of effort required to bring stores forward was of significant concern to the Australian corps commander, Lieutenant General Stanley Savige, to the extent that his orders to the commander of the 11th Brigade stipulated no further advances in the sector, with the exception of patrolling to prevent the movement of Japanese reinforcements towards the south, and for information gathering purposes. These patrols subsequently went out with native police guides, exploiting quite deep into the jungle over several days over long distances—one was even <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern coast around the Numa Numa Plantation—and proved quite successful for the Australians in harassing the Japanese in the area. Over the course of 14 weeks at least 236 Japanese were killed by these patrols, while the Australians lost four killed and 19 wounded. Four Japanese were also captured. In mid-April, the 23rd Brigade, under Brigadier Arnold Potts, took control of the central sector and in June a new offensive was opened in the area. This lasted through {{until the end of the}} war in August.|$|E
5|$|From 8 December 1944 to 23 February 1945, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} XIII Corps and held defensive positions along the Rur and prepared for the next major offensive. The division was reassigned to XIX Corps, and the attack jumped off across the Rur on 23 February, and carried {{the division}} through Jülich, Broich, Immerath, and Titz, to Mönchengladbach by 1 March 1945. The division was out of combat in March. In early April the division was reassigned to XVI Corps, where the 116th Infantry helped mop up in the Ruhr area. On 19 April 1945 the division, assigned to XIII Corps, <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elbe River and held defensive positions until 4 May. Meanwhile, the 175th Infantry cleared the Klotze Forest. After V-E Day, the division was on military duty in the Bremen enclave. It was assigned to XVI Corps again for this assignment.|$|E

Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car {{at the start of the}} game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his family on the dashboard before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, U.S. ground forces were {{introduced}} into combat roles in large numbers, {{and the first}} US Marines came ashore at Da Nang in Thi's I Corps. The flamboyant Thi organized for the American troops to be greeted by military bands, welcoming banners and teenage girls who garlanded them with flowers. This caused embarrassment to US military officials who felt the introduction of combat troops and resultant American casualties would not be received well by the public when contrasted with Thi's celebratory fanfare. Soon after the Americans were in position, Thi tipped off Marine Lieutenant General Lewis W. Walt about a major movement of Việt Cộng insurgents near Chu Lai in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam. This resulted in Operation Starlite, generally regarded as the first offensive action undertaken by the Americans in the Vietnam War. Occurring between 18–24 August, it resulted in the 1st Việt Cộng Regiment being <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast.|$|E
