This paper proposes a simple, and economical test rig for restrained shrinkage and associated procedures to assess the <b>post-shrinkage</b> mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength) of concrete. The {{results show that the}} restraining factor of the proposed rig is dependent on the time and the stiffness of the concrete. Results of residual mechanical properties show that restrained shrinkage induced cracks can affect the mechanical behaviour (flexural and compressive strength and stiffness) of concrete by up to 21 %...|$|E

The proposed approach optimizes {{the shape of}} the shrinkage functions and maximizes denoising performance by emphasizing the contribution of sparse overcomplete representation components. In contrast to previous work, we apply the weights in the overcomplete domain and formulate the restored image as a weighted combination of the <b>post-shrinkage</b> overcomplete representations. We further utilize this formulation in an offline Least Squares learning stage of the shrinkage functions, thus adapting their shape to the weighting process. The denoised image is reconstructed with the learned weighted shrinkage functions. Computer simulations demonstrate superior shrinkage-based denoising performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for online shrinkage functions learning in single image super-resolution. The proposed approach leverages the classical Wavelet Shrinkage denoising technique where a set of scalar shrinkage functions {{is applied to the}} wavelet coefficients of a noisy image. In the proposed approach, a unique set of learned shrinkage functions is applied to the overcomplete representation coefficients of the interpolated input image. The super-resolution image is reconstructed from the <b>post-shrinkage</b> coefficients. During the learning stage, the lowresolution input image is treated as a reference high-resolution image and a super-resolution reconstruction process is applied to a scaled-down versionofit. Theshapesofallshrinkage functions are jointly learned by solving a Least Squares optimization problem that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the reference image and its super-resolution approximation. Computer simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art results. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} of a methacrylated dental resin's photopolymerization is the {{shrinkage}} phenomenon. This occurs, as expected, during light irradiation but also, unexpectedly, during about 24 h after photopolymerization (i. e. during the so-called 'post-polymerization' stage). During this period, the conversion degree does not change significantly (no more initiation, very limited, if any, propagation reaction) but free radicals concentration decreases. OBJECTIVES: To better understand what happens during the 24 h after the photopolymerization, a thermal study of these resins is investigated at first and an explanation is then discussed. METHODS: In this paper, the glass transition temperatures (T(g)) are measured at 0 and 24 h by DMA. The <b>post-shrinkage</b> phenomenon is observed by TMA. Conversion degree (DC) is followed by Raman and free radical decay by ESR spectroscopy. RESULTS: T(g) increases significantly during post-polymerization (55 - 80 degrees C). The same samples were studied by TMA at room temperature and shrinkage is observed. The fact {{that the degree of}} conversion (DC) does not increase significantly and that the 'post-shrinkage' occurs at T<T(g) leads to the hypothesis that a physical phenomenon should occur which can, in turn, be responsible for a secondary chemical phenomenon (post-polymerization). SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed explanation is that, as photopolymerization of dental resins is very fast, a large excess of free volume is trapped in non-equilibrated samples. As they have no time to return to an equilibrium state, free volume should decrease below T(g) and samples do physically shrink during the first 24 h. As a consequence, free radicals can come into 'contact' and undergo limited propagation but significant termination justifying the decrease in overall radical concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{is responsible for}} some of the most serious sustainability and environmental issues the world is currently facing. Recycled materials such as recycled aggregate (RA) -generated from processed construction waste- and recycled tyre steel fibres (RTSF) -extracted from post-consumer tyres- in new constructions can potentially conserve natural aggregates (NA), eliminate unnecessary consumption of limited landfill areas and reduce energy consumption. However, the variability in the characteristics of recycled materilas, and the low density, high water absorption and porosity of RA, can lead to poor quality concrete and shrinkage cracks, particularly under restrained conditions. This study aims to examine the use of recycled materials such as RA and RTSF in the production of structural concrete and in particular to contribute towards understanding the shrinkage behaviour of NA concrete (NAC) and RA concrete (RAC) under restrained conditions. An extensive experimental study to characterise the properties of both NA and RA and identify the effect of various key parameters on the performance of RAC is undertaken. Approaches to improve the properties of RA and RAC are explored. A new restraining frame for restrained shrinkage test and a procedure to quantify the <b>post-shrinkage</b> mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus) of concrete are developed and assessed. The mechanical performance of concrete mixes incorporating RA and RTSF, as well as mixes with NA and industrial steel fibres (ISF), is examined under free and restrained conditions. It is shown that the compressive strength of RAC can be predicted using a predictive model that takes into account: particle density, LA value, water absorption and RA content. Surface treatment of RA using reactive and non-reactive microfillers, as well as the utilization of RTSF, helped improve the compressive strength of RAC by up to 30...|$|E
