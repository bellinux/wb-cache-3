25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} <b>panel</b> <b>switch</b> and a manual switchboard.

25|$|The <b>Panel</b> <b>switch</b> {{was named}} for its tall panels covered with 500 rows of terminals. Each panel had an {{electric}} motor to drive usually sixty selectors by electromagnetically controlled clutches. The selector was similar in effect to a stepping switch though it moved continuously over the contacts. Each selector had five brushes, each of which could select from 100 terminals arranged in groups. Pulses were sent {{in the opposite direction}} than in the preexisting Strowger switches, i.e. from the selector to the register which had received the dialed digits from the caller, a signaling method that became known as revertive pulsing.|$|E

2500|$|While the Strowger (step-by-step or SxS) switch moves {{synchronously}} {{with the}} dial pulses {{that come from}} the telephone dial, the more sophisticated <b>Panel</b> <b>switch</b> had senders, similar to {{the directors of the}} later Director system Strowger exchanges used in London and other large British cities. The sender first registered and stored the digits that the customer dialed, and then, with the help of other frames, translated the received digits into numbers appropriate for the selectors: District Brush, District Group, Office Brush, Office Group, Incoming Brush, Incoming Group, Final Brush, Final Tens, Final Units.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>panel</b> <b>switch</b> is {{an example}} of a power drive system, in that it used 1/16 {{horsepower}} motors to drive the selectors vertically to hunt for the desired connection, and back down again when the call was completed. In contrast, Strowger or crossbar systems used individual electromagnets for operation, and in their case the power available from an electromagnet limits the maximum size of the switch element it can move. [...] With Panel having no such restriction, its dimensions were determined solely by the needs of the switch, and the design of the exchange. The driving electric motor can be made as large as is necessary to move the switch elements. Thus, most calls required only about half as many stages as in earlier systems. Motors used on panel frames were capable of operating on alternating (AC) or direct current (DC), however they could only be started with DC. In the event of an AC power failure the motor would switch to its DC windings, and continue running until AC power was restored.|$|E
50|$|For {{outgoing}} calls, the Line Link Frame {{acted like}} the line finder of the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> autonomously connecting {{the line to}} a junctor, which corresponded to the cord circuit of the old cord telephone switchboard. As in the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the sender then found the chosen junctor and supplied dial tone. Like the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the 1XB common control {{was based on a}} complex, versatile sender circuit. The sender decoded dial pulses and was retrofitted for dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) in the 1960s. A large number of senders used a common translator circuit to detect a call going to a nearby area code to be stored in abbreviated form. It called in an auxiliary sender when necessary to implement Direct Distance Dialing (DDD). Like the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> two or more offices with separate incoming sections could share an outgoing section for more efficient trunking. Unlike the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> it was rare to combine more than two this way.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how the foreign bank entry in a host country affects domestic bank performance and whether this relationship depends on the economic and financial conditions. The panel data sample consists of 795 individual banks in 39 countries for the period 1991 - 2006. The departs from previous studies in the following three aspects. First, this paper adopts the percentage of foreign ownership as a proxy for the degree of foreign bank entry. Secondly, this paper comprehensively proposes three conditions affecting the relationship, such as economic development, financial development, and business cycles. Finally, in addition to the conventional static panel data model, Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) technique, a commonly used estimation procedure for dynamic panel data models, is applied. Empirical results confirm the premise that economic and financial conditions do have an impact on the relationship in the dynamic panel framework, and are demonstrated as follows. Firstly, foreign bank entry is associated with a decrease in profitability and overhead expenses of the domestic bank particularly in using the dynamic panel model. Moreover, the lower level of economic development mitigates the positive effect of foreign bank entry on non-interest income and overhead expenses of domestic banks. Third, the results of financial development consists of two parts: the lower level of bank development mitigates the positive effect of foreign bank entry on net interest margin, profitability, overhead expenses and loan loss provision of domestic banks. The lower level of stock development mitigates the positive effects of foreign bank entry on non-interest incomes and loan loss provision, and strengthens the positive effects of foreign bank entry on profitability of domestic banks. Finally, the business cycle mitigates the positive effect of foreign bank entry on the margins and profit for domestic banks implying that business cycles are an important role in determining the effect of foreign bank entry. This paper concludes that foreign bank entry has direct effects on domestic bank performance, especially when conditional factors are taken into consideration.
