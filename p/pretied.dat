40|$|Background: Peritoneal tear during {{endoscopic}} extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty (TEP) {{results in}} pneumoperitoneum {{and loss of}} extraperitoneal space. To avoid bowel adhesions, internal herniation, and mesh migration, closure of the peritoneal opening is preferred. The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy of various operative techniques for the closure of peritoneal laceration. Methods: Between April 2000 and May 2001, 100 consecutive patients undergoing 123 TEPs were recruited for the present study. The incidence of peritoneal tear and techniques for the closure of peritoneal opening were documented. Operative time and postoperative morbidity were compared among groups for which different closure methods of peritoneal laceration were used. Results: The incidence of peritoneal tear was 47 %. The mean operative times of unilateral TEPs with and without peritoneal laceration were 66 min and 53 min, respectively (p< 0. 05). Techniques for the closure of the peritoneal opening included endoscopic stapling (n = 12), endoscopic suturing (n = 14), and <b>pretied</b> suture loop ligation (n = 21). The mean operative times for unilateral TEPs with endoscopic stapling, <b>pretied</b> suture loop ligation, and endoscopic suturing of peritoneal tear were 53, 64, and 82 min, respectively (p< 0. 05). Comparison of postoperative morbidity showed no significant differences among the three groups. Conclusion: Peritoneal tear is a frequent and challenging intraoperative event during TEP. Its occurrence significantly prolongs the length of operation. Endoscopic stapling and <b>pretied</b> suture loop ligation are safe and quick techniques for the closure of peritoneal tear during TEP. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|Ectopic {{pregnancy}} (EP) constitutes one of {{the major}} gynaecological emergencies. In the UK, there are around 11, 000 cases of EP per year (incidence 11.5 per 1, 000 pregnancies), with 11 deaths in the last triennium [1]. Persistent ectopic pregnancy (PEP) can present as a more serious health risk than classical EP, with up to 24 % rupturing in the postoperative period after conservative therapy of EP [2]. The majority of EP patients present subacutely, and diagnosis is usually made using algorithms that include a combination of symptoms, ultrasound scans and beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). Though it is possible to manage certain cases conservatively or medically, for the majority of women, surgery remains the mainstay of treatment, which may be radical (salpingectomy) or conservative (salpingostomy), with operative laparoscopy being the gold standard. It is advised that if the contralateral tube is damaged salpingostomy be performed, but this may be associated with persistent trophoblast, and women need to be followed up with serial hCG estimations. Salpingectomies on the other hand are performed when the contralateral tube is normal, using either manufactured <b>pretied</b> knots (endoloops) or diathermy. Because the tube is removed, there should be no need for serial hCG estimations.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{very common}} Experiment, by {{striking}} with a Flint against a Steel, to make certain fiery and shining Sparks to fly out from between those two compressing Bodies. About eight years since, upon casually reading the Explication of this odd Phænomenon, by the most Ingenious Des Cartes, I had a great desire to be satisfied, what that Substance was that gave such a shining and bright Light: And to that end I spread a sheet of white Paper, and on it, observing the place where several of these Sparks seemed to vanish, I found certain very small, black, but glittering Spots of a movable Substance, each of which examining with my Microscope, I {{found to be a}} small round Globule; some of which, as they looked <b>prety</b> small, so did they from their Surface yield a very bright and strong reflection on that side which was next the Light; and each look'd almost like a <b>prety</b> bright Iron-Ball, whose Surface was <b>prety</b> regular, such as is represented by the Figure A. In this I could perceive the Image of the Window <b>prety</b> well, or of a Stick, which I moved up and down between the Light and it. Others I found, which were, as to the bulk of the Ball, <b>prety</b> regularly round, but the Surface of them, as it was not very smooth, but rough, and more irregular, so was the reflection from it more faint and confused. Such were the Surfaces of B. C. D. and E. Some of these I found cleft or cracked, as C, others quite broken in two and hollow, as D. which seemed to be half the hollow shell of a Granado, broken irregularly in pieces. Several others I found of other shapes; but that which is represented by E, I observed to be a very big Spark of fire, which went out upon one side of the Flint that I struck fire withall, to which it stuck by the root F, {{at the end of which}} small Stem was fastened-on a Hemisphere, or half a hollow Ball, with the mouth of it open from the stemwards, so that it looked much like a Funnel, or an old fashioned Bowl without a foot. This night, making many tryals and observations of this Experiment, I met, among a multitude of the Globular ones which I had observed, a couple of Instances, which are very remarkable to the confirmation of my Hypothesis.|$|R

60|$|The Seventh {{and last}} {{therefore}} that I shall prove, is, That the gradual {{heating and cooling}} of these so extended bodies does reduce {{the parts of the}} Glass to a looser and softer temper. And this I found by heating them, and keeping them for a <b>prety</b> while very red hot in a fire; for thereby I found them to grow a little lighter, and the small Stems to be very easily broken and snapt any where, without at all making the drop fly; whereas before they were so exceeding hard, that they could not be broken without much difficulty; and upon their breaking the whole drop would fly in pieces with very great violence. The Reason of which last seems to be, that the leisurely heating and cooling of the parts does not only wast some part of the Glass it self, but ranges all the parts into a better order, and gives each Particle an opportunity of relaxing its self, and consequently neither will the parts hold so strongly together as before, nor be so difficult to be broken: The parts now more easily yielding, nor will the other parts fly in pieces, because the parts have no bended Springs. The relaxation also in the temper of hardned Steel, and hammered Metals, by nealing them in the fire, seems to proceed from much the same cause. For both by quenching suddenly such Metals as have vitrifed parts interspers'd, as Steel has, and by hammering of other kinds that do not so much abound with them, as Silver Brass, &c. the parts are put into and detained in a bended posture, which by the agitation of Heat are shaken, and loosened, and suffered to unbend themselves.|$|R
60|$|The {{stems of}} the Downy {{branches}} INOE, being rang'd {{in the order}} visible enough to the naked eye, at the distance of IF, or somewhat more, the collateral stalks and leaves (if I may so call those bodies I newly described) are so rang'd, that the leaves or hairy stalks of the one side lie at top, or are incumbent on the stalks of the other, and cross each other, much after the manner express'd in the second Figure of the 22. Scheme, by which means every of those little hooked fibres of the leaved stalk get between the naked stalks, and the stalks being full of knots, and a <b>prety</b> way dis-join'd, so as that the fibres can easily get between them, the two parts are so closely and admirably woven together, that {{it is able to}} impede, for the greatest part, the transcursion of the Air; and though they are so exceeding small, as that the thickness of one of these stalks amounts not to a 500. part of an Inch, yet do they compose so strong a texture, as, notwithstanding the exceeding quick and violent beating of them against the Air, by the strength of the Birds wing, they firmly hold together. And it argues an admirable providence of Nature in the contrivance and fabrick of them; for their texture is such, that though by any external injury the parts of them are violently dis-joyn'd, so as that the leaves and stalks touch not one another, and consequently several of these rents would impede the Bird's flying; yet, for the most part, of themselves they readily re-join and re-contex themselves, and are easily by the Birds stroking the Feather, or drawing it through its Bill, all of them settled and woven into their former and natural posture; for there are such an infinite company of those small fibres in the under side of the leaves, and most of them have such little crooks at their ends, that they readily catch and hold the stalks they touch.|$|R
60|$|And {{this will}} make my next Position probable, that {{the parts of the}} Glass drops are contignated {{together}} {{in the form of an}} Arch, cannot any where yield or be drawn inwards, till by the removing of some one part of it (as it happens in the removing one of the stones of an Arch) the whole Fabrick is shatter'd, and falls to pieces, and each of the Springs is left at liberty, suddenly to extricate it self: for since I have made it probable, that the internal parts of the Glass have a contractive power inwards, and the external parts are incapable of such a Contraction, and the figure of it being spherical; it follows, that the superficial parts must bear against each other, and keep one another from being condens'd into a less room, in the same manner as the stones of an Arch conduce to the upholding each other in that Figure. And this is made more probable by another Experiment which was communicated to me by an excellent Person, whose extraordinary Abilities in all kind of Knowledg, especially in that of Natural things, and his generous Disposition in communicating, incouraged me to have recourse to him on many occasions. The Experiment was this: Small Glass-balls (about the bigness of that represented in the Figure &.) would, upon rubbing or scratching the inward Surface, fly all insunder, with a pretty brisk noise; whereas neither before nor after the inner Surface had been thus scratcht, did there appear any flaw or crack. And putting the pieces of one of those broken ones together again, the flaws appeared much after the manner of the black lines on the Figure, &. These Balls were small, but exceeding thick bubbles of Glass, which being crack'd off from the Puntilion whilst very hot, and so suffered to cool without nealing them in the Oven over the Furnace, do thereby (being made of white Glass, which cools much quicker then green Glass, and is thereby made much brittler) acquire a very porous and very brittle texture: so that if with the point of a Needle or Bodkin, the inside of any of them be rubbed <b>prety</b> hard, and then laid on a Table, it will, within a very little while, break into many pieces with a brisk noise, and throw the parts above a span asunder on the Table: Now though the pieces are not so small as those of a fulminating drop, yet they as plainly shew, that the outward parts of the Glass have a great Conatus to fly asunder, were they not held together by the tenacity of the parts of the inward Surface: for we see as soon as those parts are crazed by hard rubbing, and thereby their tenacity spoiled, the springiness of the more outward parts quickly makes a divulsion, and the broken pieces will, if the concave Surface of them be further scratcht with a Diamond, fly again into smaller pieces.|$|R
60|$|That {{the first}} of these is true may be {{gathered}} from this, That Heat is a property of a body arising from the motion or agitation of its parts; and therefore whatever body is thereby toucht must necessarily receive some part of that motion, whereby its parts will be shaken and agitated, and so by degrees free and extricate themselves from one another, and each part so moved does by that motion exert a conatus of protruding and displacing all the adjacent Particles. Thus Air included in a vessel, by being heated will burst it to pieces. Thus have I broke a Bladder held over the fire in my hand, with such a violence and noise, that it almost made me deaf for the present, and much surpassed the noise of a Musket: The like have I done by throwing into the fire small glass Bubbles hermetically sealed, with a little drop of Water included in them. Thus Water also, or any other Liquor, included in a convenient vessel, by being warmed, manifestly expands it self with a very great violence, so as to break the strongest vessel, if when heated it be narrowly imprisoned in it. This is very manifest by the Sealed Thermometers, which I have, by several tryals, at last brought to a great certainty and tenderness: for I have made some with stems above four foot long, in which the expanding Liquor would so far vary, as to be very neer the very top in the heat of Summer, and <b>prety</b> neer the bottom at the coldest time of the Winter. The Stems I use for them are very thick, straight, and even Pipes of Glass, with a very small perforation, and both the head and body I have made on purpose at the Glass-house, of the same metal whereof the Pipes are drawn: these I can easily in the flame of a Lamp, urged with the blast of a pair of Bellows, seal and close together, so as to remain very firm, close and even; by this means I joyn on the body first, and then fill both it and a part of the stem, proportionate to the length of the stem and the warmth of the season I fill it in with the best rectified Spirit of Wine highly ting'd with the lovely colour of Cocheneel, which I deepen the more by pouring some drops of common Spirit of Urine, which must not be too well rectified, because it will be apt to make the Liquor to curdle and stick in the small perforation of the stem. This Liquor I have upon tryal found the most tender of any spirituous Liquor, and those are much more sensibly affected with the variations of heat and cold then other more flegmatick and ponderous Liquors, and as capable of receiving a deep tincture, and keeping it, as any Liquor whatsoever; and (which makes it yet more acceptable) is not subject to be frozen by any cold yet known. When I have thus filled it, I can very easily in the forementioned flame of a Lamp seal and joyn on the head of it.|$|R
