In this paper we will attack this problem using the Differential Evolution approach [PS 97] and significantly improve results previously obtained using classical optimization procedures. 1 Introduction The communication revolution initiated by the phenomenal explosion of the Internet and wireless communication has led to an increased use of error correcting codes as a means of protecting information against communication errors. Nowadays, codes are being used in many diverse communication media such as wireless phones, satellites, hard disks, CD's, modems, and the Internet, to name a few. The general idea of coding theory is to partition the data into blocks and augment the blocks with redundant information so that an error recovery is possible if some part of the in [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Multi-path multi-hop {{transmission}} is commonly seen in many communication scenarios, where {{one or more}} intermediate nodes may connect the source and destination nodes along a single path and multiple such paths may exist in parallel. Network coding [1 – 3] can be beneficial in such scenarios. When packets pass through lossy multi-hop links, if intermediate nodes re-encode packets with previously received ones, coding can achieve the max-flow capacities of the links [4] and therefore improve the end-to-end transmission rate while offering <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erasures.</b> Importantly, this improvement is achieved without the need of either acknowledgements between nodes or estimation of link qualities. Random linear network coding (RLNC) [5], in which the re-encoded packets are random linear combinations of packets received at the intermediate node, can achieve this in a distributed manner. RLNC {{is known to be}} asymptotically rate-optimal, i.e., it achieves the max-flow capacity when the size of the arithmetic field used for coding goes to infinity.|$|R
30|$|Video content can be {{provided}} to an end user by transmitting video data as a sequence of internet protocol (IP) packets over the network. When the network contains a wireless link, packet erasures occur because of occasional deep fades. In order to maintain a sufficient video quality at the end user, video packets must be protected <b>against</b> <b>erasures</b> {{by means of a}} suitable form of error control. In this contribution, we investigate two types of error control: (1) forward error correction (FEC), which involves the transmission of parity packets that enables recovery of a limited number of erased video packets, and (2) the use of an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol, where the receiver requests the retransmission of video packets that have been erased. We point out that FEC and ARQ considerably reduce the probability of unrecoverable packet loss, because both error control techniques provide a diversity gain, as compared to the case where no <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erasures</b> is applied. We derive a simple analytical expression for the diversity gain resulting from FEC or ARQ, in terms of the channel coherence time, the allowable latency, and (for FEC) the allowable overhead or (for ARQ) the time interval between (re)transmissions of copies of a same packet. In the case of HDTV transmission over a 60 [*]GHz indoor wireless link, ARQ happens to outperform FEC.|$|R

40|$|Application layer forward error {{correction}} is becoming a popular addition to protocols for real-time video delivery over IP-based wireless networks. Since each part of video data is not equally important for video reconstruction, it is beneficial to divide video data based on its importance. Such partitioned data could then be provided with different degree of protection, with the important data having more <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> channel <b>erasures.</b> Data partitioning (DP) is one such low-cost feature in H. 264 /AVC enabling partitioning of video data based on its importance. In this paper, we propose an Unequal error protection (UEP) scheme to protect the DP H. 264 /AVC coded video data with Raptor and Random linear codes (RLC). The simulations have been performed using error traces which depict physical-layer Transport Stream (TS) packet losses in DVB-H. The results highlight that for broadcasting applications with varying channel conditions, better results can be obtained with dynamic probability of selection of different importance layers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Data erasure {{can often}} occur in communication. Guarding <b>against</b> <b>erasures</b> {{involves}} redundancy in data representation. Mathematically {{this may be}} achieved by redundancy {{through the use of}} frames. One way to measure the robustness of a frame <b>against</b> <b>erasures</b> is to examine the worst case condition number of the frame with a certain number of vectors erased from the frame. The term numerically erasure-robust frames (NERFs) was introduced in [9] to give a more precise characterization of erasure robustness of frames. In the paper the authors established that random frames whose entries are drawn independently from the standard normal distribution can be robust against up to approximately 15 % erasures, and asked whether there exist frames that are robust <b>against</b> <b>erasures</b> of more than 50 %. In this paper we show that with very high probability random frames are, independent of the dimension, robust against any amount of erasures as long as the number of remaining vectors is at least 1 + δ times the dimension for some δ 0 > 0. This is the best possible result, and it also implies that the proportion of erasures can arbitrarily close to 1 while still maintaining robustness. Our result depends crucially on a new estimate for the smallest singular value of a rectangular random matrix with independent standard normal entries. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{propensity}} of retroviruses to rapidly establish persistent infections poses a formidable problem in vaccination strategies. In the current study, {{we use a}} live attenuated vaccine to study <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute and persistent Friend virus infections in mice. Adoptive transfers of immune CD 8 + T cells combined with passive immunizations with virus-neutralizing antibodies increased <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease compared with either treatment alone, {{but there was no}} <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> the establishment of persistent infection. In addition, the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease elicited by the combination treatment was dependent on endogenous CD 4 + T cells as no protection was achieved in CD 4 + T-cell-depleted mice. Quantitative studies showed that doubling the numbers of immune lymphocytes used in adoptive transfer experiments increased <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease {{depending on the type of}} lymphocyte subset used in the transfer. CD 8 + T cells were the most potent subset for the transfer of such protection. However, even high numbers of immune CD 8 + T cells gave no <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> the establishment of persistent infections. The data indicate that strengthening the numbers of specific immune cell subsets may have a beneficial effect on <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease, but protection from establishment of persistence requires complex immune responses involving multiple lymphocyte subsets...|$|R
