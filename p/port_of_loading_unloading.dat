40|$|Development of {{information}} technologies and market requirements in effective control over cargo flows, forces enterprises {{to look for}} new ways and methods of automated control over the technological operations. For rail transportation {{one of the most}} complicated tasks of automation is the cargo flows distribution over the sites <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading.</b> In this article the solution with the use of one of the methods of artificial intelligence – a fuzzy inference has been proposed. The analysis of the last publications showed that the fuzzy inference method is effective for the solution of similar tasks, it makes it possible to accumulate experience, it is stable to temporary impacts of the environmental conditions. The existing methods of the cargo flows distribution over the sites <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> are too simplified and can lead to incorrect decisions. The purpose of the article is to create a distribution model of cargo flows of the enterprises over the sites <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading,</b> basing on the fuzzy inference method and to automate the control. To achieve the objective a mathematical model of the cargo flows distribution over the sites <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> has been made using fuzzy logic. The key input parameters of the model are: «number <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> sites», «arrival <b>of</b> the next set of cars», «availability of additional operations». The output parameter is «a variety of set of cars». Application of the fuzzy inference method made it possible to reduce loading time by 15 % and to reduce costs for preparatory operations before loading by 20 %. Thus this method is an effective means and holds the greatest promise for railway competitiveness increase. Interaction between different types of transportation and their influence on the cargo flows distribution over the sites <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> and <b>unloading</b> hasn’t been considered. These sites may be busy transshipping at that very time which is characteristic of large enterprises. Besides, the question of gaining experience in this model isn't tackled yet and it is to be developed in further publication...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The major {{difficulties}} of the operation <b>of</b> <b>loading,</b> <b>unloading</b> and transportation at container terminals are how to schedule berths, quay cranes and trucks more effectively and efficiently. Therefore, how to optimize their configurations effectively and connect them more reasonably is a problem which should be solved eagerly. However, a reasonable and effective optimization model is the basis and the key of this problem. The operation time of container terminals mainly depends on the time <b>of</b> ships in <b>port</b> and the operation time of trucks, quay cranes and yard cranes. So, {{the objective of this}} paper is to minimize the sum of these four parts. An optimization model based on some reasonable and necessary hypotheses is proposed and an algorithm and procedure are designed...|$|R
