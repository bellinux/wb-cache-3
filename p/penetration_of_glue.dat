40|$|Pressboard is a cellulose-based material, {{which is}} used in {{transformers}} as insulation {{as well as for}} providing structural support. The micro-structure of pressboard consists of networks of cellulose fibers, which has good mechanical properties as well as exceptional electrical insulation properties. Paper materials, such as pressboard, have anisotropic material properties due to events in the manufacturing process. Pressboard has been investigated earlier, but here laminated pressboard is studied. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the mechanical properties by means of experimental characterization and finite element simulations. The mechanical responses of laminated pressboard were studied under three- and four-pointbending (flexure) tests. In addition to the flexure tests, shear tests were performed on samples with asymmetric double notches under uniaxial tension. The objective of these tests was to calibrate model parameters related to through-thickness shear deformation. The finite element simulations of the shear tests captured the initial behavior of the experiments. At increasing strain levels there was a discrepancy between the experimental results and the results from the simulations. This can be explained by the evolution of damage in the material under the experiments and damage was not included in the present model. The simulations of the bending tests had a weaker response compared to the experiments for both three- and four-point bending. This could be explained by the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> into the pressboard, which makes the overall response of the laminated material stiffer...|$|E
30|$|The {{strength}} properties of wood-based composites are depend on many {{factors such as}} physical and mechanical properties of individual wood particles, their interfacial adhesion, the orientation and aspect ratio of particles [3, 44, 45]. Cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses contents of the lignocellulosics had strong influences on the mechanical properties [46]. Aspect ratio, rather than particle size, has the greatest effect on strength and stiffness [42]. The fiber length of paulownia (Paulownia fortunei) wood is around 0.8 – 1  mm and its aspect ratio is about 25 [47], which are less than those of some hardwoods and softwoods [42] and even less than those of fibers from agro-materials like oilseed stalk, corn stalk, and reed stalk [48]. Density of paulownia (Paulownia fortunei) wood is quite low (0.26  g/cm 3) in comparison to many common hardwoods like beech, oak, hornbeam, and ironwood [49]. Low density strands disturb the interface bond strength and require high compaction to reduce porosity and combination of locked-in internal stresses with an evaporating steam from the furnish leads to catastrophic delamination of interface bonds specially for UF bonded panels [4]. In hardwoods, vessels, morphological structural elements in longitudinal series exposed in transverse section constitute about 10 – 46  % of the stem and are cells of relatively large diameters (50 – 300  nm) which appear as the open vertical tubes within the wood structure because their end walls have partially dissolved [10]. It was also reported that resins with low molecular weights easily penetrated into the wood cell walls; however, the resins with much higher molecular weights tended only to reach the wood cell lumen instead of the cell walls [50]. Too high flow ability leads to an overpenetration of the resin into the wood and to a starved glue line [10]. In such a case, no glue line and hence no bonding strength can be formed. Resin penetration {{is a function of}} resin viscosity, chemical compatibility of the resin with the strands surface and physical condition of the strands surface [4, 10]. The quality of bonding and hence the properties and the performance of the wood-based panels and beams are determined by three main parameters: (1) the wood, especially the wood surface, including the interface between the wood surface and the bond line; (2) the adhesive; (3) the working conditions and process parameters [10]. Nanoparticles by decreasing the UF resins viscosity could prevent too much of adhesive from filtering into the wood to create the phenomena of permeation or inadequate bonding [15]. <b>Penetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> in the sense of filling of cell cavities—not cell walls—has received considerable attention [51]. At low weight OMMT loadings, the enhancement of properties of composites is attributed to the lower percolation points created by the high aspect ratio nanoclays. The increase in properties may also be attributed to the formation of intercalated and exfoliated nanocomposite structures formed at these clay loadings [20, 26, 51, 52]. The properties of panels pressed for lower time (7  min) were better than those pressed for more time (10  min). By taking into account that nanoclay has an accelerating effect on UF curing time [20], the reason could be because of partial degradation of cured UF polymer and damages of paulownia wood cell wall as it is thinner than common woods [42, 47]. When wood-based composites are hot-pressed under conditions of high temperature and low moisture content, compressive stresses are imparted to the individual wood cells resulting in damaged wood cell walls and strength losses [10, 53].|$|E
40|$|Finger {{jointing}} of unseasoned Norway Spruce was {{studied with}} respect to tensile strength, adhesive penetration and durability. Finger joints were manufactured with 1) unseasoned wood and one component polyurethane (PUR) adhesive, 2) dried wood and PUR adhesive and 3) dried wood and phenol resorcinol formaldehyde (PRF) adhesive. Two levels of wood density were used. The tensile strength of the finger joints was determined and the deformations within the joint were studied with an optical measurement system (ARAMIS). The <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the adhesive was studied with x-ray microtomography. The durability of the joints was determined according to the standard ASTM D 4688.

The <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the PUR adhesive is high in the unseasoned wood and cavities within the bonds seem to be smaller than in dry glued PUR joints.
