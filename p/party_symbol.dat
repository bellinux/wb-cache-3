25|$|On 26 July 1935 in New York a {{group of}} demonstrators boarded the SS Bremen, tore the Nazi party flag from the jackstaff and threw it into the Hudson River. The German {{ambassador}} sharply protested, but the protest was rejected, with the judgement that only a <b>party</b> <b>symbol</b> was harmed and the national flag was not affected. On 15 September 1935, {{in response to this}} incident, the Reichsflaggengesetz (Reichs flag law) (RGBl. I S. 1145) came into effect, declaring the Nazi flag to be the exclusive national flag of Germany and removing the status of the black-white-red tricolor flag of the German Empire as co-national flag.|$|E
500|$|On 15 September 1935, {{one year}} after the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler's {{elevation}} to the position of Führer, the dual flag arrangement was ended, with the exclusive use of the Nazi flag as the national flag of Germany. One reason may have been the [...] "Bremen incident" [...] of 26 July 1935, in which a group of demonstrators in New York City boarded the ocean liner SS Bremen, tore the Nazi Party flag from the jackstaff, and tossed it into the Hudson River. When the German ambassador protested, US officials responded that the German national flag had not been harmed, only a political <b>party</b> <b>symbol.</b> The new flag law was announced at the annual party rally in Nuremberg, where Hermann Göring claimed the old black-white-red flag, while honoured, was the symbol of a bygone era and under threat of being used by [...] "reactionaries".|$|E

2500|$|The party {{conference in}} 1931 passed a motion [...] "That this conference adopts Party Colours, {{which should be}} uniform {{throughout}} the country, colours to be red and gold". Since the party's inception, the red flag has been Labour's official symbol; the flag {{has been associated with}} socialism and revolution ever since the 1789 French Revolution and the revolutions of 1848. The red rose, a symbol of social democracy, was adopted as the <b>party</b> <b>symbol</b> in 1986 as part of a rebranding exercise and is now incorporated into the party logo.|$|E
2500|$|Curiously enough, {{the use of}} a {{palm tree}} as a <b>party</b> <b>symbol</b> by the NPP was suggested, indirectly, by the opposition. In the {{original}} 1967 status plebiscite, then Puerto Rico governor Roberto Sánchez Vilella asked one of his then staff members, future governor Rafael Hernández Colón to come up with three ideas for art clips, as to identify each of the three status options in the ballot and assist illiterate voters who {{might not be able to}} read it. In his book [...] "Vientos de Cambio", Hernández Colón recalls that he conceived the three symbols while at the backyard of his father-in-law's house in Ponce, Puerto Rico. One of the symbols (the one which eventually represented the statehood option in the ballot) was a [...] "palma real" [...] (Roystonea regia), a species of palm tree that is native to the Caribbean. The group [...] "Estadistas Unidos", the statehood supporters who broke rank with García Méndez to participate at the plebiscite, adopted the palm tree as a potential <b>party</b> <b>symbol</b> when they incorporated the PNP. Due to electoral law restrictions, however, they were forbidden to use a [...] "palma real" [...] as a logo because of its previous use in an election; therefore, a coconut (Cocos nucifera) palm tree was used instead. The use of the coconut palm tree as a symbol by the PNP persists to this day.|$|E
2500|$|Nazi Germany {{used the}} Weimar {{coat of arms}} until 1935. The Nazi Party used a black eagle above a stylised oak wreath, with a {{swastika}} at its centre. With the eagle looking over its left shoulder, that is, looking to the right from the viewer's point of view, it symbolises the Nazi Party, and was therefore called the Parteiadler. After 1935 the Nazis introduced their <b>party</b> <b>symbol</b> as the national insignia (Hoheitszeichen) as well. This version symbolises the country (Reich), and was therefore called the Reichsadler. It can be distinguished from the Parteiadler because the eagle of the latter is looking over its right shoulder, that is, looking to the left from the viewer's point of view. The emblem was established by a regulation made by Adolf Hitler, November 1, 1935: ...|$|E

2500|$|Each Dravidian {{party is}} {{represented}} by its own flag. Black and Red are the usual colours used, a feature which traces its origin to Periyar's visit to Axis countries and Soviet Russia. On his arrival back home, he declared that his party members would wear black shirts whenever and wherever possible [...] "as {{a symbol of the}} present down-trodden condition of Dravidians". The design of the DMK flag consists of two colour rectangles, with the top half black and the bottom half red. The black color reflects the dark political, economical and social situation of Dravidians. Red is used to signify [...] "rising sunlight" [...] that removes the darkness. The red rises from the bottom and is expected to slowly remove all the darkness. Years later, when DMK contested elections, it would take the [...] "rising sun" [...] as the <b>party</b> <b>symbol.</b> AIADMK uses the black and red combination with a picture of Annadurai in white in the middle and hence it is sometimes characterised as being a tricoloured flag: black and red with white in the middle. The MDMK flag consists of two red stripes with a black stripe in the center.|$|E
