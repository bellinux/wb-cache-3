5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for <b>postoperative</b> <b>pain</b> control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To compare {{cemented}} versus cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasty {{in terms}} of operating time, blood loss, pain, functional outcome, morbidity, and mortality. Methods. Medical records of 207 patients aged ≥ 60 years who underwent bipolar hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fracture using a cemented (n= 96) or cementless (n= 111) prosthesis were reviewed. <b>Postoperative</b> thigh <b>pain,</b> ambulatory status, and complications were assessed. Results. The cemented group had significantly longer operating time (p= 0. 017) and greater intra-operative blood loss (p= 0. 024). <b>Postoperative</b> thigh <b>pain</b> was significantly higher in the cementless group (p= 0. 023). Conclusion. Cementless hemiarthroplasty is preferred over cemented hemiarthroplasty because of reduced operating time and intra-operative blood loss. It was associated with increased <b>postoperative</b> thigh <b>pain,</b> but functional outcomes, complications, Cemented versus cementless hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fractures in the elderl...|$|R

2500|$|Local {{anesthetic}} nerve block (local anesthetic regional nerve blockade, or often simply nerve block) is {{a short-term}} nerve block involving the injection of local anesthetic {{as close to}} the nerve as possible for pain relief.

[...] The goal of the nerve block is to prevent pain by blocking the transmission of pain signals from the surgical site. [...] The block provides pain relief during and after the surgery.

2500|$|Coblation tonsillectomy: This {{surgical}} procedure {{is performed using}} plasma to remove the tonsils. Coblation technology combines radiofrequency energy and saline to create a plasma field. The plasma field is able to dissociate molecular bonds of target tissue while remaining relatively cool (40-70°C), which results in minimal or no damage to surrounding healthy tissue. A Coblation tonsillectomy is carried out in an operating room setting, with the patient under general anesthesia. Tonsillectomies are generally performed for two main reasons: tonsillar hypertrophy (enlarged tonsils) and recurrent tonsillitis. It has been claimed that this technique results in less pain, faster healing, and less post operative care. [...] However, review of 21 studies gives conflicting results about levels of pain, and its comparative safety {{has yet to be}} confirmed. This technique has been criticized for a higher than expected rate of bleeding presumably due to the low temperature which may be insufficient to seal the divided blood vessels but several papers offer conflicting (some positive, some negative) results. More recent studies of coblation tonsillectomy indicate reduced pain and ostalgia; less intraoperative or postoperative complications; lesser incidence of delayed hemorrhage, more significantly in pediatric populations, less <b>postoperative</b> <b>pain</b> and early return to daily activities, fewer secondary infections of the tonsil bed and significantly lower rates of secondary hemorrhage. Unlike the electrosurgery procedure, Coblation Tonsillectomy generates significantly lower temperatures on contacted tissue. [...] Long term studies seem to show that surgeons experienced with the technique have very few complications.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Throat packs are {{routinely}} placed in (para) nasal surgery, {{based on the}} assumption they prevent postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) by preventing blood and wound debris to run into the hypopharynx and being swallowed. Literature suggests a throat pack does not lower the incidence of PONV, but does cause more <b>postoperative</b> throat <b>pain.</b> In addition a throat pack bares possible dangers, such as postoperative asphyxia. Objective: The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the influence of a throat pack on the incidence and severity of <b>postoperative</b> throat <b>pain.</b> Influence of insertion mode (manual vs. under direct vision) was also addressed. Lastly, incidence and severity of PONV were evaluated to get an impression of the effectiveness of throat packs. Methods: We designed an observational prospective trial comparing the research group of (para) nasal surgery patients in whom a throat pack is used with a control group of diverse surgery patients, also operated under general anaesthesia and endotracheal intubated. Incidence and severity of throat pain and PONV were recorded directly postoperative and 24 hours postoperative. Results: A throat pack increases the chance on suffering from throat pain (OR 2. 4) due to a higher incidence directly <b>postoperative.</b> Throat <b>pain</b> was severe both directly postoperative and 24 hours postoperative when a throat pack was placed. No statistical significant differences were found in incidence and severity of PONV, neither between research and control group nor between modes of inserting the throat pack. Conclusion: A throat pack causes significantly more and severe <b>postoperative</b> throat <b>pain</b> than endotracheal intubation alone. Insertion mode does not influence the effectiveness of hypopharyngeal packing. PONV incidence and severity after (para) nasal surgery with a routinely placed throat pack does not differ from a general surgery population, suggesting the throat pack is effective in preventing PONV evoked by blood in the stomach. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Anterior open {{treatment}} of the inguinal hernia with a tension-free mesh has reduced the incidence of hernia recurrence. The Lichtenstein procedure is the current reference technique for inguinal hernia treatment. Chronic pain has become the main postoperative complication after surgical inguinal hernia repair, especially following Lichtenstein. Preliminary experiences with a soft mesh positioned in the preperitoneal space (PPS) by transinguinal preperitoneal (TIPP) or total extraperitoneal (TEP) technique, showed promising results considering the reduction of <b>postoperative</b> chronic <b>pain.</b> Evolution of surgical innovations for inguinal hernia repair led to an open, direct approach with preperitoneal mesh position, such as TIPP. Based on the TIPP procedure, another preperitoneal repair has been recently developed, the transrectus sheath preperitoneal (TREPP) mesh repair. METHODS: The ENTREPPMENT trial is a multicentre randomized clinical trial. Patients will be randomly allocated to anterior inguinal hernia repair according to the TREPP mesh repair or TIPP procedure. All patients with a primary unilateral inguinal hernia, eligible for operation, will be {{invited to participate in}} the trial. The primary outcome measure will be the number of patients with <b>postoperative</b> chronic <b>pain.</b> Secondary outcome measures will be serious adverse events (SAEs), including recurrence, hemorrhage, return to daily activities (for example work), operative time and hospital stay. Alongside the trial health status, an economic evaluation will be performed. To demonstrate that inguinal hernia repair according to the TREPP technique reduces the percentage of patients with <b>postoperative</b> chronic <b>pain</b> from 12 % to < 6 %, a sample size of 800 patients is required (two-sided test, alpha = 0. 05, 80 % power). The ENTREPPMENT trial aims to evaluate the TREPP and TIPP procedures from patients' perspective. It is hypothesized that the TREPP technique may reduce the number of patients with any form of <b>postoperative</b> chronic <b>pain</b> by 50 % compared to the TIPP procedure.
