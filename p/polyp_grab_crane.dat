Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A <b>grab</b> <b>crane</b> then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Permeable Reactive Barriers (PRBs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} solutions for the remediation of contaminated aquifers. Although, a variety of excavation methods have been developed, backhoe (hydraulic excavators) are commonly used for the construction of PRBs in North America. Approach: In Europe, the most common method of slurry excavation is with a hydraulic <b>grab</b> and <b>crane.</b> The aim of this study is to compare clamshell and backhoe excavation techniques and to describe the installation of a full scale PRB using a crawler crane equipped with a hydraulic grab. Results: Backhoes have been used on a larger number of PRB installations and permit a rapid rate of excavation and generally require less skill to master. Long stick backhoes are capable of digging as deep as 30 m. Instead, clamshell excavators require more skill to use, but are able to excavate to a depth of more than 70 m, with a high degree of precision. Two similar case studies are presented to compare the relative merits of the two excavation techniques. Conclusion/Recommendations: The first describes a funnel and gate system excavated by long stick backhoe, in the US, whose longest gate is 0. 73 m thick, 68 m long and up to 13 m deep. The latter is a 0. 6 m thick, 120 m long and 13 m deep continuous PRB, excavated by <b>crane</b> mounted <b>grab</b> to remediate a chlorinated hydrocarbons plume, in Avigliana, near the city of Torino, in Italy.

40|$|Crane {{companies}} face difficulties when installing {{blades of}} wind turbines: the tall cranes required for installation have large sail areas and {{are unable to}} lift 80 % of the time due to too high wind speeds. Also load control by men from the ground is limited in high winds. To design a new installation method, enabling more lifting days per year without sacrificing safety, wind research is executed. Height and gust correction factors as well as wind distribution functions are analyzed to compare the existing with the newly developed method. After a concept phase, a multi-criteria analysis shows that a fixed blade manipulator is the most favorable concept installation method. A manipulator connected {{to the tip of}} the <b>crane</b> <b>grabs</b> the blade around its center of gravity. By erecting the crane, the blade is lifted to the hub from a 6 o’clock direction. This manipulator needs to be designed. After a degrees of freedom analysis, the program of requirements shows that the manipulator requires 4 degrees of freedom: three rotations and one translation. Because each degree influences the next, the optimal order of degrees is derived. For each degree, the best combination of mechanism and drive system is selected. The largest surface of the blade is pointed towards the crane to optimize the crane’s strength. The functional design of the manipulator is transferred into a structural design by dimensioning the components and a 3 D CAD model is created. Calculation shows that the bending moment around the crane base by wind from the side is 33 % less when the manipulator is used; resulting in 43 % more lifting days with equal bending moments.

Introduced in August 2007, Viki {{is shown}} {{as having a}} rather shy demeanor, as she often whispers to Esme and then has Esme repeat what she has said to whoever may be around. Since Viki's arrival in Harmony, this {{behavior}} has often been exhibited around Fox Crane. Following her parents' death, Viki becomes Esme's ward. In the January 3, 2008 episode {{it was revealed that}} Viki is indeed the murderer of Esme's boyfriends. Viki speaks aloud {{for the first time on}} the January 9, 2008 episode. She screams [...] "Leave me alone!" [...] when Alistair <b>Crane</b> <b>grabs</b> her arm after she makes a second attempt to take his life in a hospital room. Alistair tells Viki that he won't tell Sam Bennett that she is the killer if she kills Ethan. Viki refuses but then she sees Esme and Ethan hugging and agrees to Alistair's plan. She tried to murder Ethan twice, but accidentally stabbed Rebecca Hotchkiss Crane, prompting a police investigation at the Crane mansion. In order to distract them, Viki injured Ethan's mother, Ivy Winthrop. Though Viki promised Alistair to kill Ethan, she had a very different victim in mind after noticing how close Esme was becoming to Alistair's son Julian Crane. Esme told her niece, of her plans to marry Julian, and when Viki soon learned that Julian thought it would be best for her raised at boarding school and away from Harmony, Viki decided to murder the wealthy bachelor. After Julian and Esme had sex in the Crane mausoleum, Viki stabbed Julian multiple times in the groin, completely severing his penis. On the June 4, 2008 episode, Viki admitted to Vincent that she herself murdered her own mother and father. She and Vincent plotted to kill everyone in Harmony (Viki wanting to have no one come between her and her aunt Esme) with a toxic mushroom sauce to be served at the wedding rehearsal but Sheridan finds out that Dolly (Vincent) was really alive and realizes that Viki was the killer of all Esme's boyfriends. After Tabitha revives the townspeople by sacrificing her witch powers, Sam arrests both Viki and Vincent for their crimes.|$|R
40|$|The Damen Crane Barge type CB 6324 is a {{transhipment}} barge, {{designed to}} operate in harbours, inshore and in near coastal waters worldwide, mainly for the on- and offloading of bulk carriers. In the second generation of this crane barge, optimization of the equipment and overall design is sought, increasing usability of the barge and reducing overall costs. The same is sought {{in the design of}} a jib rest, as it is found to be heavy and cost reduction can be realized by reducing weight. Additionally, it is suspected that the jib rest can be hit by the <b>crane</b> <b>grab</b> during operation. The new optimized design is restrained by the {{need to be able to}} withstand the load of the crane jib in travel conditions overseas and during its complete operational lifetime. As the barge needs to be able to operate worldwide, identification of Ultimate Limit Loads is key. Lloyds Register provides a conservative method to determine the loads acting on the floating crane barge and its equipment, based on extreme weather conditions. As specific data on the CB 6324 is available, a different calculation method is proposed, using motion responses, sea state data and design criteria as an input. The method is based on probability of encountering a sea state, the probability of non-exceedance of a wave in such a sea state, and the operability of the barge, to predict the maximum probable accelerations encountered. Finally, analysis of two first generation crane barges built, show some fatigue crack forming on the jib rests during transport to the operational locations. This signifies an interest of a fatigue analysis and estimation, adding up to three design objectives: A) Finding load cases using modeled motion responses and sea state probability B) Finding a new jib rest design that complies to the criteria set by Damen and with the load cases found with design objective A C) Finding an estimation on the fatigue lifetime on both the first and new generation jib rest For the determination of the accelerations, a tool is developed, which automates the calculations for the maximum expected loads in worldwide near shore operation and transport. The barge motion responses in regular waves are determined and used as the primary input. Secondary input is composed of wave data, direction and spreading. Wind speed, roll, pitch, flooding angles and (bending) stresses in the crane pedestal are used as additional criteria. As an output, it gives an overview of operability over the world, along with a selection of the maximum expected accelerations in the critical directions. Parallel to the load calculations and development of the tool, the design of the new jib rest is made. Starting with a concept and building up detail as more information is brought to light in every calculation step. The resulting design is composed of a 15 ton, hinged, steel A-frame with a weight reduction of approx. 5 ton compared to the first generation. Fatigue prediction shows a significant improvement on the fatigue lifetime, as a transport load case estimates the new design spending approx. 10 % of its fatigue lifetime. More weight reduction could be achieved by further research on whether the fr is a reasonable restriction for this barge. The stiffness of the jib rest is increased significantly to comply to this criterium in dropped down position. This weight reduction can only be realised if a less conservative load case calculation method is used, like the one proposed in this thesis.
