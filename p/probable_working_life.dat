40|$|The {{first article}} within this issue {{deals with the}} history of Swedish <b>working</b> <b>life</b> research. Carin Håkansta is the author of this {{interesting}} article. In the 1970 s and 1980 s, Sweden had an absolute dominance in the Nordic <b>working</b> <b>life</b> research, but from the mid- 1990 s, there was a gradual dismantling of the institutions that had carried the Swedish <b>working</b> <b>life</b> research. The most serious attack on the Swedish <b>working</b> <b>life</b> research came in 2007, when the National Institute for Working Life was closed down together with the Swedish Council for Working Life Research. A number of ‘Work Science’ departments at universities were established around 2000, but many of these institutions are now being integrated into larger institutions without any specific <b>working</b> <b>life</b> identity. The {{rise and fall of the}} Swedish <b>working</b> <b>life</b> research is associated with the rise and fall of the Swedish Social Democrats: as Håkansta points out, the strong public support to <b>working</b> <b>life</b> research in the 1970 s and 1980 s was linked to the Social Democrats' efforts to find a third way between capitalism and communism.

40|$|Background: There is a world-wide {{interest}} in {{problems of the}} quality of <b>working</b> <b>life</b> because it is the quality of <b>working</b> <b>life</b> that influences quality of care to the nursing home residents. Aim: The aim of the study is to investigate effects of work autonomy and open and accurate communication on quality of <b>working</b> <b>life</b> among nursing home staff. Methodology: Data were collected from 511 staff members from ten nursing homes in one of the southern states in the U. S. A. Variables were measured by already-developed scales with good psychometric properties. Correlations and Regression were used to test the hypotheses. Results: Work autonomy and open and accurate communication affected quality of <b>working</b> <b>life,</b> namely-job and career satisfaction, working conditions, control at work, work-home interface and general well-being among nursing home staff. Findings are consistent with social exchange theory formulations. Organizations need to increaseautonomy and communication to improve quality of <b>working</b> <b>life.</b> A counterargument was presented. People with good quality of <b>working</b> <b>life</b> usually work autonomously and tell the truth openly.

40|$|While {{there has}} been {{considerable}} debate about extending the length of <b>working</b> <b>life,</b> relatively {{little is known about}} this issue. We use data from the Spanish Continuous Working Life Sample for 2004 – 2013 to calculate period <b>working</b> <b>life</b> tables, which in turn allows us {{to assess the impact of}} the financial crisis on <b>working</b> <b>life</b> expectancy in Spain. Before the recession hit, <b>working</b> <b>life</b> expectancy in Spain was around 38 years for males and 33 years for females. The recession had a tremendous impact on the Spanish labor market, but the effects differed considerably by gender and occupational category. Men working in skilled non-manual jobs were less affected, while men working in skilled non-manual jobs lost close to 14 years of <b>working</b> <b>life</b> expectancy. Women were less affected than men. With <b>working</b> <b>life</b> expectancy decreasing, the average proportion of lifetime spent in unemployment and outside the labor market increased markedly, whereas the average number of years spent in retirement changed only a little. When we decompose losses in <b>working</b> <b>life</b> expectancy by age group, we find that economic fluctuations affect both older and younger workers. This result suggests that policies that focus on retirement ages only are incomplete. We also compare our findings to the results obtained by Sullivans method, which is based on prevalence rates rather than the incidence-based <b>working</b> <b>life</b> table approach. We find that the use of Sullivans approach does not accurately reflect the levels of and the trends in <b>working</b> <b>life</b> expectancy. Open access funding provided by Max Planck Societ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Reforms are {{changing}} pension systems in many European countries, {{in order to}} both restrict early retirement and force people to extend their <b>working</b> <b>life.</b> From occupational therapy and occupational science perspectives, studies focusing on aspects of <b>working</b> <b>life</b> that motivate the older worker is urgent. Aim: The aim was to describe incentives behind an extended <b>working</b> <b>life</b> among people over age 65. Method: Focus group methodology was used, with participants ages 66 – 71, from varying work fields: construction and technical companies and the municipal elderly care sector. Findings: Work was considered important and valuable {{to the degree of}} how challenging work was, the possibilities for inclusion in a team of colleagues and the chances for better personal finances. Amongst all, the participants expressed a feeling of a strengthened identity by being challenged and having the opportunity to manage working tasks.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis was to study how vocational education and training (VET) and <b>working</b> <b>life</b> encounter each other. Naturally the research topic chosen was selected from the researcher´s own professional field, i. e., logistics education. The research task was to examine, how VET-students' professional expectations in the study field of logistics encounter with the <b>working</b> <b>life</b> realities. The main research question was “How do the logistics (driver training) students’ vocational expectations encounter {{with the requirements of}} dynamically changing <b>working</b> <b>life</b> {{from the point of view}} of the vocational competence, the time span of 2001 - 2025 ?” The two sub-questions were 1) How do the logistics students´ expectations encounter to the <b>working</b> <b>life</b> in their answers when being interviewed by the teachers from the point of view of the vocational competence and 2) How do the changing requirements of dynamically changing <b>working</b> <b>life</b> encounter to the vocational education according to the on-the-job-learning trainers from the point of view of the vocational competence in the interview material. The theoretical framework was constructed on the basis of Super´s and Holland´s career theories. The study is an inductive, qualitative case study. The data consist of student applicants’ (N= 335, 2007 - 2014) and on-the-job-learning trainers´ (N= 10, 2014) interviews. The data were analysed through qualitative content analyses by means of theoretical framework (Holland 1959, 1973 and 1985; Super 1957). The research results indicates that the <b>working</b> <b>life</b> competence requirements and the logistics students´ professional expectations only partially encounter to, even weakly. The inability of encounter of <b>working</b> <b>life’s</b> requirements and students’ vocational expectations reflect a radical change in society and <b>working</b> <b>life.</b> According to the research results the key development areas in vocational education and training in the logistics sector is the development of digital learning and teaching environment and interactive and social skills as well, in cooperation with various actors (stakeholders) in <b>working</b> <b>life.</b> This study produced two theoretical models applied to vocational education and training: 1) A theoretical approach to cooperative pedagogical counselling and 2) The theoretical model of VET-students recruitment.
