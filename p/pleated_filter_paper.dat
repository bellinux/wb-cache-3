40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} admitted that for each filtration process using <b>pleated</b> <b>filters,</b> {{at least three}} steps can be distinguished: depth and surface filtration, which are common to flat filters, and surface reduction. This step is caused by inefficient filling of the pleat due to the filter geometry. For combustion aerosol, it has been proved that this third step strongly depends on the filtration velocity resulting in an increase of the resistance when air flow decreases. This observation leads one to think that Brownian diffusion, higher for low velocities, could influence the clogging dynamic of a <b>pleated</b> <b>filter.</b> In this article, a protocol derived from the dust cake preparation method published by Schmidt is developed.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to further advance the state of the art in {{developing}} self-sufficient methods to predict the performance of an aerosol filter. The simulation methods developed in this study are based on first principles and consequently, they do not rely on empirical correction factors. These simulation methods can be used to predict the instantaneous collection efficiency and pressure drop of a filter under dust-loading conditions. In the current study, 3 -D micro- and macroscale CFD models are developed to simulate the service life of flat-sheet and <b>pleated</b> <b>filters.</b> These CFD micro- and macroscale models are also used to quantify the effects of a fiber’s cross-sectional shape on the performance of the resulting filter. As fiber manufacturing methods are rapidly advancing, these fibers are becoming more accessible. The filtration performance of trilobal fibers is compared with their circular counterparts under dust-loading conditions. Our results show that trilobal fibers do not outperform circular ones except in very limited conditions, revealing no advantage over circular fibers. In addition, a fast but approximate 2 -D model is developed to predict the filtration performance of flat and circular <b>pleated</b> <b>filters.</b> The predictions of the model are compared with predictions from the more sophisticated CFD models, as well as with experimental work in the literature. Our 2 -D model developed in this study is aimed at providing the aerosol filtration industry with a fast but fairly accurate method of designing <b>pleated</b> <b>filters.</b> With a CPU-time of practically zero, the developed model allows one to conduct a broad parameter study, altering the parameters that affect the filtration performance of <b>pleated</b> <b>filters.</b> Using this model, predictive correlations for dust-loaded <b>pleated</b> <b>filters</b> are presented.

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of humidity on {{changes to the}} pressure drop of flat and <b>pleated</b> HEPA <b>filters</b> clogged by polydisperse hygroscopic and non-hygroscopic aerosols has been studied. For flat filters, the results confirm the observations reported by Gupta et al. (1993) that with a hygroscopic aerosol at humidity below the deliquescent point, or with a non-hygroscopic aerosol, the particulate specific cake resistance decreases as relative humidity increases. For <b>pleated</b> <b>filters</b> as for flat filters, the results reveal that during {{the formation of the}} particulate cake, the increase in relative humidity leads to a decrease in the specific cake resistance. When the reduction in filtration area, specific to <b>pleated</b> <b>filters,</b> becomes large, the presence of humidity accelerates the filling of pleats causing a greater pressure drop for a same aerosol mass loading. With a hygroscopic aerosol at a humidity above its deliquescent point, the change in pressure drop through flat or <b>pleated</b> <b>filters</b> is not linear but characteristic of liquid aerosol filtration. The {{influence of}} humidity on the efficiency of <b>pleated</b> <b>filters,</b> measured by a soda fluorescein aerosol, has also been studied.

40|$|Abstract—The {{effects of}} {{asbestos}} wet-stripping agents on {{the efficiency of}} niters used in asbestos removal have been assessed by field measurements, simulations and laboratory studies. <b>Pleated</b> glass-fibre <b>paper</b> <b>filters,</b> the type most commonly used in industry, are unaffected by wet-stripping agents beyond a slight and usually transitory increase in airflow resistance. Resin-wool niters are unaffected by the relatively coarse sprays that we observed in wet-stripping, but are degraded by very fine sprays of wetting agents or penetrating agents, though not by water or encapsulating agent. Both louvres and prefilters significantly reduce the quantity of sprays that reach a filter cartridge during real or simulated wet-stripping. Filter degradation neither progresses nor recovers after exposure to sprays has stopped, and so aerosol penetration measured at any time after exposure should equal the maximum obtained in use.

Expressions developed for flat sheet media do not provide accurate information directly useful for designing a <b>pleated</b> <b>filter,</b> and therefore, most progress made in developing <b>pleated</b> <b>filters</b> is based on empiricism. This study is aimed at establishing an enabling knowledge that allows for a better design and optimization of <b>pleated</b> aerosol <b>filters.</b> This study is focused on developing a predictive simulation method that accounts for {{the influence of a}} filter’s micro-scale geometric parameters, such as fiber orientation, as well as its macro-scale features, like pleat shape, in predicting the transient pressure drop and collection efficiency with or without the effects of dust loading. The dual-scale simulation method developed in this work {{is believed to be the}} only feasible approach for design and optimization of <b>pleated</b> aerosol <b>filters</b> with the current academic-level computational power. Our study is divided into two major tasks of micro- and macro-scale modeling. Our micro-scale studies are comprised of a series of CFD simulations conducted in virtual 2 -D or 3 -D fibrous geometries that resemble the internal micro-structure of a fibrous medium. These simulations are intended to isolate the effects of each micro structural parameter and study its influence on the performance of the filter medium. In detail, it is intended to propose a method to predict the performance of micro-structures with fiber size distribution. Also, the effects of micro-structural fiber orientation were investigated. Moreover, we offered methodology to predict the performance of noncircular fibers using available analytical expressions for circular fibers. It is shown that the circumscribed circle for a trilobal shaped fiber gives the best prediction for collection efficiency. In macro-scale simulations, on the other hand, the filter medium is treated as a lumped porous material with its properties obtained via micro-scale simulations.

40|$|<b>Pleated</b> <b>filters</b> are broadly {{used for}} various applications. In certain cases, {{especially}} in solid-liquid separation case, the filtering media may get deflected {{and that may}} change the overall performance characteristics of the filter. From the modeling point of view, this is a challenging multiphysics problem, namely {{the interaction of the}} fluid with a so-called poroelastic structure. This work focuses on the development of an algorithm for the simulation of the Fluid Porous Structure Interaction (FPSI) problem in the case of <b>pleated</b> <b>filtering</b> media. The first part of the work is concerned with the development of a robust and accurate numerical method for solving the Stokes-Brinkman system of equations on quadrilateral grids. The mathematical model describes a free fluid flow coupled with a flow in porous media in a domain that contains the filtering media. To discretize the complex computational domain we use quadrilateral boundary fitted grids which resolve porous-fluid interfaces. The Stokes-Brinkman system of equations is discretized here using a sophisticated finite volume method, namely multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) O-method. MPFA is widely used, e. g., in solving scalar elliptic equations with full tensor and highly varying coefficients and/or solving on heterogeneous non-orthogonalgrids. Up to the authors’ knowledge, there was no investigation of MPFA discretization for Stokes-Brinkman problems, and this study aims to fill this gap. Some numerical experiments are presented in order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed numerical algorithm[1]. The second part of this study focuses on the coupling of the flow model with the deflection of the filtering media. For the consideration of the FPSI problem in 3 D, the classical Biot system describes coupled flow and deformations in a porous body due to difference in the upstream and downstream pressures. Solving the Biot system of equations is complicated and requires a significant amount of computational time. In many <b>pleated</b> industrial <b>filters,</b> the thickness of the filtering media is small compared to the longitudinal dimensions and therefore the porous structure can be modeled as poroelastic plate [2] or poroelastic shell. We use a poroelastic shell model for linear elasticity to resolve the U-shaped <b>pleated</b> <b>filters.</b> Our numerical studies show that in many cases this approach gives accurate results. The so-called weak coupling approach is used to simulate the interaction between the flow and the elasticity problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of dust cartridge filters {{commonly used in}} dust masks and in room ventilation depends both on the collection efficiency of the filter material and the pressure drop across the filter. Currently, the optimization of filter design is based only on minimizing the pressure drop at a set velocity chosen by the manufacturer.

In this work, a filter quality factor, which combines the collection efficiency and the pressure drop, is used as the optimization criterion for filter evaluation.

40|$|International audienceFor {{industrial}} {{or domestic}} applications, {{the wide range}} of use of <b>pleated</b> <b>filters</b> makes the understanding of their airflow behavior a major issue for designer and users. In all industrial installations dealing with radioactive matter, the containment of pollutants must be ensured. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are used as the last purification stage before the air is rejected in the environment. These filters can be used either alone, in the case of nonsensible installation, or coupled with other filtration devices disposer before it where contamination level could be important. The prediction of their pressure drop is very important in nuclear safety to be able to anticipate any dysfunction or rupture of these devices. It has been observed that geometry of the medium has an influence on the pressure drop of a <b>pleated</b> <b>filter.</b> In the case of HEPA filters, no convincing explanation has been brought to explain their airflow behavior. The pressure drop evolution of the filtre during the clogging remains difficult to explain by assuming constant pleat geometry. Some studies show that deformation occurs during the filter use, which could induce an increaseof the available volume in the pleat and a reduction of the efficient filtration surface. The increase in computation capacity introduces nowadays the possibility to perform complex simulation, taking into account the effect of fluids on sensible devices. This can be the case for simple structural analysis or for more complex analysis such as vibration induced by gas or fluid flow. It is mostly applied to avoid breaking or deformation of safety devices,and this can also be applied to anticipate the fluid behavior of some special devices such as filters. In classical filtration application, properties of the filter are coupled with particle deposition (e. g., changes in geometry and permeability depend on the thickness of the deposit). The studies concerning mechanical properties of filters are mainly perfore for liquid filtration and clean <b>filters.</b> For <b>pleated</b> <b>filters,</b> the complexity of this kind of analysisremains the modification of the link between geometry, pressure drop, mechanical strength, and particle transport and accumulation inside the pleat.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to develop and {{validate}} a computer model for the design of <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filters.</b> Mathematical modelling of incompressible creeping flow and low permeability Darcy flow are well established and a number of reliable schemes for the simulation of these regimes are available in the literature. In the context of the present studies a computer model for modelling of combined Stokes/Darcy flows encountered in <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filters</b> has been developed. A two-dimensional simulation code that can model fluid hydrodynamics in permeable media as in dead-end <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filters</b> has been developed in FORTRAN. The developed code named as ACFAMP- Aircraft Cartridge Filter Analysis Modelling Program has been used to evaluate the performance and design of <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filter</b> elements. The governing equations of the flow model can be well represented by the Continuity, Stokes and Darcy equations respectively. Viscosity variations and non-Newtonian effects have been introduced to model the behaviour of shear-thickening fluids used in aircraft hydraulic circuits. The governing equations of the flow model are solved by using a weighted residuals finite element method. Two separate modelling approaches have been adopted in the model development. The first approach is based on modelling of flow through porous media by employing a slightly compressible form of continuity equation utilising nine-noded Lagrangian elements for domain discretisation in conjunction with a U-V -P finite element scheme. The second strategy is based on modelling of coupled Free/Porous regimes making the model industrially complaint. This scheme utilises the stabilised C 0 continuous Taylor-Hood element, which generates stable solutions for incompressible flows without any problems of numerical locking. Initial numerical experiments were based on simple geometries and the complexity of the geometries was finally extended to model the <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filters.</b> A permeability model that interprets medium compression effects and which is based on data obtained from flat sheets of the filter material used in the fabrication of the filter cartridge is incorporated within the main model. During pleating, bending and creasing the medium deforms and leads to a loss of permeability and/or effective filtering area results. The combined effects of compression and reduction in filtration area cause deviations from Darcy's law. The effects of medium compression, pleat deformation and pleat crowding have also been analysed.
