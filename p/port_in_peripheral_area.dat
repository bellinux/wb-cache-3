Innovation is usually seen {{to take place}} in urban areas which offer many opportunities for interaction between different individuals and organisations, including firms, universities and policy-makers. In contrast, relatively {{little is known about the}} types of innovation that occur <b>in</b> <b>peripheral,</b> sparsely populated <b>areas.</b> This research examines how innovation in some sectors may be stimulated by aspects of peripherality. For example, access to natural resources may generate innovation in sectors such as tourism, food processing or renewable energies. Similarly, the constraints of remoteness may promote the development of new methods for overcoming the difficulties and high cost of delivering services in these areas. A further focus is on the kinds of interactions that underpin innovation <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas,</b> where linkss are likely to be national or international rather than local. Other aspects to be investigated include the influence of external market and policy factors on innovation <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as the effectiveness of policy support for innovation in such areas. The project involves interviews with policy-makers and business organisations <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> the UK and other European countries, as well as a practitioner workshop and an academic seminar aimed at developing further research ideas...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} microvascular assessment in patients with Behcet disease (BD) by means of an intravital videocapillaroscopic study. Sixteen BD patients were compared with an equivalent group of healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Videocapillaroscopy (VCP) was performed <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>in</b> conjunctiva, and morphological and quantitative parameters were assessed. In both areas VCP showed several morphological alterations (microaneurysms, megacapillaries, desertification areas) detectable in a high percentage of patients; quantitatively we found significant changes of incisuring and sludging score, of capillary loop intermediate branch length (<b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas)</b> and of arteriole/venule diameter (in conjunctiva). Therefore, vessel involvement included both the number and the whole vessel structure and was seen both <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> and conjunctival <b>areas</b> when the two different vascular beds of micro- and paramicrocirculation were examined. We conclude that an important rearrangement of microcirculation is detectable in BD and that VCP may have diagnostic and prognostic value, providing qualitative and quantitative information able to define the systemic extension of vascular damage and the degree of vessel wall alteratio...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that cell {{suspensions}} from egg granulomas of Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice contain populations of both I-A-positive and -negative granuloma macrophages (GMs). The present study was undertaken to investigate the distribution of I-A-bearing macrophages within the granulomas, {{as well as the}} kinetics of I-A antigen expression by these cells in vivo. Cryostat sections of liver tissue from infected animals, stained with monoclonal anti-I-A antibodies, demonstrated the presence of I-A-positive GMs <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> of the granulomas, whereas I-A-negative cells concentrated in their centers. For investigation of their expression of I-A antigen, dispersed GMs were studied at time intervals after subjecting infected mice to lethal doses of total body irradiation. I-A half-life on GMs in vivo was estimated to be 2 days, based both on visual detection by immunofluorescence and functionally on the ability of GMs to perform as antigen-presenting cells. Autoradiographic studies, performed on infected liver tissue obtained 1 hour after in vivo administration of tritiated thymidine, showed that macrophages predominantly replicated <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> of the schistosomal egg granulomas. After longer intervals, however, labeled cells were seen in more central areas of the granuloma, suggesting an overall cell flux from the periphery to the center. These findings indicate that macrophages express I-A antigens <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> of the granulomas, where macrophage replication and recruitment from the bone marrow take place. They suggest that I-A expression occurs during a limited period of time in "young" macrophages, which later may convert to an I-A-negative phenotype...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} geographical {{variations in}} the demand and supply of bank finance for innovative firms in the UK. It uses a detailed survey on the finances of almost 40, 000 UK Small and Medium Sized Enterprises for 2011 – 2013 to investigate both the extent and type of applications for bank finance by innovative firms <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> regions, whether funders accept their applications and whether acceptance rates reflect objective criteria, such as credit scores, or their location. The paper finds evidence of higher demand for bank finance for innovative firms <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas,</b> but that these firms {{are more likely to}} be discouraged from applying. However, there is strong evidence that innovative firms <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> regions are more likely to have their applications for finance rejected, even when controlling for factors such as credit score. The findings suggest that geography matters in the financing of innovative firms and firms <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> may suffer a “liability of distance” which potentially reinforces regional disparities. The implications of these findings for public policy are outlined...|$|R

40|$|The fusion {{mechanism}} for application in stereo analysis of range restricted {{the depth of}} field and therefore required a shift variant mechanism <b>in</b> the <b>peripheral</b> <b>area</b> to find disparity. Misregistration was prevented by restricting the disparity detection range to a neighborhood spanned by the directional edge detection filters.

Occupational Choice and Social Contacts Across Regions This paper tests the relative importance of strong versus weak social ties on self-employment. Strong ties arising from frequent interaction should create trust that facilitates resource mobilization. To measure differences in social contacts, we compare the impact of club memberships on the likelihood of being self-employed <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> and agglomerated <b>areas.</b> <b>In</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas,</b> we expect that more membership overlappings will lead to stronger ties. Analyzing the different impact of social contacts on becoming self-employed across regions, we find that strengthening social ties increases the likelihood of being self-employed by 1. 9 to 14. 2 percentage points, depending on the number of underlying social contacts. These results remain robust after applying matching techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to test empirically some {{hypothesis}} about the relation between transport accessibility, geographic marginality and tourism development. To what extent and how accessibility can represent a limit to tourism development <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas?</b> Tourism is historically connected {{to the development of the}} transport system and the reduction of economic distances. Regions like the South of Italy (Mezzogiorno) may have as well suffered for their geographic marginality. The development of tourism destinations <b>in</b> many <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> however, demonstrates how marginality can even represent an attraction. The uneven development of Italian tourism (see figure 1) is not only influenced by physical accessibility, but rather by more complex problems of economic marginality. Accessibility, marginality and development are complex issues and – especially in the case of tourism – it is not possible to draw deterministic relationships. Mezzogiorno is the ideal context for the analysis of the effective weight of distance in travel choices and tourism development...|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{destinations}} <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> {{are often}} large regions established by centralised government agencies to encourage collaboration between dispersed communities and foster innovation. Relatively little research {{attention has been}} paid to the impact that centrally defined destination boundaries have on whether and how small communities contribute to innovation at a regional level. This paper examines the case of Burra, a small town in rural South Australia. It analyses the networking, collaboration and knowledge exchange behaviour of tourism stakeholders in the context of the state-government-defined ‘Clare Valley’ tourism region. Data were drawn from a web-based social network analysis, in-depth interviews, historic document analysis and field observations. The study found that the local tourism system had limited aspirations and capabilities to collaborate with other towns in the region. Lack of regional engagement was only partially due to intra-regional competition and resistance to regional boundaries. More significant barriers included a local culture of operating in isolation, an embedded reliance on public sector leadership to manage systemic interactions, an aging system with limited ambition to change and an inability to harness in-migrants and externally based stakeholders to stimulate knowledge transfer. Changing the imposed destination boundaries would have limited impact on the operation of the local system. The paper concludes that effective regional destination development <b>in</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> needs to be better informed by more detailed understandings of local tourism systems and their capacities to engage...|$|R

Much marine ecotourism activity occurs in parts of the world that would be considered 'peripheral' in spatial, temporal and economic terms; yet to date no one has attempted to draw together the concepts of marine ecotourism and peripherality. In particular, why might marine ecotourism be considered an especially appropriate strategy for coastal <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas?</b> This paper introduces the concept of ecotourism in the marine and coastal context.
