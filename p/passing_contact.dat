As a girl she really couldn't {{bring herself to}} lie, except to save others. In which case all her New England ancestry took flight and she would lie as magnificently as her father before her. And {{he had the same}} charm of manner, the same daring, the same ready laughter, the same vivacity. But what is lightsome and blithe in her, was debonaire in him. He won men's hearts always, or, failing that, their bitterest enmity. No one was left cold by him in <b>passing.</b> <b>Contact</b> with him quickened them to love or hate. Therein Paula differs, being a woman, I suppose, and not enjoying man's {{prerogative}} of tilting at windmills. I don't know that she has an enemy in the world. All love her, unless, it may well be, there are cat-women who envy her her nice husband." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{soldering}} {{process that}} forms the bead probe leaves a coating of flux. Depending on the manufacturing process used, this flux can have varying levels of hardness. Flux with a waxy hardness can reduce the deformation force from the bead, preventing proper contact with the test probe during the first <b>pass</b> <b>contact.</b> This becomes less of an issue on subsequent contacts as the flux is displaced. Test probes with serrated ends of an appropriate size can also aid in measuring bead probes where flux is an issue.|$|R
25|$|Incandescent {{light bulbs}} consist of an {{air-tight}} glass enclosure (the envelope, or bulb) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb, through which an electric current is <b>passed.</b> <b>Contact</b> wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical {{connections to the}} filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.|$|R

60|$|The strangest {{part of this}} {{experience}} was that I never took a drink nor thought of taking a drink. Yet I knew that men under hard pressure almost invariably drank. I had seen them do it, {{and in the past}} had often done it myself. But so sheerly non-alcoholic was I that it never entered my mind that a drink might be good for me. I instance this to show how entirely lacking from my make-up was any predisposition toward alcohol. And the point of this instance is that later on, after more years had <b>passed,</b> <b>contact</b> with John Barleycorn at last did induce in me the alcoholic desire.|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} similarities of {{the rites}} and {{stories of the}} bear, Ursus arctos, in the circumpolar northern hemisphere may {{be an example of}} cultural diffusion. But if those stories and practices did <b>pass</b> by <b>contact</b> from people to people—or by the movements of peoples—it is likely that new ideas and behaviours were adopted because they found fertile ground in common experience. Alternatively, even if these analogous aspects of the cultures arose independently, it seems probable that their similarities are due to their common origin in observations of the bear i ared...|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{misconception}} that basketball is a non-contact sport, officials often let {{a large amount}} of marginal or incidental <b>contact</b> <b>pass</b> uncalled. An official must always be wary of not just what is happening around the ball, but the roughness of play going on around the whole court, adding to the job of the official.|$|R
50|$|The Dreyfus {{affair was}} {{triggered}} in September 1894 when an office cleaner at the German Embassy in Paris, {{who was also}} an agent of French military intelligence, <b>passed</b> her French <b>contacts</b> a handwritten memorandum (widely known as the bordereau), evidently written by an unnamed French officer, offering the German Embassy various confidential military documents.|$|R
25|$|Colts {{players would}} later {{publicly}} {{complain that the}} game officials did not properly call illegal <b>contact,</b> <b>pass</b> interference, and defensive holding penalties on the Patriots' defensive backs. This, and similar complaints made by other NFL teams, would prompt the NFL during the 2004 offseason to instruct all of the league's officials to strictly enforce these types of fouls.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vehicular}} {{traffic on the}} production of groundnut (Arachis hypogea) was investigated in a sandy loam soil. A randomized complete block design with treatments of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 passes of a tractor with 31 kPa contact pressure was used. The gravimetric soil moisture content, soil dry bulk density, penetration resistance and air permeability for each applied load were measured from the soil surface up {{to a depth of}} 10 cm. Seed moisture content, haulms and seed yield were determined at harvest for each treatment. Soil dry bulk density and penetration resistance increased with {{increase in the number of}} tractor passes while air permeability decreased with increase in the number of tractor passes. The haulms yield and seed yield increased with increase in the number of tractor passes up to 5 passes, and thereafter decreased with further increases in tractor passes. The soil physical properties and the product of the number of tractor <b>passes</b> and <b>contact</b> pressure were used to generate a groundnut yield model. The yield model that contained the interactions of the product of the number of tractor <b>passes</b> and <b>contact</b> pressure, penetration resistance and air permeability had the greatest influence on the yield of the crop. It can be concluded that in groundnut production in a sandy loam soil in a semi-arid environment, a moderate amount of soil compaction could improve the yield of groundnut...|$|R

50|$|One item {{participants}} {{were told to}} bring, frequently, though not exclusively, seen in Scouting, is a SWAP. A SWAP, short for Something With A Pin, is a small object, typically with a pin or loop attached to the back, which displays something about the creator's home. SWAPS can also be defined as Special Whatchamacallits Affectionately Pinned Somewhere http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/swaps/. The home address is also written on it, because SWAPs {{are meant to be}} traded with others as a way to remember people met while easily <b>passing</b> on <b>contact</b> information. Extra SWAPs can also be left at some locations, such as World Centers, for future travellers to find.|$|R

50|$|At {{least two}} PTRs {{are needed in}} the film path - one for the base side {{and one for the}} {{emulsion}} side - though four are frequently used. A set of PTRs is frequently placed in the film paths of projectors, telecine machines, scanners and printers in order to remove dust and contaminants {{from the surface of the}} film before projection, transfer or duplication. PTRs are also used in some dedicated film cleaning machines, or mounted between rewind heads and used for manual cleaning. The contaminants are lifted from the film and adhere to the roller as the film <b>passes</b> in <b>contact</b> with it.
