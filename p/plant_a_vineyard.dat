50|$|The {{land that}} would become Champoux Vineyard was {{originally}} part of the expansive Mercer Ranch. The 6600 acre ranch featured vast plantings of several agricultural crops including carrots, corn and potatoes. In the early 1970s, the ranch's owner Don Mercer decided to <b>plant</b> <b>a</b> <b>vineyard</b> {{with the aim of}} growing grapes that would rival those of the Bordeaux wine estate Chateau Lafite. The first grapes were planted in 1972, a 7 acre block of Cabernet Sauvignon vines. The site of the original block was chosen by mere happenstance since it was an isolated segment of the ranch by the main road that was {{out of the reach of}} circle irrigation sprinklers that would have be needed if the land was to be usable for another agricultural crop. By the mid-1980s there were more 132 acre planted and winery, Mercer Ranch Vineyards was founded. Paul Champoux, a hop farmer from the Yakima Valley who had previously planted the original 2300 acre Columbia Crest vineyard overlooking the Columbia River, was hired as a vineyard manager of the estate.|$|E

40|$|Hasan Özdemir's article, entitled, "Şarabi{dotless}n İcadi{dotless} ve Dört Vasfi{dotless}" (The Invention of Wine and Its Four Characteristics) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} applications of Historic-Geographic Theory. In this article, Özdemir carries out a thorough piece of research on "the tales of the invention of wine" which spread different regions of the world. He also tries to find an "ur-form" of them. In these tales, Noah decided to <b>plant</b> <b>a</b> <b>vineyard</b> and Satan came to see him and then Satan took a peacock, a monkey, a lion and a pig, slit their throats and sprinkled the vine-stock with their blood. For this reason, people who drink wine begin to resemble to those animals in proportion to their amount of drinking. In other words, as long as a person drinks a wine, he/she will resemble to a peacock, a monkey, a lion, a pig, respectively. Özdemir claims that these tales are formed in The Near East and then they are transmitted to Europe. On the other hand, they can also be analyzed by using Structuralist Theory. The theory depends on some "binary oppositions" such as "syntagm/paradigm or metonymy/metaphor" and each dichotomy includes two fundamentals of language. Claude Lévi-Strauss, who is regarded as one of the foremost structuralist anthropologists, generally reduces "myths" to binary oppositions. Lévi-Strauss asserts that myths have a meaning which is supposed to be conveyed to the new generations, but, according to Strauss, the meaning is always embedded in dichotomies like "syntagm/paradigm or metonymy/metaphor" which can be inferred by using the elements of the myths. Tales of the invention of wine have also a universal binary opposition: good/bad. The dichotomy, in these tales, is reproduced as Noah/Satan. While Noah tries to make beneficial things like grape-juice or grape molasses, Satan wants to make harmful things like wine. If a scholar wants to extend these kinds of binary oppositions to the animal world which is mentioned in these tales, he/she would discover another interesting dichotomy: peacock/pig. Since the pig is close to human beings in terms of genus, people become anxious when they look like pigs, however, the peacock is not close to a human being in terms of genus; therefore people do not care about resembling to peacocks. The closeness between pig and human being makes the difference between humans and animals blurred and this creates anxiety that human beings resemble pigs when they drink too much...|$|E
