40|$|On 4 September 1976 and on 15 December 1976 respectively, two buoys were washed ashore on the Frisian {{island of}} Terschelling, both {{near the village}} of Oosterend. They were found by mr. G. Doeksen, who {{collected}} some operculate barnacles and one stalked barnacle from these buoys. Part of the collected material he put at my disposal. Besides specimens of Balanus balanoides (Linnaeus, 1767), Balanus improvisus Darwin, 1854 and Elminius modestus Darwin, 1854 — all common in Dutch coastal waters — there appeared to be attached to the first buoy two specimens of the barnacle Balanus perforatus Bruguière, 1879 (pl. ι), and to the second buoy four specimens of the same barnacle. Because the buoys were numbered, their exact location could be traced by consulting the <b>Pilotage</b> <b>service</b> of Terschelling. Fig. 1 shows the approximate location of the buoys. Table 1 shows their geographical location. Once attention was drawn to the occurrence of the barnacles, a member of the crew of the patrolvessel of the <b>Pilotage</b> <b>service</b> — mr. A. de Jong — collected another 11 specimens from buoys, which were all located near the buoys which had been washed ashore (see fig. 1 and table 1). All the barnacles were collected alive; two of them were lost. On the buoy washed ashore on 4 September 1976 also a stalked barnacle was found. This specimen proved to be Conchoderma auritum (Linnaeus, 1767) (fig. 2). The location of these buoys being not very far off the Dutch coast — about 15 km — these records are the first autochthonous records of B. perforatus and C. auritum from the coastal waters of the Netherlands.

40|$|The Ministry of Ports (SEP) {{was created}} in 2007 to improve the {{efficiency}} of Brazilian maritime ports and boost international trade. One {{of the most important}} and challenging issues that SEP has been dealing with is the <b>pilotage</b> <b>service</b> provision. Although recognized as of good quality, the service is considered to be too expensive and unregulated. This article's objective is to demonstrate that the Brazilian monopolistic and unregulated model is not suitable for a public utility service such as pilotage. To achieve this objective, two complimentary approaches were employed: a comparison of price and costs of pilotage services worldwide, and a comparison of service provision models worldwide. Alterations in the legal and institutional framework are suggested to implement an effective regulation mechanism. The authors propose the creation of a special committee, managed by SEP, to regulate pilotage prices. The results of the article have been submitted to SEP analysts and have been the cause of heated discussions involving pilotage associations, shipping companies, the maritime authority and SEP over pilotage legislation and pricing practices. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how lighthouses {{and pilot}} services have been bearers of technology intended {{to improve the}} safety and reliability of maritime shipping. The introduction of technology has had a considerable impact on many small island societies through state involvement meant to reduce hazards in navigation and shipping.

Indeed, small islands and islanders have generally never been the beneficiaries of large scale, state-driven technology programs seeking to modernize society.

40|$|Does the {{creation}} of a deemed servant-master relationship, between pilot and ship-owner or master through section 76 (2) of the National Ports Act (hereafter the NPA); accurately reflect the de facto relationship in which the parties stand? Can the provision's importation of the doctrine of vicarious liability and consequent foisting of liability on the ship-owner be defined as logical, just and practical? It will be argued after having had recourse to the manner in which these roles have come to be defined and understood in South African labour jurisprudence, the governing law, respective positions occupied by ship-owner and port authority, broad-based considerations of policy, and key tenets of the rationale underpinning the concept of vicarious liability; that the answer to the above-raised questions is are sounding no. In addition, the writer will submit that the privatisation of <b>pilotage</b> <b>services</b> presents a solution, alternate to the irrational imposition of the doctrine of vicarious liability, which is palatable to government, ship-owning interests and pilot. a) Introduction Typically, claims arising from consequences of pilot error satisfy the definition of a 'maritime claim' contained in s 1 (1) (e) and s 1 (1) (l) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Regulation Act. As a result thereof; a South African court sitting in admiralty has jurisdiction to hear such claims. As to the identification of the appropriate law; s 6 (2) dictates that South African statute, if relevant, trumps pre-existing English admiralty law and is the law to be applied. The NPA, chiefly through sections 75 and 76, regulates the extent of the pilot's liability for his/her acts or omissions whilst a vessel is under compulsory pilotage. Thus, the Act is applicable to disputes arising from pilot error, before a South African court sitting in admiralty...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to find out what kind of benefits and disadvantages would arise if pilotage in Finland would be opened for competition. The purpose is also to find out if competition would strengthen or weaken the safety. In {{the research}} a wide perspective was taken over the subject {{in order to get a}} good view of the factors that would be affected by the change. The price difference from a customers' point of view and the need for common rules if pilotage is opened for competition in Finland are examined as well. In order to reach the goal also a comparison to Denmark, where pilotage has been under competition for a number of years, has been made. The theoretical part of this research is done by familiarizing with texts and researches over competition and monopoly. Also pilotage acts from Finland, Denmark and Sweden have been examined, even though this research is not taking into consideration if private pilotage is legal in Finland or not. The empirical part of this research is made by interviewing persons working within the pilotage segment both in Finland and Denmark. The interviewees were carefully chosen, including authorities, public pilot operators and privately owned pilot operators. The interviews were analyzed and used as a base for the empirical part. Also new viewpoints consisting of benefits and disadvantages of competition were gathered from the interviews. In pilotage benefits could be achieved through competition. The service level would probably be the biggest competition factor. Also safety and price could be used as competition factors in the open market of pilotage. The price of pilotage would most probably be decreased through competition and companies buying <b>pilotage</b> <b>services</b> could benefit by being able to buy services tailored especially for their needs. When implementing a competed market from a monopolistic market new rules must be made for ensuring that it is functioning also in practice. Competition would put pressure on the operators and the market would start to innovate itself...|$|R
