40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} explain and predict the {{adoption}} of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage,</b> this study explores the critical factors involved in the adoption of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> and empirically validates their relationships to a user's intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Based on technology acceptance model (TAM), network externality, trust, and an interview survey, this study proposes a <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> adoption model. We conducted an empirical analysis by structural equation modeling based on survey data obtained with a questionnaire. Findings: Among the adoption factors we identified, network externality has the salient influence on a user's adoption intention, followed by perceived usefulness, individual innovation, perceived trust, perceived ease of use, and subjective norms. Cloud storage characteristics {{are the most important}} indirect factors, followed by awareness to <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> and perceived risk. However, although perceived risk is regarded as an important factor by other cloud computing researchers, we found that it has no significant influence. Also, subjective norms have no significant influence on perceived usefulness. This indicates that users are rational when they choose whether to adopt <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage.</b> Research limitations: This study ignores time and cost factors that might affect a user's intention to adopt <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage.</b> Practical implications: Our findings might be helpful in designing and developing <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> products, and helpful to regulators crafting policies. Originality/value: This study {{is one of the first}} research efforts that discuss Chinese users' <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> adoption, which should help to further the understanding of personal cloud adoption behavior among Chinese users...|$|R

This trend {{has been happening}} globally and known as consumerization of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage.</b> This research reports {{on the state of}} this trend in New Zealand corporates. A mixed methods approach was employed with data collection through online anonymous surveys and an online focus group. It was found that <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> prevails widely throughout the corporates involved in the study. In light of earlier studies in IT consumerization and recent market researches on <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage,</b> this study identifies many drivers, benefits and challenges of IT consumerization which remain significant in <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> consumerization, and additionally divulges new factors not previously surfaced in prior literature and publications. The results reveals that its challenges far outweigh its benefits and that the driving forces born within organizations are as considerably significant as those in the external environment. Resulting corporate risks such as security, support, regulatory obligations, data governance and policies are top-critical amongst other challenges with which corporates have to confront. Regardless of those challenges, corporates might gain several benefits, namely employee engagement, productivity, business agility and cost benefits to some extent...|$|R

Many of his writings, prayers and letters are extant, and his discourses with the Western Bahá'ís emphasize the growth of the faith by the late 1890s. `Abdu'l-Bahá's given name was `Abbás, but he preferred the title of `Abdu'l-Bahá (servant of the glory of God).

A sufficiently threatening adversary will typically be able to force people to reveal their encrypted data. Methods of deniable encryption seek to mend this vulnerability by allowing for decryption to alternate data which is plausible but not sensitive. Existing schemes which allow for deniable encryption are best suited for use by parties who wish to communicate with one another. They are not, however, ideal for <b>personal</b> data <b>storage.</b> This paper develops a plausibly-deniable encryption system for use with <b>personal</b> data <b>storage,</b> such as hard drive encryption.

40|$|International audienceWith {{the rapid}} {{development}} of cloud computing technology, cloud-based team collaboration applications are becoming popular on the Web. Among all the required features {{for a typical}} team collaboration application, shared storage for referred documents or produced artifacts by the team is a must-have one. However, existing shared storage solutions for team collaboration applications are far from satisfaction. Some of them rely on self-built storage infrastructure, which could be a big burden, especially for those small or medium vendors. With the prevalence of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> services, such as Dropbox and Google Drive, more team collaboration applications allow users to share files from their personal cloud-storage spaces through external shared links, which can partly solve the problem. However, this method is not convenient for team collaboration, neither safe enough. This paper presents an approach to leverage third-part personal cloud-storage services to provide shared storage for team collaboration applications. Compared to existing approaches, our approach provides sophisticated mechanisms to make sure it's more convenient and safer. It brings benefits in three folds: for users, it improves the utilization of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> space, for vendors of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> service, it helps attract users to use their services, for vendors of team collaboration applications, it reduces the burden of developing self-built storage infrastructure.

40|$|International {{audience}} <b>Personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> {{services such}} as Dropbox and OneDrive are popular among Internet users. They help in sharing content and backing up data by relying on the cloud to store files. The rise of mobile terminals {{and the presence of}} new providers question whether the usage of cloud storage is evolving.

In this paper we present a comprehensive characterization of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> services. Relying on traces collected for one month in an operational network, we show that users of each service present distinct behaviors. Dropbox is now threatened by competitors, with OneDrive and Google Drive reaching large market shares. However, the popularity of the latter services seems to be driven by their integration into Windows and Android. Indeed, around 50 % of their users do not produce any workload. Considering performance, providers show distinct trade-offs, with bottlenecks that hardly allow users to fully exploit their access line bandwidth. Finally, usage of cloud services is now ordinary among mobile users, thanks to the automatic backup of pictures and media files. </p...|$|R
