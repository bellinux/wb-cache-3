5|$|Vampyr was {{challenging}} for Dreyer {{to make as}} {{it was his first}} sound film and had to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with silent film-styled title cards. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus <b>photographic</b> <b>technique.</b> The audio editing was done in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were added to the film.|$|E
25|$|Description: The goal of {{this study}} was to perform a {{comparative}} study of living and fixed cytoplasm using the eggs at different stages. Strobell and Foot were able to study live eggs of Allolobophora foetida under high magniication using a Bausch and Lomb compressor, a feat that Foot had been attempting since 1894. The purpose of this particular paper was to discuss the photomicrography techniques using a broad overview of their work with the eggs. Three plates at different stages labeled A, B, and C are discussed in detail with 6 accompanying photographs each to show different perspectives. All three were fixed using a different method but the <b>photographic</b> <b>technique</b> remained consistent, using daylight near noon with 15-30 seconds of exposure.|$|E
25|$|According {{to the art}} {{historian}} Nicholas Allen, {{the image on the}} shroud was formed by a <b>photographic</b> <b>technique</b> in the 13th century. Allen maintains that techniques already available before the 14th century—e.g., as described in the Book of Optics, which was at just that time translated from Arabic to Latin—were sufficient to produce primitive photographs, and that people familiar with these techniques {{would have been able to}} produce an image as found on the shroud. To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis, in papers published in several science journals, and in a book. Silver bromide is believed by some to have been used for making the Shroud of Turin as it is widely used in photographic films.|$|E

25|$|Like {{his great}} uncle Ivo Peters, Beath's main passion {{in life was}} photography. His {{photographic}} subjects included {{a wide range of}} insects (especially beetles, butterflies and moths), amphibians and birds as well as the flora of tropical rainforests, which were the subject of his thesis. He was completely self-taught, and it was when studying for his PhD at The University of Aberdeen that his passion really took off. He joined the university's camera club and started to refine his <b>photographic</b> <b>technique</b> and also developed an interest in photographing Scottish landscapes. In the last decade he had focused photographing the natural landscapes in and around his hometown of Shrewsbury. He was a keen member of the Shropshire Photographic Society and was the club's competition secretary for several years. During 2010 he was commissioned to write a monthly feature about Shropshire photography through the seasons in Shropshire Life magazine.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] (pg. 96) states: [...] "Pictures can be {{protected}} as photographic works or as photographic pictures. The former requires {{a higher level}} of originality; the latter protects all types of photographs, also the ones taken by amateurs, or within medicine or science. The protection requires some sort of <b>photographic</b> <b>technique</b> being used, which includes digital cameras as well as holograms created by laser technique. The difference between the two types of work is the term of protection, which amounts to seventy years after the death of the author of a photographic work as opposed to fifty years, from the year in which the photographic picture was taken." ...|$|E
