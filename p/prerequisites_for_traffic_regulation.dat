This study investigates the mechanism of routing in communication networks with particular emphasis on networks operating under nonstationary environments. Communication networks have typically been modelled as stochastic processes. However, under non-stationary conditions these models are mathematically complex and analytical solutions have only been found for {{a small number of}} single server queueing systems. In our approach to the problem, we construct a deterministic equation that approximates the stochastic model of a single queue. The model necessarily compromises between accuracy and speed in computation. The model is used to investigate an efficient routing mechanism at a single switch in the network.

We first provide existence of a minimizer and compute analytically the cost functional variations due to needle-like variation in the control policy.

In particular, we show that the Nash equilibrium is unique, and is moreover efficient. These properties make the polynomial cost structure attractive <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> and link pricing in telecommunication networks.

All sorts of transportation have detrimental effects on the environment and ultimately the public health. Therefore, the mail aim of the thesis is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} electronic toll systems as a tool <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> within cities. To this end a comparison of available technologies by several criteria is presented and optimal solutions including the order of preference of specific technologies are suggested. Modern electronic toll systems enable variable setting of the toll amounts to reflect specific needs of particular towns and cities such as reduction of vehicle entry, noise or emissions as well as congestions of traffic and other issues.

30|$|The Objective {{behind this}} system is to propose a {{solution}} <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> based on air quality, meteorological and contextual collected data. A set of algorithms is used over these data filtering systems that analyses data gathered from local station’s sensors and external data sources which contains other needed data (Meteorological parameters, Geographical data and boundary conditions) and adds the intelligence of immediate contextual parameters which we can retrieve from users’ devices (e.g. Smartphone), such as time of day, location, speed, direction and weather. The resulting information will then be used to address the traffic regularization issue. As a result, users receive more relevant information and recommendations {{that are based on}} a combination of their historical preferences and contextual parameters.|$|R
40|$|International audienceUrban {{congestion}} is a {{major problem}} in our society for quality of life and for productivity. The increasing communication abilities of vehicles and recent advances in artificial intelligence allow new solutions to be considered <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation,</b> based on real-time information and distributed cooperative decision-making models. The paper presents a mechanism allowing a distributed regulation of the right-of-way of the vehicles at an intersection. The decision-making relies on an automatic negotiation between communication-equipped vehicles, taking into account the travel context and the constraints of each vehicle. During this negotiation, the vehicles exchange arguments, in order to take into account various types of information, on individual and network scales. Our mechanism deals with the continuous aspect of the traffic flow and performs a real-time regulation...|$|R

The specification, in PSF, centers on the algorithm performing the regulation, which is, in our view, the most interesting part. The specification given is data-oriented, i. e., {{there is not much}} emphasis on processes. Although time {{plays an important role in}} the regulation process, this is not an obstacle for specification. 1991 Mathematics subject classification: 68 Q 40, 68 Q 45 1990 CR categories: D. 1. 3, D. 2. 1, F. 1. 2.

40|$|Nongeostationary {{satellite}} constellations with intersatellite links are {{a challenge}} for networking due to their continuously changing topology. In order to make maximal use of the network's capacities, special attention has {{to be paid to}} routing and traffic engineering. Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) as underlying protocol is an interesting candidate for this task since it offers many possibilities to exert influence on traffic flows and supports today's dominating Internet protocol traffic very well. This paper describes a general MPLS-based networking concept for satellite networks and discusses different scenarios considering the particularities and constraints of the dynamic topology. Functional elements of MPLS like ingress, egress, or core routers have to be mapped onto the physical entities of the network and <b>prerequisites</b> <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> engineering are discussed. Routing and rerouting of paths is of key interest since this affects route computation effort and routing performance. Thus, an analytical estimation of routing effort is deduced and numerical and simulation results are presented...|$|R

A {{few months after}} her arrival, the Zuari Bridge was {{completed}} but not opened to public; the state government wanted Indira Gandhi to come from Delhi and inaugurate it formally. However, {{they were not able}} to secure confirmation from Indira Gandhi for several days. The public had to use ferries to transfer their vehicles across the Zuari River. One day, during a patrol, Bedi noticed that there was a huge mess at the ferry boarding point. She drove to the bridge, removed the blockades and diverted the traffic waiting at ferry to the bridge. This unofficial inauguration angered many politicians. In November 1983, Goa hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meet (CHOGM).

ONERA & SNCF conducted a first experiment of change detection using cross-track interferometry & coherent change detection with a rail-borne synthetic aperture radar. The BuSARd airborne SAR pod was strapped on a flat wagon with its X-band horn antennae extended to the wagon corner in squinted across-track configuration. Preliminary results from a first set of acquisition trips allowed to assess the specific difficulties of SAR in this application. Compared to space/airborne SAR major difficulties are consequences of an extremely wide relative swath width (propagation gain range of 40 dB), a large angular baseline (at near range) & wider variation of along-track velocity (slowdown/stop <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic {{priority}} multiplexing scheme <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> {{and scheduling}} in a B-ISDN supporting widely diversified services is proposed. In this scheme, the instantaneous priority of a packet {{is given by}} {{the difference between a}} penalty reflecting the earliness of the packet arrival with respect to its targeted arrival time and a dynamically attained priority due to waiting in the buffer. The packet with the highest priority is scheduled for transmission when the link is available and the packet with the lowest priority is dropped when the buffer is full. When the priorities of all waiting packets increase linearly at rate one, the proposed scheme is shown to be equivalent to the Virtual Clock algorithm. For this special case, a simple expression for the per connection waiting time is obtained by using a heavy traffic approximation approach. 1 Introduction The transmission speed of B-ISDN is orders of magnitude larger than that of any individual user.

40|$|Multimedia traffic can {{tolerate}} some loss but has rigid delay constraints. A natural QoS requirement for a multimedia connection is a prescribed bound on the {{the fraction of}} traffic that exceeds an end [...] to [...] end delay limit. We propose and analyze a traffic management schemes which guarantees QoS to multimedia traffic while simultaneously allowing for a large connectioncarrying capacity. We study our traffic management scheme {{in the context of}} a single node. In order for the node to guarantee QoS, each connection's traffic is regulated. In order to support many connections, the link statistically multiplexes the connections' traffic. The scheme consists of (i) cascaded leaky-buckets <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation,</b> (ii) smoothers at the ingresses, and (iii) bufferless statistical multiplexing within the node. For this scheme we show that loss probabilities are minimized with simple one [...] buffer smoothers which operate at specific minimum rates.
