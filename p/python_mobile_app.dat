40|$|Abstract—Mobile apps are {{software}} products {{developed to}} run on mobile devices, and are typically distributed via <b>app</b> stores. The <b>mobile</b> <b>app</b> market {{is estimated to be}} worth billions of dollars, with more than hundred of thousands of apps, and still increasing in number. This explosion of <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> is astonishing, given the short time span that they have been around. One possible explanation for this explosion could be the practice of software reuse. Yet, no research has studied such practice in <b>mobile</b> <b>app</b> development. In this paper, we intend to analyze software reuse in the Android <b>mobile</b> <b>app</b> market along two dimensions: (a) reuse by inheritance, and (b) class reuse. Since app stores only distribute the byte code of the <b>mobile</b> <b>apps,</b> and not the source code, we used the concept of Software Bertillonage to track code across <b>mobile</b> <b>apps.</b> A case study on thousands of <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> across five different categories in the Android Market shows that almost 23 % of the classes inherit from a base class in the Android API, and 27 % of the classes inherit from a domain specific base class. Furthermore, on average 61 % of all classes in each category of <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> occur in two or more <b>apps,</b> and 217 <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> are reused completely by another <b>mobile</b> <b>app</b> in the same category.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the contents of}} a tutorial on web-based hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>apps.</b> Nowadays millions of <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> are downloaded and used all over the world. <b>Mobile</b> <b>apps</b> are distributed via different app stores like Google Play Store, the Apple App Store, the Windows Phone Store. One of the most intriguing challenges in <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> development is its fragmentation with respect to mobile platforms (e. g., Android, Apple iOS, Windows Phone). Recently, companies like IBM and Adobe and a growing community of developers advocate web-based hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> development as a possible solution to mobile platforms fragmentation. Web-based hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> are consistent across platforms and built on web standards like HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript. This tutorial provides a state of the art overview of the solutions, technologies, and research opportunities related to the development of web-based hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>apps.</b> Apache Cordova is presented as one of the possible technologies for hybrid apps development. The results of two empirical studies performed on real hybrid <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> are presented as an up-to-date snapshot {{of the state of the}} practice in the field.

40|$|Abstract—The {{popularity}} {{information in}} App stores, such as chart rankings, user ratings, and user reviews, provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand user experiences with <b>mobile</b> <b>Apps,</b> learn {{the process of}} adoption of <b>mobile</b> <b>Apps,</b> and thus enables better <b>mobile</b> <b>App</b> services. While the importance of popularity information is well recognized in the literature, {{the use of the}} popularity information for <b>mobile</b> <b>App</b> services is still fragmented and under-explored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a sequential approach based on hidden Markov model (HMM) for modeling the popularity information of <b>mobile</b> <b>Apps</b> toward <b>mobile</b> <b>App</b> services. Specifically, we first propose a popularity based HMM (PHMM) to model the sequences of the heterogeneous popularity observations of <b>mobile</b> <b>Apps.</b> Then, we introduce a bipartite based method to precluster the popu-larity observations. This can help to learn the parameters and initial values of the PHMM efficiently. Furthermore, we demon-strate that the PHMM is a general model and can be applicable for various <b>mobile</b> <b>App</b> services, such as trend based App rec-ommendation, rating and review spam detection, and ranking fraud detection. Finally, we validate our approach on two real-world data sets collected from the Apple Appstore. Experimental results clearly validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed popularity modeling approach.

These apps are used by {{millions of people around the}} world every day. However, currently most software engineering research is performed on large desktop or server applications like the Eclipse IDE and Apache HTTPD Server. We believe that research efforts must begin to examine <b>mobile</b> <b>apps.</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>apps</b> are growing at a rapid pace, yet they differ from traditionally-studied desktop and server applications. In this thesis, we examine such apps by performing three quantitative studies.

Then, inspired by the observation that different types of <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> may be relevant to different real-world contexts, we also extract some contextual features for <b>mobile</b> <b>apps</b> from the context-rich device logs of mobile users.
