She rejects the surgery, and is further disappointed when Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her that the worst-case scenario is that she will need an ostomy <b>pouching</b> system. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E
25|$|Deuterostomes {{differ from}} protostomes in several ways. Animals from both groups possess a {{complete}} digestive tract. However, in protostomes, the first {{opening of the}} gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the mouth, with the anus forming secondarily. In deuterostomes the anus forms first, with the mouth developing secondarily. In most protostomes, cells simply fill {{in the interior of}} the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes, it forms through invagination of the endoderm, called enterocoelic <b>pouching.</b> Deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.|$|E

Mean(s. d.) compliance was 10 (6) and 11 (4) ml/mmHg in the groups with poor and adequate <b>pouch</b> function respectively (P not significant). Mean(s. d.) visual analogue scale scores (0 - 10 cm) for urge at the highest pressure of 28 mmHg were 2. 3 (1. 0) versus 2. 3 (2. 4) cm respectively (P not significant); those for pain were 0. 8 (1. 0) versus 0. 5 (0. 7) (P not significant).

No man, sure, could see for the first time, without emotion, the youthful inheritor of so much fame and misfortune.

I soon recognized in the successful angler little Benjie, who had been my guide and tutor in that gentle art, as you have learned from my former letters. I called--I whistled--the rascal recognized me, and, starting like a guilty thing, seemed hesitating whether to approach or to run away; and when he determined on the former, it was to assail me with a loud, clamorous, and exaggerated report of the anxiety of all at the Shepherd's Bush for my personal safety; how my landlady had wept, how Sam and the ostler had not the heart to go to bed, but sat up all night drinking--and how he himself had been up long before daybreak to go in quest of me.|$|E

50|$|An ostomy <b>pouching</b> {{system is}} a {{prosthetic}} medical device that provides a means for the collection of waste from a surgically diverted biological system (colon, ileum, bladder) {{and the creation of}} a stoma. <b>Pouching</b> systems are most commonly associated with colostomies, ileostomies, and urostomies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pouching</b> systems usually {{consist of}} a {{collection}} pouch plastic bag, known as a one-piece system or, in some instances involves a mounting plate, commonly called a flange, wafer or a baseplate, and a collection pouch that is attached mechanically or with an adhesive inan airtight seal, known as a two-piece system. The selection of systems varies greatly between individuals and is often based on personal preference and lifestyle. Ostomy <b>pouching</b> systems collect waste that is output from a stoma. The <b>pouching</b> system allows the stoma to drain into a sealed collection pouch, while protecting the surrounding skin from contamination.|$|E
50|$|The {{point of}} exiting {{is what is}} known as the stoma. For {{greatest}} success and to minimize negative effects, it is preferable to perform this procedure as low down in the tract as possible, as this allows the maximal amount of natural digestion to occur before eliminating fecal matter from the body. The stoma is usually covered with a removable <b>pouching</b> system (adhesive or mechanical) that collects and contains the output for later disposal. Modern <b>pouching</b> systems enable most individuals to resume normal activities and lifestyles after surgery, often with no outward physical evidence of the stoma or its <b>pouching</b> system.|$|E

The kangaroo's <b>pouch</b> opens horizontally {{on the front of the}} body, and the joey must climb a relatively long way to reach it. Kangaroos and wallabies allow their young to live in the <b>pouch</b> well after they are physically capable of leaving, often keeping two different joeys in the <b>pouch,</b> one tiny and one fully developed. In kangaroos, wallabies and opossums, the <b>pouch</b> opens forward or up. In koalas, wombats and marsupial moles, the <b>pouch</b> opens backward or down. Backwards facing <b>pouches</b> would not work well in kangaroos or opossums as their young would readily fall out. Similarly, forward-facing <b>pouches</b> would not work well for wombats and marsupial moles as they both dig extensively underground. Their <b>pouches</b> would fill up with dirt and suffocate the developing young one. Kangaroo mothers will lick their <b>pouches</b> clean before the joey crawls inside. Kangaroo <b>pouches</b> are sticky to support their young joey. Koalas are unable to clean out their <b>pouches</b> since they face backwards, so just prior to giving birth to the young koala joey, a self-cleaning system is activated, secreting droplets of an anti-microbial liquid that cleans it out. In a relatively short time, the cleansing droplets clean out all of the crusty material left inside, leaving an almost sterile nursery ready to receive the tiny joey.|$|R
