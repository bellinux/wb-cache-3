40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} public expenditure by its components on income distribution among household sectors in Malaysia. The study on public expenditure related to income distribution is important as public expenditure has been used intensively since independence to achieve income equality goals in Malaysia. However, income inequality across ethnic groups, {{urban and rural areas}} remains wide and persistent. Income for Chinese and Indian is more than one time higher the income for Malay while income for urban is approximately double the income for rural. Using a detailed SAM framework for Malaysia constituting 50 accounts and a fixed <b>price</b> <b>multiplier</b> model, this paper highlights the difference impacts of public expenditure by different components on income distribution. Our results show that while public expenditure in education has improved inter-ethnic income inequality, it has led to a widening of rural-urban disparity.

However, food wastage abatement has sectorial trade-offs (winners and losers) and variations which need to be explored empirically to determine if this solution is worthwhile. Furthermore, despite the relevance of staples in SSA economies and their significant share in food loss, there are relatively few literature that analyses the economic impact of its reduction. Thus this study assesses and compares the economic impact of a cassava prevention policy, integrated wastage management policy and a combined policy on food security, rural-urban income distribution, economic growth, output expansion, net waste generation, trade-off between cooking and work income, food wastage footprint as well as employment in a cassava export driven Ghanaian economy using a mixed methods approach; namely food wastage fixed <b>price</b> <b>multiplier</b> model, value chain analysis and documentary analysis...|$|E

The impact is examined {{within the context of}} a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) based fixed <b>price</b> <b>multiplier</b> model. Generally the results show that public expenditure expansion has improved income inequality in Malaysia. The public expenditure expansion significantly improved the distribution of income across different household groups where it reduced both the Malay-Chinese and Malay-Indian income inequality as well as reduced income disparity between rural and urban areas. However, the improvement in income inequality is much larger in the Eight Malaysia Plan than the Ninth Malaysia Plan. This could reveal that the public expenditure expansion in the Eight Malaysia Plan gave more opportunities to the Malay to increase their income. It could also indicate that there were differences in the pattern or composition of the public sector expenditure in both plans that had influenced income distribution among the household sector which result a more significant success in the Eight Malaysia Plan. This then lead to suggest further investigation on the impacts of the various components of the public expenditure on the different household groups...|$|E

Here, the term channel represents the business interaction between the retailer and the carrier. The retailer sells a particular item with price-dependent demand, whereas the carrier is responsible for transporting the item to the retailer's site. We characterize the profit functions of each channel member as well as the total channel profit. We consider two specific channel structures: (i) the centralized channel and (ii) the decentralized channel. Under the first channel structure, the goal is to set the retail price so as to maximize the total channel profit. Under the latter, the carrier and the retailer choose their own policy parameters, i. e., the freight rate for the carrier and the retail price for the retailer, so as to maximize their individual profits. We model the decentralized channel as a Stackelberg Game and propose a coordination mechanism between the retailer and the carrier in which the retailer signals a <b>price</b> <b>multiplier</b> to the carrier. We illustrate that this mechanism could provide win-win solutions for both parties and present analytical and numerical results on the efficiency of channel coordination.

40|$|Poster {{presentation}} at the Medical Library Association Annual Meeting, May 15 - 20, 2015 in Austin, TXObjectives: The University System of Maryland and Affiliated Institutions (USMAI) Library Consortium consists of the 16 libraries from Maryland’s diverse public universities and colleges, including a research university, a distance education university, a liberal arts college, professional schools in law and the health sciences, HBCU institutions, and two system centers. A pilot was implemented to explore the feasibility of a joint demand driven acquisition (DDA) e-book model. Methods: A committee of ten—including the collection manager from the health sciences library and a health sciences librarian {{from one of the}} system centers—convened to design and manage the pilot. The consortium leadership provided a budget of $ 100, 000, and the committee selected a broad profile, focusing on the subject areas offered at the system centers, which offer several interdisciplinary and inter-institutional courses. One goal was to provide greater equity in access to resources across institutions. The committee decided to pilot a novel consortial DDA model that limited the lending of each purchased book rather than providing a <b>price</b> <b>multiplier.</b> A simple questionnaire was devised to measure participation by campus. Results: The pilot went live in August 2013 with an initial load of 6560 titles into USMAI’s shared catalog. The original model was to pay for 6 short term loans and purchase the book at print list price on the 7 th. A purchase entitled the consortium to 14 short term loans per year with an additional copy being purchased at print list price on the 15 th. Over {{the course of the year}} the committee removed certain titles from publishers who demanded exorbitant increases in the cost of short term loans and added others. Currently the shared DDA collection contains 25, 077 titles. An analysis of usage shows that the users of all libraries in the system have benefited from the program, and funding for the pilot was approved for a second year. Conclusions: A consortial e-book DDA program can be a cost-effective way of equitably increasing access to a greater number of resources for library users. As e-book models for libraries continue to evolve it is vital that libraries work with publishers to design systems that are mutually beneficial. It is our hope that other consortia will adopt this type of model so that it will continue to be viable in the marketplace. ...|$|E

40|$|Access to {{adequate}} and nutritionally balanced food {{to achieve a}} productive and healthy life for all individuals, on a daily basis, has been an elusive challenge in several parts of the world. In many developing countries such as Botswana, increasing per capita food consumption has been hampered by poverty as well as poor access to marketable skills and employment opportunities. Experience and studies elsewhere indicate that international trade liberalization based on comparative cost advantage in the goods sectors, can greatly improve per capita food consumption through improved export market access and reduction in tariffs. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the effects of international trade liberalization on food security/household welfare and the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in Botswana. In undertaking this study basically two hypotheses were made. Firstly, it is hypothesized that trade liberalization within SACU through the reduction of agricultural tariffs on food commodities can improve per capita consumption by reducing domestic food prices. Currently, products like maize grain, beef, dairy and wheat grain attract an import duty which partly increases their domestic prices within SACU. Poor households in Botswana, in particular, spend a disproportionate share of their disposable income on food most of which is imported. Secondly, this study also hypothesizes that improved market access of agricultural exports for Botswana based on WTO rules could generate additional foreign earnings that could be used to import more food. Globally, agricultural trade is characterized by distortions that restrict free commerce based on comparative advantage. Direct producer price and input subsidies together with export subsidies to farmers especially in major trade players like the EU, USA and Japan constitute barriers to trade and disadvantage developing countries like Botswana which have comparative advantage in several farm commodities. Subsidies by major industrialized countries create an artificial comparative advantage for their farmers as without direct farmer assistance, it is doubtful if some of them could invest in agriculture! Secondary data on international trade and social accounting matrix (SAM) were used in this study. Trade data were used to conduct policy simulations in order to determine the effects of trade liberalization on food security and competitiveness of the agricultural sector in Botswana. SAM data for 1993 / 94 were modified and used to generate income and price multipliers to undertake policy simulations. Data from SAM captures the income and demand linkages in the economy. Using partial equilibrium and economy-wide approach (SAM multiplier analysis), this study shows that Botswana can improve its household welfare or per capita food consumption through an increase in export earnings which in turn could be used to import more food at competitive prices. Except for meat products especially beef, Botswana is a net-importer of most food items. Based on a partial equilibrium agricultural trade policy model, this study found that the country’s agricultural sector enjoys global comparative advantage in beef exports if there was global trade liberalization. The model advocates for the reduction of direct producer price, input and export subsidies in the agricultural sector by WTO members. Beef earnings including those from other goods like textiles and minerals are used to purchase imported food to increase domestic supply. Through a SAM income multiplier analysis, policy simulations on improved export market access for beef and textiles indicated that households, factors and activities gained from global trade liberalization. However, poor households without assets or factors such as capital and skills marginally benefited from improved export market access. This finding also indicates the potential negative income distributional effects which require policy support to benefit poor households during trade liberalization. Beef and textiles exports were chosen when undertaking policy simulations based on improved market access. With a SAM <b>price</b> <b>multiplier</b> analysis, policy simulations based on SACU tariff reduction on maize grain, beef, powdered milk and wheat grain was made. Applied tariffs were used for policy simulations. A reduction in tariffs not only improves household welfare, factors and activities also benefit through lower domestic food costs/prices. This study found that SACU tariff reduction indeed contributed to welfare improvements among households in Botswana as their cost of living declined. Poor households, in particular, benefited most from tariff reduction in imported food commodities. Factors including low-wage workers also gained from a reduction of import duties on selected food commodities. However, government loses tariff revenue when import duties are cut while producers of exports enjoying preferential markets such as the beef producers in Botswana lose when trade-distorting agricultural subsides are removed/reduced. Like government, consumers of imported food items are, in short term, adversely affected by an increase in food prices following the reduction of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies (producer price, input and export subsidies). The results of the SAM <b>price</b> <b>multiplier</b> analysis also indicated limited price/cost transmission in the economy following tariff reduction. Limited price transmission or circular flow of cost reduction in the economy imply weak competition in the market, poor information dissemination, institutional rigidities, etc hence the need for an effective competition policy and law. An effective competition policy and authority minimizes unfair trading practices and provides consumers and the economy with choice and possibly maximum net-value for money. In addition to improving welfare and reducing cost of living, etc, this study also found that when policy simulations/shocks were made, income and demand linkages in the economy were identified. In some simulations the linkages demonstrated a strong circular flow of income/price transmission while in others the multiplier effects were weak indicating limited economic integration/competition, a policy challenge that requires efforts for sustained diversification. Based on the results from SAM multiplier analysis, this study has provided Botswana with useful information to design policies that enhance economic integration and diversification. To maximize her benefits from international trade liberalization, Botswana also needs to implement complementary policies to address supply-side constraints and improve infrastructure, competition, information technology, etc. Safeguard mechanisms are still necessary to protect the agricultural sector and the economy in Botswana from unfair trade practices including market failure.
