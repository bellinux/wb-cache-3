500|$|According to a belief, {{the power}} of dragon boys was {{greatest}} {{at the time of}} their birth; the younger they were, the greater power they had. In a folk tale from eastern Serbia, a group of dragons surrounded an ala, which broke away and flew into a watermill. There was a woman in the mill with her baby, who was a dragon boy; he grabbed a stone and killed the ala with it. It was recorded in the region of Niš that a winged dragon boy, in his fights with ale, [...] "takes a <b>plough</b> <b>beam</b> and immediately stops the ala, and hail ceases." [...] The mother of a dragon boy wanted to make him an ordinary child by cutting off the winglets beneath his armpits, but that section resulted in the boy's death. As was thought in the Župa basin and nearby areas, no one but the mother should see a dragon boy during the first seventeen days of his life; otherwise the child would die. If he survived, he would protect his village from hail, and at the age of seven he would fly away from home. It was also believed in Župa that the dragon men lived alone, without contacts with other humans.|$|E
50|$|The Ransome Victory Plough's most {{recognizable}} {{feature is the}} vertically adjustable pivot wheel {{in front of the}} ploughshare (as opposed to a cutting knife or wheel). This pivot wheel, combined with an offset tension bar to which the chain from the yoke is connected, causes the forward motion of oxen to force the blade into the soil. However, the tension bar is typically far weaker than the main <b>plough</b> <b>beam,</b> and is likely {{the first part of the}} plough to break. The difficulty of accessing spare parts causes many farmers to simply chain the oxen to the front of the beam, after which the ploughman must use his own strength to keep the plowshare in the soil. Another notable feature is the relatively short mouldboard, which lessens the amount of draft force necessary to pull the plow.|$|E

5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and his spirit would fly out of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using <b>plough</b> <b>beams.</b> In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|R

40|$|Cue: It?s widely {{acknowledged}} that HIV and AIDS pose an enormous threat to food production {{in many of}} Africa?s agriculture-dependent countries. For anyone to die from AIDS is a tragedy, but in Africa, {{many of those who}} are dying are the backbone of the farming labour force. How can those who are left behind, the very old, the very young, the widows and the orphans, manage to grow the crops they require for their own food and income needs? One answer, being promoted by the NGO Africare, is the use of labour saving technologies, that allow cultivation of sufficient areas of land with much less human labour than has been needed in the past. Africare has designed new implements, such as ploughs, planters and harvesters, which can be operated even by old people or fairly young children. Chris Kakunta recently visited a field day in his home country of Zambia, {{to find out more about}} the equipment Africare is promoting. He sent us this report. IN:		?I am here at the Africare ?? OUT:		??You are most welcome. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 58 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chris Kakunta reporting from Magoye, Zambia, on new labour-saving equipment being promoted by the NGO Africare. Transcript Kakunta	I am here at the Africare stand, Magoye, Mazibuka, some 150 km south of Lusaka. Africare is one of the NGOs that has come to exhibit some of their equipment that they are promoting among small scale farmers at this year?s field day, particularly to small scale farmers who are vulnerable. And with me is Munachoongo Muleya, the field officer with the organisation. To start with Munachoongo, what are some of these equipment that you are trying to promote? Muleya	What we are doing actually, we are looking at two main areas. We are looking at conservation tillage and crop processing. So what we have here are conservation tillage implements and we have post-harvest machinery. Kakunta	How can the farmers benefit from this equipment that you are promoting? Muleya	You know these days, Chris, we are talking of HIV and AIDS, and actually we are talking of farmers who have lost their animals due to Corridor [disease]. And what you can see here, we have the rippers, we have the groundnut lifter, we have the cultivators, we have the weed-sweep. These implements that you see can be used by a farmer who has maybe two oxen. That farmer can use and actually rip the field as much as he wants. Kakunta	Let?s take for instance the ripper, this one, which is looking like a small plough really. Muleya	Actually this ripper that we are seeing here, it?s a ripper that can be used by any farmer, and what we have done it we have just designed this attachment and then you put it onto the usual beam. You know these beams at our farms, the plough beams that we have, you know the farmers have this tendency of saying, ?No, they have brought up this new technology but it is very expensive. ? Everything now we are making, it has to be fitted on the old beam, the old <b>plough</b> <b>beam</b> that we have on our farm. So you just have to attach the ripper to the beam which we have; then you use it to make your own furrows at the farm. Kakunta	When you came up with all this equipment, what was in your mind? Muleya	You know if you go to the villages now, Chris, you only find the old and the young. And actually in the villages there, the people who do most of the work are the women. Now we are saying, since we have the old men there at the farms, we have the old men in the village, if we bring these implements, and you can see on that poster Chris, that?s a poster for a maize sheller, and that?s a poster for a ripper, you know these men they get interested. The next thing you can see there is the ripper planter. Instead of the women following the animals everyday, the man will just put on the ripper planter, put the seed, he will make the furrow, he will plant, and the same ripper planter you are seeing has a covering mechanism. You rip, then it plants behind, and it covers. Then it does three jobs at once. So it will be easier for the old men in the village there to do the work alone. Kakunta	How are the vulnerable, the women and children, the widows and orphans, how are they able to access some of this equipment. Do you have a mechanism in place? Muleya	We don?t give direct loans, but we work with lending institutions like micro-bankers trust, and women finance co-operatives. These people, when we go into the villages, we go with them, and the farmers are able to access money from these lending institutions and are able to buy our machines. I can give you an example; that group that you can see there is Manyama farmers group. They were able to access that peanut butter machine and now here in Magoye, these women are making peanut butter. That means the family and themselves, even their husbands - you can see that husband there is getting interested, because there is money coming out. And that peanut butter, actually, when you talk of HIV and AIDS, they can use it for the porridge, for the children. They can put it in relish. And you know it makes life easier. Kakunta	What about the health concerns. How are you addressing them? Muleya	Actually Chris, on health, it?s not direct, that we go to those people who are directly affected by HIV/AIDS. We are targeting those people who are there in the villages, who have remained. We are talking of the old and the young. You know, the old ladies who are looking after the orphans and those orphans who have been left; we don?t want these people to make excuses, that?s why we have made sure that we have these implements which are labour saving, which can be used by the old women - the ripper can be used by an old man, even a young boy. The ripper will just go, within two hours it will be a hectare. And that woman, what she needs is just to go and put in the seed when the rains come. That means that woman will be able to harvest; she won?t even make an excuse that she had nothing to use, and that?s why she is going hungry now. These farmers have to change with time, because everything is changing. Even the rains are changing. Then why don?t you change the implements that you are using as a farmer? Kakunta	I would like to thank you so much. Muleya	You are most welcome. End of track.
