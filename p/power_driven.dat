5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that the next big war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller <b>power</b> <b>driven</b> airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty-eight miles an hour and such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty-five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E

The steering pump was <b>power</b> <b>driven,</b> which replaced the early belt driven system, while the only available engine {{was the new}} Leyland O.680. A wide variety of body styles from various manufacturers continued to be offered, allowing the Atlantean to be tailor made to requirements from operators ranging from the small independent to the large city corporation.|$|E
25|$|Most extant cottages in the north-west {{date from}} the late-18th and early-19th century when weaving had {{ceased to be a}} sideline. They were adapted or built {{specially}} at a time when spinning technology was sufficiently advanced to supply the needs of the weavers. Wool and silk manufacture were slower to adopt <b>power</b> <b>driven</b> looms than the cotton industry. Terraces of three-storey brick-built domestic workshops were built in Macclesfield after silk weaving was introduced around 1790 and more than 600 weavers had looms in their homes in 1825. Domestic workshops for velvet cutting survived in the Cadishead area until 1914.|$|E

2500|$|When Allied {{troops were}} halted near Anzio, Italy {{during the spring}} of 1944, powered {{personal}} radio receivers were strictly prohibited as the Germans had equipment that could detect the local oscillator signal of superheterodyne receivers. [...] Crystal sets lack <b>power</b> <b>driven</b> local oscillators, hence they could not be detected. Some resourceful soldiers constructed [...] "crystal" [...] sets from discarded materials to listen to news and music. One type used a blue steel razor blade and a pencil lead for a detector. [...] The lead point touching the semiconducting oxide coating (rust) on the blade formed a crude point-contact diode. [...] By carefully adjusting the pencil lead {{on the surface of the}} blade, they could find sensitive spots, of iron oxide, capable of rectification. [...] The lead of the pencil is made of graphite and clay and so it would inhibit further corrosion that would result if copper or iron wire was used in its place. Any further corrosion at the point of contact would ruin the diode effect found at that spot and further adjustment would be necessary. The sets were dubbed [...] "foxhole radios" [...] by the popular press, and they became part of the folklore of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Independent {{tests of}} the nail's stretch were {{conducted}} by several organizations, including Florida International University and the International Code Council. Those tests confirmed what the researchers at Bostitch had claimed, that they had created a better nail. Among all of the different tests, {{it was found that}} the new nail had twice the [...] "uplift capacity" [...] of other <b>power</b> <b>driven</b> nails, as well as increasing a home's resistance to wind and increasing earthquake resistance by up to 50%. For further testing, Sutt asked for the assistance of Scott Schiff, the coordinator of the graduate program in civil engineering and engineering mechanics at Clemson University. Tests at the Clemson Wind Load Test Facility confirmed what had already been stated. With equipment to simulate the force of winds, roofs attached with traditional nails were pulled apart at around 13,500 pounds of force (60.1 kN). At forces up to 16,000 pounds (71kN), walls built with the HurriQuake environment nail showed minimal wall movement. As the pressure increased to 17,000 pounds (75kN), then 18,000 (80kN), then 19,000 (85kN), the walls began to make creaking and groaning noises but they still stayed attached. As the test rig pushed 20,000 pounds (89kN), the maximum it was capable of testing, it gave out, showing that the HurriQuake environment nail sustained 20,000 pounds of force (89kN) and still was not sheared or completely pulled out.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. One {{of basic}} {{elements}} of band bucket elevators is their drive. For determination of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> {{it is necessary to}} conduct calculations on standard by methods, in what it is needed to expend enough time. One of project parameters is productivity of elevator. It is necessary to build parametric dependence of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> of elevator on its design capacity that takes into account a type and descriptions of load, lifting height, standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Methodology. Using the method of hauling calculation of band buckets elevators, the parametric dependences of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> of high-speed elevators are built with deep and shallow buckets from their productivity at fixed type of load and height of getting up. Findings. It is set {{on the basis of the}} built parametric dependences that the change function of a size of elevator power from design capacity (at fixed to the lifting height, load type, rate of tape movement) is piecewise and droningly increasing. The intervals of project values of productivity, which provide the permanent size of elevator <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> are certain in a general view. As the example of application of the recived results the construction process of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> dependence from design capacity of elevator of shotblasting room, which is intended for transporting of the metallic shot using for consolidating of carriage springs, is considered. For concrete type of load and lifting height of such elevator graphic dependence of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> on productivity was built. Originality. Parametric dependences of elevator <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> on its design capacity were first built, which take into account a type and physical and mechanical descriptions of load, lifting height, standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Practical value. The use of the built dependences enables in relation to rapid determination of approximate value of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> of vertical high-speed elevators with deep and shallow buckets on the stage of planning and to execute the high-quality selection of its basic elements at concrete project descriptions: type of load, productivity, lifting height...|$|R
