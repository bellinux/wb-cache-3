The CSM was initially implemented on January 1, 2006, with the signing of the document for its implementation by six original member states. However the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas establishing the CSME had been provisionally applied by twelve member states of CARICOM from February 4, 2002, under a Protocol on the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Application</b> of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas. Nine protocols had been drafted to amend the Original Treaty of Chaguaramas and had been consolidated into the Revised Treaty signed at Nassau in 2001, with a number of the Protocols having been applied in part or in full from their creation in 1997-1998 including the provision on the Free Movement of Skilled Nationals.|$|E

40|$|In 1994, Congress {{enacted the}} Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) {{in an effort}} to bring the United States into {{conformance}} with international patent standards and “place domestic applicants on an equal footing with foreign applicants. ” The URAA introduced substantial changes in U. S. patent law. One of the most significant changes was the amendment of 35 U. S. C. A. § 111 (West 1994) to allow inventors (both domestic and foreign) to file a special application: the <b>provisional</b> patent <b>application.</b> In the years following ratification of the URAA, {{much has been written about}} the various nuances and intricacies of filing <b>provisional</b> patent <b>applications</b> in the United States. In the midst of this voluminous discourse, it has been difficult for the conscientious practitioner to determine exactly what to say to a client who asks, “Should I file a provisional application?” The purpose of this Note is to provide a quick and practical guide to the benefits and shortcomings of filing <b>provisional</b> patent <b>applications,</b> including the use of <b>provisional</b> <b>applications</b> as part of an overall patent filing strategy. Part II will provide a brief overview of <b>provisional</b> <b>applications</b> and how they differ from nonprovisional applications. Part III will evaluate the benefits of filing <b>provisional</b> <b>applications.</b> Part IV will discuss the disadvantages, including potential pitfalls for the unwary. Finally, some general conclusions will be drawn in Part V regarding the use of <b>provisional</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Although the CARICOM Skills Certificate regime pre-dates {{the formal}} inauguration of the CSME (Skills Certificates have been {{available}} since 1997, while the CSME was only formally instituted in 2005 following <b>provisional</b> <b>application</b> of the CSME protocols in 2001) the number of Skills Certificates issued to qualifying CARICOM nationals has only really taken off since the CSME was instituted. Between 1997 and 2005 only nine Member States had issued certificates of Recognition of Skills on a relatively small scale. Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Guyana have issued the bulk of these certificates. By September 2010 approximately 10,000 Skills Certificates had been issued by the 12 member states with the available data on free movement indicating that more than 6,000 of these skills certificates having been issued between 2006 and 2008. At {{an address to the}} graduates of the 48th Convocation of the University of Guyana on 8 November 2014, [...] CARICOM’s Secretary General, Irwin La Rocque, revealed that up to November 2014 a total of 14,000 Skills Certificates had been issued and he urged the graduates to apply for their own Skills Certificates now that they were eligible.|$|E
50|$|Provisional patent {{applications}} can {{be filed}} at many patent offices, {{such as the}} USPTO in the U.S. A <b>provisional</b> <b>application</b> provides an opportunity to place an application on file to obtain a filing date (thereby securing a priority date), but without the expense and complexity of a standard patent application. The disclosure in a <b>provisional</b> <b>application</b> may, within a limited time (one year in the U.S.), be incorporated into a standard patent application if a patent is to be pursued. Otherwise, the <b>provisional</b> <b>application</b> expires. No enforceable rights can be obtained solely through the filing of a <b>provisional</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{provisional}} {{priority date}} {{is of little}} consequence for any claims in the issued patent that are {{not supported by the}} disclosure in the priority document. This makes it very important that <b>provisional</b> <b>applications</b> be sufficiently detailed. Otherwise, the validity of an issued patent may be challenged as to the priority date of its claims that purport to relate back to an insufficient [...] "provisional". Furthermore, during the year after filing the first provisional (and prior to filing a non-provisional application), it may be useful to file additional <b>provisional</b> <b>applications</b> as improvements are made, and then claim priority of those found useful in drafting the non-provisional application(s).|$|R
