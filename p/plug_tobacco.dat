25|$|By the 1850s, Lynchburg (along with New Bedford, Massachusetts) {{was among}} the richest towns per capita in the US. Tobacco (including the {{manufacture}} of <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> in factories using rented slave labor), slave-trading, general commerce, and iron and steel powered the economy.|$|E
6000|$|... "The captain has {{a sort of}} {{discussion}} with his helpmates, and they all produce the contents of their pockets for analysis. Out of the general results they figured up $102.30 in cash and $31 worth of <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{smell was}} {{something}} awful in the place, coming from some seal meat that was cooking over the fire, {{and also from}} the pipes of the Esquimaux, who were all smoking stuff that the lads later on learned {{was a combination of}} <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> and seal hair--the hair being added to the tobacco to make the latter last longer.|$|E
50|$|In 1876, Liggett & Myers {{introduced}} L&M <b>plug</b> chewing <b>tobacco,</b> {{during the}} 1880s it entered the cigarette business and by 1885 {{the company had}} become the world's largest manufacturer of <b>plug</b> chewing <b>tobacco.</b>|$|R

60|$|Calling each by name, Minnie {{gave the}} {{presents}} out, accompanying each presentation with some happy remark that {{added to the}} glee. There were trade watches, clasp knives, amazing assortments of fish-hooks in packages, <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco,</b> matches, and gorgeous strips of cotton for loincloths all around. That Boyd Duncan was liked by them was evidenced by the roars of laughter with which they greeted his slightest joking allusion.|$|E
60|$|Captain Boone, of the {{schooner}} Flyaway, {{stood near}} his skiff, {{which one of}} his crew was guarding in the surf. When ready to sail he had discovered {{that one of the}} necessaries of life, in the parallelogrammatic shape of <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco,</b> had been forgotten. A sailor had been dispatched for the missing cargo. Meanwhile the captain paced the sands, chewing profanely at his pocket store.|$|E
60|$|Two {{pairs of}} heavy mittens, John Robert's muffler which {{his mother had}} knitted for him, and Joseph Dawes' beaver cap atop my own, both bearing ear-and neck-flaps, {{completed}} my outfitting. The shouts that the brig was sinking redoubled, but I took a minute longer to fill my pockets with all the <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> I could lay hands on. Then I climbed out on deck, and not a moment too soon.|$|E

60|$|Let me {{tell you}} briefly the history of my {{personal}} relation to tobacco. It began, I think, when I was a lad, and {{took the form of}} a quid, which I became expert in tucking under my tongue. Afterward I learned the delights of the pipe, and I suppose there was no other youngster of my age who could more deftly cut <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> so as to make it available for pipe-smoking.|$|E
60|$|The shelter {{was nearly}} full when {{they opened the}} door. It was very warm inside. A cabman gets so much fresh air in the {{exercise}} of his professional duties that he is apt to avoid it in private life. The air was heavy with conflicting scents. Fried onions seemed to be having the best of the struggle for the moment, though <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> competed gallantly. A keenly analytical nose might also have detected the presence of steak and coffee.|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{paid the}} {{slightest}} attention. It {{was the same}} as if Jean had not spoken. Waiting, half amused, half irritated, Jean shot a rapid glance around the store. The place had felt bare; and Jean, peering back through gloomy space, saw that it did not contain much. Dry goods and sacks littered a long rude counter; long rough shelves divided their length into stacks of canned foods and empty sections; a low shelf back of the counter held a generous burden of cartridge boxes, and next to it stood a rack of rifles. On the counter lay open cases of <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco,</b> the odor of which was second in strength only to that of rum.|$|E

6000|$|... "Worse and worse," [...] cried Jasper, {{pulling a}} large <b>plug</b> of <b>tobacco</b> from the breast of his coat; [...] "here, that'll keep you puffin' {{for a short}} bit, anyhow." ...|$|R
60|$|It was coarse gold, {{running from}} pinheads to a twelve-dollar nugget, {{and it had}} come from off bed-rock. The first fall snow was flying that day, and the Arctic winter was closing down; but Daylight had no eyes for the bleak-gray sadness of the dying, {{short-lived}} summer. He saw his vision coming true, and on the big flat was upreared anew his golden city of the snows. Gold had been found on bed-rock. That was the big thing. Carmack's strike was assured. Daylight staked a claim in his own name adjoining the three he had purchased with his <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco.</b> This gave him a block of property two thousand feet long and extending in width from rim-rock to rim-rock.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{were called}} insubordinate young whelps at last, and {{strictly}} forbidden {{to take the}} Tommies out any more without orders. I wasn't sorry, because Tommy is such an exacting sort of creature. He wants to live {{as though he were}} in barracks all the time. I was grubbing on fowls and boiled corn, but the Tommies wanted their pound of fresh meat, and their half ounce of this, and their two ounces of t'other thing, and they used to come to me and badger me for <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> when we were four days in jungle. I said: 'I can get you Burma tobacco, but I don't keep a canteen up my sleeve.' They couldn't see it. They wanted all the luxuries of the season, confound 'em!" ...|$|E
60|$|The food {{problem was}} simple arithmetic. We did not count Aaron Northrup, for {{we knew he}} would soon be gone. At a pound per day, our five hundred pounds would last us twenty-five days; at half a pound, it would last fifty. So half a pound had it. I divided and issued the meat under the captain's eyes, and managed it fairly enough, God knows, {{although}} some of the men grumbled from the first. Also, from time to time I made fair division among the men of the <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> I had stowed in my many pockets--a thing which I could not but regret, especially when I knew it was being wasted on this man and that who I was certain could not live a day more, or, at best, two days or three.|$|E
60|$|And {{for three}} pounds of Star <b>plug</b> chewing <b>tobacco,</b> Daylight bought {{outright}} three five-hundred-foot claims on Bonanza. He could still stake another claim {{in his own}} name, the others being merely transfers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I left me <b>plug</b> of <b>tobacco</b> {{here when}} I was coiling down last," [...] said the little twisted man--no; {{he did not}} say it. He spat it out like so much venom.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed her}} a large <b>plug</b> of <b>tobacco,</b> and the woman, sitting down close to young Duncan, {{produced}} her pipe, and drew out a knife {{for the purpose of}} cutting up the tobacco.|$|R
6000|$|In those thirty years, by a sane {{and steady}} growth, Hilary Vane had {{achieved}} his present eminent {{position in the}} State. He was trustee for I know not how many people and institutions, a deacon in the first church, a lawyer of such ability that he sometimes was accorded the courtesy-title of [...] "Judge." [...] His only vice--if it could be called such--was in occasionally placing a piece, {{the size of a}} pea, of a particular kind of <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> under his tongue,--and this was not known to many people. Euphrasia could not be called a wasteful person, and Hilary had accumulated no small portion of this world's goods, and placed them as propriety demanded, where they were not visible to the naked eye: and be it added in his favour that he gave as secretly, to institutions and hospitals the finances and methods of which were known to him.|$|E

50|$|Plug {{chewing tobacco}} is pressed tobacco leaves into a square, brick-like mass of tobacco. From this, bites {{are taken from}} the plug, or can also be cut off and then chewed. <b>Plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> is declining in popularity, and thus is less readily {{available}} than loose leaf chewing tobacco. Some brands include Cannon Ball, Days Work, and Levi Garrett Plug. Historically, <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> could be either smoked in a pipe or chewed, but today these are two distinct products.|$|E

50|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> {{is made up}} {{of tobacco}} leaves that have been pressed {{together}} and bound by some type of sweetener, resulting in a dense, square tobacco mass. (Some compare the look of <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> to a brownie or similar pastry.) One can then bite directly from the mass or slice the tobacco into portions. Some types of plug may either be chewed or smoked in a tobacco pipe, and some are exclusive to one method of consumption or the other.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>tobacco</b> {{was once}} a much more common product, {{available}} to many American consumers during the 19th century. Two tobacco companies that historically manufactured plug are Liggett and Lorillard. (The latter was known for its Climax brand of plug.) ...|$|E
60|$|This last {{addition}} to my stock caused a considerable protuberance in front, which I abated in a measure by shaking {{the bits of}} bread around my waist, and distributing the <b>plugs</b> of <b>tobacco</b> among {{the folds of the}} garment.|$|R
