40|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of section 37 C into the Pension Funds Act. 24 of 1956, the benefit payable {{as a result of the}} death of a member would devolve in accordance with his last will and testament or the provisions of intestate succession. The advent of section 37 C brought a statutory regime which expressly excludes freedom of testation and rather looks to the board of a fund to distribute the death benefit. The board may only pay the dependants of a deceased (either factual or legal) or the persons he has recorded on his nomination form. The section relies on the board to exercise its discretion in a manner which results in an equitable distribution of the death benefit notwithstanding that it does not provide any guidelines as to how this is to be achieved. Accordingly, numerous decisions are challenged by the identified beneficiaries because they are unhappy with the manner in which the board exercised its discretion. This results in complaints being lodged with the Pension Funds Adjudicator. Many such complaints should never have arisen or could have been easily solved by a <b>proper</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> on the part of the board.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project, led by the International Drug Policy Consortium, with {{the participation of the}} International Security Research Department at Chatham House and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, is to collate and refine theoretical material and examples of new approaches to drug law enforcement, as well as to promote debate amongst law enforcement leaders on the implications for future strategies. Key Points: • Many police services have long {{played an important role in}} the protection and promotion of various aspects of public health – the primary role of police officers is to protect life and property. • On their appointment police officers swear or affirm to uphold the laws of their countries including those which directly or indirectly speak to the protection of public health, fundamental human rights and the promotion of health related programmes and interventions. • Police services from around the world have engaged with a range of harm reduction interventions incorporated within the WHO, UNODC, UNAIDS ‘comprehensive package for the prevention, treatment and care of HIV among [people who inject drugs (PWID) ]’, including needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy (OST). • Some police services also engage in good practice relative to the operation of drug consumption rooms, drug overdose prevention and drug referral schemes. • Evidence shows that harm reduction interventions are cost effective, produce positive public health outcomes, and in some cases lead to reductions in drug related criminal activity. • In some countries police services remain antagonistic towards harm reduction interventions and often operate contrary to national laws and rights-based treaties. • Chief police officers need to ramp up, and in many case initiate, engagement with a full range of harm reduction interventions relating to people who inject drugs and work to change related laws where necessary. • Embedding harm reduction principles within police service training curricula can bring about positive and beneficial change in policing attitudes towards people who inject drugs. • The <b>proper</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> police <b>discretion</b> will also help to achieve positive and beneficial change and engender support for harm reduction programmes. • Police service performance indicators should, where possible, support the broader agenda of public health...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesSection 165 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 {{introduces}} the new statutory derivative action. The section confers a pivotal function {{on the courts}} as gatekeepers to the derivative action, with an important filtering or screening function to weed out applications for derivative actions that are frivolous, vexatious or without merit. The vital judicial discretion to grant leave to an applicant to bring a derivative action entails a tension between two equally important policy objectives. A proper balance between these two underpinning policy objectives depends on the appropriate judicial interpretation and application of the three vague, general and open-textured criteria or gateways for the grant of leave to institute a derivative action. The courts have been entrusted by s 165 to flesh out the details, the contours, the ambit and the scope of these criteria. This crucially gives the courts a dominant and a decisive {{role in shaping the}} effectiveness of the new statutory derivative action. This thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge in three main respects. First, this thesis focuses on the three guiding criteria for leave, and their many nuances, interpretations and applications in certain foreign jurisdictions that have exerted an influence on the provisions of s 165. Based on experience garnered from Australian, Canadian and New Zealand law, as well as the United Kingdom and the USA, guidelines are suggested for the approach that the South African courts should adopt to the three preconditions for a derivative action. Secondly, it is submitted that the real weakness in s 165 lies in the rebuttable presumption in s 165 (7) and (8), which contains a fatal flaw that renders the remedy defective and calls for legislative amendment. Pending such amendment, proposals are suggested for the proper judicial approach in the meantime to the troublesome presumption. These proposals are supported by both reasoned argument and original research on experience in certain foreign jurisdictions, particularly the USA. Thirdly, and equally importantly, a framework is suggested in this thesis for the <b>proper</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> the judicial <b>discretion</b> to make orders of costs, which is known to have plagued minority shareholders wishing to bring derivative proceedings against miscreant directors who have wronged the company...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} of Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic. (1990) 21 FCR 193 {{is the central}} thread of this thesis. Broadly, {{the subject matter of}} this thesis is concerned with those circumstances when an administrative decision-maker does not have the capacity to change the decision. This broad subject matter involves the consideration of two separate questions: (i) whether an administrative decision-maker can, in the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> statutory powers, express or implied, reopen an earlier decision either with or without the request of a person affected by that decision; and (ii) whether or not an administrative decision-maker can be estopped from reopening the earlier decision made in the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> the decision makers statutory, common law or prerogative powers. In responding to these two questions, the writer has dealt with four main issues. First, the writer has considered whether or not an administrative decision-maker may, {{in the absence of an}} express statutory power, reconsider an earlier decision. In response to this question, the writer has developed a set of principles determinative of the circumstances where, in the absence of an express power, a power to reconsider may be implied in the terms of the statute. Secondly, the writer has reviewed what are proffered to be exceptions or qualifications to the general principle that estoppel cannot operate to sanction something otherwise prohibited by statute or prevent, hinder or fetter the <b>proper</b> performance or <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> a statutory power, duty or <b>discretion.</b> <b>Of</b> these exceptions, the writer gives special attention to the sovereign and proprietary distinction and the policy and operational distinction. On the one hand, the sovereign and proprietary distinction purports to allow estoppel to be applied against an administrative decision-maker in the course of making proprietary (or commercial), but not sovereign (or governmental) decisions. On the other hand, the policy and operational distinction purports to allow estoppel to apply, so long as there is no issue of ultra vires or illegality, against an administrative decisionmaker in the course of making an operational decision that gives effect to or implements decisions made in the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> a particular government policy. Following a review of the authorities which have cited, applied, distinguished and rejected the policy and operational distinction, and the sovereign and proprietary distinction, the writer concludes that it is not necessary to characterise the type of decision in question to determine whether estoppel should lie against the government. The general principle that estoppel cannot operate to sanction something otherwise prohibited by statute or prevent, hinder or fetter the <b>proper</b> performance or <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> a statutory power, duty or discretion is sufficient to dispose of any case of estoppel in this particular context. Also, the writer identifies what type of link (direct or remote) between the subject matter <b>of</b> the statutory <b>discretion</b> and the representation or promise is sufficient to demonstrate that the alleged representation would fetter, hinder or prevent the <b>proper</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> a statutory <b>discretion.</b> The writer concludes that the High Court has adopted a broad approach to resolving this question and that it is sufficient to demonstrate that the subject matter of the alleged representation or promise made by the administrative decision-maker falls within the ambit of, is a matter relevant to, or forms part of the chain of events relevant to, the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> the statutory <b>discretion.</b> Last, the writer has considered whether or not estoppel may apply to prevent, hinder or fetter the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> prerogative powers by the government. Laker Airways Ltd v Department of Trade [1977] 1 QB 643 is the only case on this topic. The writer concludes that the view of the court in this case should be accepted, namely, that estoppel should be precluded if the government is exercising its prerogative powers...|$|R
