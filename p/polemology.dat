50|$|After his Abitur in Wiesbaden, Jahn studied history -specialising in East European history - {{political}} science, {{geography and}} educational theory between 1961 and 1969 in Marburg-an-der-Lahn (under amongst others Peter Scheibert, Wolfgang Abendroth, Ernst-Otto Czempiel, Karl Christ, Walter Heinemeyer, Carl Schott, Kurt Scharlau, Leonhard Froese) and briefly also in Berlin and Bratislava. After his state examination in 1968 {{he graduated in}} East European History in 1969 under Peter Scheibert at Marburg-an-der-Lahn.At the beginning of 1968, while still a student in Marburg, he set up the High School Union for Peace and Conflict Research (originally the High School Union for Interdisciplinary <b>Polemology)</b> {{and was one of}} the first members of the Association of Peace and Conflict Research (AFK), which was also founded in 1968. After a brief period in 1969/70 as scientific assistant to Czempiel in Marburg, he went with the latter to Frankfurt am Main and in 1971 became the first research fellow at the Frankfurt Peace Research Institute (PRIF, i. e. Hessische Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung, HSFK). Here from 1974 until the end of 1990, he became the director of the Research Group “Socialist States”. In 1975 he was offered the Professorship in Socio-Economic Structures, Institutions and Foreign Policy of Socialist Countries and then the Professorship of Political Science and Political Sociology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main; and then in 1993 received a further offer, in succession to Hermann Weber, of the Chair of Political Science and Contemporary History at Mannheim University until September 2005. In 1992. while still in Frankfurt he founded the Research Unit for Conflict and Cooperation Structures in Eastern Europe, Southeast Europe and Eurasia (FKKS) called the Mannheim here-named the Research Area for Conflict and Cooperation Structures in Eastern Europe. At the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES), he first headed a department and then later on until 2009 directed the Research Area “New Democracies and Conflict Resolution”. In Mannheim, from May 2004 until the end of 2009, Jahn gave regular series of lectures on “Controversial Political Issues from the perspective of contemporary history” both for students of all disciplines and as a contribution to the political education of senior citizens. Since October 2009 he has continued these series at the Goethe University in Frankfurt.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the methodological {{problems}} and manipulative mechanisms of hybrid warfare. Owing to the polemological (from πολέμιος — war and λόγος — study) approach the authors managed to systematize and summarize the theories of war and peace, clarify contemporary western concepts of warfare, outline the specifi cs of the Russian view on the hybrid war concept, assess the signifi cance of information and manipulation technologies for hybrid wars, analyze a number of geopolitical and socio-cultural dimensions of modern hybrid wars. The <b>polemology</b> is a branch of science, which studies the nature of armed confl icts and wars, their role in time and space, cycles, intensity, scope, scale, and causative relations and their classifi cation. <b>Polemology</b> deals with the wars and armed confl icts of the past, present and future. Novel hybrid wars take a respective place among them. They involve using all available warfare, regular and irregular, cyber and those allowing for the use of weapons of mass destruction, and also information, psychological and propaganda war using the latest information and media technologies. According to the classical approach, the state is the only subject of military actions, but today its role has changed dramatically under the infl uence of other political and economic supranational and trans-border factors. For the purpose of studying wars and armed confl icts from the polemological perspective it means the need to focus on social changes in all the areas of human life, on considering various elements of the political, economic or even technological context, which infl uence the war as a social phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Data {{collection}} {{is a major}} concern in studying violently divided societies. Challenges researchers encounter may dramatically affect reliable contributions to the field of <b>polemology.</b> This paper suggests a practical link between difficulties experienced in data gathering and the theoretical framework such that challenges can become a source of data in their own right; this makes the latter functional {{to a better understanding of}} the former. The research was based on ethnographic field work conducted in Northern Irish Protestant and Catholic enclaves during my doctoral studies. The research examined the long term legacy and perceptions of acts of self-immolation, which involved Republican prisoners who gave or attempted to give their life for a political cause in 1980 - 81. I maintain that what may appear as a socio-methodological problem can be viewed as a helpful component towards clarifying internal dynamics in deeply rooted ethnic conflicts when seen through the lens of participant observation, within ethno-graphically specific boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Conflictology is {{the science}} of conflict, {{including}} concepts such as crisis, change, problems and violence The term was used by J. Galtung and is internationally accepted in Academia, Scientific Societies, universities, the United Nations and at major NGOs as a synonym for conflict resolution. Conflict researchers and theorists such as J. Burton, M. Deustch, K. & E. Boulding, Hobbes, Lederach, Rapoport, Sandole and Marlow, among many others, have contributed to laying the foundations of a body of theory and pragmatic considerations on how to address all types of conflicts. Thousands of books, hundreds of training programmes and dozens of research centres around the world bear witness to a plurality of approaches drawing on philosophy, sociology, political science, psychology, anthropology, and even mathematics, medicine and neuroscience in their studies of the biological bases for human emotions, stress and individual and collective human behaviour. Although humanity’s interest in understanding and containing or channelling its conflicts {{is as old as}} humanity itself, it was only in recent decades that a process was undertaken to gather all such efforts under a single umbrella: conflictology or conflict resolution. In recent decades, peace studies, conflict transformation, conflict management, irenology, <b>polemology,</b> mediation and negotiation have converged in their interest to identify the multiple key factors that cause and give rise to conflicts and violence, as a system to be able to understand them fully and, thus, be able to intervene in a positive, practical and effective way. The aim is to overcome the limitations and contradictions of violent methods for solving conflicts. </p...|$|E
