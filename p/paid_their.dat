5|$|Controversy {{had arisen}} before the Giro {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that many of 's sponsors in Kazakhstan had not <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> full obligations to the team, and that the riders had therefore not been <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> full salaries to that point in the season. In protest, the team wore new jerseys beginning with this stage, that had the names of those underpaying sponsors faded out {{to the point of being}} unreadable.|$|E

5|$|A {{more modern}} and {{convenient}} competing bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858, and usage of Battersea Bridge fell sharply. There were serious public {{concerns about the}} safety of the bridge by this time, after an 1844 incident in which a woman was murdered on the bridge in view of one of the toll collectors, who did not intervene because both parties had <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> fares.|$|E
5|$|After the eulogies, {{the three}} {{speakers}} each laid a wreath at the casket, and the Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Barry Black, gave the benediction. Cheney escorted Nancy Reagan to the casket, where {{she said her}} goodbyes. The dignitaries in the room <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> respects during the next half-hour. In a rare instance, {{the doors of the}} Capitol were then opened to the public, who stood in lines stretching many blocks to view the casket.|$|E
5|$|Arnost Rosin (prisoner no. 29858) and Czesław Mordowicz (prisoner no. 84216) {{escaped from}} Auschwitz on 27 May 1944 and arrived in Slovakia on 6 June, {{the day of}} the Normandy landings. Hearing about the {{invasion}} of Normandy and believing the war was over, they got drunk to celebrate, using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> fines.|$|E

5|$|During {{the postwar}} era, Indiana became a {{critical}} swing state that often helped decide which party controlled the presidency. Elections were very close, {{and became the}} center of frenzied attention with many parades, speeches and rallies as election day approached; voter turnout ranging over 90% to near 100% in such elections as 1888 and 1896. In remote areas, both sides <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> supporters to vote, and occasionally paid supporters of the opposition not to vote. Despite allegations, historians have found very little fraud in national elections.|$|E
5|$|His {{administrative}} skills led Stalin to take Kosygin {{under his}} wing. Stalin shared information with Kosygin, {{such as how}} much money the families of Vyacheslav Molotov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Lazar Kaganovich possessed, spent and <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> staff. A Politburo member earned a modest salary by Soviet standards but enjoyed unlimited access to consumer goods.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{beginning}} of the Giro d'Italia, it was reported that many of the team's sponsors in Kazakhstan had not <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> full obligations to the team, and that most of the riders had been underpaid to that point in the season as a result. One sponsor, the Kazkhstani state carrier Air Astana, dropped its sponsorship entirely. There was concern that the team itself may fold, as UCI ProTour teams must meet certain financial parameters to stay active, or risk losing their UCI license.|$|E

5|$|The {{general public}} stood in long lines {{waiting for a}} turn {{to pay their respects}} to the president. People passed by the casket {{at a rate of about}} 5,000 per hour (83.3 per minute resp. 1.4 per second) and the wait time for some {{exceeded}} seven hours. In all, 104,684 <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> respects when Reagan lay in state. The Washington Metro subway set a then daily record in ridership of 850,636 as a result.|$|E
5|$|A {{funeral was}} held on March 11, at the Montreal Forum, the arena where the Canadiens played. Fans were allowed to file past the casket, laid at center ice, and 50,000 people <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> respects. A {{rotating}} guard of honour of four Canadiens stood around the casket which was covered in flowers including a large wreath from Aurèle Joliat that was shaped like the number 7, Morenz's number, and a note from Morenz's three children. The entire service was broadcast on the radio, and after its conclusion he was buried in Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Catch a Fire is a 1973 album by Bob Marley and the Wailers. It {{was their}} first album {{released}} by Island Records. After touring and recording in the United Kingdom with Johnny Nash, Nash's departure to the United States left the band without enough money to return home; they approached producer Chris Blackwell, who agreed to advance the Wailers money for an album and <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> fares back to Jamaica, where they recorded Catch a Fire. The album features nine songs, two of which were written and composed by Peter Tosh and the remaining seven of which were written and composed by Bob Marley. After Marley's return to London to present the tapes to Blackwell, the producer reworked the tracks with contributions by Muscle Shoals session musician Wayne Perkins, who played guitar on two overdubbed tracks.|$|E

5|$|During the 13th century, {{agricultural}} land {{around the town}} was acquired by Fountains and Furness Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its sheep farming, and in 1208 bought large tracts of land from Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold Derwent Island in Derwentwater, land at Watendlath, the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in Borrowdale. Keswick was at {{the hub of the}} monastic farms in the area, and Fountains based a steward in the town, where tenants <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> rents. Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's funeral train left Long Branch on {{the same}} special track that brought him there, {{traveling}} over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body lay in state in Washington; later, on September 25, 1881, in Cleveland, more than 150,000—a number equal to {{the entire population of}} that city—likewise <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> respects. His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 4 August 1914, {{and as part of}} the British Empire, Southern Rhodesia was also now at war. The British South Africa Company (which then administered the territory) took no steps to aid recruiting for the forces, so many men <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> own fares to England to join up. A number of eligible recruits could not afford to go, so Guest, together with Captain Alwyn Knowles of the Bedfordshire Regiment, who as a reserve officer was awaiting his call-up, organised a private fund to pay their passages. When the recruits arrived in England they were enlisted by Captain (later Colonel) John Banks Brady (who was in 1934 to be elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly as member for Bulawayo North) to form a Rhodesian platoon in the King's Royal Rifle Corps.|$|E

5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{volatile}} issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers <b>paid</b> <b>their</b> government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
