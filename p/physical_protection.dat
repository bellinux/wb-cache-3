5|$|In many bacteria, an S-layer of rigidly arrayed protein {{molecules}} {{covers the}} outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>protection</b> for the cell surface and can act as a macromolecular diffusion barrier. S-layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions, but are known to act as virulence factors in Campylobacter and contain surface enzymes in Bacillus stearothermophilus.|$|E
5|$|Most archaea (but not Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma) {{possess a}} cell wall. In most archaea {{the wall is}} {{assembled}} from surface-layer proteins, which form an S-layer. An S-layer is a rigid array of protein molecules that cover {{the outside of the}} cell (like chain mail). This layer provides both chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>protection,</b> and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, archaea lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Methanobacteriales do have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan, which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks D-amino acids and N-acetylmuramic acid.|$|E

25|$|Procuring {{can often}} take abusive forms. Pimps may punish clients for {{physical}} abuse or failure to pay, and enforce {{exclusive rights to}} 'turf' where their prostitutes may advertise and operate with less competition. In the many places where prostitution is outlawed, sex workers have decreased incentive to report abuse for fear of self-incrimination, and increased motivation to seek any <b>physical</b> <b>protection</b> from clients and law enforcement that a pimp might provide.|$|E
25|$|For example, fish derive mainly passive {{benefits}} from forming social groups, including <b>physical</b> <b>protection</b> from predators and better detection {{of food and}} danger from the combined awareness of many group members; these ecological benefits increase {{with the size of}} the group. Burgess' measurements showed how fish simultaneously monitor the position and activity of many speciesmates simultaneously to create large, geometric group patterns.

25|$|Procuring or pandering is the {{facilitation}} or {{provision of}} a prostitute or sex {{worker in the}} arrangement of a sex act with a customer. A procurer, colloquially called a pimp (if male) or a madam (if female), is an agent for prostitutes who collects part of their earnings. The procurer may receive this money in return for advertising services, <b>physical</b> <b>protection,</b> or for providing, and possibly monopolizing, a location where the prostitute may engage clients. Like prostitution, the legality of certain actions of a madam or a pimp vary from one region to the next.|$|E
50|$|Abuses are aggravated and perpetuated law {{enforcement}} practice, and laws that government discrimination against women. MIMDES and NGOs stated that many domestic abuse cases went unreported. NGO sources {{stated that the}} majority of reported cases did not result in formal charges because of fear of retaliation or because of the expense of filing a complaint. The legal and <b>physical</b> <b>protections</b> offered were limited because of legal delays, ambiguities in the law, and the lack of shelters for victims. According to a study done in Lima, Peru in 2007, abused women have a 1.63-fold increased risk for unintended pregnancy. Additionally, women who have experienced both physical and sexual abuse are 3.31 fold more likely to get unintentionally pregnant.|$|R

25|$|In 1980, Prime Minister Olof Palme {{established}} the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues, {{also known as}} the Palme Commission. The Commission favored the demilitarization of space, the elimination of chemical arms from Europe, and the reduction of conventional weapons. The commission also advocated negotiations in Europe to reduce political tensions among the states and political actors that could have a potential for military conflict. In the early 1980s, Sweden was one of 58 nations signatory to the Convention on the <b>Physical</b> <b>Protection</b> of Nuclear Material. In compliance with the Convention, Sweden adopted the Nuclear Activities Act and the Nuclear Activities Ordinance in 1984. The Acts were designed to prevent unlawful dealings with nuclear material and thereby ensure the safety of nuclear activities.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella (นพปฎลมหาเศวตฉัตร) is {{considered}} the most sacred and ancient of the royal regalia. The umbrella (also called a chatra) consists of many tiers, five for the crown prince (or the viceroy), seven for an unconsecrated king, and nine for a fully sovereign king. The shades are made of white silk trimmed with gold, attached to a gilded golden stem. The umbrellas are usually displayed above an important throne in the royal palace (similar to a baldachin). The umbrellas themselves are considered sacred objects and receive offerings from the king {{on the anniversary of}} his coronation day. There are currently seven such umbrellas, with six distributed at the various throne halls in the Grand Palace, and one in the Dusit Palace. Derived from ancient Hindu beliefs, the umbrella symbolises the spiritual and <b>physical</b> <b>protection</b> the king can give to his subjects. The multiple tiers symbolise the accumulation of honour and merit the king may possess.|$|E

50|$|Those labeled infames (singular infamis) were {{liable to}} {{corporal}} punishment, {{usually reserved for}} slaves. Under the Republic and early Empire, {{one of the ways}} in which the citizen's liberty was defined was through the freedom of his body from physical coercion or punishment such as flogging by authorities. Citizens who chose to become public performers, however, and to use their bodies to offer public pleasure, were excluded from these <b>physical</b> <b>protections,</b> and could be beaten or otherwise subjected to violence. Any free man who became a gladiator took an oath to suffer branding, bondage, and beating, as well as potential death by the sword. Both glamorized and despised, the gladiator was supposed to exert a compelling sexual allure over women.|$|R
500|$|There {{are several}} {{separate}} reasons why animals have evolved colours. Camouflage enables an animal to remain hidden from view. Animals use colour to advertise {{services such as}} cleaning to animals of other species; to signal their sexual status to {{other members of the}} same species; and in mimicry, taking advantage of the warning coloration of another species. Some animals use flashes of colour to divert attacks by startling predators. Zebras may possibly use motion dazzle, confusing a predator's attack by moving a bold pattern rapidly. Some animals are coloured for <b>physical</b> <b>protection,</b> with pigments in the skin to protect against sunburn, while some frogs can lighten or darken their skin for temperature regulation. Finally, animals can be coloured incidentally. For example, blood is red because the haem pigment needed to carry oxygen is red. Animals [...] coloured in these ways can have striking natural patterns.|$|E
500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] Umpire Ellison started the race at 1:45p.m, with a strong wind blowing against the tide, {{creating}} [...] "sizeable waves". [...] Oxford had already taken on board a considerable amount of water from their row to the stakeboats and had opted for less <b>physical</b> <b>protection</b> against the inclement conditions than their opponents. [...] Both crews started at a relatively low stroke rate to cater for the conditions, with Cambridge moderately out-rating their opponents. [...] The Light Blues took an early lead and appeared to be coping with the conditions better than Oxford, and were over a length ahead by the time they passed the London Rowing Club boathouse. [...] The Dark Blues shipped more water until they became entirely submerged, and were rescued by spectators on the Oxford launch Niceia. [...] Cambridge continued, and headed for the relative protection of the Surrey shore but were caught by the umpire's boat and informed that the race was void.|$|E
