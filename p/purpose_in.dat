The initial <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> having medals struck was not principally to provide keepsakes to the assay commissioners, but to advertise the Mint's medal-striking capabilities. The nascent custom lapsed when Snowden left office in 1861.|$|E

A nun suggests that Gelsomina's <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life is comparable to her own. But, when Gelsomina offers Zampanò marriage, he brushes her off.|$|E

Not only had they liberated a substantial territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, but they encouraged rebellion all over the country.

They planned several large-scale operations for this <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> which air support played a very important role.|$|E

5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular <b>purpose.</b> <b>In</b> {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor.

The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

5|$|A near-contemporary {{account of}} Æthelwig's life, or Vita, is {{included}} in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey. This was a 13th-century work by Thomas of Marlborough, which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In order to do this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on Æthelwig. However, because of Thomas' <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> composing the Chronicon, he probably altered some of the texts he included, and it appears that the life of Æthelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that composit work was adapted by Thomas into his Chronicon. The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the Æthelwig material is stylistic uniform with other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.|$|E

In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E
