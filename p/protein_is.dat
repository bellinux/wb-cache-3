5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the <b>protein</b> <b>is</b> shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or <b>protein</b> <b>is</b> called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of <b>protein</b> <b>is</b> a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E

5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core <b>protein</b> <b>is</b> coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core <b>protein</b> <b>is</b> produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{huntingtin}} protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have multiple biological functions.

Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function. DNA methylation also appears to be changed in HD.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated <b>protein</b> <b>is</b> targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed. Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting <b>protein)</b> <b>is</b> itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E
5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding <b>protein</b> <b>is</b> haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes {{are part}} of a major {{mechanism}} by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. Once a <b>protein</b> <b>is</b> tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.|$|E
