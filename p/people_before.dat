5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured <b>people</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
5|$|British troops {{proceeded}} {{to occupy the}} various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the Native Americans, the British post-war approach was essentially to treat the Native Americans as a conquered <b>people.</b> <b>Before</b> long, Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.|$|E

5|$|Key figures {{mentioned}} in inscriptions {{from rural areas}} were the Gavundas (officials) or Goudas. The Gavundas belonged to two levels of economic strata, the Praja Gavunda (people's Gavunda) and the Prabhu Gavunda (lord of Gavundas). They served the dual purpose of representing the <b>people</b> <b>before</b> the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias. They are {{mentioned in}} inscriptions related to land transactions, irrigation maintenance, village tax collection and village council duties.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 <b>people</b> <b>before</b> turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} Sotelo, a {{prominent}} member of Parliament, with {{involvement of the}} police, aroused suspicions and strong reactions among the government's opponents on the right. Massive reprisals followed. Although the conservative Nationalist generals were already in advanced stages of a planned uprising, the event provided a catalyst and convenient public justification for their coup, and in particular that Spain {{would have to be}} saved from anarchy by military rather than democratic means. The Socialists and Communists (led by Prieto) demanded that arms be distributed to the <b>people</b> <b>before</b> the military took over. The Prime Minister was hesitant.|$|E

5|$|Thus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his {{relation}} to King Eric {{seem to have}} emerged in the historical record {{at the same time}} in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption, that Henry's cult had developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary <b>people</b> <b>before</b> official adoption. Although Nousiainen had Henry as its patronus, that is first mentioned only in 1452. Still in 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated to the Virgin Mary only.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled <b>people</b> <b>before</b> the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers {{of people in the}} gas vans and the special gas chambers used in the death camps such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carmen was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. A destructive and widespread storm, Carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that emerged from Africa {{toward the end of}} August. The disturbance traveled westward, spawning a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August29. The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea, and in an environment conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Carmen moved ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula, where, despite striking a sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several <b>people.</b> <b>Before</b> the storm's arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the {{original}} film, a student short film serving as an unauthorized sequel was made by amateur filmmaker Don Glut, after he discovered the Sun Demon mask in Bob Burns' collection. Filmed in black and white with a running time of three-and-a-half minutes, Wrath of the Sun Demon starred Burns as the Sun Demon. The short film was made {{with the support of the}} University of Southern California, where Glut was a student at the time. The plot centered on a man (presumably McKenna) transforming into the Sun Demon and terrorizing several <b>people</b> <b>before</b> falling to his death off a cliff. The film also starred John Schuyler as the film's hero and Burns' wife Kathy.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, PD {{affected}} 6.2 {{million people}} and resulted in about 117,400 deaths globally. Parkinson's disease typically occurs in people {{over the age of}} 60, of which about one percent are affected. Males are more often affected than females. When it is seen in <b>people</b> <b>before</b> the age of 50, it is called young-onset PD. The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years. The disease is named after the English doctor James Parkinson, who published the first detailed description in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, in 1817. Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson's Day (on the birthday of James Parkinson, 11 April) and the use of a red tulip as the symbol of the disease. People with parkinsonism who have increased the public's awareness of the condition include actor Michael J. Fox, Olympic cyclist Davis Phinney, and late professional boxer Muhammad Ali.|$|E
5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen <b>people</b> <b>before</b> meeting their own death.|$|E

50|$|In {{traditional}} Germanic law, {{the law of}} Germanic <b>peoples</b> (<b>before</b> {{the widespread}} adoption of Roman canon law) accepted that the clan of a criminal was liable for offenses committed by one of its members.

5|$|The {{game was}} delayed {{numerous}} times before its actual release. Work {{on the game}} was extended because the development staff wanted to perfect the game due to high expectations from the fans and because the team only consisted of about 35 <b>people.</b> <b>Before</b> its release, it was ranked as the most wanted game in Japan and Square, knowing about Dragon Quest VII's release, moved Final Fantasy IX {{to come out on}} a later date. Horii stated in an interview that the team focused more on puzzle solving than the game's story. Being the first game in the series to include 3D graphics, the team was also initially reluctant to include CG movies and cinematics due to letters written to Enix by fans fearing that doing so would change the overall feeling of the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{living and}} {{economic}} activity structures were either distributed randomly or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot. The larger settlements {{could have had}} over a dozen homesteads and be occupied by 50 to 80 residents, but more typically there were just several homes {{with no more than}} 30 inhabitants. From the 7th century on, the previously common semi-subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings wholly above the surface, but still consisted of just one room. Pits were dug for storage and other uses. As the Germanic <b>people</b> <b>before</b> them, the Slavs left vacant regions between developed areas for separation from strangers and to avoid conflicts, especially along the limits of their tribal territories.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{reported}} attendance figures for Bound for Glory IV, {{with the initial}} attendance figure being 5,000 <b>people</b> <b>before</b> being retracted and updated {{to a total of}} 5,500 people by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. This was lower than the maximum seating capacity available at the Sears Centre of between 11,000 and 11,800 people for festival style events. However, the Bound for Glory IV setup caused the event to only hold a maximum capacity of 8,000 people. Of the 5,500 that attended the show, only 4,500 of them were paid tickets. Despite this, it was seen as one of the largest paid crowds in the company's history {{and one of the most}} responsive crowds the company has had as well. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that 35,000 people bought the event.|$|E
