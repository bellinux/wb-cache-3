40|$|The {{fat body}} cells of Pachycondyla (=Neoponera) villosa are {{disposed}} {{in a single}} layer between the cuticle and the digestive tract, forming a group of cells enclosed by a thin membrane. Histological studies have revealed three different cellular types: trophocyte (more abundant), urate, (located among the trophocytes), and oenocyte (the scarcest), usually observed laying near the cuticle. Histochemically, the trophocytes showed a <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> for basic proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm, as well as a strong <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> in the cytoplasmic granules. The test for carbohydrates showed a strong <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> throughout the cytoplasm, while the test for lipids was positive for the cytoplasmic vesicles. The urate cells showed a <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> for basic proteins in the nucleus and in the areas of the cytoplasm surrounding the vesicles. These cells did not react to the PAS test or to Sudan Black B. The oenocytes showed a weak <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> to PAS and a strong <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> to Sudan Black B and Mercuric-bromophenol Blue...|$|R

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

40|$|The {{localization}} of S- 100 protein, {{a nervous}} system specific protein, was studied immunohistochemically in sections of normal human brain and various brain tumors. In human brain, the specific <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> for S- 100 protein {{was observed in}} astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells and epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. In human brain tumors, a <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> was observed in all cases of astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, ependymoma, choroidplexus papilloma, neurinoma and teratoma examined. A <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> was also observed in some cases of meningioma and hemangioblastoma. In astrocytoma and glioblastoma, the <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> for S- 100 proten was weak in intensity and heterogeneous throughout the section {{in accordance with the}} increased histopathological malignancy. All metastatic brain tumors were negative for S- 100 protein. From this immunohistochemical evidence it is concluded that the immunohistochemical examination of S- 100 protein in human brain tumors may become a useful method for the diagnosis of human brain tumors, especially in relation to the histogenesis and degree of malignancy...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and development of}} Taxol-like vesicles in callus cells of Kyaraboku (Taxus cuspidata var. nana.) were investigated using histochemical and quantitative methods. Many transparent vesicles revealed in the young and mature normal callus cells. The vesicles treated thoroughly with Taxol detection chemicals and immunoassay system. In case of Vanillin-sulfuric acid reagent, several big and small vesicles showed intense <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> and were stained brown and yellow ocher.
