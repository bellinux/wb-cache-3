At the same time, travel time was reduced by 20 minutes, as the trains stopped at only three intermediate stations. Linx operated with different prices on the same route, depending on if the ticket was bought in Norway or Sweden. The company stated that this was in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of a strong Norwegian krone, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> Norwegians were willing to pay more, and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the sales system in Sweden was more automated.|$|E

5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} minicomputer at the station. NDRE argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk by buying the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new minicomputer, SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E

5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who was seeking re-election for the sixth time. Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year– in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole, and in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> this was Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which the senator's reputation for character had suffered. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. In addition to his leave from Bain Capital, Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.|$|E

5|$|However, the toad was {{generally}} unsuccessful {{in reducing the}} targeted grey-backed cane beetles (Dermolepida albohirtum), in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the cane fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day, in <b>part</b> <b>because</b> the beetles live at the tops of sugar cane – and cane toads are not good climbers. Since its original introduction, the cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian biodiversity. The population {{of a number of}} native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the varanid lizards Varanus mertensi, V. mitchelli, and V. panoptes, the land snakes Pseudechis australis and Acanthophis antarcticus, and the crocodile species Crocodylus johnstoni; in contrast, the population of the agamid lizard Amphibolurus gilbertiknown to be a prey item of V. panopteshas increased.|$|E

5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books.

Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
