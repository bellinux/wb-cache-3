40|$|Although {{studies have}} {{reported}} a linkage between young pregnancy and child maltreatment risk, it is still unclear about what factors place young mothers {{at greater risk of}} maltreating their child in Chinese context. Based on the socio-ecological model, risk factors in 4 domains: family background/structure, maternal stressors, mother-child interaction, and child behavioral issue in relation to <b>physical</b> assault, <b>neglect,</b> both <b>physical</b> assault and <b>neglect,</b> and either <b>physical</b> assault or <b>neglect</b> among Chinese young mothers in Hong Kong were assessed. 392 young mothers were recruited from an integrated supportive program for young mothers. The mean age of mothers at delivery was 21. 8 (SD =  3. 0) and 52. 3 % were married. Individual risk factors and cumulative risk domains related to different child maltreatment groups were examined. Our results show both overlapping and unique risk factors across the domains associated with <b>physical</b> assault and <b>neglect.</b> Further, young families exposed to higher number of risk domains show higher rates for <b>physical</b> assault and <b>neglect,</b> co-occurrence of <b>physical</b> assault and <b>neglect,</b> and either form of maltreatment. In addition, various risk domains were found to be particularly important for different forms of maltreatment: family background/structure domain was found to be an important risk domain for neglect; mother-child interaction domain for both physical assault and neglect; family background/structure and maternal stressors domains for either <b>physical</b> assault or <b>neglect.</b> Closer examination of a subgroup of adolescent mothers aged 18 and below shows that family background/structure was an important risk domain for this group.

50|$|At the social/economic level, the {{association}} between poverty and neglect has frequently been made. A study of the maltreatment of children by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children supports {{the association}} between neglect and lower socio-economic class. US {{studies have shown that}} less affluent families {{are more likely to be}} found to maltreat their children, particularly in the form of neglect and physical abuse, than affluent families. Some argue that many forms of <b>physical</b> <b>neglect,</b> such as inadequate clothing, exposure to environmental hazards and poor hygiene may be directly attributed to poverty whereas others are more cautious in making a direct link. Studies have shown that parents in a low socioeconomic level are less likely to purchase resources needed for their children, which makes them experience school failure at a more frequent level. While poverty is believed to increase the likelihood of neglect, poverty does not predetermine neglect. Many low-income families are not neglectful but provide loving homes for their children. However, when poverty coexists with other forms of adversity, it can negatively impact parent's ability to cope with stressors and undermine their capacity to adequately respond to their child's needs. It can also mean that parents who want to work are faced with the choice between being unemployed and leaving their children at home. McSherry argues that the relationship between child neglect and poverty should be seen as circular and interdependent. Where caregiver alcohol abuse is identified, children are significantly more likely to experience multiple incidents of neglect compared with children where this is not identified, as were children where other family risk factors (including markers of socioeconomic disadvantage) are found.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S. W.) 				 California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Anh-Luu Huynh-Hohnbaum, Valentine M. Villa, Dale WeaverAcademic Achievement, Child Maltreatment, <b>Neglect,</b> <b>Physical</b> Abuse, Sexual Abuse, Young AdultsOne of the {{consequences}} of child maltreatment is the lower level of academic achievement found within maltreated youth. The literature focuses on predictors of poor academic achievement. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine if one type of child maltreatment (<b>neglect,</b> <b>physical</b> abuse, and sexual abuse) had a greater impact on academic achievement using the secondary publically available Add Health data. For every increase in neglect and sexual abuse, academic achievement decreased. Mistreatment through physical abuse is not related to achieving less academically over time. This study discovered that sexual abuse led to poorer academic outcomes by young adulthood in comparison to <b>physical</b> abuse and <b>neglect.</b> This research study suggests implications for child welfare policy and practice. Child welfare workers and policy makers need to be mindful of the other dangers that threaten children's well-being and that early victimization experiences do impact academic achievement over time...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 This study {{examined}} the association between poverty and child neglect. The existence of a general association has been established for some time. However, there is much debate, and little detailed research, on the specific processes that create this association. This study focused on the form of neglect that involves the most health risk for children—physical neglect. It was hypothesized that poverty should {{increase the likelihood of}} a specific type of <b>physical</b> <b>neglect,</b> neglect of safety and basic needs, occurring more than other types. Using official child protective services data from a national data set three types of <b>physical</b> <b>neglect</b> were examined: abandonment, lack of safety or basic needs, and inadequate supervision. Hypothesis 1 was that poverty increases the odds of safety/basic needs neglect more than it influences the odds of either abandonment neglect or inadequate supervision neglect, controlling for prior neglect. Hypothesis 2 focused on a test of whether the link between poverty and <b>physical</b> <b>neglect</b> is not direct, but is instead mediated by caregiver stress. Three waves of longitudinal data were used for this test to establish causal time order between poverty and stress, and between stress and <b>physical</b> <b>neglect.</b> This study analyzed data from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN), Assessments 0 - 3 from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect at Cornell University. The data was analyzed using multinominal logistic regression for both models. The results did not confirm Hypothesis 1, though the analysis was limited somewhat due to low frequencies of some <b>physical</b> <b>neglect</b> types in certain age groups. Hypothesis 2 was confirmed showing that the effect of poverty on <b>physical</b> <b>neglect</b> was completely mediated by caregiver stress for the abandonment and safety/basic needs types of <b>physical</b> <b>neglect.</b> Implications of the results for research on the effects of poverty on child neglect, and for preventing child neglect are discussed...|$|E
30|$|The ACEs of the {{participants}} were assessed using two validated measures. First, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 1997) was used, which includes five subscales: <b>physical</b> <b>neglect,</b> emotional neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse before they were 18, and has good convergent and discriminant validity (Bernstein et al., 1997). The following scores represent the condition under which the traumatic experience of a participant was given a score of 1 (each component had to be within the range specified below): emotional neglect ≥[*] 15 points, or <b>physical</b> <b>neglect</b> ≥[*] 10 points, or sexual abuse ≥[*] 8 points, or physical abuse ≥[*] 10 points, or emotional abuse ≥[*] 13 points.|$|E
40|$|Purpose The aim of {{the current}} {{meta-analysis}} was to provide {{an estimate of the}} prevalence of physical and emotional neglect by integrating prevalence figures from the body of research reporting on neglect. An attempt was also made to unravel the substantial variation in prevalence figures reported in primary studies by analyzing the effects of procedural factors and sample characteristics on com-bined prevalence rates. Methods Studies providing prevalence rates of child neglect were searched using electronic databases, exploring specialized journals, and by searching references of pub-lications for other relevant studies. Data were extracted using a coding system. Intercoder reliability was satisfac-tory. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted. Results Child <b>physical</b> <b>neglect</b> prevalence rates were found for 13 independent samples with a total of 59, 406 participants, and child emotional neglect prevalence rates were found for 16 independent samples with a total of 59, 655 participants. The overall estimated prevalence was 163 / 1, 000 for <b>physical</b> <b>neglect,</b> and 184 / 1, 000 for emo-tional neglect, with no apparent gender differences. The influence of research design factors on the prevalence of <b>physical</b> <b>neglect</b> was more pronounced than on the preva-lence of emotional neglect. Studies on <b>physical</b> <b>neglect</b> in ‘low-resource ’ countries were conspicuously absent. Conclusions Child neglect is a problem of considerable extent, but seems to be a neglected type of maltreatment in scientific research. This is illustrated by the deplorable dearth of studies on child neglect, especially in low-resource countries. Recommendations for the design of future prevalence studies are proposed...|$|E
