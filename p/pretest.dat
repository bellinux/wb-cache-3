25|$|In general, {{the imaging}} {{technique}} chosen {{is based on}} the <b>pretest</b> likelihood of the diagnosis, availability of the testing modality, patient stability, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test.|$|E
25|$|The above {{methods are}} {{inappropriate}} to use if the <b>pretest</b> probability {{differs from the}} prevalence in the reference group used to establish, among others, the positive predictive value of the test. Such difference can occur if another test preceded, or the person involved in the diagnostics considers that another <b>pretest</b> probability must be used because of knowledge of, for example, specific complaints, other elements of a medical history, signs in a physical examination, either by calculating on each finding as a test in itself with its own sensitivity and specificity, or at least making a rough estimation of the individual pre-test probability.|$|E
25|$|Pre-test {{probability}} and post-test probability (alternatively spelled <b>pretest</b> {{and posttest}} probability) are the probabilities {{of the presence}} of a condition (such as a disease) before and after a diagnostic test, respectively. Post-test probability, in turn, can be positive or negative, depending on whether the test falls out as a positive test or a negative test, respectively. In some cases, it is used for the probability of developing the condition of interest in the future.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of questionnaires, surveys and psychometric scales is an iterative research process {{that includes a}} number of carefully planned stages. <b>Pretesting</b> is a method of checking that questions work as intended and are understood by those individuals {{who are likely to}} respond to them. However, detailed reports of appropriate methods to undertake <b>pretesting</b> are currently underrepresented within the literature. This study presents a detailed protocol of a cognitive interview <b>pretesting</b> approach that informed the {{development of}} the Exercise Referral Quality of Life Scale – a measure of life-quality designed specifically for structured clinical exercise settings. This documented approach to <b>pretesting</b> proved a vital stage in the scale development process, without which the item problems detected would have carried forward into the statistical analyses.

40|$|One of the least-managed {{aspects of}} {{advertising}} management {{may well be}} that of effectiveness measurement. The problem of obtaining satisfactory indications of advertising effectiveness is particularly critical in <b>pretesting</b> since the rationale for <b>pretesting</b> is to evaluate advertisements before their release for broadscale media distribution. Therefore, {{the primary purpose of the}} research reported here is to provide empirical evidence of the value of multidimensional scaling methods to <b>pretesting</b> advertising. The article demonstrates how nonmetric methodology obviates the disadvantages of such methods as consumer jury tests and rating scales. A secondary purpose of the research project is to demonstrate the value of <b>pretesting</b> itself by comparing the perceptions of target market consumers with those of selected group of advertising professionals. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} exclude random factors from the experiment, several {{measures}} {{were conducted to}} minimize unintentional and external influences. First, student’s prior level of English learning achievement was measured as the average score of three <b>pretests,</b> while the interval of these <b>pretests</b> was 1 month. In the <b>pretests,</b> students had no idea about the eSchoolbag, and the eSchoolbag haven’t {{been used in the}} classroom practice. In doing so, a relatively correct estimate of students’ prior English-learning levels were acquired. Second, this study was designed as a longitudinal research that involves repeated observations of students’ learning outcomes to ensure that the differences observed were more accurate. Third, similar with the design of the <b>pretests,</b> students’ learning achievement were tested for three times with an interval of 1 month after using eSchoolbag for 9  months. Last, it’s important to mention that the English exams taken in the <b>pretests</b> and posttests were designed by school English-teaching teams as standardized tests, whose validity can be verified to some extent.|$|R

6000|$|The Declaration ends, as I {{have before}} quoted it, with a solemn {{voluntary}} pledge, the most full {{and the most}} solemn that ever was given, of our resolution (if {{so it may be}} called) to enter again into the very same course. It requires nothing more of the Regicides than to famish some sort of excuse, some sort of colorable <b>pretest,</b> for our renewing the supplications of innocence at the feet of guilt. It leaves the moment of negotiation, a most important moment, to the choice of the enemy. He is to regulate it according to the convenience of his affairs. He is to bring it forward at that time when it may best serve to establish his authority at home and to extend his power abroad, A dangerous assurance for this nation to give, whether it is broken or whether it is kept. As all treaty was broken off, and broken off in the manner we have seen, the field of future conduct ought to be reserved free and unincumbered to our future discretion. As to the sort of condition prefixed to the pledge, namely, [...] "that the enemy should be disposed to enter into the work of general pacification with the spirit of reconciliation and equity," [...] this phraseology cannot possibly be considered otherwise than as so many words thrown in to fill the sentence and to round it to the ear. We prefixed the same plausible conditions to any renewal of the negotiation, in our manifesto on the rejection of our proposals at Basle. We did not consider those conditions as binding. We opened a much more serious negotiation without any sort of regard to them; and there is no new negotiation which we can possibly open upon fewer indications of conciliation and equity than were to be discovered when we entered into our last at Paris. Any of the slightest pretences, any of the most loose, formal, equivocating expressions, would justify us, under the peroration of this piece, in again sending the last or some other Lord Malmesbury to Paris.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the one-week bonding effectiveness of nine contemporary composite cements used to lute ceramic to dentin and to determine an appropriate processing method for <b>pretesting</b> failures. The microtensile bond strengths (microTBS) of different luting agents including five self-adhesive cements (Unicem, 3 M ESPE; Maxcem, Kerr; Monocem, Shofu; G-Cem, GC; and Multilink Sprint, Ivoclar-Vivadent), two self-etch cements (Panavia F 2. 0 and Clearfil Esthetic Cement, Kuraray), and two etch-and-rinse cements (Calibra, Dentsply, and Variolink II, Ivoclar-Vivadent) were measured using a standardized protocol. As control, a two-step self-etch adhesive combined with a restorative composite (Clearfil SE+Clearfil APX, Kuraray) were included as luting material. Depending on the processing of the <b>pretesting</b> failures, two groups of cements could be distinguished: (1) those with low bond strength and many <b>pretesting</b> failures and (2) those with relatively high bond strength and few <b>pretesting</b> failures. Nevertheless, the control luting procedure involving a self-etch adhesive combined with a restorative composite presented with a significantly higher microTBS. The microTBS was clearly product-dependent rather than being dependent on the actual adhesive approach. Fracture analysis indicated that failure usually occurred at the dentin-cement interface especially for the cements with low bond strength and many <b>pretesting</b> failures. Depending on the cement system, an adequate immediate ceramic-to-dentin bond strength can be obtained, even with self-adhesive cements that do not use a separate dental adhesive. Yet, the self-etch adhesive Clearfil SE combined with the restorative composite revealed a superior bonding performance and should therefore be preferred in clinical situations where the restoration transmits light sufficiently. status: publishe...|$|R
