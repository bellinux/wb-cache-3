5|$|On 24 May 2017, Pogba {{scored in}} the 18th minute of the Europa League final against Dutch club AFC Ajax, which <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> game-winning goal as Manchester United {{defeated}} Ajax 2–0 to win United's first continental trophy in nine years.|$|E

5|$|A Jo Tessem {{equaliser}} for Southampton {{earned the}} visitors a point against Arsenal on 2 February 2002; in hindsight this <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{last time they}} dropped points in the league season. Wiltord scored the winning goal against Everton and Arsenal moved back to second place, which was obtained by Liverpool, following a 4–1 win at home to Fulham.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} an hour, Gemmell {{finally managed to}} equalise for Celtic when Craig passed {{to him from the}} right wing and he scored with a {{powerful}} 25 yard shot. The balance of play remained the same with Inter defending deeply against sustained Celtic attacking. With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti. This <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a layer of iridium 60nm thick. Iridium <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E

5|$|Anti-slavery campaigners, {{inspired}} by Non-conformist preachers such as John Wesley, started {{some of the}} earliest campaigns against the practice. Prominent local opponents of both the trade and the institution of slavery itself included Anne Yearsley, Hannah More, Harry Gandey, Mary Carpenter, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. The campaign itself <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> beginning of movements for reform and women's emancipation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Kaloyan's death, Strez was in the capital Tarnovo, perhaps seeking to {{capitalize}} on his ancestral rights to the Bulgarian crown. However, Boril <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> more ambitious candidate. Boril persecuted the other candidates for the throne, and Alexius Slav, along with Ivan Asen's sons Ivan Asen II had to leave Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Heikkinen's {{interception}} of {{a forward}} pass <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> key break in a 70 win over Penn. He also blocked kicks for points after touchdown in one-point wins over Illinois (76) and Chicago (1312). Without Heikkinen’s big plays against Penn, Illinois and Chicago, the Wolverines {{likely would have}} been 152 instead of 44. Even in a 210 loss to Ohio State, Heikkinen blocked two kicks.|$|E

5|$|Horsfield {{enjoyed a}} good start to 2005–06, signing a new two-year {{contract}} and scoring twice in each of Albion's first two home games, but these <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last goals he would score for the club. He made a total of 20 appearances in league and cup during his final season at West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|However, {{towards the}} end of his reign Manuel's {{achievements}} in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at Myriokephalon, which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended Seljuk position. Although the Byzantines recovered and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan Kilij Arslan II, Myriokephalon <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> final, unsuccessful effort by the empire to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Turks.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon came}} time to name the new highway, and an {{upcoming}} visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a light beam near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks to swing out, revealing a sign which read The Queen Elizabeth Way.|$|E

5|$|John Lindley {{had named}} {{material}} collected by James Drummond Banksia cylindrostachya in 1840, but this <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{same as the}} species named Banksia attenuata by Robert Brown 30 years earlier in 1810, and thus Brown's name took precedence. Within the genus Banksia, the close relationships and exact position of B. attenuata is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Mochtar and Soekarsih, {{who first}} {{met on the}} set of Pareh, married after {{appearing}} together in Terang Boelan. This later production included much of the same cast and was highly successful, leading to a renewed interest in filmmaking in the Indies.

5|$|On 26 June 1953 Beria {{was arrested}} at a Presidium meeting, {{following}} extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies.

5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|The Spinks {{variety of}} avocado, Persea {{americana}} 'Spinks', {{was developed by}} William A. Spinks at his Duarte ranch between 1910 and 1920. In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a University of California at Berkeley and California Avocado Association comparison of avocado strains. The Spinks avocado fruit was shown to be more resistant to freezing than other avocados. They also <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> second-longest-lasting in storage out of the ten varieties tested.|$|E
