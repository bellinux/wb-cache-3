5|$|During extratropical transition, the cyclone {{begins to}} tilt {{back into the}} colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> {{converts}} from the release of latent heat from condensation (from thunderstorms near the center) to baroclinic processes.

5|$|In {{addition}} to being the <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in {{a process known as}} photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that are sensitive to light.|$|E
25|$|Salmonids are {{carnivorous}} and {{are currently}} being fed compound fish feeds containing fish meal and other feed ingredients, ranging from wheat byproducts to soybean meal and feather meal.

5000|$|Ethiopia has {{ressources}} of non-renewable <b>primary</b> <b>energies</b> (oil, natural gas, coal, ...), but it {{does not}} exploit them. It also does not export them. In the future however that will change with the export of natural gas. <b>Primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> need to be transported, in particular imported and exported <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> Up to 2017, transport was done by trucks and tank trucks but that is not economically feasible due to the growing transportation needs.

25|$|New Hampshire's {{residential}} {{electricity use}} is low {{compared with the}} national average, in part because demand for air conditioning is low during the generally mild summer months and because few households use electricity as their <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> for home heating. Over half of New Hampshire households use fuel oil for winter heating. New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power, hydroelectricity, and wood fuel.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{energy is}} {{produced}} by the consumption of energy carriers. It is official policy worldwide and also in Ethiopia to replace <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> consumption through secondary energy consumption and energy carriers are the vehicles to store this secondary energy. By doing so, the need to use <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> for daily life {{will be replaced by}} the need to use energy carriers. This will relieve some pressure from the <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> of Ethiopia (wood, forests) and will also prevent the country from using its own domestic and non-renewable <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> such as coal and oil shales.|$|R

A direct use of abundant renewable <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> (sun, water, etc...) is usually not possible in technical processes, so it is better to use them to produce energy carriers to store energy that can later be consumed as secondary energy.|$|R
25|$|Under normal {{metabolic}} conditions, {{the human}} body relies on free blood glucose as its <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> The level of blood sugar is tightly regulated; as blood glucose is consumed, the pancreas releases glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. The glycogen stores are ordinarily replenished after every meal, but if the store is depleted {{before it can be}} replenished, the body enters hypoglycemia, and begins the starvation response.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} fuel is another alternative under development in various countries, alongside, hydrogen vehicles though hydrogen {{is actually an}} energy storage medium, not a <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> and consequently {{the use of a}} non-petroleum source would be required to extract the hydrogen for use. Though hydrogen is currently outperformed in terms of cost and efficiency by battery powered vehicles, there are applications where it would come in useful. Short haul ferries and very cold climates are two examples. Hydrogen fuel cells are about a third as efficient as batteries and double the efficiency of gasoline vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{the poorest}} fifth receive 0.1% of the world's {{lighting}} but pay {{a fifth of}} total spending on light, accounting for 25 to 30 percent of their income. Indoor air pollution from burning fuels kills 2 million, with almost half the deaths from pneumonia in children under 5. Fuel from Bamboo burns more cleanly and also matures much faster than wood, thus also reducing deforestation. Additionally, using solar panels is promoted as being cheaper over the products' lifetime even if upfront costs are higher. Thus, payment schemes such as lend-to-own programs are promoted and up to 14% of Kenyan households use solar as their <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E

25|$|One {{key feature}} of a {{hydrogen}} economy {{would be that}} in mobile applications (primarily vehicular transport) energy generation and use could be decoupled. The <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> would need no longer travel with the vehicle, as it currently does with hydrocarbon fuels. Instead of tailpipes creating dispersed emissions, the energy (and pollution) could be generated from point sources such as large-scale, centralized facilities with improved efficiency. This would allow the possibility of technologies such as carbon sequestration, which are otherwise impossible for mobile applications. Alternatively, distributed energy generation schemes (such as small scale renewable energy sources) could be used, possibly associated with hydrogen stations.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} caries is acid from {{bacteria}} dissolving the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin and cementum). The acid is produced from food debris or sugar on the tooth surface. Simple sugars in food are these bacteria's <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> {{and thus a}} diet high in simple sugar is a risk factor. If mineral breakdown is greater than build up from sources such as saliva, caries results. Risk factors include conditions that result in less saliva such as: diabetes mellitus, Sjogren's syndrome and some medications. Medications that decrease saliva production include antihistamines and antidepressants. Caries is also associated with poverty, poor cleaning of the mouth, and receding gums resulting in exposure of {{the roots of the}} teeth.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of water is}} essential for the survival of all plant life. In a grapevine, water acts as a universal solvent for many of the nutrients and minerals needed to carry out important physiological functions, and the vine receives these by absorbing the nutrient-containing water from the soil. In the absence of sufficient water in the soil, the root system of the vine may have difficulties absorbing these nutrients. Within the structure of the plant itself, water acts as a transport within the xylem to bring these nutrients to all ends of the plant. During the process of photosynthesis, water molecules combine with carbon derived from carbon dioxide to form glucose, which is the <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> of the vine, as well as oxygen as a by-product.|$|E

25|$|India {{is one of}} the world's largest {{consumer}} of fuel-wood. India's consumption of fuel-wood is about five times higher than what can be sustainably removed from forests. However, a large percentage of this fuel-wood is grown as biomass remaining from agriculture, and is managed outside forests. Fuel-wood meets about 40% of the energy needs of the country. Around 80% of rural people and 48% of urban people use fuel-wood. Unless India makes major, rapid and sustained effort to expand electricity generation and power plants, the rural and urban poor in India will continue to meet their energy needs through unsustainable destruction of forests and fuel wood consumption. India's dependence on fuel-wood and forestry products as a <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> is not only environmentally unsustainable, it is a primary cause of India's near-permanent haze and air pollution.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the {{production}} of unit of hydrogen fuel by steam reformation or electrolysis was approximately 3 to 6 times more expensive than {{the production}} of an equivalent unit of fuel from natural gas. When evaluating costs, fossil fuels are generally used as the reference. The energy content of these fuels is not a product of human effort and so has no cost assigned to it. Only the extraction, refining, transportation and production costs are considered. On the other hand, the energy content of a unit of hydrogen fuel must be manufactured, and so has a significant cost, on top of all the costs of refining, transportation, and distribution. Systems which use renewably generated electricity more directly, for example in trolleybuses, or in battery electric vehicles may have a significant economic advantage because there are fewer conversion processes required between <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> and point of use.|$|E

500|$|Coastal {{regions are}} {{particularly}} vulnerable {{to the impact of}} a tropical cyclone, compared to inland regions. The <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> for these storms is warm ocean waters, therefore these forms are typically strongest when over or near water, and weaken quite rapidly over land. Coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain, high waves (due to winds), storm surges (due to severe pressure changes), and the potential of spawning tornadoes. Tropical cyclones also draw in air from a large areaâ€”which can be a vast area for the most severe cyclonesâ€”and concentrate the precipitation of the water content in that air (made up from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water) into a much smaller area. This continual replacement of moisture-bearing air by new moisture-bearing air after its moisture has fallen as rain, may [...] cause extremely heavy rain and river flooding up to [...] from the coastline, far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one time.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{confined}} {{character of}} the Mediterranean and the limited capability of heat fluxesâ€”in the case of medicanes, airâ€”sea heat transferâ€”tropical cyclones with a diameter larger than [...] cannot exist within the Mediterranean. Despite being a relatively baroclinic area with high temperature gradients, the <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> utilized by Mediterranean tropical cyclones is derived from underlying heat sources generated {{by the presence of}} convectionâ€”thunderstorm activityâ€”in a humid environment, similar to tropical cyclones elsewhere outside the Mediterranean Sea. In comparison to other tropical cyclone basins, the Mediterranean Sea generally presents a difficult environment for development; although the potential energy necessary for development is not abnormally large, its atmosphere is characterized by its lack of moisture, impeding potential formation. The full development of a medicane often necessitates the formation of a large-scale baroclinic disturbance transitioning late in its life cycle into a tropical cyclone-like system, nearly always under the influence of a deep, cut-off, cold-core low within the middle-to-upper troposphere, frequently resulting from abnormalities in a wide-spreading Rossby waveâ€”massive meanders of upper-atmospheric winds.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone's <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> is {{heat from}} the evaporation {{of water from the}} ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation. The energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot heat engine. First, inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e. latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation, the ocean cools and the air warms). Second, the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation). Third, air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause. Finally, air subsides and warms at {{the outer edge of the}} storm while conserving total heat content. [...] The first and third legs are nearly isothermal, while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic. This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation. [...] The Carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain.|$|E

50|$|The {{two main}} energy {{carriers}} in Ethiopia are electricity (from solar radiation, water, wind, heat) and bioethanol (from sugarcane). Bioethanol wasn't produced in substantial quantities {{until very recently}} (2017). Electricity was, is and will be by far the main energy carrier in Ethiopia. In 2010, electricity production made up only ~1 % of Ethiopia's <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> consumption. Between 2010 and 2016, the production of electricity went up from around ~5 TWh to around ~22 TWh (around 4 % of the <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> value). This was due to an ambitious program to build wind farms and hydropower plants to produce electricity. By looking at the table, the annual production of energy carriers (electricity) is growing faster than the growing need for <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> But the consumption of <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> is still increasing in Ethiopia.
