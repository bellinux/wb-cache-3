50|$|Phosphate solubilizing {{bacteria}} (PSB) are {{beneficial bacteria}} capable of solubilizing inorganic phosphorus from insoluble compounds. P-solubilization ability of rhizosphere microorganisms {{is considered to}} be one of the most important traits associated with plant phosphate nutrition. It is generally accepted that the mechanism of mineral phosphate solubilization by PSB strains is associated with the release of low molecular weight organic acids, through which their hydroxyl and carboxyl groups chelate the cations bound to phosphate, thereby converting it into soluble forms. PSB have been introduced to the Agricultural community as phosphate Biofertilizer. Phosphorus (P) is one of the major essential macronutrients for plants and is applied to soil in the form of phosphate fertilizers. However, a large portion of soluble inorganic phosphate which is applied to the soil as chemical fertilizer is immobilized rapidly and becomes unavailable to plants. Currently, the main purpose in managing soil phosphorus is to optimize crop production and minimize P loss from soils. PSB have attracted the attention of agriculturists as soil inoculums to improve the plant growth and yield. When PSB is used with rock phosphate, it can save about 50% of the crop requirement of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The use of PSB as inoculants increases P uptake by plants. Simple inoculation of seeds with PSB gives crop yield responses equivalent to 30 kg P2O5 /ha or 50 percent of the need for phosphatic fertilizers. Alternatively, PSB can be applied through fertigation or in hydroponic operations. Many different strains of these bacteria have been identified as PSB, including Pantoea agglomerans (P5), Microbacterium laevaniformans (P7) and Pseudomonas putida (P13) strains are highly efficient insoluble phosphate solubilizers. Recently, researchers at Colorado State University demonstrated that a consortia of four bacteria (sold commercially as Mammoth P and Bio-Fizz), synergistically solubilize phosphorus at a much faster rate than any single strain alone.|$|E

Grain yield and total P uptake data obtained after crop harvest showed that wheat varieties differed significantly in grain and straw yield, harvest index and 1000 - grain weight. Application of P by either method increased grain and straw yield as well as total P uptake over control. Method x P interaction effect was also significant for yield, indicating higher yield response due to fertigation compared to broadcast method of P application. Where P was applied by fertigation grain yield, total P uptake, agronomic and P fertilizer efficiency were all higher in cv. Inqelab- 91 compared to cv. Pasban- 90.

Fertilizers, utilized in Saudi Arabia, were analyzed for their total and water-soluble content of Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu. They represented three categories namely: phosphatic, solid multiple nutrient fertilizers (SMNF) and water-soluble multiple nutrient fertilizers (WSMF). Total iron content in examined fertilizers was higher in phosphatic fertilizers and lower in WSMF. Nevertheless, only a very small portion of the total iron content is likely to be available to plants. It was estimated, on the basis of total content, that almost 2 g of iron would be applied to soil for each added kg of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The highest total content of Zn was recorded for phosphatic fertilizers. The data suggested that less than half kg of Zn would be accumulated in soil if 500 kg of phosphatic fertilizers were applied in one year.

All the sites were low in organic matter contents and extractable K while available P was in medium range. The sources of phosphorus tested were single super phosphate (SSP), triple super phosphate (TSP), diammonium phosphate (DAP) and nitrophos (N/P). The rate of phosphorus applied was 110 kg P 2 O 5 ha - 1 from all the sources along with N and K @ 140 and 70 kg ha - 1 respectively. The results showed that grain and straw yields were improved by the application of phosphorus over control from all the sources. All the sources remained at par with each other at all the sites except DAP at site three (sodic) where it was found inferior to other sources used i. e. SSP, TSP and N/P. Phosphorus concentration in grain and straw was found non significant in all the treatments. While phosphorus (P) uptake was significantly affected by the <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> application. Maximum P uptake was recorded in the treatment where TSP was applied except in grain at Ist site and in straw at 3 rd site where SSP proved better. However both the sources remained at par with each other. Nitrophos in case of grain remained at par with TSP and SSP while in case of straw it was significantly inferior to TSP and SSP. Diammonium phosphate (DAP) was proved an inferior source at site Ist and 3 rd than TSP and SSP. However P uptake in all the sources {{was significantly higher than}} control...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{intensive}} use of fertilizers green revolution {{has been successful}} in increasing agricultural production but the spot of ground where the corn and plants grew has changed beyond recognition. In the race of producing more food at any cost, soils in countries like India has badly deteriorated. Industrialization, urbanization and infrastructural developments have reduced agricultural land to a significant extent which is to be compensated by excessive use of fertilizers. Crops according to their nature consume a fraction of nutrients applied to the field while the rest causes soil and water pollution. In the present investigation an attempt has been made to assess the consumption coefficient of phosphorus by two common crops. i. e. maize (Zea mays) and paddy (Oryza sativa).
