40|$|Si-Mo vermicular iron is {{an ideal}} {{material}} for exhaust manifold that works in high temperature and therm alcycle conditions because its properties oftherm alfatigue resistance and thermal distortion resistance are significantly better than that of gray cast iron and nodular iron. This paper explains that the verm icularity of Si-Mo verm icular iron {{is better to be}} controlled approxim ately to 50 % for the applications of exhaust manifold castings, and generalizes the successful experience ofverm icularizing technique thatuses sandwich(pourover) process combining with cored-wire injection in trough process together,and uses rare earths-magnesium-silicon as verm icularizing alloy in Disa high speed molding line and autom atic plug rod airpressure <b>pouring</b> <b>furnace.</b> In addition, this paper also describes the method to solve the shrinkage hole and porosity defects in the exhaustm anifold production...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hycast TM RAM, {{hereafter}} called RAM, is a crucible fluxing {{technology for}} removal of alkaline elements (Na, Ca, and Li), {{as well as}} carbides, oxides and cryolite, from aluminium pot-room metal {{without the use of}} chlorine. AlF 3 powder is injected into the liquid metal (below the metal surface) by the use of a specially designed rotor system and argon as a carrier gas. The fluxing system can be adapted to different crucible transport/tapping system, and is proven for crucible sizes from 2 to 9 tons. Since surface active elements like Sodium are removed before the metal enters into the furnace, the metal oxidation during <b>pouring</b> and <b>furnace</b> treatment is significantly reduced. Pretreatment will also reduce the carbide level in the metal, and by this improve the overall metal quality, and prevent clogging/deposits in furnaces, degassers, ceramic foam filters etc. This paper describes the principles of the RAM technology, effect on metal quality and documented operational benefits in a primary casthouse. Also environmental issues are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Advanced vision {{solutions}} enable {{manufacturers in}} the technology sector to reconcile both competitive and regulatory concerns and address the need for immaculate fault detection and quality assurance. The modern manufacturing has completely shifted from the manual inspections to the machine assisted vision inspection methodology. Furthermore, the research outcomes in industrial automation have revolutionized the whole product development strategy. The purpose of this research paper is to introduce a new scheme of automation in the sand casting process by means of machine vision based technology for mold positioning. Automation has been achieved by developing a novel system in which casting molds of different sizes, having different pouring cup location and radius, position themselves {{in front of the}} induction furnace such that the center of pouring cup comes directly beneath the <b>pouring</b> point of <b>furnace.</b> The coordinates of the center of pouring cup are found by using computer vision algorithms. The output is then transferred to a microcontroller which controls the alignment mechanism on which the mold is placed at the optimum location...|$|R
50|$|Ravindra Singh and Dheerendra Singh of Banaras Hindu University, in {{association}} with Cambridge University, carried out ASI-financed excavations of Indus Valley Civilization site at the ground of Government School in Khanak, during September 2014 and Feb-May 2016. They found early to mature Harappan phase IVC materials, pottery, semiprecious beads of lapis lazuli, carnelian and others. They also found evidence of matallurgical activities, such as crucible (used for <b>pouring</b> molten metal), <b>furnace</b> lining, burnt floor, ash and ore slugs. Ceramic petrography, Metallography, Scanning electron microscope (SEM, non-destructive, surface images of nanoscale resolution), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXA and EDXMA, trade name EDAX, non-destructive, qualitative and quantitative elemental composition) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, destructive method) scientific studies of the material found prove that the Khanak site was inhabited by the IVC metal-workers who used the locally mined polymetalic tin, and they were also familiar with metallurgical work with copper and bronze. Since excavation did not reach natural soil, {{it is believed that}} finds at Khanak site might go as far back as pre-Harappan era to Sothi-Siswal culture (4600 BCE or 6600 BP).|$|R
