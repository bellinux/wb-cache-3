40|$|Condensate on the air-side {{surface of}} flat-tube air-cooling heat {{exchangers}} {{can result in}} several adverse effects on the overall thermal-hydraulic performance. In order to improve the performance of compact heat exchangers under wet-surface conditions, promoting the drainage of condensed water is critical. <b>Drainage</b> <b>channels</b> on tube walls might provide a robust solution to promote condensate drainage from compact heat exchangers. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> on the condensate retention characteristics of compact flat-tube louver-fin heat exchangers is presented. Various geometries of <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> are engraved on surrogate tubes in contact with fin stock. Two fin designs are tested using a dynamic dip testing method, and four designs are tested in a small wind tunnel apparatus. Data from the quantitative results and the visualization tests show that the <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> reduce the condensate retention for all the fin designs tested, except one. Fin structure {{plays an important role in}} determining the condensate retention behavior and hence the effect of <b>drainage</b> <b>channels.</b> Other important parameters, such as fin gap and louver gap, which have an effect on the condensate retention behavior are identified. The results include a comparison of <b>drainage</b> <b>channel</b> geometry and dimensions, over a range of incoming air velocity and relative humidity, and at different sample inclinations. The maximum effect obtained is a 27 % reduction in steady- state retention. A method to implement <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> in full-size heat exchangers is suggested and an analysis suggests heat transfer can be improved by 12 % while pressure drop is reduced by 9 %...|$|R

This study estimated the contribution of N and P from maize fields to nearby <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> and evaluated the effects in water quality. An N and P budget was drawn up for three fields managed with a maize-fallow system, El Maiten (20. 7 ha), El Naranjal (14. 9 ha) and El Caleuche (4. 2 ha), and water quality variables (pH, EC, dissolved oxygen, total solids, turbidity, NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N, PO 43 -, COD, total N, total P and sulphate) were monitored in nearby <b>drainage</b> <b>channels.</b> The N and P balances for the three fields indicated a high risk of N and P non-point source pollution, with fertiliser management, soil texture and climate factors determining the temporal variations in water quality parameters. Elevated levels of NH 4 -N and PO 43 - in the <b>drainage</b> <b>channels</b> were usually observed during the winter period, while NO 3 - concentrations did not show a clear tendency. The results suggest that excessive slurry application during winter represents a very high risk of N and P runoff to <b>drainage</b> <b>channels.</b> Overall, great emphasis must be placed on good agronomic management of fields neighbouring <b>drainage</b> <b>channels,</b> including accurately calculating N and P fertiliser rates and establishing mitigation measures.
