5|$|Montgomery had {{previously}} suggested {{the appearance of}} Mayweather's parents {{at the end of}} season one, and was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> introduced. Several sets to create the Horizon were created on a soundstage, with the related scenes filmed {{in the second half of}} the episode's shoot after the main cast were dismissed, with the exception of Montgomery. Critical response was mixed, and the episode received the lowest ratings for a first-run episode of the series so far, viewed by 3.36 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler and the Doctor {{decide to}} visit Rose's mother Jackie. Jackie is <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> but makes a strangely happy remark that her {{deceased}} father {{will be joining}} them shortly. Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
5|$|When the Southern Pawnees {{arrived in}} Nebraska, the Skidis were not <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> on lands that they {{regarded}} as their own. Nevertheless, {{they were willing}} to accept them as neighbors, so long as they kept to {{the south side of the}} Platte. However, the Chaui leaders demanded that they be recognized as the heads of the entire Pawnee people, above the Skidi chiefs. They defied the Skidis by sending a large hunting party to Prairie Creek, on the north side of the Platte within sight of the Skidi villages on the Loup. The Skidis responded by attacking the Chaui hunters and driving them back across the Platte. The Chauis and Pitahawiratas resolved on war, and summoned the Kitkehahki fighters to join them against the Skidis; the Kitkehahkis, unwilling to leave their people unprotected against Skidi raids, left the Republican and moved to the Platte near the other bands.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{pleasing}} sight, of a Sunday morning, {{when the bell}} is sending its sober melody across the quiet fields, to behold the peasantry in their best finery, with ruddy faces, and modest cheerfulness, thronging tranquilly along the green lanes to church; {{but it is still}} more <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in the evenings, gathering about their cottage doors, and appearing to exult in the humble comforts and embellishments which their own hands have spread around them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drink {{another cup}} of wine at least," [...] she said, smiling and filling their mugs with the sweet vintage of Lebanon--for it seemed <b>to</b> <b>please</b> her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> eat so heartily of her fare.|$|R
40|$|As Harpercollins {{continues}} to release this welcome series of Australian reissues, it's especially <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> including less well-known, even long-forgotten, titles. While Webby had read {{none of these}} latest offerings, she did at least know something about three of the authors. Les Robinson, however, was almost a complete mystery. 'Almost' because Webby had a vague memory {{of one of his}} stories being included in an anthology she once lectured on. Obviously, it did not impress her enough to seek out more of his work. Nor would it have been easy to find, since, unlike the other three titles, "The Giraffe's Uncle" had never been reissued since its first printing, in 1933, by the Macquarie Head Press, a firm now as forgotten as the books it published...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, {{this is as}} {{it should}} be," [...] said Ozma, highly <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> so fully reconciled. Then {{she turned to her}} companions: [...] "Come, my dears, let us resume our walk." ...|$|E

Would it not <b>please</b> you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> humiliated just a little?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} entered four pages and four maidens {{bringing}} sweetmeats from the Queen, and goblets of iced water. They bowed; Keferinis indicated their purpose, {{and when they}} had fulfilled their office they disappeared; but the seasonable interruption had turned the conversation, and prevented Fakredeen making a sharp retort. Now they talked of the Queen, who, Keferinis said, would be graciously <b>pleased</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> to-day, and might not even <b>see</b> <b>them</b> for a week, which agreeable intelligence was communicated in the most affable manner, {{as if it were}} good news, or a compliment at least.|$|R
60|$|And {{also they}} had lessons, so high are our modern {{standards}} of education, from Mr. Blent, a brilliant young mathematician in orders, who sat now next to Lady Ella. Mr. Whippham, the chaplain, {{was at the}} bishop's right hand, ready for any chance of making arrangements to clear off the small arrears of duty the little holiday in London had accumulated. The bishop surveyed all these bright young people {{between himself and the}} calm beauty of his wife. He spoke first to one and then another upon the things that interested them. It rejoiced his heart {{to be able to give}} them education and opportunity, it <b>pleased</b> him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in clothes that he knew were none the less expensive because of their complete simplicity. Miriam and Mr. Blent wrangled pleasantly about Debussy, and old Dunk waited as though in orders of some rare and special sort that qualified him for this service.|$|R
6000|$|Chatterton and {{his sister}} were both known to Mrs. Ives, and both were favorites. She was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> and after {{reproaching}} the brother with compelling her son to ask a favor of a comparative stranger, she turned to Emily, and smilingly said-- ...|$|E
60|$|We thanked {{them over}} and over again, and we said it was a lovely night, and we wished them a {{pleasant}} trip, and, I think, I invited them all to come and spend a week with me, and my cousin said her mother would be so <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> And we sang the soldiersâ€™ chorus out of Faust, and got home in time for supper, after all.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} the church they found that, as was usual with her, {{she had brought}} them before any one was ready; the doors were locked, {{and they had to}} wait while Carey and John went to old Martha's to fetch the key. In a few minutes more Mr. Franklin arrived, well <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> ready to fulfil their promise; the west door was opened, and disclosed a huge heap of holly laid up under the tower, ready for use.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All {{that were}} {{called upon to}} read did so fluently; the singing was harsh and nasal enough, but in very good time; their {{counting}} very good, and their writing on slates quite equal to the average performance, I am satisfied, of a good English parish school. They listened attentively when Mr. Inglis spoke to them, and when at his request I said a few words, which he translated. The most perfect order and quiet prevailed {{all the time we}} were in the school. At the end of the lessons they came forward, and each one shook hands with Leonard Harper and myself, smiling and laughing with their quick intelligent eyes, and apparently <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> strangers among <b>them.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} is the daily routine of the school: The scholars assemble {{every morning at}} seven in summer, and eight in winter. The school is opened by reading the Scriptures, praise, and prayer, and religious instruction suited to their years; after {{which there is a}} lesson in geography, or the more ordinary facts of natural history, taught by means of maps and prints distributed along the walls of the school room; two days in the week they have a singing lesson; at nine they breakfast on porridge and milk, and have half an hour of play; at ten they again assemble in school, and are employed at work till two. At two o'clock they dine; usually on broth, with coarse wheaten bread, but occasionally on potatoes and ox-head soup, &c. The diet is very plain, but nutritious and abundant, and appears to suit the tastes of the pupils completely. It is a <b>pleasing</b> sight <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> assembled, with their youthful appetites sharpened by four hours' work, joining, at least with outward decorum, in asking God's blessing on the food he has provided for them, and most promptly availing themselves of the signal given to commence their dinner.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next day}} was Wednesday, and in the {{afternoon}} Miss Celia went to hear the children [...] "speak pieces," [...] though it was very seldom {{that any of the}} busy matrons and elder sisters found time or inclination for these displays of youthful oratory. Miss Celia and Mrs. Moss were all the audience on this occasion, but Teacher was both <b>pleased</b> and proud <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> and a general rustle went through the school as they came in, all the girls turning from the visitors to nod at Bab and Betty, who smiled all over their round faces <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] "Ma" [...] sitting up [...] "'side of Teacher," [...] and the boys grinned at Ben, whose heart began to beat fast at the thought of his dear mistress coming so far to hear him say his piece.|$|R
6000|$|... "The king, too, is himself, {{above all}} things, a soldier. He has good generals, and his troops {{are devoted to}} him, though the {{discipline}} is terribly strict. It is a pity {{that he and the}} King of England are not good friends. They are natural allies, both countries being Protestant; and to say the truth, we in Hanover should be well <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> make common cause together, and should feel much more comfortable with Prussia as our friend than as a possible enemy.|$|E
6000|$|They {{came across}} Malvina {{close to the}} tail of the White Horse. They knew she was a fairy the moment they saw her. But they were not frightened--at least not very much. It was Victor who spoke first. Taking off his hat and going down on one knee, he wished Malvina good morning and hoped she was quite well. Malvina, who seemed <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> made answer, and here it was that Victoria took charge of the affair. The Arlington twins until they were nine had shared a French nurse between them; and then Victor, going to school, had {{gradually}} forgotten; while Victoria, remaining at home, had continued her conversations with [...] "madame." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{one of them}} {{spoke to}} the other, and Wandle {{recognized}} Private Stanton's voice. Indeed, it was ominously distinct, and Wandle, standing very still with a firm hand on the bridle, passed a few anxious moments; a movement of his horse might betray him. The troopers, however, drew abreast without glancing toward him and the tension slackened as they slowly moved away. What they expected to find he could not tell, but {{he was on the}} whole <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> hanging round the bluff. He waited a while after the faint sound they had made died away; and then, tying his horse to a branch, he crept quietly into the bluff.|$|E

60|$|Tom {{was greatly}} <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> so merry, for {{he took it}} as a token of their favour, and good-humoured regard. Therefore he laughed too and rubbed his hands and wished them a {{pleasant}} journey and safe return, and was quite brisk. Even when the coach had rolled away with the olive-branches in the boot and the family of doves inside, he stood waving his hand and bowing; so much gratified by the unusually courteous demeanour of the young ladies, that he was quite regardless, for the moment, of Martin Chuzzlewit, who stood leaning thoughtfully against the finger-post, and who after disposing of his fair charge had hardly lifted his eyes from the ground.|$|E
60|$|Old Sam {{was going}} to say something, but Mrs. Finch looked so pleased that 'e thought better of it. Some o' the cocoa 'e was {{drinking}} went the wrong way, and then Ginger patted 'im on the back and told 'im {{to be careful not to}} bring on 'is brownchitis agin. Wot with temper and being afraid to speak for fear they should let Mrs. Finch know that 'e wasn't a captin, he could 'ardly bear 'imself, but he very near broke out when Peter Russet advised 'im to 'ave his weskit lined with red flannel. They all stayed on till closing time, and by the time they left they 'ad made theirselves so pleasant that Mrs. Finch said she'd be <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> any time they liked to look in.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{if it is}} not {{to satisfy}} the foreign powers we make this assurance, to what power at home is it that we pay all this humiliating court? Not to the old Whigs or to the ancient Tories of this kingdom,--if any memory of such ancient {{divisions}} still exists amongst us. To which of the principles of these parties is this assurance agreeable? Is it to the Whigs we are to recommend the aggrandizement of France, and the subversion of the balance of power? Is it to the Tories we are to recommend our eagerness to cement ourselves with the enemies of royalty and religion? But if these parties, which by their dissensions have so often distracted the kingdom, which by their union have once saved it, and which by their collision and mutual resistance have preserved the variety of this Constitution in its unity, be (as I believe they are) nearly extinct by the growth of new ones, which have their roots in the present circumstances of the times, I wish to know to which of these new descriptions this Declaration is addressed. It can hardly be to those persons who, in the new distribution of parties, consider the conservation in England of the ancient order of things as necessary to preserve order everywhere else, and who regard the general conservation of order in other countries as reciprocally necessary to preserve the same state of things in these islands. That party never can wish to see Great Britain pledge herself to give the lead and the ground of advantage and superiority to the France of to-day, in any treaty which is to settle Europe. I insist upon it, that, so far from expecting such an engagement, they are generally stupefied and confounded with it. That the other party, which demands great changes here, and is so <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> everywhere else, which party I call Jacobin, that this faction does, from the bottom of its heart, approve the Declaration, and does erect its crest upon the engagement, there can be little doubt. To them it may be addressed with propriety, for it answers their purposes in every point.|$|E

6000|$|She gave me {{the smile}} once more as over her shoulder, from her chair, she turned her face to me. [...] "Here you are again!" [...] she exclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little {{backward}} for me to take. I dropped into a chair just behind her and, having taken it and noted {{that one of the}} curtains of the box would make the demonstration sufficiently private, bent my lips over it and impressed them on its finger-tips. It was given me however, to my astonishment, to feel next that all the privacy in the world couldn't have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greeted this free application of my moustache: the blood had jumped to her face, she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me, twisting herself round, a vacant challenging stare. During the next few instants several extraordinary things happened, the first of which was that now I was close to them the eyes of loveliness I had come up to look into didn't show at all the conscious light I had just been <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> flash across the house: they showed on the contrary, to my confusion, a strange sweet blankness, an expression I failed to give a meaning to until, without delay, I felt on my arm, directed to it as if instantly to efface the effect of her start, the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatched from me. It was the irrepressible question in this grasp that stopped on my lips all sound of salutation. She had mistaken my entrance for that of another person, a pair of lips without a moustache. She was feeling me to see who I was! With the perception of this and of her not seeing me I sat gaping at her and at the wild word that didn't come, the right word to express or to disguise my dismay. What was the right word to commemorate one's sudden discovery, at the very moment too at which one had been most encouraged to count on better things, that one's dear old friend had gone blind? Before {{the answer to this question}} dropped upon me--and the moving moments, though few, seemed many--I heard, with the sound of voices, the click of the attendant's key on the other side of the door. Poor Flora heard also and on hearing, still with her hand on my arm, brightened again as I had a minute since seen her brighten across the house: she had the sense of the return of the person she had taken me for--the person with the right pair of lips, as to whom I was for that matter much more in the dark than she. I gasped, but my word had come: if she had lost her sight it was in this very loss that she had found again her beauty. I managed to speak while we were still alone, before her companion had appeared. [...] "You're lovelier at this day than you have ever been in your life!" [...] At the sound of my voice and that of the opening of the door her impatience broke into audible joy. She sprang up, recognising me, always holding me, and gleefully cried to a gentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me: [...] "He has come back, he has come back, and you should have heard what he says of me!" [...] The gentleman was Geoffrey Dawling, and I thought it best to let him hear on the spot. [...] "How beautiful she is, my dear man--but how extraordinarily beautiful! More beautiful at this hour than ever, ever before!" ...|$|E
