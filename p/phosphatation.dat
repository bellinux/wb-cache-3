This approach leads to insights into the physicochemical processes that take place during <b>phosphatation.</b> Direct <b>phosphatation</b> of H-ZSM- 5 promotes zeolite aggregation, as phosphorus does not penetrate deep into the zeolite material and is mostly found on and close to the outer surface of the zeolite, acting as a glue. <b>Phosphatation</b> of pre-steamed H-ZSM- 5 gives rise to the formation of a crystalline tridymite AlPO 4 phase, which is found in the mesopores of dealuminated H-ZSM- 5. Framework aluminum species interacting with phosphorus are not affected by hydrothermal treatment. Dealuminated H-ZSM- 5, containing AlPO 4, retains relatively more framework Al atoms and acid sites during hydrothermal treatment than directly phosphated H-ZSM- 5. Tried and tested: The effect of phosphorus modification of zeolite H-ZSM- 5 greatly depends on the applied <b>phosphatation</b> route.

40|$|A glass {{allowing}} the wetting of titanium {{has previously been}} developed. Two surface treatments promoting glass adhesion on titanium are compared: preoxidation and <b>phosphatation</b> combined with preoxidation. After preoxidation at 700 degrees C, a 1 mu m-thick TiO 2 layer covers titanium. The phosphated titanium substrates are oxidized at 600 degrees C to obtain a 20 mu m-thick oxifluoride layer. After firing, glass adhesion is obtained with both surface treatments, but a "critical time of firing" appears with preoxidized titanium. WDS analysis suggests that diffusion of TiO 2 into the glass is responsible for adhesion on preoxidized titanium, while a complex oxifluoride layer allows redox phenomena {{in the case of}} phosphated titanium. Pull-off tests have measured a maximum strength from 1. 5 to 3 MPa whatever the surface treatment.

40|$|In this work, three industrially {{relevant}} zeolites with framework topologies of MOR, FAU and FER have been explored {{on their ability}} to form an AlPO 4 phase by reaction of a phosphate precursor with expelled framework aluminum. A detailed study was performed on zeolite H-mordenite, using in situ STXM and soft X-ray absorption tomography, complemented with 27 Al and 31 P magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy, and N 2 physisorption. Extraframework aluminum was extracted from steam-dealuminated H-mordenite and shown to dominantly consist of amorphous AlO(OH). It was found that phosphoric acid readily reacts with the AlO(OH) phase in dealuminated H-mordenite and forms an extraframework amorphous AlPO 4 phase. It was found that while AlPO 4 crystallizes outside of the zeolitic channel system forming AlPO 4 islands, AlPO 4 that remains inside tends to stay more amorphous. In the case of ultrastable zeolite Y the FAU framework collapsed during <b>phosphatation,</b> due to extraction of framework aluminum from the lattice. However, using milder <b>phosphatation</b> conditions an extraframework AlPO 4 α-cristobalite/tridymite phase could also be produced within the FAU framework. Finally, in steamed zeolite ferrierite with FER topology the extraframework aluminum species were trapped and therefore not accessible for phosphoric acid; hence, no AlPO 4 phase could be formed within the structure.

Phosphated H-ZSM- 5 retains more acid sites and catalytic cracking activity after steam treatment than its non-phosphated counterpart, while the selectivity towards propylene is improved. It was established that the stabilization effect is twofold. First, the local framework silico-Aluminophosphate (SAPO) interfaces, which form after <b>phosphatation,</b> are not affected by steam and hold aluminum atoms fixed in the zeolite lattice, preserving the pore structure of zeolite H-ZSM- 5. Second, the four-coordinate framework aluminum can be forced into a reversible sixfold coordination by phosphate. These species remain stationary in the framework under hydrothermal conditions as well. Removal of physically coordinated phosphate after steam-treatment leads to {{an increase in the number}} of strong acid sites and increased catalytic activity.

40|$|Phosphorus and {{microporous}} aluminosilicates, {{better known}} as zeolites, have a unique but poorly understood relationship. For example, <b>phosphatation</b> of the industrially important zeolite H-ZSM- 5 is a well-known, relatively inexpensive and seemingly straightforward post-synthetic modification applied by the chemical industry not only to alter its hydrothermal stability and acidity, but also to increase its selectivity towards light olefins in hydrocarbon catalysis. On the other hand, phosphorus poisoning of zeolite-based catalysts, which are used for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust fuels, poses a problem for their use in diesel engine catalysts. Despite the wide impact of phosphorus-zeolite chemistry, the exact physicochemical processes that take place require a more profound understanding. This review article provides the reader with a comprehensive and state-of-the-art overview of the academic literature, from the first reports in the late 1970 s until the most recent studies.

30|$|Carbon {{decolorization}} still extensively {{applied in}} the field of food production such as sugar refining to remove color precursors from different types of juice (Bourzutsckky 2005; Chou 2010). The reactions that take place during the production are the main reason for such colored compounds in the sugar manufacturing. Furthermore, {{it is not possible to}} determine the chemical structure of the relevant coloring compounds and difficult to control in many cases. Melanin, melanoidins and caramel types are the most proper colored components formed during sugar carbonation process (Singh et al. 2011). There are twenty-one phenolic compounds in the cane sugar plantation according to Farber and Carpenter, who also reported, four colored types in refined sugar, and nearly ten in raw sugar (Farber and Carpenter 1971). Moreover, the red-colored quinones, indole and melanin derivatives, result from the oxidation of phenolic compounds. Therefore, we can conclude that the polyphenols are responsible for color formation in sugar processing (Gross and Coombs 1976). With increasing energy costs related to the sugar production and environmental impacts, it is highly important to re-estimate the old decolorization technologies with respect to their virtues. These techniques include affination, carbonation or <b>phosphatation</b> that are classified as a primary decolorization stage, and secondary expensive decolorization technique-based ion-exchange resins (Singh et al. 2011). Moreover, treatment with hydrogen peroxide or sulfur dioxide have some toxic effect overdose; therefore, to produce high juice clarity and good-quality white sugar products, a new cost-reduction material used for treatment of juice like powdered activated carbon is developed (van der Poel et al. 1998).|$|E
40|$|Adhesion between {{aluminium}} and polymers {{is important}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications. The aim of the present work was to improve adhesion in polyethylene- aluminium laminates by surface modification of aluminium. The treatments examined were hydration in boiling water and <b>phosphatation</b> by immersion in dilute phosphoric acid solutions. Laminates were produced by applying a pressure of 1. 2 MPa at 250 °C and by extrusion coating in pilot plant. The peel strength was measured by a T-peel test. To evaluate the adhesion mechanism, chemical and topographical changes on the Al surface were studied by FTIR, XPS, AES, SEM and BET surface area analysis. Hydration of Al in boiling water is known to produce an adherent porous oxyhydroxide, AlOOH. In pressed laminates, improved adhesion was obtained for all polymers, EBA, EVA, EAA, EVS, EVSBA and LDPE, laminated with hydrated Al. Three factors are suggested to contribute to the improved adhesion: mechanical keying into the porous surface; a larger contact surface, which increases the number of interactions/bonds across the interface; and the formation of stronger intermolecular bonds across the interface. By IR spectroscopy, a hydrogen bond was observed to form at the interface with ester carbonyls in EBA and EVA, while a carboxylate was observed to form with EAA. For EVS and EVSBA, the hydrated surface is proposed to favour the formation of covalent bonds across the interface. In extrusion-coated laminates, the adhesion was superior for hydrated Al, especially after storage with acetic acid solutions. The adhesion in extrusion coated laminates was favoured by a higher melt index, which improves the ability to penetrate the porous hydrated oxide. In efforts to produce a hydrated foil with short hydration times, an enhanced Mg concentration in the surface oxide was observed to increase the initial hydration rate. By the introduction of phosphate onto the Al surface, improved adhesion was obtained in pressed laminates for EBA, EVA and HEMA, while a deterioration was obtained with EAA and ION. After characterisation of the phosphated Al surfaces by IR spectroscopy, these results are explained using an acid-base approach. The acidic sites in the ethylene copolymers, such as hydroxyl in HEMA, are suggested to interact with basic P=O groups. The strong carboxylic acid dimer in EAA is suggested to act as a base, for which reason no strong interaction forms with the basic P=O rich surfaces...|$|E

En ce qui concerne la sciure de bois, les recherches répertoriées ont porté principalement sur l'utilisation du sapin rouge, du manga, du tilleul, de l'épinette, du pin, du cèdre, du teck, de l'akamatsu et du buna. Pour ce qui est des écorces de bois, plusieurs espèces ont été étudiées, notamment les écorces de pin, de chêne et d'épinette. La présente revue fait le point sur les performances de ces différents adsorbants peu coûteux pour l'adsorption des principaux métaux contaminants (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb et Zn). Les points discutés portent sur les méthodes de préparation (lavage, séchage et tamisage) et de traitement chimique de l'adsorbant (traitement acide ou basique, traitement à la formaldéhyde, <b>phosphatation,</b> carboxylation, sulfoéthylation, carboxyméthylation, etc.), les conditions opératoires utilisées lors de l'adsorption, les modèles thermodynamiques, cinétiques et autres applicables au couple adsorbant-adsorbat, l'effet des principaux paramètres opératoires (temps de contact, pH de traitement, température, concentration d'adsorbant, taille des particules, etc.), les principes et les mécanismes impliqués dans l'élimination des contaminants métalliques par les adsorbants présentés. Wood industry by-products such as barks and sawdusts {{have been}} widely studied in recent years for their property of metal adsorption and metal removal from contaminated effluents. Concerning the utilization of sawdusts, many researchers have studied metal adsorption on material from species such as red fir, mango, lime, pine, cedar, teak, Japanese red pine and Japanese beech. As regards wood barks, several species were studied, in particular pine, oak and spruce. The present review gives a progress report on the efficiency of these various inexpensive materials for the adsorption of different metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn). The points discussed relate to the preparation methods (washing, drying, screening) and the chemical treatments of the adsorbents (acid or base treatment, formaldehyde treatment, <b>phosphatation,</b> carboxylation, sulfoethylation, carboxymethylation, etc.). We also consider the operating conditions used during adsorption, the thermodynamic, kinetic and other models applicable to the adsorbent-adsorbate couple, {{the effect of the}} operational parameters (time of contact, pH, temperature, adsorbent concentration, particle size, etc.), as well as the principles and mechanisms involved in metal removal by the adsorbents. The accumulation of organic or inorganic matter at the solid-liquid interface is the basis of almost all surface reactions. Adsorption is often a process described in terms of isotherms, which represent the relationship between the concentration of a solute in solution and the quantity adsorbed at the surface at constant temperature. The isotherms are often used to establish the maximum adsorption capacity of a given adsorbent for metals. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are the most frequently used and their models are presented in this review. Knowledge of adsorption parameters is essential for understanding the adsorption mechanisms involved. Usually, the maximum adsorption capacity for sawdusts and barks is reached after one hour. The pH of the ambient water is a very important parameter because it affects the metal adsorption capacities. For most of the metals studied, the adsorption capacity increases when the pH increases. The opposite effect is observed for metals involved in an anionic complex (Cr, Se, Pt, Au). Metal adsorption efficiency also improves with increases in substrate concentration because there are more available adsorption sites. Metal adsorption is affected by an another important factor, the particle size. In effect, a smaller size particle increases the specific surface and improves the adsorption capacity. The presence of anions in the effluent doesn't appear to have a great effect on adsorption results with sawdusts. However, some anions were reported to have an influence on the metal adsorption capacities of barks. In the case of a metal mixture, the presence of one metal may influence, compete or exclude the recovery of another metal from the solution. Sawdusts contain lignin, cellulose, tannin and protein. Wood tannin likely serves as a primary adsorption site for divalent cations. The application of chemical treatments on sawdusts could modify the lignin functional groups. Other studies regarding the participation of major components of barks (lignin, carbohydrate and protein) in the adsorption process revealed the involvement of amine and carboxyl functional groups. The proposed mechanism involves an ion-exchange process. This phenomenon suggests that cationic exchange is the active mechanism for some wood species, in agreement with the work of some researchers. Currently, only a few industries use plant biomass to eliminate metals in wastewater. To encourage industries to use this biotechnology, research has to be oriented towards the cheapest and most competitive process rather than the current and conventional process. Forest waste products are produced in large quantities in several countries. They constitute easily-available resources of low cost. Future research in this field should be focused on cheap new chemical treatments to apply to by-products to improve their adsorption capacities...|$|E
40|$|Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) {{are one of}} {{the three}} most rapidly growing fields in {{materials}} science, booming from a few papers per year in 2001 to more than 2000 in 2011 [1]. These coordination polymers are normally synthesized solvothermally mixing a metal salt with the chosen linker and dwelling the mixture at high temperatures; but a new technique patented in 2007 [2] opened the possibility to synthesize them electrochemically in milder conditions. Afterwards it was discovered that this technique can also yield to adherent MOF layers if the right parameters are chosen [3], opening many new possibilities. In fact, in response to that article, a proliferation of others followed, both on the application of MOF layers electrochemically synthesized and on the synthesis of new MOF layers [4]. Unfortunately up to now, even if the literature is growing, only a few parameters of the electrosynthesis have been studied, and the understanding of how this anodic deposition process works and what is the cause of the adhesion or lack of adhesion of the MOF, are still largely unknown. Needless to say, this understanding is indispensable to synthesize layers with higher quality and made by the most interesting MOFs. In our study we took HKUST- 1 as an archetypal MOF and we made use of several techniques: Quartz Crystal Microbalance, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Electric Impedance and other electrochemical techniques, to explain how the synthesis of MOF layers works and what are the main reasons for the deposition of these crystals on the electrode surface. Based on new experimental data and on the experience gained in earlier works, we propose a growth mechanism for electrochemically synthesized copper(II) MOFs layers divided in four phases, which are summarized in the selected SEM pictures of Figure 1. Phase I: Nucleation. At the anode, when the potential is applied, copper(II) ions are released in solution where the linker is present. When the critical concentration of reagents is reached, the nucleation starts in solution and on the electrode surface. Similarly to what has been observed also for <b>phosphatation</b> [5], this phase is characterized by a well-defined inversion of trend in the QCM plots due to the initial copper loss, followed by the gain in mass due to the precipitation of HKUST- 1 (Figure 1 d). We observed that the nucleated crystals act as nucleation sites for new crystals and, even if the deposition was stopped for several minutes and the copper(II) ions diffused from the surface, it was not necessary to reach the critical concentration again, but the deposition started directly. Phase II: Growth of islands. After the first crystals are nucleated, new ones grow attached {{to the surface of the}} first, either next and on top of them. This phase yields therefore to zones completely covered with crystals and others where almost no crystals can be found. Phase III: Intergrowth. With time, the nucleation and growth of crystals continues covering all the available surface. This is maybe the most important phase since it can yield to a closed layer made by intergrown crystals. Being a porous material, the growth of MOF crystals does not stop the release of copper, but it just hampers it, and this leads to a steadily increase in the potential (see Figure 1 d), and to a jump in the impedance response of the layer. Phase IV: Detachment. This phase corresponds to the detachment of some crystals from the synthesized layer caused by their undercut. The dissolution of the substrate, especially at the grain boundaries of the metal, removes the anchoring sites of the MOF crystals that are therefore released from the surface, leaving empty sites behind. During this phase, the impedance signal fluctuates between the high values characteristic of the close layers and the lower values due to the partially MOF-free surface. The previously described phases and other insights have been found which answer the scientific curiosity for a previously not well understood mechanism, and can be helpful to solve technological problems connected with this process applied to the studied MOFs and to new ones.
