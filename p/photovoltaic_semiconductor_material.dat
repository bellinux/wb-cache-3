40|$|Abstract—Ultrabroadband and {{wide-angle}} antireflection coat-ings (ARCs) {{are essential}} to realizing efficiency gains for state-of-the-art multijunction photovoltaic devices. In this study, we ex-amine a novel design that integrates a nanostructured antireflec-tion layer with a multilayer ARC. Using optical models, we find that this hybrid approach can reduce reflected AM 1. 5 D power by 10 – 50 W/m 2 over a wide angular range compared to conventional thin-film ARCs. A detailed balance model correlates this to an improvement in absolute cell efficiency of 1 – 2 %.

40|$|Abstract – In <b>Photovoltaic,</b> many <b>semiconductors</b> <b>{{materials}}</b> are used. These materials possess different optical, {{electrical and}} mechanical properties. However, the present technologies {{used in the}} solar cell manufacture, depend essentially for the material and impose an elevated price. Therefore, {{the choice of the}} material is very important and should be developed very finely. In this paper, we first present the theory of some important photovoltaic materials, than secondly, we developed a statistical analysis method. This method allows to class hierarchically the different photovoltaic materials (Si, GaAs, CdTe, CdSe, InP [...] .). In this method, the influence of the physical and technological parameters such as the bandgap, the carrier lifetime, the carrier mobility, the coefficient of reflection…are taken into account in order to analyze the related importance of each parameter on the hierarchical classification. This method is based on the ordinal statistical analysis of the data, called Analysis in Principal Component (A. P. C). The photovoltaic data are taken from the recent literature and are represented on tables. A graphic visualization of this classification is presented while using the factorial analysis.

40|$|Abstract Currently, {{there is}} a {{critical}} need for a photovoltaic design that will convert sunlight into electricity with practical efficiencies higher than 50 %. Multijunction Solar Cells (MJSCs) {{are one of the}} most promising options to achieve ultra high efficiencies. III-V compound semiconductors are generally used to fabricate MJSCs; however, limitations imposed by the lattice constants of available substrates strongly restrict which materials can be used for high-quality epitaxial growth. Herein we present an alternative design for an all lattice-matched monolithic 3 -junction solar cell formed by (1. 93 eV) InA lAs / (1. 39 eV) InGaAsP / (0. 94 eV) InGaAs, with 5. 807 A lattice constant. I-dimensional device modeling for each individual subcell, as well as for the tandem device were performed under AM 1. 5 direct illumination and concentrated sunlight. The role of concentration in each figure of merit was analyzed and Auger recombination was found to play an important role for high injection levels. For a current match of 1. 58 Alcm 2 we found that> 51 % in efficiency can be achieved under tOO-suns (with Voc = 3. 34 V). A detailed analysis of the effect of concentration on the device performance is presented.

We report measurements of Cu 2 O interface stoichiometry {{and the effect of}} interface composition on heterojunction device performance. ZnO/Cu 2 O interface stoichiometry was varied by adjusting the ZnO window layer deposition conditions and stoichiometry was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Current-voltage characteristics of ZnO/Cu 2 O heterojunctions indicate open circuit voltages of Voc ~ 530 mV for devices where the Cu 2 O layer is stoichiometric at the interface and Voc ~ 100 mV for devices where Cu 2 O is nonstoichiometric at the interface.
