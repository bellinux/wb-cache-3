40|$|In this dissertation, I {{developed}} a grounded {{theory that describes}} and explains the processes by which a sample of highly educated young adults organizes and gives meaning to work careers in the contemporary milieu. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 24 graduates from Harvard University 2 ̆ 7 s Class of 1996, I identified {{a sense of the}} <b>possibilities</b> as the core conceptual category for understanding how informants construct careers. Through a combination of cultural, relational and individual influences, informants {{developed a}} sense of the <b>possibilities</b> that was either uncomplicated or complicated. An uncomplicated sense of the <b>possibilities</b> included awareness of a limited range of <b>possibilities,</b> clarity about the <b>possibilities,</b> a sense of the <b>possibilities</b> as relatively permanent career solutions and a conception of the <b>possibilities</b> as fixed. Conversely, a complicated sense of the <b>possibilities</b> involved awareness of an extensive range of <b>possibilities,</b> ambiguity about the <b>possibilities,</b> a sense of the <b>possibilities</b> as short-term career solutions, and a conception of the <b>possibilities</b> as pliable. The more complicated their sense of the <b>possibilities,</b> the more actively individuals engaged in constructing a career. Three subprocesses relate to this core category: becoming aware of the <b>possibilities</b> explains the conditions under which a sense of the <b>possibilities</b> develops, confronting the <b>possibilities</b> explains the strategies of action individuals employ to contend with their sense of the <b>possibilities,</b> and living with <b>possibilities</b> and choices explains how people 2 ̆ 7 s careers and lives are shaped by the consequences of their actions and choices in the process of constructing their careers. The theory developed in this study suggests that, in constructing their careers, informants use whatever structural resources are available and impose their own structure where it is otherwise lacking and action is required. The convergence of available structural resources, a person 2 ̆ 7 s sense of the <b>possibilities,</b> and the action strategies employed to confront those <b>possibilities</b> leads people to construct either institutional or individual careers. These distinct career orientations have different consequences for the shape of the resulting work career, for the relationships between work careers and other interdependent careers, as well as for people 2 ̆ 7 s overall well-being. ...|$|R

40|$|How {{do people}} imagine the <b>possibilities</b> {{in which an}} {{assertion}} would be true and the <b>possibilities</b> in which it would be false? We argue that the mental representation of the meanings of connectives, such as “and”, “or”, and “if”, specify how to construct the true <b>possibilities</b> for simple assertions containing just a single connective. It follows that the false <b>possibilities</b> are constructed by inference from the true <b>possibilities.</b> We report converging evidence supporting this account from four experiments in which the participants had to list the true and the false <b>possibilities</b> for various sorts of assertion. Their systematic errors, response times, and think-aloud protocols corroborated the theory’s predictions. Not even true <b>possibilities</b> are immediately available for complex assertions containing two or more different connectives. The task of listing the true <b>possibilities</b> then becomes difficult, and the task of listing the false <b>possibilities</b> almost impossible. A fundamental semantic ability is to imagine {{the circumstances in which}} an assertion is true. If you understand an assertion, then you should be able t...|$|R

5|$|Another <b>possibility</b> was {{suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the <b>possibility</b> that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E
