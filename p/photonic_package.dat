40|$|AbstractAlthough pulsed Nd:YAG {{laser welding}} {{has been widely}} used in {{microelectronics}} and <b>photonics</b> <b>packaging</b> industry, {{a full understanding of}} various phenomena involved is still a matter of trials and speculations. In this research, an ultra compact pulsed Nd:YAG laser with wavelength of 1. 064 Î¼m has been used to produce a spot weld on stainless steel 304. The principal objective of this research is {{to examine the effects of}} laser welding parameters such as laser beam peak powers, pulse durations, incident angles, focus point positions and number of shots on the weld dimensions: penetration depth and bead width. The ratio of the penetration depth to the bead width is considered as one of the most critical parameters to determine the weld quality. It is found that the penetration depth and bead width increase when the laser beam peak power, pulse duration and number of shot increase. In contrast, the penetration depth decreases when the laser beam defocus position and incident angle increase. This is due to the reduction of the laser beam intensity causing by the widening of the laser spot size. These experimental results provide a reference on an optimal laser welding operations for a reliable <b>photonics</b> device <b>packaging.</b> The results obtained shows that stainless steel 304 is suitable to be used as a base material for <b>photonics</b> device <b>packaging</b> employing Nd:YAG laser welding technique...|$|R

40|$|Glass as a {{substrate}} material for interposer application has many benefits compared to conventional packaging materials like silicon, ceramic or polymer based laminates because of its excellent dielectric and transparent properties.

40|$|Due to high {{bandwidth}} potential, optical single-mode signal transmission {{is superior to}} electrical as well as optical multimode signal transmission. For years, optical single-mode fiber cables {{have been used in}} telecommunication networks. However, {{there is a lack of}} photonic system integration based on optical single-mode interconnects in printed circuit boards and modules for signal transmission between electro-optical components and optical fibers. Therefore, a thin glass-based photonic integration concept for single-mode signal transmission was developed. Optical waveguides and optical free space interconnects are integrated in a single or a stack of thin glass sheets for module and printed circuit board packaging. For light routing inside a thin glass sheet, a singlemode waveguide technology on wafer level (150 mm) was developed promising for scaling up on panel size (45 Ã 60 cm 2). The waveguides show single-mode behavior, low propagation (0. 05 dB/cm) and fiber coupling (- 0. 3 dB) losses at wavelength of 1550 nm. Different waveguide structures such as 180 Â°-bends, S-bends, splitters and crosses have been integrated in thin glass and characterized in detail. Coupling mechanism and misalignment loss has also been studied. Technologies for fiber laser joining on glass as well as laser structuring of an optical mirror are introduced and first results are presented.

40|$|The large {{bandwidth}} demand in long-distance telecom networks lead to single-mode fiber interconnects as result of low dispersion, low loss and dense wavelength multiplexing possibilities. In contrast, multi-mode interconnects {{are suitable for}} much shorter lengths up to 300 meters and are promising for optical links between racks and on board level. Active optical cables based on multi-mode fiber links are at the market and research in multi-mode waveguide integration on board level is still going on. Compared to multi-mode, a single-mode waveguide has much more integration potential because of core diameters of around 20 % of a multi-mode waveguide by a much larger bandwidth. But light coupling in single-mode waveguides is much more challenging because of lower coupling tolerances. Together with the silicon photonics technology, a single-mode waveguide technology on board-level will be the straight forward development goal for chip-to-chip optical interconnects integration. Such a hybrid packaging platform providing 3 D optical single-mode links bridges the gap between novel photonic integrated circuits and the glass fiber based long-distance telecom networks. Following we introduce our 3 D <b>photonic</b> <b>packaging</b> approach based on thin glass substrates with planar integrated optical single-mode waveguides for fiber-to-chip and chip-to-chip interconnects.

PBS of these quasi- 3 D photonic lattices was computed using the MPB (MIT <b>Photonic</b> Bands) <b>package</b> [28]. The computation of slab band structures requires two steps: First, the slab eigenstates are calculated using preconditioned conjugate-gradient minimization of the Rayleigh quotient in a plane-wave basis [29]. Second, the light cone is obtained and overlapped. As the method requires a unit cell to compute the eigenstates, and the slab is only periodic in two dimensions, a z-supercell approach is required, assuming a periodic sequence of slabs separated by enough background regions. In this case, guided eigenstates are unaffected and only no guided modes are disturbed, but since they fall inside the light cone, their frequencies are inconsiderable [6].|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, modeling, fabrication and experimental validation {{of an active}} precision fixturing system called the Hybrid Positioning Fixture (HPF). The HPF uses the principles of exact constraint, combined with principles and means of Nanomanipulation to fixture components with tens of nanometer accuracy and repeatability. Achieving this level of performance requires addressing three fundamental limitations of precision fixtures; (1) Elimination of stiction via integrated compliance, (2) Integration of sensors and actuators to enable correction of systematic and time variable alignment errors, and (3) Improvement of fixture contacts' stability and longevity via hard coatings. Conceptual and analytic models are developed for the integration of compliant elements, sensors and actuators within the fixture. The validity of these concepts/models is tested via a prototype HPF. Analytic models and design rules are provided to guide designers {{in the use of}} thin coatings for precision fixture contacts. These are based upon non-linear finite element analysis. The effects of hard and soft interlayer, which reduce coating stresses and improve coating adherence, are also analyzed. The performance of the HPF is measured in two modes, passive (constant voltage supplied to piezoelectric actuators) and active (actuators supplied with different input voltages). The HPF is shown to be capable of 3 [sigma], passive repeatability of 100 nm in x, y, and repeatability of 2 [mu] radian in [theta]x, [theta]y and [theta]z. Active tests indicate that the HPF is capable of accuracy of better than 5 nm. (cont.) The fixture is shown to have a load capacity of 450 N and stiffness of 7 N/[mu]m. The combination of nanometer-level accuracy, repeatability and high load capacity make the HPF suitable for a range of current and emerging applications such as <b>photonics</b> <b>packaging,</b> mask to wafer alignment, nanomanufacturing, nano-scale research experiments and automated transfer lines. by Kartik Mangudi Varadarajan.
