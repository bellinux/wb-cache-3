5|$|During <b>Paramount</b> ownership, {{the theatre}} {{was known as}} <b>Paramount</b> Theatre. Eventually, the <b>Paramount</b> Theatre stage was {{converted}} to an artificial ice surface, and renamed Wonderland Theatre. Two ice shows were presented, titled Endless Summer on Ice (2007–2009) and Snoopy Rocks! on Ice (2010–2011). The first production included Scooby-Doo and outfits like s'mores, while Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus appeared in sequences of the latter. The show appeared at various other former <b>Paramount</b> Parks, and in each situation, the sequenced did vary between the Scooby-anchored and Peanuts-anchored productions.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>Paramount</b> {{vetoed the}} plan {{almost out of}} hand due to {{antitrust}} concerns. A few months earlier, the FCC had ruled that <b>Paramount</b> controlled DuMont, and there were still some questions about whether UPT had really separated from <b>Paramount.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1951, ABC {{chairman}} Edward Noble and United <b>Paramount</b> Theatres president Leonard Goldenson {{announced a}} proposed merger between their companies. The {{plan was to}} merge ABC and its five television stations with United <b>Paramount</b> Theatres, a company only recently spun off from <b>Paramount</b> Pictures. UPT also owned the network's Chicago station, WBKB; that station {{would have to be}} sold in order for the merged company to stay under the five-station cap. Because the proposed merger involved the sale of a television station, it required the approval of the FCC, which opened a hearing on the issue that August. The proposed deal was complex, and would affect many parties involved in television broadcasting, including <b>Paramount,</b> DuMont, and CBS (CBS executives wanted to purchase WBKB). During the hearing, Allen DuMont asked the FCC to force <b>Paramount</b> to sell its share of the DuMont Network. He stated that <b>Paramount</b> in effect owned two television networks, the PTN and DuMont; the FCC had similarly forced NBC to sell off one of its two radio networks eight years earlier due to concerns about multi-network ownership. <b>Paramount</b> executives, however, denied ever having operated a television network. Evidence presented against <b>Paramount</b> included network affiliation contracts and advertisements for the <b>Paramount</b> Television Network from 1951. Despite <b>Paramount</b> executives' testimony, advertisements for the <b>Paramount</b> Television Network ran as late as 1952.|$|E

5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, <b>Paramount,</b> but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement {{between the two}} organizations granted <b>Paramount</b> 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than the original $125 million estimate, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so <b>Paramount</b> could cover the film's costs. In order for <b>Paramount</b> to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film had to make over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and those with smaller profit-sharing deals would also begin to collect their cut.|$|E
5|$|Klaus Landsberg, a German immigrant, {{produced}} many <b>Paramount</b> Television Network series; he {{also served}} {{as one of the}} company's vice presidents and as KTLA's general manager.

By this time, Paramount's television arm was called <b>Paramount</b> TV Productions, Incorporated; <b>Paramount</b> ceased using the PTN name. The company continued to distribute programs nationally, however, and continued to sign network affiliation agreements with local television stations.|$|E

After {{the success of}} Strategic Air Command, <b>Paramount</b> obtained the rights to The Sons of Katie Elder, and assigned the project to Briskin to produce, with Alan Ladd starring. However, when Ladd brought out {{the remainder of his}} contract with <b>Paramount,</b> the film was put on hold, and would not be produced until 1965, by a different producer, Hal B. Wallis. In May 1956, Briskin asked to be released from the final two years of his agreement with <b>Paramount,</b> to which the studio agreed. The one condition was that Briskin finish work on his remaining film commitment to the studio, The Joker is Wild, starring Frank Sinatra, which was being produced by an independent film company, A.M.B.L. Productions, under an agreement with <b>Paramount.</b>|$|E

In 1970 <b>Paramount</b> offered to sell all rights to Star Trek to Roddenberry, but he could not afford the $150,000 ($ in 2007) price.|$|E

5|$|Author Timothy White {{has called}} Paramount's efforts to launch its own {{television}} service, which directly competed with the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision – <b>Paramount</b> in effect was competing with itself. The resulting ill feelings between Paramount's and DuMont's executives continued to escalate throughout the early 1950s, {{and the lack}} of cooperation hindered both entities' network plans. According to White, by 1953, even the public pretense of cooperation between <b>Paramount</b> and DuMont was gone.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, {{television}} {{networks in the}} United States were restricted to owning {{no more than five}} local VHF television stations. This system, which evolved from similar FCC regulations governing radio, resulted in executives of {{television networks}} forming alliances with local station owners in order to air network programs across the U.S. These alliances were codified in network affiliation contracts; <b>Paramount</b> Television Network staff required affiliate station managers to sign a network contract even if the station only aired one <b>Paramount</b> program. At its peak in late 1950, the <b>Paramount</b> Television Network was distributing five television series a week to over 40 affiliated television stations. Most <b>Paramount</b> stations were in the United States, but at least two were Canadian stations.|$|E

However, {{traditional}} Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo <b>paramount</b> chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E
