A prospective, randomized, single-blind trial of liposomal bupivacaine in implant-based breast reconstruction was performed. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control arm were treated with 20 [*]mL 0. 25 % bupivacaine with epinephrine 1 : 200, 000 to each breast pocket. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental arm were treated with 10 [*]mL 1. 3 % liposomal bupivacaine delivered to each breast pocket. Pain scores were recorded {{over the course of}} patients’ hospital stay. Consumption of pain medications, benzodiazepines, and anti-emetics was monitored. Length of stay and other direct cost data were collected. Results:. Twenty-four patients were enrolled, with 12 women randomized to each arm. Average postoperative pain scores were 3. 66 for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control arm and 3. 68 for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental arm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dabigatran, {{which is}} {{administered}} in a fixed dose {{and does not}} require laboratory monitoring, may be suitable for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism. METHODS: In two double-blind, randomized trials, we compared dabigatran at a dose of 150 mg twice daily with warfarin (active-control study) or with placebo (placebo-control study) <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with venous thromboembolism who had completed at least 3 initial months of therapy. RESULTS: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> active-control study, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 26 of 1430 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dabigatran group (1. 8 %) and 18 of 1426 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warfarin group (1. 3 %) (hazard ratio with dabigatran, 1. 44; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 78 to 2. 64; P= 0. 01 for noninferiority). Major bleeding occurred <b>in</b> 13 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dabigatran group (0. 9 %) and 25 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warfarin group (1. 8 %) (hazard ratio, 0. 52; 95 % CI, 0. 27 to 1. 02). Major or clinically relevant bleeding was less frequent with dabigatran (hazard ratio, 0. 54; 95 % CI, 0. 41 to 0. 71). Acute coronary syndromes occurred <b>in</b> 13 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dabigatran group (0. 9 %) and 3 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warfarin group (0. 2 %) (P= 0. 02). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> placebo-control study, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 3 of 681 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dabigatran group (0. 4 %) and 37 of 662 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placebo group (5. 6 %) (hazard ratio, 0. 08; 95 % CI, 0. 02 to 0. 25; P< 0. 001). Major bleeding occurred <b>in</b> 2 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dabigatran group (0. 3 %) and 0 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placebo group. Major or clinically relevant bleeding occurred <b>in</b> 36 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dabigatran group (5. 3 %) and 12 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placebo group (1. 8 %) (hazard ratio, 2. 92; 95 % CI, 1. 52 to 5. 60).

Syndrome X was defined as typical anginal chest pain, a positive exercise test, and normal coronary angiogram. SETTING [...] Regional cardiothoracic centre. RESULTS [...] The mean follow up time was 36 (range 20 - 51) months for the unstable angina group and 35 (range 19 - 51) months for the stable angina group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} two different dosage regimens of botulinum toxin to induce healing <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with idiopathic anal fissure. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Chronic anal fissure is maintained by contraction of the internal anal sphincter. Sphincterotomy, which is successful in 85 % to 95 % of patients, permanently weakens the sphincter and therefore might be associated with anal deformity and incontinence. METHODS: Fifty-seven consecutive outpatients were evaluated. Type A botulinum toxin was injected into the internal anal sphincter. RESULTS: Patients {{were divided into two}} treatment groups {{based on the number of}} botulinum toxin units injected. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first group were treated with 15 units and retreated with 20 units. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second group were treated with 20 units and retreated with 25 units. Two months after treatment, 10 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first group and 23 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second group had a healing scar. Symptomatic improvement was observed <b>in</b> 13 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first group and <b>in</b> 24 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second group. Statistical analysis showed that resting anal pressure varied from baseline values as a function of treatment; <b>in</b> contrast, <b>the</b> treatment had no effect on maximum voluntary pressure.

Sixty-four (34 %) of 186 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HFDS group experienced healing by week 12 compared with 56 (31 %) of 180 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group (P= 0 · 235). For ulcers≤ 12 months duration, 49 (52 %) of 94 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HFDS group versus 36 (37 %) of 97 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group healed at 12 weeks (P= 0 · 029). For ulcers≤ 10 cm 2, complete healing at week 12 was observed in 55 (47 %) of 117 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HFDS group compared with 47 (39 %) of 120 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group (P= 0 · 223). The most common adverse events (AEs) were wound infection, cellulitis and skin ulcer. The frequency of AEs did not markedly differ between the treatment and control groups...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aims: The natural {{course of}} chronic {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection {{is characterized by}} different immune responses, ranging from immune tolerant (IT) to immune activated (IA) stages. In our study, we investigated the natural killer (NK) cells activity <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> at different immunological stages of chronic HBV infection. Methods: Blood samples obtained from 57 HBeAg positive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), including 15 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immune tolerant (IT) stage, 42 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immune activated (IA) stage, and 18 healthy individuals (HI). The analyses included flow cytometry to detect NK cells, the determination of cytokine levels {{as well as of}} surface receptor expression and cytotoxicity. Results: NK cells in peripheral blood were significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IA stage of CHB compared to HI (p, 0. 05). <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IA stage of CHB had lower levels of NK cells activating receptor NKp 30 and NKG 2 D expression, cytokine interferon-c (IFN-c) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) production, as compared to <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IT stage and HI, respectively (p, 0. 05). Cytotoxicity of NK cells was lower <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IA stage of CHB compared to <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IT stage and HI, respectively (p, 0. 05). The level of IFN-c but not level of TNF-a and cytotoxicity of NK cells was inversely correlated with serum HBV load <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with CHB. Peripheral NK cells activity did not correlate with ALT level...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Electrocardiographic (ECG) {{differences}} {{occur between}} African-American and Caucasian patients. METHODS: The study includes ECGs of 2, 123 patients, ages 20 - 99 years attending an urban hospital. RESULTS: First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was more prevalent <b>in</b> African-American <b>patients</b> compared with Caucasian <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> {{all age groups}} of the study except for those <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighth decade of life. The prevalence of first-degree AV block began to increase at age 50 years in both ethnic groups and gradually increased with advancing age, peaking <b>in</b> African-American <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10 th decade of life, and <b>in</b> Caucasian <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ninth decade of life. <b>The</b> continuing increase <b>in</b> first-degree AV block <b>in</b> African-American <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10 th decade of life suggests increasing impairment but greater durability of the AV conduction system in African-American compared with Caucasian patients. The dramatic decline of the prevalence of first-degree AV block <b>in</b> Caucasian <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10 th decade of life suggests more frequent failure of the AV conduction system in this group of patients at ages 90 - 99 years, compared with African-American <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same age group. In population-based surveys, first-degree AV block was more prevalent in African-American subjects compared with Caucasian subjects...|$|R
