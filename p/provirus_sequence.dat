However, evidence conflicts {{about whether they}} negatively impact Vif-positive HIV- 1, or only enhance virus genetic diversity, in vivo. We studied {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from 19 antiretroviral-naïve, HIV-infected adults: 12 long-term non-progressors (LTNP) and 7 non-controllers (NC). Cells from LTNP had higher A 3 G and A 3 F mRNA levels, lower provirus burden, and more A 3 G-hypermutated positions in <b>provirus</b> <b>sequence</b> than cells from NC. A 3 G mRNA level was directly associated with its Hypermutation Index (HI) and inversely associated with provirus burden. Plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels were inversely associated with A 3 G expression levels and with HI only among subjects who had HI> 1. A 3 G HI was not associated with provirus burden. These results indicate that A 3 G deaminase-dependent activity above a threshold level, and its deaminase-independent functions, contribute to decreasing Vif-positive virus replication in vivo...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we found avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) gag genes in 19 {{species of birds}} in the order Galliformes including all grouse and ptarmigan (Tetraoninae) surveyed. Our data suggested that retroviruses had been transmitted horizontally among some host species. To further investigate these elements, we sequenced a replication-defective retrovirus, here named tetraonine endogenous retrovirus (TERV), from Bonasa umbellus (ruffed grouse). This is the first report of a complete, replication-defective ASLV <b>provirus</b> <b>sequence</b> from any bird other than the domestic chicken. We found a replication-defective proviral sequence consisting of putative Gag and Env proteins flanked by long terminal repeats. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that retroviral gag sequences closely related to TERV are transcribed, supporting the hypothesis that TERV is an active endogenous retrovirus. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that TERV may have arisen via recombination between different retroviral lineages infecting birds. Southern blotting using gag probes showed that TERV occurs in tetraonines but not in chickens or ducks, suggesting that integration occurred after the earliest phasianid divergences but prior to the radiation of tetraonine birds...|$|E
40|$|Retroviruses use unusual recoding {{strategies}} to synthesize the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor of viral enzymes. In human immunodeficiency virus, ribosomes translating full-length viral RNA can shift back by 1 nucleotide {{at a specific}} site defined {{by the presence of}} both a slippery sequence and a downstream stimulatory element made of an extensive secondary structure. This so-called frameshift mechanism could become a target for the development of novel antiviral strategies. A different recoding strategy is used by other retroviruses, such as murine leukemia viruses, to synthesize the Gag-Pol precursor; in this case, a stop codon is suppressed in a readthrough process, again due to the presence of a specific structure adopted by the mRNA. Development of antiframeshift agents will greatly benefit from the availability of a simple animal and virus model. For this purpose, the murine leukemia virus readthrough region was rendered inactive by mutagenesis and the frameshift region of human immunodeficiency virus was inserted to generate a chimeric provirus. This substitution of readthrough by frameshift allows the synthesis of viral proteins, and the chimeric <b>provirus</b> <b>sequence</b> was found to generate infectious viruses. This system could be a most interesting alternative to study ribosomal frameshift {{in the context of a}} virus amenable to the use of a simple animal model...|$|E

40|$|Viral {{infections are}} often the {{etiological}} agents of severe acute and chronic human diseases. Their peculiar biology usually leads to the need of design specific therapies for each virus, and the eradication of the viruses and the healing of the patients very often are not reached also after decades of theoretical and applied researches. HIV is a classical {{example of how the}} efforts of the researchers may be disappointed in eradicating a virus infection in an infected patient. Here I present a hypothesis for a new antiviral approach that may be suitable for the treatment of HIV infected patients. The same approach, with opportune modifications, may be also applied as healing strategy for a wide set of viruses infections. In brief, my idea is to use the retrotranscription machinery and the packaging system of HIV infected cells to amplify the interfering effects of siRNAs directed against HIV genes and transcripts. The coding sequences for the interfering RNAs are brought to the infected cells via modified HIV virions deficient for structural viral genes that will use the resident viral activities of HIV infected cell as helpers. The use of this strategy will probably lead to an intracellular, intercellular and systemic amplification of the specific virus-targeted interfering activities. Moreover this strategy may show novel levels of interference: a competition between the deficient and wild type viruses for the packaging molecules and the possibility of homologous recombination between the deficient and wild type viruses that may lead in turn to the formation of recombinant non infectious viruses, and the removing of wild type <b>provirus</b> <b>sequence</b> from the host genome of infected cells by recombination...|$|E

The 3 ' LTR of the CFE- 6 clone was also sequenced. The endogenous FeLV LTRs, which were very similar {{to each other in}} sequence and in organization of the functional domains, differed considerably from the exogenous FeLV LTR in the U 3 region. The major differences in U 3 included variations in sets of small (14 to 19 base pair) direct repeats, altered location of the simian virus 40 core enhancer-like sequence, and occurrence of three segments of largely nonhomologous sequences. There was extensive homology between endogenous and exogenous FeLV LTRs in sequences beginning from the TATA box through the R region down to the 3 ' end of the U 5 region. The DNA sequence downstream of the 5 ' LTR encompassing the primer-binding site, leader, and almost {{to the end of the}} p 15 gag coding region, a point up to which the sequencing was carried out, also revealed a high degree of conservation. However, the detection of frameshift and nonsense mutations in this region of a nearly full-length endogenous <b>provirus</b> <b>sequence</b> (CFE- 6) predicted its defectiveness and correlated with the lack of infectivity of this DNA. The functional studies of the endogenous LTRs, based on linkage to the bacterial cat gene and transient expression in feline cell lines, indicated that although the basic characteristics for promotion and enhancement of transcription were retained in each LTR, there was a significant variation in the activity of the cat constructs. Reconstruction and deletion analyses with the CFE- 6 5 ' LTR revealed the presence of strong transcription regulatory sequences in the 702 -base-pair region immediately upstream of the 5 ' boundary of the endogenous LTR. These and related data suggest that in addition to the transcription-modulating elements occurring within the LTR, the cis-acting {{nucleotide sequence}}s in the upstream cellular DNA may determine the overall efficiency of transcription of the defective endogenous FeLV provirus loci of the felid genome...|$|E

In the present study, we have examined amphotropic retrovirus receptor (amphoR) and ecotropic retrovirus receptor mRNA expression in highly purified populations of mouse and human HSC. Murine HSC with low to undetectable levels of amphoR mRNA and relatively high levels of ecotropic retrovirus receptor mRNA were studied. When these HSC were analyzed simultaneously for ecotropic and amphotropic retrovirus transduction, ecotropic <b>provirus</b> <b>sequences</b> were detected in 10 of 13 long-term repopulated animals, while amphotropic proviral sequences were detected in only one recipient. A second distinct population of murine HSC were isolated that express 3 -fold higher levels of amphoR mRNA. When these HSC were analyzed simultaneously for ecotropic and amphotropic retrovirus transduction, 11 of 11 repopulated mice contained ecotropic provirus and 6 of 11 contained amphotropic <b>provirus</b> <b>sequences,</b> {{a significant increase in the}} amphotropic retrovirus transduction (P = 0. 018). These results indicate that, among the heterogeneous populations of HSC present in adult mouse bone marrow, the subpopulation with the highest level of amphoR mRNA is more efficiently transduced by amphotropic retrovirus. In a related study, we found low levels of human amphoR mRNA in purified populations of human HSC (CD 34 + CD 38 -) and higher levels in committed progenitor cells (CD 34 + CD 38 +).

Surprisingly, the pattern of free virus variants in the colostrum of all animals corresponded only partially to that of the proviral form, suggesting that free viruses might not derive from infected colostral cells.

40|$|Retrovirus genomes have a conserved modular {{organization}} {{that consists of}} trans-acting gag, pol, and env genes that function through cis-acting sequences to replicate the RNA genome to the DNA provirus. Genetically more complex retroviruses also encode regulatory genes and cis-acting sequences that are essential for their replication.

We constructed novel, hybrid retrovirus vectors to replicate the gag, pol, and env genes of the more complex bovine leukemia virus (BLV) {{in the absence of}} regulatory genes and cis-acting response sequences. Most of the cis-acting sequences involved in the replication and regulation of BLV were replaced by the cis-acting transcriptional control sequences of a simpler retrovirus, spleen necrosis virus.

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} {{continues to}} be a major obstacle in the development of therapies and vaccines against retroviral infections and contributes extensively to viral pathogenesis and persistence. Recombination is one mechanism that increases retroviral variation by shuffling mutations from different genomes. Recent studies suggest that recombination not only shuffles the mutations but also generates them at high rates during reverse transcription. In contrast to these recent studies, this investigation shows that recombination does not generate mutations during recombination. A spleen necrosis virus (SNV) -based homologous recombination system was used to test the hypothesis that retroviral recombination is a high-fidelity process during replication of the virus in cell culture. The system consisted of a pair of SNV vectors expressing two drug resistance genes. The vectors were constructed so that cells containing recombinant proviruses could be selected by a double drug-resistant phenotype. Restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to map the location of recombination within 182 <b>proviruses.</b> <b>Sequencing</b> and single-strand conformation polymorphism techniques were then used to check for mutations within the recombinant proviruses.

Some of these endogenous retroviruses can be pathogenic in mice and possibly in other animal species.

In humans, genomic DNA contains numerous endogenous retroviral sequences detected by their partial relatedness to animal retroviruses. However, all <b>proviruses</b> <b>sequenced</b> so far {{have been found to be}} defective. In this communication, we describe the expression of a family of human endogenous retrovirus sequences (HERV-K) in GH cells, a teratocarcinoma cell line producing the human teratocarcinoma-derived retrovirus (HTDV) particles previously described by us. Four viral mRNA species could be identified, including a full-length mRNA. The other three subgenomic mRNAs are generated by single or double splicing events. This expression pattern is reminiscent of the more complex control of virus gene regulation observed, for example, with lenti- or spumavirus strains, although HERV-K shows no sequence homology to human T-lymphotropic virus or human immunodeficiency virus. Sequence analysis of expressed HERV-K genomes revealed non-defective gag genes, a prerequisite for particle formation. Open reading frames were also observed in pol and env.

40|$|Feline leukaemia viruses (FeLVs) are {{classified}} into subgroups A, B and C by {{their use of}} different host cell receptors on feline cells, a phenotype which {{is determined by the}} viral envelope. FeLV-A is the ubiquitous, highly infectious form of FeLV, and FeLV-C isolates are rare variants which are invariably isolated along with FeLV-A. The FeLV-C isolates share the capacity to induce acute non-regenerative anaemia and the prototype, FeLV-C/Sarma, has strongly age-restricted infectivity for cats. The FeLV-C/Sarma env sequence is closely related to that of common, weakly pathogenic FeLV-A isolates. We now show by construction of chimeric viruses that the receptor specificity of FeLV-A/Glasgow- 1 virus can be converted to that of FeLV-C by exchange of a single env variable domain, Vr 1, which differs by a three codon deletion and nine adjacent substitutions. Attempts to dissect this region further by directed mutagenesis resulted in disabled <b>proviruses.</b> <b>Sequence</b> analysis of independent natural FeLV-C isolates showed that they have unique Vr 1 sequences which are distinct from the conserved FeLV-A pattern. The chimeric viruses which acquired the host range and subgroup properties of FeLV-C retained certain FeLV-A-like properties in that they were non-cytopathogenic in 3201 B feline T cells and readily induced viraemia in weanling animals. They also induced a profound anaemia in neonates which had a more prolonged course than that induced by FeLV-C/Sarma and which was macrocytic rather than non-regenerative in nature. Although receptor specificity and a major determinant of pathogenicity segregate with Vr 1, it appears that sequences elsewhere in the genome influence infectivity and pathogenicity independently of the subgroup phenotype...|$|R

In this paper, we attempted to relate these differences to the expression of F-SFFV and Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) functions. Teratocarcinoma phenotype hybrids retained F-SFFV-and F-MuLV-related <b>provirus</b> <b>sequences.</b> They did not express F-SFFV- or F-MuLV-related RNA or proteins. The hybrids differentiated to endoderm-like cells on exposure to retinoic acid or hexamethylene-bis -acetamide.

Endogenous F-SFFV functions could not be rescued by infection with F-MuLV. Induction of teratocarcinoma hybrids with retinoic acid did not activate endogenous F-MuLV or F-SFFV transcription or protein synthesis.

Because integration is essentially random, this phenomenon can be exploited for random mutagenesis of the genome, and analysis of integration sites in tumors may identify potential oncogenes. Here we have investigated this strategy {{in the context of}} astrocytoma progression. Neuroectodermal explants from astrocytoma-prone GFAP-v-src transgenic mice were infected with the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV). In situ hybridization and FACS analysis indicated that astrocytes from E 12. 5 – 13. 5 embryos were highly susceptible to retroviral infection and expressed viral RNA and proteins both in vitro and in vivo. In average 80 % of neuroectodermal cells were infected in vitro with 9 – 14 proviral integrations per cell. Virus mobility assays con�rmed that Mo-MuLV remained transcriptionally active and replicating in neuroectodermal primary cultures even after 45 days of cultivation. Proviral insertion sites were investigated by inverse long-range PCR.

40|$|A promoter-trap {{retrovirus}} {{has been}} constructed {{in which a}} promoterless polyomavirus middle T antigen gene was inserted in the U 3 region of the long terminal repeat of a replication-competent Moloney murine leukemia virus. The resulting virus, designated PyT, was used to infect mouse mammary glands in situ. As expected, mammary tumors appeared in some infected animals. These tumors were found to contain PyT proviruses of the predicted structure. From one such tumor, the PyT <b>provirus</b> and surrounding <b>sequences</b> from the integration site were cloned. The provirus {{was found to have}} integrated adjacent to the promoter of a novel mouse gene (TRAP 1) that was expressed at low levels in various mouse tissues.

40|$|Eleven {{patients}} responding {{successfully to}} first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) were investigated for proviral drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in RT by ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS). After molecular typing {{of the class}} I alleles A and B, the CTL epitopes in the Gag, Nef and Pol regions of the <b>provirus</b> were <b>sequenced</b> and compared to the reference HXB 2 HIV- 1 epitopes. They were then matched with the HLA alleles with determination of theoretical affinity (TA).

40|$|We {{generated}} viral constructs to {{test the}} hypothesis that the major substrate on retroviral DNA that is utilized for proviral DNA integration is the palindromic sequence, termed the LTR-LTR junction, normally present in circular molecules formed by joining the two termini of linear proviral DNA. Recombinant viral genomes were built which carried a selectable marker and an extra copy of the LTR-LTR junction from a cloned circular <b>provirus.</b> The junction <b>sequence</b> in each case was positioned such that its use during integration would lead to an easily detected, aberrantly integrated proviral DNA. Analysis of DNA from cells infected with the virus constructs showed that the introduced junction sequence is used at least 1, 000 -fold less efficiently than the natural sequences at the ends of the genome. This suggests that a linear or more exotic DNA intermediate is most likely the true precursor for the integration reaction...|$|R

40|$|A {{new species}} of copia-like movable genetic element termed 17. 6 was {{identified}} in Drosophila melanogaster, and the nucleotide sequences of its long terminal repeats (LTRs) were determined. The LTRs of 17. 6 were not only homologous to those of 297, a sibling movable genetic element of 17. 6, but also closely matched those of avian leukosis-sarcoma virus. This made it possible (i) to identify the nucleotide sequences in 17. 6 and 297 that correspond to the crucial regulatory sequences for both transcription and reverse transcription in avian leukosis-sarcoma virus and (ii) to divide the LTRs of these two elements into three regions, U 3, R, and U 5, like those of retrovirus <b>proviruses.</b> Similarity in <b>sequence</b> was also found {{to a certain extent}} in other copia-like elements. From these results, we postulate that copia-like movable genetic elements in Drosophila originated from infection of a progenitor Drosophila with a retrovirus from which the present-day avian leukosis-sarcoma virus was derived...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that cell-free infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) is less efficient than that with other retroviruses, though the specific infectivities of {{only a limited number}} of HTLV- 1 isolates have been quantified. Earlier work indicated that a postentry step in the infectious cycle accounted for the poor cell-free infectivity of HTLV- 1. To determine whether variations in the pol gene sequence correlated with virus infectivity, we sequenced and phenotypically tested pol genes from a variety of HTLV- 1 isolates derived from primary sources, transformed cell lines, and molecular clones. The pol genes and deduced amino acid <b>sequences</b> from 23 <b>proviruses</b> were <b>sequenced</b> and compared with 14 previously published sequences, revealing a limited number of amino acid variations among isolates. The variations appeared to be randomly dispersed among primary isolates and proviruses from cell lines and molecular clones. In addition, there was no correlation between reverse transcriptase sequence and the disease phenotype of the original source of the virus isolate. HTLV- 1 pol gene fragments encoding reverse transcriptase were amplified from a variety of isolates and were subcloned into HTLV- 1 vectors for both single-cycle infection and spreading-infection assays. Vectors carrying pol genes that matched the consensus sequence had the highest titers, and those with the largest number of variations from the consensus had the lowest titers. The molecular clone from CS- 1 cells had four amino acid differences from the consensus sequence and yielded infectious titers that were approximately eight times lower than those of vectors encoding a consensus reverse transcriptase...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous retroviruses {{constitute}} a significant genomic fraction in all mammalian species. Typically they are evolutionarily old and fixed {{in the host}} species population. Here we report on a novel endogenous gammaretrovirus (CrERV; for cervid en-dogenous gammaretrovirus) in the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) that is insertionally polymorphic among individuals from the same geographical location, suggesting {{that it has a}} more recent evolutionary origin. Using PCR-based methods, we identi-fied seven CrERV proviruses and demonstrated that they show various levels of insertional polymorphism inmule deer indi-viduals. One CrERV provirus was detected in all mule deer sampled but was absent fromwhite-tailed deer, indicating that this virus originally integrated after the split of the two species, which occurred approximately one million years ago. There are, on average, 100 CrERV copies in the mule deer genome based on quantitative PCR analysis. A CrERV <b>provirus</b> was <b>sequenced</b> and contained intact open reading frames (ORFs) for three virus genes. Transcripts were identified covering the entire provirus. CrERV forms a distinct branch of the gammaretrovirus phylogeny, with the closest relatives of CrERV being endogenous gammaretroviruses from sheep and pig. We demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and elk (Cervus ca-nadensis) DNA contain proviruses that are closely related to mule deer CrERV in a conserved region of pol; more distantly re-lated sequences can be identified in the genome of another member of the Cervidae, the muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak). The dis-covery of a novel transcriptionally active and insertionally polymorphic retrovirus in mammals could provide a useful model system to study the dynamic interaction between the host genome and an invading retrovirus...|$|R
40|$|Over 20 {{years into}} the ever-worsening AIDS pandemic, genetic {{variation}} remains the greatest obstacle for treating and preventing HIV- 1 infection. Mutation rate assays for HIV- 1 have been reported; however, none measure directly the forward mutation rate during replication of the virus in cell culture while still retaining the ability to propagate and further study mutant proviruses. Therefore, {{the objective of the}} current study was to develop such a phenotypic cell-based assay for measuring the forward mutation rate of HIV- 1. Conventional recombinant DNA techniques and polymerase chain reaction were used to create a replication defective HIV- 1 vector, pNL 4 - 3 Δ+cass, which is based on the NL 4 - 3 strain and contains the thymidine kinase gene from human herpes virus type 1 as the mutational target. A series of transfection and infection steps were used to introduce the vector into 143 B cells, which are negative for thymidine kinase function, and produce vector virus for a single cycle of replication. Viral titers were measured by counting the number of drug resistant colonies on the assay plates, and forward mutation rates were calculated from the viral titers. Mutant <b>proviruses</b> were <b>sequenced</b> to determine the types of genetic alterations that occurred. The average forward mutation rate for HIV- 1 was 2. 2 × 10 − 5 mutations/base/cycle. The majority of mutations were base substitutions, including high frequencies of C → U and G → A transitions. Single adenosine insertions were also observed frequently. The new assay is economical and provides a direct measurement of the mutation rate during a single cycle of viral replication. Target cells containing mutant proviruses survive the drug selection process and may be propagated for further analysis. The new assay is novel and has many advantages over previous mutation rate assays and thus will be very useful in future studies on genetic variation of HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the virus}} family Sphaerolipoviridae include both archaeal viruses and bacteriophages that possess a {{tailless}} icosahedral capsid with an internal membrane. The genera Alpha- and Betasphaerolipovirus comprise viruses that infect halophilic euryarchaea, whereas viruses of thermophilic Thermus bacteria belong to the genus Gammasphaerolipovirus. Both sequence-based and structural clustering of the major capsid proteins and ATPases of sphaerolipoviruses yield three distinct clades corresponding to these three genera. Conserved virion architectural principles observed in sphaerolipoviruses suggest that these viruses belong to the PRD 1 -adenovirus structural lineage. Here we focus on archaeal alphasphaerolipoviruses and their related putative <b>proviruses.</b> The highest <b>sequence</b> similarities among alphasphaerolipoviruses are observed in the core structural elements of their virions: the two major capsid proteins, the major membrane protein, and a putative packaging ATPase. A recently described tailless icosahedral haloarchaeal virus, Haloarcula californiae icosahedral virus 1 (HCIV- 1), has a double-stranded DNA genome and an internal membrane lining the capsid. HCIV- 1 shares significant similarities with the other tailless icosahedral internal membrane-containing haloarchaeal viruses of the family Sphaerolipoviridae.
