The precipitation of TiN inclusion during solidification of different carbon content of 0. 72 %, 0. 82 % and 0. 95 % in <b>tire</b> <b>cord</b> steel is thermodynamically studied respectively. The {{results show that the}} carbon content has obvious effect on TiN inclusion precipitated in <b>tire</b> <b>cord</b> steel of different strength levels. With the carbon content of <b>tire</b> <b>cord</b> steel in-creasing, the temperature before solidifying reduced gradually and the required activity product of titanium and nitrogen for TiN inclusion precipitation also declined gradually. With the same condition of initial Ti and N content in liquid steel, the size of TiN inclusion precipitated in <b>tire</b> <b>cord</b> steel of higher carbon content is bigger than that of lower carbon content. In order to control the harmful effects on processability of TiN inclusion precipitated in hypereutectoid <b>tire</b> <b>cord</b> steel of the ultra high strength level, the measures of smelting process must be taken to further reduce the titanium and nitrogen content in liquid steel...|$|R
