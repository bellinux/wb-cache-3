Facing Oxford University, Hewett made zero and eight for the London club. The same summer, Hewett was selected to play for an England XI against the touring Australians, and in a ten wicket win for the tourists, he scored 12 and 1. Between 1884 and 1888 Hewett had limited success at the first-class level, establishing a reputation as a useful, if erratic, hard-hitting middle-order batsman. He <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> club cricket, being a regular for Harrow Wanderers, and scoring 201 not out for Senior Common Room against Christ Church in 1888.|$|E
5|$|The third son of Arthur Percival Howell Kippax and {{his wife}} Sophie Estelle (née Craigie), Alan Kippax {{was born in the}} inner-city Sydney suburb of Paddington. He {{attended}} both Bondi and Cleveland Street Public schools. At 14, Kippax joined Waverley (now Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club) and was a regular in the first-grade team within three years. At this stage, first-class cricket was suspended because of World War I, but when competition resumed in the 191819 season he made his debut for New South Wales (NSW). However, the state possessed a lot of batting talent, which was supplemented by the return to Australia of the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team that played in England after the armistice. Therefore, Kippax’s opportunities were restricted for a number of seasons. He also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> baseball with the Waverley Baseball Club (usually at third base) and represented Australia against touring teams from American universities.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{criticism}} {{of its original}} Ten Year Plan, the ICC created an ICC Future Tours Programme (or FTP for short). In {{the same way as}} for the Ten Year Plan, this is a schedule of international cricket tours which structure the programme of cricket for ICC full members, with an objective of each team playing each other at least once at home and once away over a period of 10 years. If the cricket boards of two individual countries reach an agreement, they can play more than two series. If a team doesn’t want to travel to a particular country for a bilateral series due to security reasons, then, by the mutual agreement of the respective boards, that series can be shifted to a neutral venue such as United Arab Emirates or any other country where the facilities are good. Recently, the Pakistan Cricket Team has <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> their home bilateral series on Emirates soil.|$|E

Afterwards, {{he made his first}} appearance for Middlesex against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1886. Although initially quite successful, he soon thereafter realized he had great difficulties to compete on a first-class level. Consequently, from 1887 to 1890 he virtually retired, blaming {{his time at}} the Navy which allegedly had prevented him from practising more. However, in 1891, he took cricket up again and played some first class matches for the MCC as well as the Gentlemen Players. Later that year, he participated in a trip of English cricketers to North America led by Lord Hawke in winter 1891/92. There, Hillyard played both first-class matches at Philadelphia.
