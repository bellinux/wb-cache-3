40|$|Abstract This study {{explored}} {{the extent to}} which the self-concept of students in Port Harcourt relates to their Mathematics, and General Academic Achievement. The population consisted of 6, 478 senior secondary 3 (SS 3) students from 13 state financed senior secondary schools in Port Harcourt. Stratified random sampling was conducted to select 3 schools (one school each from 2 mixed schools, 5 boys ’ schools and 6 girls ’ schools). The sample for study was 300 SS 3 students from the 3 randomly selected schools. The instrument used for data collection was the Self-Description Questionnaire 111 (SDQ 111) developed by Marsh (1992) which contains 13 self-concept facets out of which 2 facets (Mathematics, and General Academic) where adopted for this study. The subjects were tested in Mathematics and scores obtained. The general average scores of the students on their <b>promotion</b> <b>examination</b> from SS 2 to SS 3 were extracted from their school records. The Person’s Product Moment Correlation analysis was used to answer the research questions, while the transformed t-test was used to test all the 3 hypotheses formulated for this study. The results of the tests indicated that Mathematics Self-concept is significantly related to Mathematics Achievement, General Academic Achievement and General Academic Self-concept. The main implication of the findings of this study is that self-concept and Mathematics, and General Academic achievement of students are so strongly related that a change in self-concept facilitates a change in achievement. It was therefore, recommended that educational programme designers and developers, teachers, parents and students should make self-concept development of students an educational aim as important as academic achievement...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effect of class classification, class size and gender on academic performance. Specifically, {{the objectives of the}} study was to evaluate the effect of class classification, class size and gender on academic performance of senior secondary school students in Mathematics and English Language. However, three research questions and hypothesis were designed to guide the study. The study employed expo-facto research design and purposeful sampling technique which is stratified in nature in selecting all one-hundred and eighty nine (189) Grade II (SSS II) students participated in the Unified <b>Promotion</b> <b>Examination</b> (UPE) conducted by Osun State Ministry of Education in May, 2017. In this regards, Grade II students’ scores in Mathematics and English Language was used to proxy academic performance which are disaggregated into three strata such as class stream (Science, Art and Commercial), gender (female and male) and class size (large class size and small class size). Inferential statistics such as t-statistics was used to analyse the generated data. The findings of the study revealed that there was no significant difference between the academic performance of students in Science and Art stream, Science and Commercial stream and Art and Commercial stream while significant difference existed in the academic performance of students in English Language between Science and Commercial stream as well as Art and Commercial stream respectively but in favour of Science class and Art class. The study also indicated that there was no significant difference in the performance of students in both Mathematics and English Language not only on the basis of the number of the students allocated into a class (Class size) but also gender quality (female or male). It was concluded that the explanatory variables such as class classification, class size and gender are not only the necessary condition in determining academic performance among students but also work hand-in-hand with other factors in order to guarantee favourable academic performance. The study recommended intensification of efforts by school authority towards monitoring of students in doing class work, assignment, punctuality in school and re-visitation of the classroom instructional practice by the teachers among others...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two aspects}} {{significant}} {{for the purpose of}} this discussion. Firstly, military law publications were called by different names in the earlier years. However, these were all official publications. Law being complex and technical in nature, these text were not easy to comprehend and apply. The same called for a need to draft ‘notes’ or ‘comments’ thereto. These were prepared and duly inserted by the authorities, whose identity was not indicated. Secondly, military law was included in the syllabus for retention and <b>promotion</b> <b>examinations</b> for military officers. This was done with a view to make the officers study and assimilate relevant legal provisions necessary for enforcement of a disciplinary code amongst the men under their command. A need therefore, existed for publication of books that could explain, guide and amplify the rules. Thus such handbooks were required not only for application of law by the officers for unit routine but also for their understanding while preparing for obligatory examinations.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] In Ricci v. DeStefano, the 2 ̆ 2 New Haven Firefighters 2 ̆ 2 case, white{{firefighter}}s and one Hispanic firefighter {{sued the}} city of New Haven, Connecticut and city officials under Title VII. The plaintiffs claimed the city had committed intentional discrimination or disparate treatment against them when the city disregarded the results of <b>promotion</b> <b>examinations</b> that had an adverse effect on black and Hispanic applicants. The Supreme Court sustained the claim. In his concurring opinion, Justice Scalia invited attorneys in subsequent cases to consider arguing that the disparate impact theory of employment discrimination is unconstitutional. He reasoned as follows: • The Constitution prohibits the government from committing disparate treatment. • Therefore, the government may not enact laws that requirean employer to commit disparate treatment. • An employer who abandons a practice that has a disparate impact commits disparate treatment against the persons whom the practice favors because the employer seeks to increase the percentage of black applicants whom the practice favors. • An employer who abandons a practice that has a disparate impact {{in order to avoid}} being sued by members of the class which the practice disfavors has been required by the government to commit disparate treatment. Disparate impact is thus unconstitutional in Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s view, but his reasoning reflects a misunderstanding of the theory of disparate impact and how it proves discrimination. When disparate impact is understood correctly, no constitutional issue arises...|$|R

50|$|Olatunji Ariyomo's team {{attempted}} {{to change the}} way things were originally done in Ondo State within a space of 5 years via the computerization of different departments of government. His team achieved tremendous success. Examples include the phasing out of typewriters in the state civil service and the automation of tax collections and administration in the state. While the latter was popular with the then governor and the majority of citizens of the state, he nonetheless incurred the hatred and the stiff resistance of a section of the State Board of Internal Revenue whose previous ability to control funds were terminated. The unprecedented increase in the state internally generated revenue in the year 2008 is a confirmation that reforming that sector was a successful step. The computer literacy level of civil servants in the state was also raised via a compulsory training programme administerred upon every public officer in the state. This was done by advocating and implementing a compulsory computer training programme for civil servant in the state. With the assistance of the Head of Service, Mr. Alaba Isijola, the state service in fact adopted computer literacy as one of the compulsory requirements in the annual <b>promotion</b> <b>examinations</b> for civil servants. Also, {{the state of the art}} ICT centre (SITDEC building) commissioned by President Olusegun Obasanjo on 24 June 2006 which is considered one of the key accomplishments of the Olusegun Agagu administration was built by his team. The Open Door to ‘Industrial Attaches’ and ‘National Youth Service Corp’ members also resulted in ICT knowledge empowerment for over 370 beneficiaries between 2003 and 2008. Under Ariyomo's team, information technology drive of the government was so intense that the governor of the state Dr. Olusegun Agagu was pronounced the ICT Governor of the Year 2007 by NITTA - a prize he shared only with Senator Mamman Bello Ali and His Excellency Godswill Akpabio of Akwa Ibom State.In 2006, the then Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Technology, Akure Prof. Peter Adeniyi described Olatunji as a living testimony to the good quality of products of the Federal University of Technology Akure.
