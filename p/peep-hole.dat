2500|$|Edison {{was also}} granted a patent for {{the motion picture}} camera or [...] "Kinetograph". He did the {{electromechanical}} design while his employee W.K.L. Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much {{of the credit for}} the invention belongs to Dickson. In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or <b>peep-hole</b> viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.|$|E
60|$|Let me now {{return to}} business--that is to say, to my <b>peep-hole</b> and my pipe-hole.|$|E
60|$|What Hunky Ben saw {{on looking}} through his <b>peep-hole</b> {{filled him with}} {{surprise}} and pity, and compelled him to modify his plans.|$|E
60|$|Smoke grinned, {{stepped to}} the fake windlass, {{and gave it a}} couple of {{creaking}} turns. Shorty pulled out the moss-chinking from between the logs so as to make <b>peep-holes</b> on every side of the cabin. Then he blew out the candle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, to be sure. And in {{some parts}} against Brassing, by what I've heard say, the folks fell on 'em when they were spying, and broke their <b>peep-holes</b> as they carry, and drove 'em away, so as they knew better than come again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Holmes drew a {{table to}} the window, sat down {{with his back to}} the spies, and {{proceeded}} to write. The spies withdrew their eyes from the <b>peep-holes,</b> lit their pipes, and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction, ...|$|R
60|$|YANK--Naw. I tought it was locked--and dat yuh'd wanter {{give me the}} once-over trou a <b>peep-hole</b> or somep'n to see if I was right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beautiful, beautiful," [...] Shorty moaned with delight. He crept over noiselessly {{from the}} <b>peep-hole.</b> [...] "They've got their heads together, an' I {{can almost see}} 'em talkin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a <b>peep-hole</b> {{into the}} next room. It was clever of you to guess. But they will not think of that--they are only anxious to get in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just then I heard {{somebody}} coming, and I dragged High Jack {{into the}} bedless bedchamber. There was <b>peep-holes</b> bored through the wall, {{so we could}} see the whole front part of the temple. Major Bing told me afterward that the ancient priests in charge used to rubber through them at the congregation.|$|R
60|$|I walked round this barrier {{as far as}} our old trysting-place without finding any flaw {{through which}} I could get a glimpse of the house, for the fence had been {{repaired}} with each rail overlapping the last, so as to secure absolute privacy for those inside, and to block those <b>peep-holes</b> which I had formerly used.|$|R
6000|$|Now he {{was seeing}} his first foreign city, and to Morton, stolidly curious beside him, he could say nothing save [...] "Gee!" [...] With church-tower and swarthy dome behind dome, Liverpool lay across the Mersey. Up through the Liverpool streets that ran down to the river, as though through <b>peep-holes</b> slashed {{straight}} back into the Middle Ages, his vision plunged, and it wandered unchecked through each street while he hummed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now don't make a noise, {{and stay}} here till I come for you," [...] {{instructed}} her guide, pointing out a <b>peep-hole</b> arrangement {{in the wall}} of the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here--let me look!" [...] Penfentenyou flung himself down, and rooted till he too broke a <b>peep-hole.</b> We lay {{side by side}} {{commanding}} the entire garden at ten yards' range.|$|E
60|$|From the sounds, {{the boys}} judged {{that the men}} were {{moving away from the}} hut, and Bob once more had access to the <b>peep-hole</b> as a point of observation.|$|E
50|$|Brown's {{system had}} {{a set of}} four <b>peep-holes</b> and a camera that could slide up and down {{to look at each}} one. Anything and {{everything}} the camera picked up would appear on a monitor. Also, a resident could unlatch the door by remote control. Although the system was originally intended for domestic uses, many businesses began to adopt her system due to its effectiveness. For her invention she received an award from the National Science Committee.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that Sri Vadiraja Swami set up a window to commemorate this divine event. This window, with a trellis work of <b>peep-holes</b> is popularly known as Kanakana kindi (Kanaka's window). Peeping through this window, a pilgrim can have a ready flashing sight of Krishna's image without entering the temple. After this window was installed, it became customary for all devotees to catch a sight of Krishna's image through this window, before entering the temple.|$|R
60|$|Slowly, sternly, {{as if it}} {{were part}} of his duty to spy, he moved to the torn window and peeped in. He was fascinated at once of course. After gazing for five minutes in rapt admiration, he chanced to {{withdraw}} his face for a moment, and then found that nine Eskimos had discovered nine holes or crevices in the hut walls, against which their fat faces were thrust, while at least half-a-dozen others were vainly searching for other <b>peep-holes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{actually}} ARE a-picking cherries, Miss, up in {{the tree}} {{like a couple of}} robins a-chirpin' and laughin' as gay as can be," [...] reported Roxy, from her <b>peep-hole.</b>|$|E
60|$|After {{hearing him}} snoring {{for at least}} two hours, I was {{recalled}} to my <b>peep-hole</b> by a knock at his door. He jumped up and opened it with suspicious activity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{we shall}} {{find out who}} it was that {{disturbed}} us," [...] said Bob, gleefully, as he clambered upon the improvised platform, that he might {{see what was going}} on outside from the <b>peep-hole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Briggs {{had been}} murdered in a closed {{compartment}} that had no corridor, so after the train started {{there was no way}} to leave until the next station. Public reaction resulted in the establishment of the communication cord on trains that allowed passengers to contact members of the railway crew, required by the Regulation of Railways Act 1868. It also led to the creation of railway carriages with side corridors, which allowed passengers to move from their compartments while the train was in motion. Old compartment stock was modified by some companies to include circular <b>peep-holes</b> in the partitions.|$|R
60|$|Crystal {{knew that}} through the <b>peep-holes</b> of his mask, the man's eyes were fixed intently upon her and the {{knowledge}} caused a blush of mortification and of shame to flood her cheeks and throat. At that moment she would gladly have given her life for the power to turn the tables upon that abominable rogue, to filch from him that precious treasure which she had hoped to deposit {{at the feet of}} the King for the ultimate success of his cause: and she would have given much for the power to tear off that concealing mask, so that for the rest of her life she might be able to visualise that face which she would always execrate.|$|R
25|$|In 1940 Commonwealth {{troops in}} Egypt and North Africa were issued {{commercial}} model Lend-Lease Colt- and Savage-manufactured M1928s. Section leaders carried them instead of pistols or rifles. Many of the Colt models had French-language manuals packed {{with them as}} they had been abruptly diverted to England after the fall of France. They soon discovered that the weapon was prone to jamming due to sand. To fix this, the armorers removed the Blish Lock and replaced it with a hex bolt to keep the cocking handle and bolt together. The 20-round Type XX magazines had their <b>peep-holes</b> welded shut to keep sand out and the 50-round Type L drums were discontinued. Ammunition was scarce as it was either in small lots of Lend-Lease commercial ammo or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the 9mm Sten gun and Lanchester SMG.|$|R
60|$|Watching {{through the}} <b>peep-hole</b> in the curtain, Jet saw the constable in {{whom he was}} {{especially}} interested seated near the stage, {{and for an instant}} he resolved not to appear lest he should be recognized.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't she order round?" [...] thought Johnny, as he obeyed. But {{he liked}} it, and showed such a smiling {{face at the}} <b>peep-hole,</b> that Princess Fay was pleased to say, after {{a long look at}} him,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Everything was in {{readiness}} for the start, and Bob clambered {{up to the}} <b>peep-hole</b> {{that he might be}} sure the enemy were yet in their position, which was so favorable to the plans of the moonlighters.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the bushes}} {{on her left}} moved, and a man, pushing them aside, peeped from among them. He was a savage, in the war-paint and panoply of a Blackfoot brave. The spot {{to which he had}} crept was indeed the nearest to the hut that could be reached in that direction, but Softswan knew well that an impassable chasm {{separated}} her from the intruder, so she kept well concealed behind the breastwork, and continued to watch him through one of the <b>peep-holes</b> made in it for that purpose. She might have easily shot him, for he was within range, but her nature revolted from doing so, for he seemed to think that the hut was untenanted, and, instead of looking towards her place of concealment, leaned over the cliff so as to get {{a good view of the}} lower end of the zigzag track where it entered the woods.|$|R
60|$|Meantime {{the road}} in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping for a glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, and did not appear. None but Ferguson, Jake Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any luck. These {{enthusiastic}} admirers of the great scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-baggage lockup, which looked into the detective's room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide, ambushed themselves in it, and cut some <b>peep-holes</b> in the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's blinds were down; but by-and-by he raised them. It gave the spies a hair-lifting but pleasurable thrill to find themselves {{face to face with the}} Extraordinary Man who had filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities. There he sat--not a myth, not a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and almost within touching distance with the hand.|$|R
5000|$|Prior {{to writing}} new material, Michael Timmins {{spent a month}} {{collecting}} various segments of lyrical and musical ideas that were accumulated over the past year. At {{the start of the}} intended writing process, The Cowboy Junkies heard the news that Townes Van Zandt had died. Van Zandt was perhaps the biggest influence as a songwriter on Michael, showcasing songs that were <b>peep-holes</b> into the soul. Michael wrote the first draft of [...] "Blue Guitar" [...] the day that he heard Van Zandt died, [...] "as a tribute to the man who had the bluest guitar that I had ever heard." [...] However, the song wasn't finished at the time, and was put away for a while. The following month, Michael caome into possession of some of Van Zandt's unpublished and unfinished lyrics, including one titled [...] "Screams from the Kitchen" [...] which had lyrics that just popped out. With permission from Van Zandt's widow, Jeanene Van Zandt, he incorporated the lyrics into the song [...] "Blue Guitar" [...] which managed to finish off the song, completing the tribute to Van Zandt, and becoming Michael Timmins favorite on the album.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{how nice}} to get beyond our {{tiresome}} old tether!' she said, arranging herself a <b>peep-hole</b> between the curtains. 'I am so sick of all those dusty black beeches, and formal evergreens. How can you stare at them so, Cherry?' ...|$|E
60|$|I am now comfortably {{established}} {{next door}} to Mr. Jay, and I am delighted to say that I have two holes in the partition instead of one. My natural sense of humor has led me into the pardonable extravagance of giving them both appropriate names. One I call my <b>peep-hole,</b> and the other my pipe-hole. The name of the first explains itself; {{the name of the}} second refers to a small tin pipe or tube inserted in the hole, and twisted so that the mouth of it comes close to my ear while I am standing at my post of observation. Thus, while I am looking at Mr. Jay through my <b>peep-hole,</b> I can hear every word that may be spoken in his room through my pipe-hole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't despair, ma'am," [...] I said, with an insinuating {{mildness}} {{which seemed}} to touch her. [...] "I have heard a mysterious conversation--I know of a guilty appointment--and I expect great things from my <b>peep-hole</b> and my pipe-hole to-night. Pray don't be alarmed, but I think {{we are on the}} brink of a discovery." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{snow-storm}} lasted another day; {{but what}} became of it afterwards, I cannot possibly imagine. At any rate, it entirely cleared away during the night; and when the sun arose the next morning, it shone brightly down on as bleak a tract of hill-country here in Berkshire, as could be seen anywhere in the world. The frost-work had so covered the window-panes that it was hardly possible {{to get a glimpse}} at the scenery outside. But, while waiting for breakfast, the small populace of Tanglewood had scratched <b>peep-holes</b> with their finger-nails, and saw with vast delight that--unless it were one or two bare patches on a precipitous hill-side, or the gray effect of the snow, intermingled with the black pine forest--all nature was as white as a sheet. How exceedingly pleasant! And, to make it all the better, it was cold enough to nip one's nose short off! If people have but life enough in them to bear it, there is nothing that so raises the spirits, and makes the blood ripple and dance so nimbly, like a brook down the slope of a hill, as a bright, hard frost.|$|R
60|$|While devouring the grapes, I {{looked on}} all sides out of the <b>peep-holes</b> of my hermitage, and saw the farmhouse, the fields, and almost every part of our domain, but not a single human figure in the landscape. Some of {{the windows of the}} house were open, but with no more signs of life than in a dead man's unshut eyes. The barn-door was ajar, and {{swinging}} in the breeze. The big old dog,--he was a relic of the former dynasty of the farm,--that hardly ever stirred out of the yard, was nowhere to be seen. What, then, had become of all the fraternity and sisterhood? Curious to ascertain this point, I let myself down out of the tree, and going {{to the edge of the}} wood, was glad to perceive our herd of cows chewing the cud or grazing not far off. I fancied, by their manner, that two or three of them recognized me (as, indeed, they ought, for I had milked them and been their chamberlain times without number); but, after staring me in the face a little while, they phlegmatically began grazing and chewing their cuds again. Then I grew foolishly angry at so cold a reception, and flung some rotten fragments of an old stump at these unsentimental cows.|$|R
6000|$|Here {{the tour}} of the Palace ended; {{and it must be}} remembered that the Englishman had not gone the depth of three rooms into one flank. Acres of {{building}} lay to the right of him, and above the lines of the terraces he could see the tops of green trees. [...] "Who knew how many gardens, such as the Rang Bilas, were {{to be found in the}} Palace?" [...] No one answered directly, but all said that there were many. The warden gathered up his keys, and, locking each door behind him as he passed, led the way down to earth. But before he had crossed the garden the Englishman heard, deep down in the bowels of the Palace, a woman's voice singing, and the voice rang as do voices in caves. All Palaces in India excepting dead ones, such as that of Amber, are full of eyes. In some, as has been said, the idea of being watched is stronger than in others. In Boondi Palace it was overpowering--being far worse than in the green shuttered corridors of Jodhpur. There were trap-doors on the tops of terraces, and windows veiled in foliage, and bull's-eyes set low in unexpected walls, and many other <b>peep-holes</b> and places of vantage. In the end, the Englishman looked devoutly at the floor, but when the voice of the woman came up from under his feet, he felt that there was nothing left for him but to go. Yet, excepting only this voice, there was deep silence everywhere, and nothing could be seen.|$|R
