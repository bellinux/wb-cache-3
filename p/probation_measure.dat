The range of time taken into consideration starts from 1974 and reaches {{the first years of}} the 3 rd millennium. According to the Author’s opinion, the Constitutional Court, with a large number of sentences, played a significant role in ensuring the presence of jurisdictional guarantees even in the post-trial phase, where, traditionally, penitentiary authorities are involved in most of the decisions.

50|$|Besides, the Chief expert {{research}} {{department of the}} Supreme Rada of Ukraine apparatus concluded that the draft contained a lot of terminological discrepancies {{with respect to the}} legislation in force. The concept of applying <b>probation</b> <b>measures</b> to both suspects and defendants also seems dubious. Neither suspects nor defendants cannot be considered guilty of felony and, therefore, needing “supervisory” or “social education” measures. By the way, the funding assigned for probation, as was mentioned before, constitutes an insignificant portion within the Target program for the reforming of criminal executive service- 0.64 million UAH. The specialist, therefore, are concerned that the introduction of probation in fact will amount to nothing but renaming of the criminal executive inspections.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{appliance}} of non-custodial penalties, completed by the necessity of respecting the measures of surveillance and/or certain obligations imposed by the court, is to ensure the re-socialization and reintegration into the community to which they belong. In this context, at the European Union’s level it was adopted 2008 / 947 /JHA Framework Decision of the Council on 27 November 2008 regarding the appliance of mutual recognition principle {{in the case of}} judgments and probation decisions for supervising the <b>probation</b> <b>measures</b> and alternative sanctions. The most important criterion under which judicial decision can be transmitted to another Member State is referring to the convicted person residency, considering that adopting such a measure the chances of social reintegration of the sentenced person will increase, allowing them to preserve the family, linguistic, cultural links. The probation service has a critical role for community supervision of the measures and obligations imposed by the Romanian court to the sentenced person. This institution has a number of specific tasks even when the Romanian court sends the legal judgment accompanied by the certificate in another Member State, seeking its recognition and enforcement. These responsibilities relate in particular to the cooperation activity that needs to be carried out with similarauthority of the executing Member State, since it can always intervene the possibility of restoring the competence of executing the decision of the Romanian court.

40|$|Straipsnyje analizuojama teisinė ir kriminologinė socialinio tyrimo išvados reikšmė bei galimos kliūtys ja naudotis Lietuvoje nagrinėjant baudžiamąsias bylas. The article {{contains}} legal and criminological research of significance of probation report in hearing criminal cases, and obstacles of using it. It is found that especially rare use of probation report {{is incompatible with}} the importance of such report according to the constitutional principles of justice, rule of law, and provisions of criminal law which suppose the need to individualize criminal liability. Legal acts regulating the use of probation report are quite comprehensive, but they contain certain shortcomings which may be deemed as obstacles for broader application of such reports in practice. It concerns {{the definition of the}} purpose of the report and omission to specifically regulate when it must be used. The trial court should invoke a probation report whenever there is a doubt whether in case of guilty verdict real punishment of imprisonment should be imposed or probation should be used instead of it, and in the latter case, if there any doubts exist, what <b>probation</b> <b>measures</b> should be applied. In practice, probation reports have been developed for people accused only with premeditated different dangerous crimes that violate various values provided in the Criminal Code, {{as well as for the}} persons who committed several crimes. In most cases, the crimes were committed under the influence of alcohol and in a group. For the purposes of the probation report, it was intended to individualize the probation conditions for people of all ages. Education of the persons reported on probation had been mostly poor, but often they continued studying. All the accused persons were convicted previously, their propensity to commit crimes encouraged the court to explore the possibility of adjustment of criminal conduct by the individualization of the sentence. The crime risk of the accused persons ranged from low to medium. The probation officers welcome possibility of using of the probation reports, and the accused persons agreed to cooperate with officials preparing the reports. Probation reports terms depend mostly on the accused person`s willingness to cooperate, and the officials have a small workload for probation report preparation. The officers who prepare reports identify the need of application of deeper psychological knowledge and training on the OASys (the Offender Assessment System) methodology. Judges, who have issued instructions to develop the probation reports, welcome the possibility of using of the probation report, support the individualization of the sentence or selecting of other sanction and legislation, and regulating the use of these reports, do not get a lot of attention. The judges probably assigned to draw reports due to the difficulties faced by the accused persons and to proper decision on sanctions for the accused young age persons. Judges may overestimate the charge of probation officers and, therefore, rarely assign the probation reports. The aforementioned conclusions of the article are drawn by analysing legal acts and jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of Lithuania, recommendations of Council of Europe, legal and criminological literature, materials of criminal cases, interviews of judges and probation officers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} the probation system in the social reintegration of offenders in NWFP, Pakistan. Probation is the punishment most widely associated with rehabilitation and helping offenders to lead law-abiding lives. The probation system in Pakistan has a colonial origin. The Probation Ordinance of 1960 has its origins in the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (Amended 1923) passed into law by the British Colonial government. The passing of the probation law in 1960 was part of General Ayub Khan's attempt to modernise Pakistan. The central argument of this thesis is that the meaning of punishment changes when it is taken out of its cultural setting. The punishment of probation has no equivalent in Pakistani culture. Throughout this study, it was found that probation was perceived differently by the probation officers in the Reclamation and Probation Department (RPD) of NWFP Pakistan, the judicial magistrates who are empowered to grant probation orders and the offenders placed on probation. The result is a deluded system which was founded upon the rehabilitation ideal but which tries to offer an 'advice, assist and befriend' service. The empirical data showed that even that support was not provided. <b>Probation</b> officers <b>measured</b> their success in terms of how many people they were able to persuade judicial magistrates to release to them on probation. This made their job resemble that of the 19 th century missionaries in England – 'saving souls'. It is argued that the problems of the RPD are due to lack of political support for the probation service in Pakistan, evidenced by its lack of identity and infrastructure. This has meant that the RPD has not 'evolved' {{enough to be able to}} meet its goals of rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the Probation and Mediation Service in the Czech Republic, its {{importance}} and awareness of this service in society. The Probation and Mediation Service is a state organization that works {{in the field of}} criminal policy. Its main goal is to resolve the conflicts associated with criminal activities effectively and in favour of society. But this is not the only aim of the organization. It also strives for efficient and dignified execution of alternative punishments and <b>measures.</b> <b>Probation</b> and Mediation Service is based on a concept of restorative justice which is increasingly developing in the Czech Republic. It stresses the integration of offender, participation of victim and protection of society. The probation officers have to face many problems that make their work difficult. Key issue is a low awareness of the Probation and Mediation Service in society which is caused by insufficient PR strategy. The consequence of inadequate promotion is a limited cooperation between probation officers and offenders or victims. The low awareness is proved by the results of questionnaire surveys that were conducted among general public in the Czech Republic and clients of the Probation and Mediation Service centre in Prague. Czech experts - probation officers suggest taking certain measures [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study the {{development}} of probation work is traced. It is shown that emphases from the past influence perceptions and aims of workers today. A new analysis of these is presented suggesting that workers' aims can be expressed on a continuum between two ORIENTATIONS, the JUDICIAL and the CLINICAL. In the second part of the study, after description of characteristics of worker and probationer samples, four hypotheses are tested. Firstly changes in the behaviour of probationers subsequent to the making of a <b>probation</b> order are <b>measured</b> not only, as is usual, using reconviction rates, but also utilizing undetected offending rates, changes in the numbers of convictions, in the number of undetected offences, in the seriousness of these, in social stability, in employment stability, in attitudes (to work, law and authority, probation and self) and in social functioning. Little change in the behaviour of probationers is found. Secondly, the outcome of probation in Scotland and England is compared. No consistent differences are found. Thirdly, the existence of ORIENTATIONS and the feasibility of expressing aims of probation workers on the continuum between JUDICIAL and CLINICAL ORIENTATIONS are examined. The concept of ORIENTATIONS receives support; the measurement method devised appears workable. Lastly, there is examination of changes in the behaviour of a subsample of probationers matched with their workers who were categorised using a tripartite division of the JUDICIAL/CLINICAL scale. Those probationers whose workers had a CLINICAL ORIENTATION appear to have fewer reconvictions and to have committed fewer undetected offences. Those probationers whose workers had an INTERMEDIATE ORIENTATION, that is, who fell in the middle of the scale, appear to have made greater change in a positive direction on all the other measures...|$|R
40|$|A major youth justice {{policy issue}} in Canada is the {{management}} of young offenders who are mentally disordered, violent, and/or gang-involved. As probation is the most commonly applied youth sentence in Canada, specialized youth probation caseloads were introduced to meet {{the unique needs of}} these young offenders. These youth probation officers are assigned reduced caseloads, thereby facilitating more intensive supervision and individualized case management plans. The present study focuses on two specialized youth probation caseloads in Vancouver, British Columbia: the Serious-Violent/Gang-Involved Young Offender Caseload and the Mentally Disordered Young Offender Caseload. To determine whether the supervision received and the outcomes of specially supervised youth are different than those for youth supervised on traditional caseloads, this dissertation relies on data from 192 youth probationers’ case files assigned to a specialized or a traditional caseload in the Lower Mainland, between 2004 and 2011, and who had a mental health condition, a serious-violent conviction, or who were associated with a criminal organization. In addition, it includes seven semi-structured qualitative interviews with the youth probation officers who supervised the specialized caseloads. This mixed methodology permitted a careful examination of the in-depth profiles and specific typologies of the youth probationers; an evaluation of the practices employed by the specialist officers; and finally, an assessment of the outcomes of the youth probationers supervised by specialist probation officers compared to youth supervised by traditional <b>probation</b> officers, as <b>measured</b> through recidivism, chronic offending, and changes in risk assessment ratings. Several of the proposed research hypotheses were confirmed, as specially supervised youth probationers, overall, received more intensive supervision, as compared to youth who were assigned to traditional caseloads. Moreover, they had reduced probabilities of recidivism, had lower likelihoods of becoming chronic offenders, and had comparatively better risk assessment ratings than the traditionally managed young offenders. This research provides important implications related to the community supervision of mentally disordered and violent/gang young offenders, and recommendations for continued and future youth probation practices and policies are offered...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, China has {{accepted}} and extensively adopted probation {{as a type}} of community-based sanctions. Since 2003, the number of offenders granted probation in China has greatly increased. However, few empirical studies have focused on the impact of probation, the effect of environments that probationers re-enter or what factors are associated with better probation outcomes. This study fills this gap by evaluating probation outcomes over a one-year follow up on a sample of 250 male probationers. The primary aim of this exploratory study is to examine what factors make probation work better from the social learning perspective. This study tests interaction effects between the person and the social environment in which the probationers’ learning occurs. This study also categorizes potential variables into a theoretical framework of static and dynamic risk factors. This study poses two main research questions: (1) Does probation lower the likelihood of reoffending? (2) What specific factors explain whether probationers reoffend during their probation? This study uses unique, first-hand, self-report data from 250 male Chinese probationers. Probationers were interviewed with a structured questionnaire {{at the start of the}} study and revisited 12 months later and asked about their probation experience. <b>Probation</b> outcomes were <b>measured</b> by self-reported reoffending behaviors, including recidivism and technical violations. This was triangulated by reports from probation officers. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the effects of static and dynamic risk variables on self-reported probation outcomes. Logistic regressions demonstrated that age, employment status, contact with antisocial companions, leisure status, family/marital circumstance, and relationship with probation officers were all significantly associated with probation outcomes. Logistic regressions also demonstrated that leisure status and contact with antisocial companions were critical factors explaining probation success and failure. The main implication of the findings is that personal and interpersonal factors are important in explaining probationers’ reoffending behaviors. Finally, this study also has implications for social services for probationers from relationship and structuring perspectives. published_or_final_versionSocial Work and Social AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
