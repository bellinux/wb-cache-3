40|$|Introduction: HIV-related stigma impacts {{the quality}} of life and care {{management}} of HIV-infected and HIV-affected individuals, but how we measure stigma and its impact on children and adolescents has less often been described. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies that measured HIV-related stigma with a quantitative tool in paediatric HIV-infected and HIV-affected populations. Results and discussion: Varying measures have been used to assess stigma in <b>paediatric</b> <b>populations,</b> with most studies utilizing the full or variant form of the HIV Stigma Scale that has been validated in adult populations and utilized with <b>paediatric</b> <b>populations</b> in Africa, Asia and the United States. Other common measures included the Perceived Public Stigma Against Children Affected by HIV, primarily utilized and validated in China. Few studies implored item validation techniques with the population of interest, although scales were used in a different cultural context from the origin of the scale. Conclusions: Many stigma measures have been used to assess HIV stigma in <b>paediatric</b> <b>populations,</b> globally, but few have implored methods for cultural adaptation and content validity...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{patients}} with congenital heart disease (CHD) has significantly increased over the last decades. The CHD population has a high prevalence of heart failure during late follow-up {{and this is a}} major cause of mortality. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be a promising therapy to improve the clinical outcome of CHD and paediatric patients with heart failure. However, the CHD and <b>paediatric</b> <b>population</b> is a highly heterogeneous group with different anatomical substrates that may influence the effects of CRT. Echocardiography is the mainstay imaging modality to evaluate CHD and paediatric patients with heart failure and novel echocardiographic tools permit a comprehensive assessment of cardiac dyssynchrony that may help selecting candidates for CRT. This article reviews the role of CRT in the CHD and <b>paediatric</b> <b>population</b> with heart failure.

40|$|Purpose: The aims of this {{research}} were to pilot and assess {{the performance of a}} new generic paediatric health related quality of life measure and to refine the measure to be amenable to health state valuation to make it suitable for use in economic evaluation. Methods: A sample of 247 children was recruited from general and clinical <b>paediatric</b> <b>populations.</b> Each child completed the measure and data was collected to allow assessment of practicality, validity, whether the child could self complete and preferences for alternative wordings that could be used. The measure was refined in light of the results and also to make it amenable to health state valuation. Results: The measure demonstrated good practicality and validity in both the general and clinical <b>paediatric</b> <b>populations</b> with excellent completion rates, a low time to complete and evidence of face, content and construct validity. To make it suitable for health state valuation, the number of dimensions of health related quality of life was reduced from 11 to 9. Conclusions: The measure performed well and the final measure generates health states which should be feasible for valuation. Further research is needed to value the final descriptive system...|$|R
