The Ministry approved a $90,000 <b>project</b> <b>support</b> for the Church of Norway, while the pressure group Bellona faced a cut of the same amount. Hareide, being a devout Christian {{and a member of}} the Church of Norway, was accused of putting his own religious interests ahead of environmental considerations. The case became a curiosity in the Norwegian media as some of the money was channelled into the church internet site, which, among other things, contained a set of prayers for earthworms – described in such odd terms as [...] "the blind subterranean workers", [...] "small sisters and brothers in the compost" [...] and [...] "members of the subterranean congregation". Hareide responded to the criticism by describing the overall project as [...] "exciting".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method for optimally compacting a continuous distribution $F$ into a representative point set called <b>projected</b> <b>support</b> points. As its name suggests, the primary appeal of <b>projected</b> <b>support</b> points {{is that it}} provides an optimal representation of not only the full distribution $F$, but its marginal distributions as well. These point sets have numerous important applications in statistics and engineering, because many practical, high-dimensional sampling or integration problems typically have low-dimensional structure which can be exploited. In this work, a unifying framework is presented for <b>projected</b> <b>support</b> points, connecting the desired goodness-of-fit on marginal distributions with important principles in experimental design and Quasi-Monte Carlo. Two algorithms are then proposed for efficient optimization of <b>projected</b> <b>support</b> points, with simulation studies confirming {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed point set both in representing marginal distributions and in integrating functions with low-dimensional structure. An important application of <b>projected</b> <b>support</b> points [...] as a way to optimally compact Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains [...] is then highlighted using a Bayesian age-cohort model for breast cancer...|$|R
2500|$|Progress on E Pluribus Unum {{was placed}} on hold in October 2010. [...] At that time $51,000 of Wilson's $325,000 {{commission}} for E Pluribus Unum had been paid. [...] In January 2011, the sculpture was awarded $50,000 in <b>project</b> <b>support</b> from the Chicago-based Joyce Foundation. The annual Joyce Foundation grant supports community engagements {{and the development of}} dance, music, theater, and visual arts by artists color in major Midwestern United States cities. The grant was to be used to fund part of Wilson's commission as well as public outreach about the artwork. This outreach was to consist of discussions led by local art educators and the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee's Race and Cultural Relations Leadership Network, with each session limited to 20 participants. The $50,000 grant was to be returned to the Joyce Foundation if the sculpture is not created. In December 2011, the Central Indiana Community Foundation held a press conference to announce cancellation of the project.|$|E
