50|$|Razing Storm {{is similar}} to many of its Time Crisis rail shooter counterparts, namely Crisis Zone, using the {{signature}} foot <b>pedal</b> <b>cover</b> system, but providing the player with a machine gun as the default weapon and a handheld ballistic shield. Pressing down on the pedal allows the player to lower the shield and attack, but leaves them open to enemy fire. Releasing the pedal allows the player to raise the shield, reloading their weapon and rendering the player impervious to all conventional types of damage, but leaves them unable to attack. The game also has a time limit on each section. This forces the player to attack and take risks rather than {{spend too much time}} hiding behind their shield, or they will face damage from events that occur when from the timer runs out.|$|E
50|$|Honda {{was born}} in Tenryū, Shizuoka, a small village under Mount Fuji near Hamamatsu on November 17, 1906. He spent his early {{childhood}} helping his father, Gihei, a blacksmith, with his bicycle repair business. At the time his mother, Mika, was a weaver. Honda {{was not interested in}} traditional education. His school handed grade reports to the children, but required that they be returned stamped with the family seal, to make sure that a parent had seen it. Soichiro created a stamp to forge his family seal out of a used rubber bicycle <b>pedal</b> <b>cover.</b> The fraud was soon discovered when Honda started to make forged stamps for other children. Honda was unaware that the stamp was supposed to be mirror-imaged. His family name 本田 was symmetrical when written vertically, so it did not cause a problem, but some of other children's family names were not.|$|E

5000|$|The toccata {{starts with}} a large linear canon (imitation theme, one hand imitating the other) over a pedal point in F major. It is then {{followed}} by a pedal solo vamping material from the canon. The canon is reiterated with some variations in the dominant in C major. This time the hands are switched, and the left hand leads the right. This is again followed by a long pedal solo. The two large canon flourishes cover 108 measures of the composition. The <b>pedal</b> solos <b>cover</b> 60 measures. The concerto movement exhibits a seven-part structure. The canons and pedal solos effect the departure from the home key of F to the dominant C, and the entire rest of the movement, with its concertante 3-part imitation and striking [...] "proto-waltzes", constitute the harmonic return. This formal pattern is unique within Bach's œuvre.|$|R
50|$|When {{his friend}} Claude Debussy was {{composing}} new pieces for the piano, he would often ask Philipp {{for advice on}} notation so that pianists {{would be able to}} better understand his nuances and approach. After considerable deliberation, they both decided that almost no pedal markings should be used in any of the published pieces. Their reasoning is that every piano is different in quality, every room or hall is different in size and resonance, and each pianist has different capabilities. To lock in one form of <b>pedaling</b> to <b>cover</b> all possible circumstances would place the pedaling notation above the effects that Debussy wished to achieve. Therefore, they decided that pedaling should be noted only where it is absolutely necessary, and gave discretion to the pianist to use it as needed. Although this has often been abused by some pianists who use it to cloud the harmonies, or achieve a very dry sound, it remains a point of discussion for every pianist who chooses to perform Debussy's piano works.|$|R
