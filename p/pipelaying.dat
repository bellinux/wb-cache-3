5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of <b>pipelaying,</b> Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when <b>pipelaying</b> could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1969, the {{pipeline}} crossed the Laotian frontier through the Mu Gia Pass and, by 1970, {{it reached the}} approaches to the A Shau Valley in South Vietnam. The plastic pipeline, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, managed to transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all through the same pipe. Due {{to the efforts of}} the PAVN 592nd <b>Pipelaying</b> Regiment, the number of pipelines entering Laos increased to six that year.|$|E
500|$|Even though winter {{shut down}} all <b>pipelaying</b> {{on the right}} of way, work on the pump {{stations}} and in Valdez continued without stop. At Pump Station 1, in Prudhoe Bay, temperatures reached lower than , but the work continued. Because the pump station was the origin point for the main pipeline, it also had to process the feeder lines coming from oil wells. The pump station camp had a population of 270 workers through the winter, and it would peak in the summer with 430 workers.|$|E
5000|$|The company spent {{its early}} days {{developing}} {{the concept of}} dynamically positioned (DP) subsea <b>pipelay.</b> Allseas acquired the former bulk carrier “Natalie Bolten” in 1985 and converted it for DP <b>pipelay</b> at the Boele shipyard in Bolnes, the Netherlands. The vessel was christened Lorelay in Rotterdam on 26 April 1986. Lorelay immediately entered service and successfully executed her first <b>pipelay</b> contract, the 8-inch, 1.8-km Helder A-B pipeline, for Unocal in the Dutch sector of the North Sea.|$|R

500|$|The first {{purchase}} order, for [...] of 24-inch-diameter pipe, {{was placed on}} July 2, 1942. To meet a construction deadline of January 1, 1943, the laying of pipe began on August 3, 1942, near Little Rock. Other pipeline crews began work immediately on segments elsewhere in Arkansas and Texas. By September 10 all eight <b>pipelaying</b> crews, each consisting of between 300 and 400 men, were in the field working. The schedule called for [...] of the Big Inch pipeline to be laid each day. But soon men were laying as much as [...] a day. In all, roughly [...] of material were excavated. Oil began flowing through the Big Inch Line between Texas and Illinois on New Year's Eve 1942. Work on the Little Big Inch then began in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Offshore {{gas and oil}} {{development}} in the Okhotsk Sea within [...] of the primary feeding ground off northeast Sakhalin Island is of particular concern. Activities related to oil and gas exploration, including geophysical seismic surveying, <b>pipelaying</b> and drilling operations, increased vessel traffic, and oil spills, all pose potential threats to western gray whales. Disturbance from underwater industrial noise may displace whales from critical feeding habitat. Physical habitat damage from drilling and dredging operations, combined with possible impacts of oil and chemical spills on benthic prey communities also warrants concern.|$|E

50|$|The {{firing line}} {{comprises}} the fixed <b>pipelay</b> ramp, enclosed {{in the central}} housing, running along the longitudinal centreline of the vessel. It is connected to an internal and external ramp, {{both of which have}} adjustable inclination to facilitate <b>pipelay</b> in varying water depths. A ramp extension unit is available for use in deep water or for severe seabed conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Allseas {{operates}} a versatile fleet of specialised heavy-lift, <b>pipelay</b> and subsea installation vessels designed and developed in-house. The company has installed over 20,000 km of subsea pipeline worldwide using S-lay technology, with diameters ranging from 2” to 48”. [...] Allseas’ launched its first vessel Lorelay, the world’s first <b>pipelay</b> vessel {{to operate on}} full dynamic positioning, in 1986.|$|R

50|$|A <b>pipelaying</b> ship is a {{maritime}} vessel used in {{the construction}} of subsea infrastructure. It serves to connect oil production platforms with refineries on shore. To accomplish this goal a typical <b>pipelaying</b> vessel carries a heavy lift crane, used to install pumps and valves, and equipment to lay pipe between subsea structures.|$|E

50|$|The Castoro Sei is {{equipped}} with 2 rotating gantry cranes 134 tonnes capacity, three 130 tonnes pipe tensioners and a 400 tonnes abandon and recovery winch for <b>pipelaying.</b> She provides accommodation for 354 persons.|$|E
50|$|Allseas {{added the}} shallow water <b>pipelay</b> and {{construction}} barge Tog Mor to its fleet in 2002. Solitaire’s S-lay capacity was increased to a holding force of 1,050 t in 2005, enabling her to lay the heaviest pipelines in unprecedented water depths. The same year Allseas launched the dynamically positioned support vessel Calamity Jane. The 225 m long dynamically positioned <b>pipelay</b> vessel Audacia became operational two years later.|$|R

50|$|Finally in June 2007 {{there was}} a one-foot-deep flood in the area after a major but {{temporary}} National Grid gas-pipeline-laying operation. Very wide paths of earth were exposed and compacted for the <b>pipelaying</b> further upstream during the works, encouraging sudden, fast drainage across acres of bare earth into the river after heavy storms, and the beck ran too full for the first time. In a similar situation at Peckham in 2003, some residents suggested {{that the process of}} laying a pipeline had encouraged flooding; however this was denied by the <b>pipelaying</b> company Weeks, and by the Council which had responsibility for overseeing the works. According to the Natural Gas Forum, the proper procedure when <b>pipelaying</b> is to erect barriers to prevent massive, sudden storm water runoff into streams, when swathes of bare earth are exposed. Compacted soil from large-scale works can lead to increased runoff and higher peak storm flows into streams. Therefore, all of the above flooding was apparently due to human agency; no evidence has been discovered so far of the existence of a floodplain here.|$|E
50|$|Lay methods {{consist of}} J-lay and S-lay {{and can be}} reel-lay or welded length by length. <b>Pipelaying</b> ships make use of dynamic {{positioning}} systems or anchor spreads to maintain the correct position and speed while laying pipe.|$|E
50|$|Broadhaven Bay has {{in recent}} years (approx 2002-2014 and ongoing) been {{the site of the}} Corrib gas {{controversy}} where Royal Dutch Shell sent the Solitaire, reputedly the largest <b>pipelaying</b> ship in the world, into the bay to lay an offshore section of proposed extremely high pressure gas.|$|E
5000|$|Twenty {{years after}} the {{original}} idea was conceived, in 2007 Allseas announced plans to build Pieter Schelte, a twin-hulled platform installation / decommissioning and <b>pipelay</b> vessel. [...] Named after the offshore pioneer Pieter Schelte (father of the Allseas’ owner and founder Edward Heerema), the design featured a lifting system at its bow for lifting platform topsides up to 48,000 t and a lifting system at its stern for lifting steel jackets up to 25,000 t. The design also included <b>pipelay</b> equipment to handle pipe diameters ranging from 6 - 68 inches at water depths exceeding 4000 m (13,100 ft.).|$|R

50|$|It {{was built}} in 1972 as a bulk carrier and {{launched}} under the name Trentwood by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries at their shipyard in Hiroshima, Japan, and later converted to a pipe-laying vessel between 1996 and 1998 at Swan Hunter Shipyard on Tyneside in England.

40|$|As a {{traditional}} offshore <b>pipelay</b> technology, S-lay is still frequently utilized {{even in the}} deep water <b>pipelays.</b> It has two important devices: stinger and tensioner. Stinger controls the overbend of pipeline. Its geometry, length, and curvature, are the function of water depth, lay tension requirement and geometry and material of the pipeline. In this paper, an analytical method and the finite element methods are presented for researching the relationships of these parameters. Suggestions on the conceptual design of a novel deepwater stinger and the upgrade of an actual stinger have been provided as a favor of decision-making.

25|$|Other sensors {{depend on}} the kind of ship.
