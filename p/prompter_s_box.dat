Encryption algorithm {{plays a major}} role in network application and data security systems. But securing data consumes a major amount of resources such as CPU time and battery power. We also focus on improvising the performance and security provided by the blowfish encryption algorithm. With advancement in technology, DES is found to be no longer secure. As a drop-in replacement for DES, blowfish encryption algorithm can be used. The blowfish algorithm which was originally 64 -bit block cipher is transformed into 128 -bit block cipher. This paper also proposes various modifications in the blowfish algorithm such as a new logic has been incorporated instead of just replicating the bits in the key expansion part. In Blowfish algorithm there are four <b>S</b> <b>boxes</b> each with 256 entries which consume a memory space. Hence this paper proposes an alternative to replace these <b>boxes</b> with AES <b>S</b> <b>box</b> and mix column techniques.

The <b>S</b> <b>box</b> RNA is the most wide spread transcriptional riboswitch in Gram -positive bacteria, while the SMK RNA is a translational riboswitch in members of the Lactobacillales.

With the increasing use of digital techniques for transmitting and storing Multimedia data, the fundamental issue of protecting the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the information poses a major challenge for security professionals and hassled to the major developments in Cryptography. In cryptography, an S-Box (Substitution-box) is a basic componentof symmetric key algorithms, which performs substitution and is typically used to make the relationship between the key and the cipher text non linear and most of the symmetric key algorithms like DES, Blowfish makes use of <b>S</b> <b>boxes.</b> This paper proposes a new method for design of <b>S</b> <b>boxes</b> based on chaos theory. Chaotic equations are popularly known for its randomness, extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and ergodicity.

However every new key requires pre-processing equivalent to encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers and it prevents its usage in memory limited applications and embedded systems. The modified design of S boxesmaintains the non linearity [3] [5] and key dependency factors of <b>S</b> <b>boxes</b> with a major reduction in time complexity of generation of <b>S</b> <b>boxes</b> and P arrays.

40|$|Modulation of the {{structure}} of a leader RNA to control formation of an intrinsic termination signal is a common mechanism for regulation of gene expression in bacteria. Expression of the <b>S</b> <b>box</b> genes in Gram-positive organisms is induced in response to limitation for methionine.

In this study, we show that efficient termination of the <b>S</b> <b>box</b> leader region by bacterial RNA polymerase depends on SAM but not on methionine or other related compounds. We also show that SAM directly binds to and induces a conformational change in the leader RNA. Both binding of SAM and SAM-directed transcription termination were blocked by leader mutations that cause constitutive expression in vivo. Overproduction of SAM synthetase in Bacillus subtilis resulted in delay in induction of <b>S</b> <b>box</b> gene expression in response to methionine starvation, consistent with the hypothesis that SAM is the molecular effector in vivo.

40|$|Tightly {{regulated}} {{expression of}} {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class II genes is critical for the immune system. A conserved regulatory module consisting of four cis-acting elements, the W, X, X 2 and Y boxes, controls transcription of MHC class II genes. The X, X 2, and Y boxes are bound, respectively, by RFX, CREB, and NF-Y to form a MHC class II-specific enhanceosome complex. The latter constitutes a landing pad for recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator CIITA. In contrast to the well defined roles of the X, X 2, and Y boxes, {{the role of the}} W region has remained controversial. In vitro binding studies have suggested that it might contain a second RFX-binding site. We demonstrate here by means of promoter pull-down assays that the most conserved subsequence within the W region, called the <b>S</b> <b>box,</b> is a critical determinant for tethering of CIITA to the enhanceosome complex. Binding of CIITA to the enhanceosome requires both integrity of the <b>S</b> <b>box</b> and a remarkably stringent spacing between the <b>S</b> and X <b>boxes.</b> Even a 1 - 2 -base pair change in the native S-X distance is detrimental for CIITA recruitment and promoter function. In contrast to current models, binding of RFX to a putative duplicated binding site in the W box is thus not required for either CIITA recruitment or promoter activity. This paves the way for the identification of novel factors mediating the contribution of the <b>S</b> <b>box</b> to the activation of MHC class II promoters...|$|R
