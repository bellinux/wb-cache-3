5000|$|Distributing {{very long}} {{one-time}} pad keys is inconvenient and usually poses a significant security risk. The pad {{is essentially the}} encryption key, but unlike keys for modern ciphers, it must be extremely long and is much too difficult for humans to remember. Storage media such as thumb drives, DVD-Rs or personal digital audio players {{can be used to}} carry a very large one-time-pad from place to place in a non-suspicious way, but even so the need to transport the pad physically is a burden compared to the key negotiation protocols of a modern public-key cryptosystem, and such media cannot reliably be erased securely by any means short of physical destruction (e.g., incineration). A 4.7 GB DVD-R full of one-time-pad data, if shredded into particles 1 mm² in size, leaves over 4 megabits of (admittedly hard to recover, but not impossibly so) data on each particle. [...] In addition, the risk of compromise during transit (for example, a pickpocket swiping, copying and replacing the pad) is likely to be much greater in practice than the likelihood of compromise for a cipher such as AES. Finally, the effort needed to manage one-time <b>pad</b> <b>key</b> material scales very badly for large networks of communicants—the number of pads required goes up as the square of the number of users freely exchanging messages. For communication between only two persons, or a star network topology, this is less of a problem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{data stream}} {{generated}} from hysteresis-based multi-scroll chaos is proposed in this paper. The mathematical {{model of the}} multi-scroll chaotic attractor is a continuous-time linear third-order system with a feedback of hysteresis-series. The pseudo random data stream is generated from the state values of the third-order systems at the instance of hysteresis switching. Thanks to the complicated dynamical behavior of the multi-scroll chaotic attractor, the resulted data stream demonstrates highly unpredictability which is ideal for security use. Due to the simplicity of system model, the data stream can be generated in resource limited environment, such as mobile computing environment and wireless sensors. The data stream generation has been implemented in mobile phones with J 2 ME. It {{has the potential to}} be used as one time <b>pad</b> <b>key</b> in protecting information in ubiquitous computing environment. The resulting cipher can achieve high security strength with low cost. Keywords-chaos; mobile; security; ubiquitous computing I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} whether ethnic groups {{differ in the}} prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We compared {{the distribution of the}} ankle–brachial index (ABI), a measure of PAD, between African Americans and non-Hispanic white individuals. Subjects (n ˆ 931) belonged to the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study, a community-based study of hypertensive sibships, and included 453 African Americans from Jackson, Mississipi (mean age 72 6 years, 69 % women) and 478 non-Hispanic white individuals from Rochester, Minnesota (mean age 58 7 years, 64 % women). ABI was deter-mined at two sites in each lower extremity and the lowest of four indices was used in the analyses. PAD was de ned as an ABI of 0. 95. Information about conventional risk factors was derived from interviews and from blood samples drawn at the study visit. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertensionwas signi cantly higher in African Americans than in non-Hispanic white individuals. After adjusting for age, African American subjects had a lower mean ABI (women 0. 97 vs 1. 04, p < 0. 001; men 0. 96 vs 1. 12, p < 0. 001) and a greater prevalence of PAD (women 34 % vs 22 %, p ˆ 0. 010; men 33 % vs 11 %, p < 0. 001) than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. In multiple regression analyses, African American ethnicity was a predictor of a lower ABI and the presence of PAD in each sex after adjusting for age and other conventional risk factors. In conclusion, the lower ABI and greater prevalence of PAD in African Americans than in non-Hispanic white individuals is not explained by differences in conventional risk fac-tors. Identifying additional ‘novel ’ risk factors that account for the ethnic differences in PAD is an important next step towards understanding why such differences exist and developing more effective strategies to reduce the burden of <b>PAD.</b> <b>Key</b> words: ankle–brachial index; ethnicity; peripheral arterial disease; risk factor...|$|E
50|$|The numpad {{or number}} <b>pad</b> <b>keys</b> are used quite often, but is used mostly in driving {{simulator}} games. This is mainly because these games usually {{have quite a}} large amount of keys needed to control the vehicle properly and the number pad will have plenty of keys for that particular use. Another reason this is commonly used is because left-handed players will find this a more comfortable position than the IJKL keys (see above), and the number <b>pad</b> has less <b>keys</b> around it, thus it is less likely the player will hit the wrong key by mistake.|$|R
50|$|Ring keys {{virtually}} {{eliminated the}} problems of cross-fingerings. These rings surround the tone holes so that when a finger covers the tone hole, it also pushes a metal ring down to a level flush with {{the top of the}} hole. The ring, in turn, is connected to a long axle (borrowed directly from Boehm's flute), which then causes another hole located elsewhere on the instrument to be covered by a <b>padded</b> <b>key.</b>|$|R

50|$|Each mission {{requires}} that the player bomb a specific target from a specific altitude. There is no strict time limit, but the amount of fuel the plane can carry is limited. The player decides upon take off how much fuel to carry and whether to carry an extra-heavy load of bombs. The player then moves his plane to the target using the number <b>pad</b> <b>keys,</b> and on each turn may ascend or descend in 5,000 foot increments. When the bomber is over the target, the player is meant to wait until there is no cloud cover before dropping the bombs. When the player is over an enemy target {{and there is no}} cloud cover, the enemy will typically fire flak, which can damage the plane, injure or kill crewmen, or set the plane on fire. The lower the bomber's altitude, the more intense the flak will be. The bomber may also be strafed by enemy fighter planes, such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Messerschmitt Bf 109, or Messerschmitt Bf 110.|$|R

50|$|The touch tone <b>key</b> <b>pad</b> has sixteen <b>keys</b> {{laid out}} in a four-by-four matrix. Each key {{produces}} a combination of two audible tone frequencies, determined by their position on the pad. Each column and row has a distinct frequency assigned, thus generating a total of sixteen dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals. Early keypads only used the keys with the digits 1 through 9 and 0. The extra keys were intended for computer data entry, business functions, and military applications. By 1967, the keys with the asterisk (*) and hash (#) were added on all subscriber telephone sets. The keys A, B, C, D were used as priority signals (FO, F, I, and P) in the Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) of the US military.|$|R
