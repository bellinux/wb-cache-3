40|$|It is {{well known}} that ultranarrow electromagnetically induced {{transparency}} (EIT) resonances can be observed in atomic gases at room temperature. We report here the experimental observation of another type of ultranarrow resonances, as narrow as the EIT ones, in a Λ-system selected by light polarization in metastable 4 He at room temperature. It is shown to be due to coherent population oscillations in an open two-level system (TLS). For perpendicular linearly polarized coupling and probe beams, this system can be considered as two coupled open TLSs, in which the ground state populations exhibit anti-phase oscillations. We also predict theoretically that in case of two <b>parallel</b> <b>polarizations,</b> the system would behave like a closed TLS, and the narrow resonance associated with these oscillations would disappear.

40|$|International audienceA {{review of}} recent {{simulation}} and {{experimental studies of}} the colliding pulse injection scheme is presented. One dimensional particle in cell simulations show that when the colliding pulses have <b>parallel</b> <b>polarizations,</b> the dominant effects {{that have to be}} considered for modeling electron injection in plasma waves are (i) stochastic heating and (ii) wakefield inhibition at the collision. With cross polarized pulses, injection of an electron beam is still possible because stochastic heating still occurs. However, it is found numerically that the injection threshold is higher in this case. The simulations also underline the possibility of tuning the electron beam parameters by modifying the injection laser pulse. Experiments (i) validate these scenarios and show that stable and high quality electron beams are produced when two counterpropagating laser pulses collide in an underdense plasma and (ii) confirm very clearly the existence of a threshold for injection, which is higher with cross polarized pulses than with parallel polarized pulses...|$|R

40|$|Recording {{with both}} {{parallel}} and orthogonal linearly polarized lights, polarization holographic storage in genetic mutant BR-D 96 N film is reported with both transmission type geometry and reflection type geometry. Polarization properties of diffraction light and scattering light are discussed for two different cases, <b>parallel</b> <b>polarization</b> recording and orthogonal polarization recording. It shows that, compared with recording with <b>parallel</b> <b>polarization</b> lights, orthogonal polarization holography can separate the diffraction {{light from the}} scattering noise, therefore improving the signal-to-noise ratio. It also shows that, compared with reconstruction with reference light, reconstruction with phase conjugated wave of the reference light can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed diffraction image, and also the wave-front aberration of the object light introduced by irregular phase object in the optical pass-way can also be corrected effectively, which ensures that the reconstructed diffraction image has a better fidelity.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{moments for}} the amide bands from beta-sheet peptide structures {{generally do not}} exhibit axial symmetry about the director in linearly polarized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements on oriented systems. The angular dependences of the dichroic ratios of the amide bands are derived for beta-sheet structures in attenuated total reflection (ATR) and polarized transmission experiments on samples that are {{oriented with respect to}} the normal to the substrate and are randomly distributed with respect to the azimuthal angle in the plane of the orienting substrate. The orientational distributions of both the beta-strands and the beta-sheets are considered, and explicit expressions are given for the dichroic ratios of the amide I and amide II bands. The dichroic ratio of the amide II band, which is parallel polarized, can yield the orientation of the beta-strands directly, but to specify the orientations of the beta-sheets completely requires measurement of the dichroic ratios of both the amide I and amide II bands, or generally two bands with <b>parallel</b> and perpendicular <b>polarizations.</b> A random distribution in tilt of the planes of the beta-sheets does not give rise to equal dichroic ratios for bands with perpendicular and <b>parallel</b> <b>polarizations,</b> such as the amide I and amide II bands.

An analysis in three dimensions confirmed the direction of the elongation to be <b>parallel</b> to the <b>polarization</b> direction of the incident beam. The phenomenon could be explained by a photoinduced vibration and/or transport of the molecules <b>parallel</b> to the <b>polarization</b> direction of the incident beam to generate a force exerted by the particles to push the surrounding gel away in the direction <b>parallel</b> to the <b>polarization</b> direction. Photoinduced elongation was promoted by a high Tg for the material but impeded by the introduction of bulky substituents {{at both ends of the}} azobenzene moiety.
