50|$|With {{increasing}} turbine entry temperature, it {{is important}} to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena occurring during creep deformation of single crystal superalloys under such extreme condition (i.e. high temperature and high stress). The creep deformation behavior of superalloy single crystal is strongly temperature, stress, orientation and alloy dependent. For a single-crystal superalloy, there are 3 different mode of creep deformation under regimes of different temperature and stress: Rafting, Tertiary and Primary. At low temperature (~750 °C), SX alloys exhibits mostly <b>primary</b> <b>creep</b> behavior. Matan et al. concluded that the extent of <b>primary</b> <b>creep</b> deformation depends strongly on the angle between the tensile axis and the <001>/<011> symmetry boundary. At temperature above 850 °C, tertiary creep dominates and promotes strain softening behavior. When temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the rafting effect is prevalent where cubic particles transform into flat shapes under tensile stress The rafts would also form perpendicular to the tensile axis, since γ phase was transported out of the vertical channels and into the horizontal ones. After conducting unaxial creep deformation of <001> orientated CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy at 1105 °C and 100 MPa, Reed et al. has established that rafting is beneficial to creep life since it delays evolution of creep strain. In addition, rafting would occur quickly and suppress the accumulation of creep strain until a critical strain is reached.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{numerical}} model based on static fatigue laws {{in order to}} model the time-dependent damage and deformation of rocks under creep. An empirical relation between time to failure and applied stress is used to simulate the behavior of each element of our finite element model. We review available data on creep experiments in order to study how the material properties and the loading conditions control the failure time. The main parameter that controls the failure time is the applied stress. Two commonly used models, an exponential tfexp (bs/s 0) and a power law function tfsb 0 fit the data as well. These time-to-failure laws are used at the scale of each element to simulate its damage {{as a function of}} its stress history. An element is damaged by decreasing its Young's modulus to simulate the effect of increasing crack density at smaller scales. Elastic interactions between elements and heterogeneity of the mechanical properties lead to the emergence of a complex macroscopic behavior, which is richer than the elementary one. In particular, we observe <b>primary</b> and tertiary <b>creep</b> regimes associated respectively with a power law decay and increase of the rate of strain, damage event and energy release. Our model produces a power law distribution of damage event sizes, with an average size that increases with time as a power law until macroscopic failure. Damage localization emerges at the transition between <b>primary</b> and tertiary <b>creep,</b> when damage rate starts accelerating. The final state of the simulation shows highly damaged bands, similar to shear bands observed in laboratory experiments. The thickness and the orientation of these bands depend on the applied stress.

30|$|Thermomechanical {{exposure}} {{results in}} internal cavitation (void development) {{as a type}} of stress-induced damage. Cavity nucleation, growth, and coalescence are a <b>primary</b> cause of <b>creep</b> rupture. Cavity nucleation requires significant stress concentration orders of magnitude greater than the applied stress (Evans 1984; Kassner & Hayes 2003). Stress concentrations also aid cavity nuclei growth during its incipient stages, although initial growth is also aided by absorption of lattice vacancies (Greenwood et al. 1954). Grain boundary sliding and dislocation pile-up generate sufficient local stresses to promote cavity formation, particularly at precipitates located at grain boundaries (Yoo and Trinkaus 1986; Trinkaus and Yoo 1987). Existing cavities also cause stress concentrations resulting in new cavity formation with increasing creep strain (Anderson and Shewmon 2000). Once formed, cavity growth is primarily driven by two mechanisms: vacancy diffusion and creep plasticity (Hulla and Rimmera 1959; Hancock 1976; Raj and Ashby 1975). Comparison of diffusive cavity growth and plastic cavity growth has demonstrated cavities grow faster when driven by plasticity. Grain boundary sliding has also been considered a mechanism for cavity growth (Chen 1983).|$|R
