5|$|Ryan White was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana {{who became}} a national <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> HIV/AIDS in the United States after being expelled from school because of his infection. A hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment and, when diagnosed in 1984, was given six months to live. Though doctors said he posed no risk to other students, AIDS was poorly understood at the time, and when White tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied against his attendance.

5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E
5|$|The {{publicity}} of Ryan White's story catapulted {{him into}} the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media. Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled. While isolated in middle school, White appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease. Eventually, he became known as a <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> the AIDS crisis, appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. Ryan participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with Ryan, starting during his trial and continuing {{for the rest of}} his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Singers John Cougar Mellencamp, Elton John and Michael Jackson, actor Matt Frewer, diver Greg Louganis, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop, Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all befriended White. He also was a friend to many children with AIDS or other potentially debilitating conditions.|$|E

He has attributed his unlikely survival to heroic efforts of his older brother Naphtali Lau-Lavie who concealed him, at constant risk, and enlisted other prisoners in this effort. Yisrael Meir was freed from the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945. He became a <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> miraculous survival, and the inhumanity of the Nazi regime, after U.S. Army chaplain Rabbi Herschel Schacter detected him hiding behind a heap of corpses when the camp was liberated. Lau has credited a teen prisoner with protecting him in the camp (later determined by historian Kenneth Waltzer to be Fedor Mikhailichenko).

40|$|The Mexican artists Nahum B. Zenil and Julio Galán {{have become}} the <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> being gay and Mexican in {{contemporary}} art criticism. Critics have drawn comparisons between Zenil and Galán because of their thematic treatment of gay sexuality and Mexican nationalism. These comparisons, however, have often assumed that Zenil and Galán are representing a monolithic gay sexuality that is unaffected by their social class, their relationships to nationalism and Catholicism, and {{their views on the}} role of art in social activism. This paper aims to analyze specifically how Zenil and Galán represent two distinct gay identities, all the while employing the similar themes of suffering, the vulnerability of the gay male body, and the use of nationalist and Catholic symbols. Through a close reading of visual texts and the methodological lens of queer theory and art history, the paper will show that both artists represent homosexuality as a social construction that is influenced by the other identity categories the artists inhabit...|$|R

Hurd pointed out that Human Torres looked like [...] "a <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> the cult of white womanhood", while Klingon Torres had more stereotypical African-American features, such as dark skin and kinky hair. Torres' final statement that she will always experience internal conflict was identified as a marker of mental instability by Hurd, who felt such behavior was normalized in hybrid characters. Allen Kwan also cited the episode's final scene as a negative commentary on race in his article [...] "Seeking New Civilizations: Race Normativity in the Star Trek Franchise".

Any attempt to narrowly define statistics (it is estimation, it is prediction, it is decision theory, it is model selection) is doomed. But I will not be going too far {{out on a limb}} to state that one major theme of classical statistics is significance testing, that is, deciding whether what is seen is real or merely a chance occurrence. Even a fair coin is unlikely to land heads exactly 50 times in 100 flips. Permutation tests, also called randomization tests, are the <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> classical significance testing. The canonical “pure ” randomization situation starts with a number of people, and randomly assigns half to receive a drug, and half to receive a placebo. The null hypothesis is that the drug and placebo have the same effect.

The question is whether, assuming the null hypothesis is true, the observed test statistic looks extreme enough to cause one t...|$|R

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have commented on Shikamaru's character. IGN stated that Shikamaru {{was one of their}} favorite characters in the series, and referred to him as [...] "the <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> any card-carrying member of Generation X" [...] due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential. In a review of episode 110, IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair. Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru's emergence as [...] "an unlikely hero" [...] {{one of the highlights of}} the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru's team were critically injured, IGN lauded the [...] "great moment" [...] in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich celebrated his [...] "sheer intellect", calling him [...] "one of the most fascinating characters in the series" [...] and [...] "one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen anime". Dani Moure, another reviewer from the same site, noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was [...] "one of the better fights involving the supporting players".|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new <b>poster</b> <b>child</b> <b>for</b> everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|R
40|$|Marked by a {{sense of}} rupture and discontinuity, the post-war {{generation}} of Turkey yearned for a sense of belonging and legacy. Atatürk, whose name literally means 'Father of the Turks', gave them all and more. Turks became the heirs of a future that was difficult to foresee but was painted for them in the most vivid colours. Women were Atatürk's passion and the true force majeure of his reforms. They became the <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> his reforms at home and gave him cult status abroad. After a failed marriage to Latife Hanoum, the adoption and education of young girls became Atatürk's obsession. It is through the memoirs, letter and interviews of Afet Inan, Sabiha Gökçen and Ülkü Adatepe, that we get the most intimate glimpse into the private quarters of Kemal Mustafa Atatürk. Theirs were lives purposely lived {{out in front of the}} eyes of a nation which struggled and dreamt of a better future, much as they did. At the roots of their - and the nation's - memory lay rupture. At once rejecting their own familial past and choosing orphanhood, their political birth coincided with Atatürk's appearance in their lives - much like the rest of Turkey. My essay takes us onto a time travel into the flamboyant houses of Turkey's founder and first president, Kemal Mustafa Atatürk and challenges us to rethink our notion of Turkey as a nation caught between East and West, when it actually was, and remains to be, a country looking for its past in an uncertain future...|$|R

40|$|The multimillion-dollar {{lobbying}} {{effort to}} repeal the federal estate tax has been aggressively led by 18 super-wealthy families, according this report by Public Citizen and United for a Fair Economy. The report details {{for the first time}} the vast money, influence and deceptive marketing techniques behind the rhetoric in the campaign {{to repeal the}} tax. It reveals how 18 families worth a total of $ 185. 5 billion have financed and coordinated a 10 -year effort to repeal the estate tax, a move that would collectively net them a windfall of $ 71. 6 billion. The report profiles the families and their businesses, which include the families behind Wal-Mart, Gallo wine, Campbell's soup, and Mars Inc., maker of M&Ms. Collectively, the list includes the first- and third-largest privately held companies in the United States, the richest family in Alabama and the world's largest retailer. These families have sought to keep their activities anonymous by using associations to represent them and by forming a massive coalition of business and trade associations dedicated to pushing for estate tax repeal. The report details the groups they have hidden behind [...] the trade associations they have used, the lobbyists they have hired, and the anti-estate tax political action committees, 527 s and organizations to which they have donated heavily. In a massive public relations campaign, the families have also misled the country by giving the mistaken impression that the estate tax affects most Americans. In particular, they have used small businesses and family farms as <b>poster</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> repeal, saying that the estate tax destroys both of these groups. But just more than one-fourth of one percent of all estates will owe any estate taxes in 2006.
