5|$|A third {{possibility}} is {{the involvement of}} a third body or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior, and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars, <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked a turning <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions {{have come to}} play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, al-Rahba was {{situated}} near the tribal {{territory of the}} Al Fadl. About four hundred Al Fadl tribesmen joined the small army of Caliph al-Mustansir, the Egypt-based Abbasid caliph dispatched by Baybars to recapture Baghdad from the Mongols, when he reached al-Rahba. The latter was al-Mustansir's first stop after he rode out from Damascus, but his campaign ultimately failed and {{he was killed in}} a Mongol ambush in al-Anbar. The Mongols of Ilkhanid Iraq inflicted significant damage on al-Rahba during their wars with the Mamluks. The fortress was restored by Baybars at some <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> the end of his reign. In 1279, the Mamluk viceroy of Syria, Sunqur al-Ashqar, rebelled against Sultan Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) and took refuge with the Al Fadl chieftain, Isa ibn Muhanna, at al-Rahba, where he requested the intervention of the Mongol ruler Abaqa Khan. When the Mongols could not help him, Sunqur fled the incoming Mamluk army, while Isa barricaded himself in the fortress. The Mongols' failure to capture al-Rahba after a month-long siege commanded by the Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü in 1312/13 marked the Ilkhanate's final attempt to invade Mamluk Syria. Isa's son Muhanna rebelled against Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341) in 1320, and was pursued by the Mamluk army as far al-Rahba. During the ensuing confrontation, the fortress may have been destroyed.|$|E

25|$|After some {{massive stars}} have ceased {{thermonuclear}} fusion, {{a portion of}} their mass collapses into a compact body of neutrons called a neutron star.

25|$|Gaius Calvisius Sabinus is {{the only}} member of the gens Calvisia listed in Broughton's Magistrates of the Roman Republic as holding office during the Republican era. He is one several novi homines ("new men") who {{achieved}} not only the consulship but triumphal honors during the 30s BC. He is the first consul whose nomen gentilicium has the non-Latin ending -isius. The ethnic cognomen Sabinus ("Sabine") is found with the nomen Calvisius for the first time in his name, but inscriptions <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> a probable origin in the Latin colony of Spoletium (Spoleto).

25|$|Emulsifying agent (lecithin) used in {{mayonnaise}} {{are able}} to suspend oil droplets in water because it lowers the interfacial tension γ between oil and water. When emulsifying agent, lecithin, {{is added to the}} oil and water emulsion, they form a layer between the two different liquids, with their hydrophobic tail <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> the non-polar oil droplet, and their hydrophilic end facing the polar water molecules. This reduces the interfacial tension γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules. Hence, a large increase of surface area (ΔA) is made possible because energy cost to arrive at the food state is now favorable.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, marine {{forensic}} investigators {{considered that}} {{an explosion in}} the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> a failure, of one sort or another, in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines.|$|E
25|$|These basic shapes are {{modified}} {{with lines}} jutting from {{their faces and}} corners to represent fingers that are not positioned as described above. Straight lines represent straight fingers (these may be {{at an angle to}} indicate that they are not in line with the palm; if they <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> or away from the signer, they have a diamond shape at the tip); curved lines for curved (cupped) fingers; hooked lines for hooked fingers; right-angle lines, for fingers bent at only one joint; and crossed lines, for crossed fingers, as shown in the chart at right. The pentagon and C are only modified to show that the fingers are spread rather than in contact; the angle is only modified to show whether the thumb touches the finger tips or juts out to the side. Although there are some generalizations which can be made for the dozens of other glyphs, which are based on the circle and square, the details are somewhat idiosyncratic and each needs to be memorized.|$|E
25|$|Solar output also varies on shorter time scales, {{including}} the 11-year solar cycle and longer-term modulations. Solar intensity variations possibly {{as a result}} of the Wolf, Spörer and Maunder Minimum are considered to have been influential in triggering the Little Ice Age, and some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950. The cyclical nature of the Sun's energy output is not yet fully understood; it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the Sun as it ages and evolves. Research indicates that solar variability has had effects {{including the}} Maunder minimum from 1645 to 1715 A.D., part of the Little Ice Age from 1550 to 1850 A.D. that was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward. Some studies <b>point</b> <b>toward</b> solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming, and climate may be influenced by the sum of all effects (solar variation, anthropogenic radiative forcings, etc.).|$|E
