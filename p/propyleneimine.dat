50|$|Poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> dendrosome based genetic {{immunization}} against Hepatitis B {{was found to}} be highly effective as compared to Dendrimer-Plasmid DNA complex. It has been postulated that in dendrosomes, the poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> dendrimer-DNA complex is largely protected by multilamelarity of the vesicles. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that the lipoidal layers of the dendrosomes modifies the release pattern of the poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> dendrimer -DNA complex, while some of the larger vesicles remain at the site of injection following their degradation by tissue phospholipases, the smaller ones delivering and transfecting efficiently the antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the draining lymph nodes. Dendrosomes have also been explored for the delivery of s10siRNA targeting E6/E7 oncogenes in cervical cancer. It has been reported that polyamidoamine dendrimer based dendrosomes are efficient systems for the delivery of siRNA for effective management of cervical cancer.|$|E
40|$|D. Phil. (Chemistry) The {{application}} of dendritic-based materials has attracted great interest. For {{the first time}} this research has investigated the feasibility of poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> (PPI) dendrimers and hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (HPEI) in combination with beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD) embedded in polysulfone (PSf) membrane for water treatment. The advantage of embedding these conjugates (β-CD-PPI and β-CD-HPEI) in PSf membranes is the presence of numerous nanocavities which can act as water channels allowing easy water passage through the membrane improving water permeability. Secondly, the presence of functional groups such as –OH and –NH greatly improves hydrophilicity of membranes. Commercial polysulfone (PSf) ultrafiltration membranes were crosslinked with β-cyclodextrin-poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> (β-CD-PPI) and β-cyclodextrin-hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (β-CD-HPEI) using trimesoyl chloride (TMC) by interfacial polymerisation. These membranes were used in the rejection of Aldrich humic acid (molecular weight: 4. 1 kDa) from synthetic water samples prepared in the laboratory. Moreover, β-cyclodextrin-poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> (β-CD-PPI) was used as a host for the preparation of Fe/Ni nanoparticles. The new membranes were synthesised by crosslinking β-CD-PPI with trimesoyl chloride and subsequently loading Fe/Ni nanoparticles and this was supported on a commercial polysulphone (PSf) layer for the degradation of 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (2, 4, 6 -TCP). The membrane surfaces were characterised using Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflectance (FT-IR/ATR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), water-contact angle, and water-intake capacity [...] ...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} the specific migration of aziridine (ethyleneimine) into food simulants at trace levels is described. The method comprises a two-phase (aqueous-organic solvent) derivatization procedure with 4 -fluorobenzoyl chloride, using <b>propyleneimine</b> as an internal standard. The derivatization reaction is accomplished very quickly and the organic layer containing the derivatized imine is analysed by capillary gas chromatography using selective nitrogen detection (nitrogen-phosphorous detector). The detection limits of the method were lower than 5 myg/kg in the food simulant...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{clinical}} {{success of}} cisplatin and its derivatives {{for the treatment}} of different cancers has {{had a profound effect on}} the use of metal-containing agents in medicine. Despite the successes, the drawbacks of platinum-based therapy, such as drug resistance, toxicity and the emergence of unwanted side effects, have bred a need for effective and novel anticancer agents. Hence, the design and study of bioorganometallic complexes as potential therapeutic agents may eventually lead to the identification of new drug candidates. The purpose of this study was to synthesize and characterize a series of polynuclear transition-metal-containing complexes based on a (poly) <b>propyleneimine</b> dendritic scaffold, and investigate the in vitro antiproliferative activity of these complexes...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{polysulfone}} (PSf) membranes were crosslinked with a β-cyclodextrin-poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> (β-CD-PPI) conjugate {{which had}} β-CD pendant arms using trimesoyl chloride (TMC) by interfacial polymerization. The morphology and physicochemical {{properties of the}} nanofiltration membranes were characterized using Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflectance (FT-IR/ATR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and cross-flow filtration system. Water-contact angle, water-intake capacity, and rejection capacities of the membranes were evaluated. The β-CD-G 4 (generation 4) -PPI-PSf and β-CD-G 3 (generation 3) -PPI-PSf membranes both exhibited high humic acid rejection of 72 % {{as compared to the}} commercial PSf which exhibited 57 %. The modified membranes were also more hydrophilic (36 ° to 41 °) than PSf (76 °). These results suggest that β-CD-PPI nanostructures are promising materials for the synthesis of membranes for the removal of humic acid from water...|$|E
40|$|The rising {{demand for}} {{speciality}} polymers that possess novel properties {{has led to}} an interest in the tailored synthesis of dendritic polymers having highly controlled molecular architectures. Control over size, shape, molecular weight and functionality at the periphery of the molecule was used to design a series of dendrimer wedges with the ultimate aim of enhanced binding of a functional, property modifying unit to a cotton surface in water. Poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> dendrimer wedges with various foci were produced in a stepwise way via a repetitive reaction sequence using the divergent approach. Initially, long chain aliphatic amines were used as starting materials and optimisation of the reaction conditions produced wedges up to the third generation possessing eight primary amine end groups. Subsequently dendrimer wedges were synthesised from a siloxysilane core up to the second generation. End group modification with amino acid residues was performed at the periphery of the wedges and adsorption studies were carried out to ascertain if enhanced molecular recognition at a cotton surface occurred. Also an investigation of the modification of polar surfaces by amine terminated dendrimers with a siloxysilane unit at the focus was performed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Sheryl Tucker, ChemistryPrevious spectroscopic investigations, {{utilizing}} the fluorescent reporter molecule phenol blue, showed that that the probe {{resided in the}} core region of dendritic polymers. Two dendrimer families were investigated - <b>propyleneimine</b> (PPI) and polyamido amine (PAMAM). This dye molecule provided information about the interior microenvironment of the dendrimers, which are potentially useful in applications ranging from sensors to catalysis to microreactors to drug carriers. Given their beneficial uses, the dendrimers ability to act as container molecules was further characterized in this study. Water {{was used as the}} original solvent because phenol blue is only slightly soluble in it, and the dye is attracted to the hydrophobic interior of the dendrimer. Phenol blue was added to aqueous solutions of PPI and PAMAM dendrimers of varying sizes and analyzed. Absorption, anisotropy, and fluorescence emission measurements were taken to show that phenol blue dye did associate with the dendrimer in the core region as expected. Samples were then heated to remove the water, and the solvent was replaced by adding methanol to the samples. Methanol was chosen because both phenol blue and the dendrimers are very soluble in it. This solvent should provide an opportunity for the dye to diffuse back into the bulk solution. The experimental measurements were repeated and revealed that phenol blue remains inside the dendrimers, once it is associated. This makes their utility as transporter molecules, etc. very desirable, as the payload can be retained...|$|E
40|$|Dendrimers {{are three}} {{dimensional}} polymers, nanoscopic in size, most widely explored {{in the field}} of drug delivery in recent times. In order to establish these polymers as controlled and targeted drug delivery systems, they should be non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the toxicological profile of fifth generation poly (<b>propyleneimine)</b> dendrimers (PPI) and some of its surface engineered derivatives. Functionalized PPI dendrimers (TPPI, MPPI and TuPPI) were synthesized to mask the primary amino groups responsible for the positive charge and associated toxicity. Each polymer is administered in three different doses: 2. 5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg (i. e., low, intermediate and high dose) to Wister rats, and blood as well as tissue samples were collected after 24 h and 15 days. Decrease in RBC count and hemoglobin content after 24 h, in case of animals administered with PPI suggests hemolytic activity of PPI. Significant increase in SGOT, SGPT and LDH indicates that PPI causes severe damage to the membranes of the various tissues of the body, especially that of the liver leading to the leakage of these marker enzymes in blood. Sections of liver of animals administered with PPI showed signs of tissue degeneration after 24 h. No signs of toxicity were observed in case of animals administered with functionalized PPI. Neither PPI nor its surface engineered derivatives showed any signs of immunogenicity. It can be concluded that functionalization of dendrimers leads to drastic reduction of toxicity and increases biocompatibility...|$|E
40|$|This work {{explores the}} use of {{spheroidal}} polymer molecules called dendrimers {{in the preparation of}} dendrimer/inorganic composites that, in one case, yielded silica xerogels with spherical cavities (after template removal), and in a second approach produced lamellar dendrimer/zinc-arsenate composites with long range layered structures. These unique materials are expected to open the door to synthetic pathways of even more sophisticated nanostructured composites that will ultimately exploit the full potential of dendrimer templates. ^ The first part of this dissertation involves {{the use of}} dendrimers with amine terminal groups as templates in the formation of spherical cavities in silica xerogels prepared through a sol-gel route. Two families of dendrimers are represented in this part: poly-amidoamine generation 4 (PAMAM) dendrimer, and poly <b>propyleneimine</b> generation 4 and 5 (PPI Gn) dendrimers. The former rendered only microporous silicas (after thermal treatment) with two systems of micropores. The other set of materials produced a microporous solid (with PPI G 4), and a mesoporous xerogel (with PPI G 5). Both porous structures showed narrow pore size distributions and their pore diameters correlated well with the dimensions of the template molecules as measured by argon adsorption. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of platinum stained samples corroborated that the symmetry of the cavities was indeed spherical. ^ The second part deals with the study of a synthetic route to lamellar dendrimer/zinc-arsenate composites. All commercially available generations of the PPI Gn family of dendrimers were included in these composites as it was shown by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and chemical analysis. However, calculation of interlayer distances indicated that the spacing in between inorganic lamellae changes more slowly with dendrimer generation than was expected, compared to reported free dendrimer diameters in solution. This suggests that the dendrimers tend to adopt compressed, or oblate conformations in the interlayer. Images of these composites, obtained by TEM, showed that the zinc-arsenate sheets displayed some degree of flexibility and occasional branching defects. ...|$|E
