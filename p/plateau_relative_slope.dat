For example, in the case of pollution, the <b>relative</b> <b>slopes</b> of marginal costs and marginal damages must be examined (the marginal benefits are the avoidance of the marginal damages).

40|$|Conventional wisdom among {{environmental}} economists is {{that the}} <b>relative</b> <b>slopes</b> of the marginal social benefit and marginal social cost functions determine whether a price-based or quantity-based environmental regulation leads to higher expected social welfare. We revisit the choice between price-based vs. quantity-based environmental regulation under Knightian uncertainty; that is, when uncertainty cannot be modeled with known probability distributions. Under these circumstances, the policy objective cannot be to maximize the expected net benefits of emissions control. Instead, we evaluate an emissions tax and an aggregate abatement standard in terms of maximizing the range of uncertainty under which the welfare loss from error in the estimates of the marginal benefits and costs of emissions control can be limited. The main result of our work {{is that the}} same criterion involving the <b>relative</b> <b>slopes</b> of the marginal benefit and cost functions determines whether price-based or quantity-based control is more robust to unstructured uncertainty. Hence, not only does the <b>relative</b> <b>slopes</b> criterion lead to the policy that maximizes the expected net benefits of control under structured uncertainty, it als...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{accepted}} that excessive exposure to asbestos may produce lung cancer but not {{that there is a}} consistent "biological gradient. " This can only be evaluated reliably in studies where, for every individual, exposure has been measured in terms of both duration and intensity. Even now, there are only at most eight such cohort studies of asbestos workers, while femoral methods of analysis have been available only recently. These methods, applied in these studies, yield good evidence that the "exposure-response" relation between accumulated exposure to asbestos and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for lung cancer may be taken as linear, but that at zero exposure the lung cancer SMR is not always unity [...] not surprising, because of well known difficulties with the choice of reference population and selection problems. This leads to a concept of "relative slopes" that take account of the background mortality in the cohort and make {{what appears to be the}} best use of the available data. Other approaches to the same data, and indeed to all cohort data known, are also considered. Each study is examined as closely as is possible in a short review, and the concepts of linearity and <b>relative</b> <b>slopes</b> appear justified. The <b>relative</b> <b>slopes</b> (b/a) in the line SMR = a[1 + (b/a).
