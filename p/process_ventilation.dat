Particle contamination in OTs depends mainly on the surgery <b>process,</b> <b>ventilation</b> principle, personnel clothing systems and working routines. In many open surgical operations, electrosurgical tools (ESTs) are used for tissue cauterization. ESTs generate a significant airborne contamination, as surgical smoke. Surgical smoke is a work environment quality problem. Ordinary surgical masks and OT ventilation systems are inadequate to control this problem. This research work is based on numerous monitoring campaigns of ultrafine particle concentrations in OTs, equipped with upward displacement ventilation or with a downward unidirectional airflow system. Measurements performed during ten real surgeries highlight that the use of ESTs generates a quite sharp and relevant increase of particle concentration in the surgical area as well within the entire OT area. The measured contamination level in the OTs are linked to surgical operation, ventilation principle, and ESTs used. A better knowledge of airborne contamination is crucial for limiting the personnel’s exposure to surgical smoke.

40|$|Because {{nanomaterials}} {{are thought}} to be more biologically active than their larger parent compounds, careful control of exposures to nanomaterials is recommended. Field studies were conducted at three sites to develop information about the effectiveness of control measures including process changes, a downflow room, a ventilated enclosure, and an enclosed reactor. Aerosol mass and number concentrations were measured during specific operations with a photometer and an electrical mobility particle sizer to provide concentration measurements across a broad range of sizes (from 5. 6 nm to 30). At site A, the dust exposure and during product harvesting was eliminated by implementing a wait time of 30 -min following process completion. And, the dust exposure attributed to process tank cleaning was reduced from 0. 7 to 0. 2 mg/m 3 by operating the available <b>process</b> <b>ventilation</b> during this task. At site B, a ventilated enclosure was used to control dust generated by the manual weigh-out and manipulation of powdered nanomaterials inside of a downflow room. Dust exposures were at room background (under 0. 04 mg/m 3 and 500 particles/cm 3) during these tasks however, manipulations conducted outside of the enclosure were correlated with a transient increase in concentration measured at the source. At site C, a digitally controlled reactor was used to produce aligned carbon nanotubes. This reactor was a closed system and the ventilation functioned as a redundant control measure. Process emissions were well controlled by this system with the exception of increased concentrations measured during the unloading of the product. However, this emission source could be easily controlled through increasing cabinet ventilation. The identification and adoption of effective control technologies is an important first step in reducing the risk associated with worker exposure to engineered nanoparticles.

40|$|Background: The {{widespread}} use of lead and its components has its hazards and causes health disorders to industrial workers. The hazards are determined {{by a number of}} factors e. g. work <b>process,</b> <b>ventilation,</b> general hygienic condition of the workroom and personnel 1, and preventive measures. No prevalence of deafness associate with lead exposed workers was found in Egypt. However, there is an increase in all-cause mortality with high blood lead level. Aim and objectives: The aims of this study are: 1. To determine the association between elevated blood lead levels and hearing impairment in lead-exposed workers. 2. To investigate the use of preventive measures Methods and study design: The study was conducted on a random sample of 61 lead-exposed (mean age 40. 4 years) and 50 non-exposed male workers (mean age 39. 2 years) in printing presses and battery industries in Cairo. Blood lead levels were determined and an audiometric evaluation was done at different frequencies (500 - 8000 Hz). The use of preventive measures for lead-exposed workers was investigated and regular check-up. Results/ Findings: The mean blood lead level in the lead-exposed group was 52. 5 μg/dl + 21. 5, and in the non-exposed was 18. 2 μg/dl + 5. 9 (t= 10. 9 (CI 28. 1 – 40. 5) p< 0. 001). There was a significant correlation r= 0. 7 between blood lead levels and binaural hearing. The audiometric evaluations revealed significant positive correlation between blood lead level in exposed workers and hearing impairment. All lead exposed workers had hearing impairment at different frequencies. Although all workers were aware of protective devices against lead exposure, 100 % of them did not use any. They also did not go to regular checkups. Study limitations: Researchers could not assess the environmental lead levels in workers' residences. Conclusions: Hearing impairment in lead-exposed workers in printing presses and battery industries in Cairo is inevitable and irreversible.

40|$|The {{exposure}} to fumes and gases {{is one of}} the hazards associated with welding operations. Apart from research conducted on the mechanism of fume and gas formation and the relationship between fume formation rates and common welding parameters, {{little is known about the}} exposure process during welding. This research project aimed to identify the factors that influence exposure, develop an understanding of their role in the exposure process and through this understanding formulate strategies for the effective control of exposure during welding. To address these aims a literature review and an experimental program was conducted The literature review surveyed epidemiological, toxicological and exposure data. The experimental program involved three approaches, the first, an evaluation of the factors that influence exposure by assessing a metal inert gas/mild steel welding process in a workshop setting. The second approach involved the study of exposure in a controlled environment provided by a wind tunnel and simulated welding process. The final approach was to investigate workplace conditions through an assessment of exposure and control strategies in industry. The {{exposure to}} fumes and gases during welding is highly variable and frequently in excess of the health based exposure standards. Exposure is influenced by a number of a factors including the welding process, base material, arc time, electrode, arc current, arc voltage, arc length, electrode polarity, shield gas, wire-to-metal-work distance (metal inert gas), metal transfer mode, intensity of the UV radiation (ozone), the frequency of arc ignitions (ozone), thermal buoyancy generated by the arc <b>process,</b> <b>ventilation</b> (natural and mechanical), the welding environment, the position of the welder, the welders stance, helmet type, and helmet position. Exposure occurs as a result of three processes: the formation of contaminants at or around the arc region; their transport from the arc region, as influenced by the entry and thermal expansion of shield gases, the vigorous production of contaminants, thermal air currents produced by the heat of the arc process, and ventilation; and finally the entry of contaminants into the breathing zone of the welder, as influenced by the position of the welder, the welders stance, helmet type, and the helmet position. The control of exposure during welding can be achieved by several means: through the selection of welding parameters that generate low contaminant formation rates; through the limitation of arc time; and by isolating the breathing zone of the welder from the contaminant plume through the use of ventilation, welder position or the welding helmet as a physical barrier. Effective control is achieved by careful examination of the workplace, the selection of the most appropriate control option, and motivation of the workforce...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} possibilities to reduce primary steam consumption of the integrated pulp and paper mill in Obbola. For this purpose, a pinch analysis has been performed. The thesis {{has been carried out}} on site and necessary data for the analysis was produced mainly using the sensors installed for controlling the process. Based on the data, a representation of the heat exchanges at the mill was obtained and from this emerges an understanding of how optimized the heat exchange is. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} energy savings potential amounts to 7 MW, which corresponds to 6 % of present steam consumption of approximately 112 MW. One of the identified pinch violations was the flue gases in the recovery boiler used to preheat combustion air and <b>process</b> <b>ventilation</b> when it can be used to meet a thermal demand at higher temperatures or potentially to generate steam, the latter has not been investigated. Steam preheating of air to the paper dryer, steam preheating of water that is used to thaw logs and steam that is used in some of the process ventilations were also among the identified violations. Possible measures to optimize heat exchange and eliminate pinch violations have been investigated. These include flashing of paper mill condensate to replace the live steam in the air preheaters to the paper dryer and replace this thermal energy with secondary heat in the feed water treatment plant. As well as using part of the heat from the flue gas cooling system to preheat feed water. Increasing the operational temperature in the water treatment plant turned out to be possible regardless of whether a flash is introduced or not. The savings with contra without the flash would amount to 1. 13 MW and 0. 85 MW, respectively, and the net heat savings of a reconstruction is only 0. 28 MW. The heat that can be released from the flue gas cooling system corresponds to 0. 46 MW and is expected to be higher in the summer when heat necessity in other ends of the system decreases. To suggest optimization of heat exchanges at the mill, it was also investigated how much excess of warm and hot water was that present in the secondary heating system. The investigation showed that if the temperature in the warm water tank would be regulated, an excess of hot water would be sufficiently large to provide secondary heat to the optimization measures discussed and to provide for all ventilations currently using live steam. In all cases profitability should be investigated and for the case of any ventilation consideration should be given to distance from a secondary heating source and if there is a glycol circuit present or not. ...|$|E
40|$|The report {{comprises}} {{two separate}} parts: part 1 :  Temperature needs for district heating {{in the paint}} shop for axles in building 210 part 2 :  Energy and low temperature waste heat solutions in heating and cooling systems for   building 64 with surroundings The paint shop for axles in part 1 has air quality requirements in places for coating of axles. Toachieve desired air properties there are different <b>process</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems, which consist ofventilation coils for heating and cooling, plus air humidifier. The ventilations coils for heating usedistrict heating. Today the ventilation coils use water of 100 °C to achieve necessary air demands inthe coating boxes. This part of the report investigates whether the existing system would achievethe air requirements with a water temperature of 75 °C instead of 100 °C in the ventilation coilsduring the coldest parts of the year. The conclusion {{is that it is}} not possible; the existing system isadjusted for a water temperature of 100 °C to achieve the air requirements. To use a watertemperature of 75 °C, more or major ventilation coils are needed. The focus of the report is at part 2. In this part, possibilities for low temperature waste heatsolutions are investigated. Those partly aim at specific local solutions for building 64 withsurroundings and on the other part of general waste heat solutions for new buildings andreconstructions in the future. To make these parts possible, the systems for heating and cooling inbuilding 64 have been identified. During this identification, potential savings that are not of wasteheat character have also been observed. The most profitable saving concerns the control of temperature for the inner hardening vat. It isthe hardening vat for gas carburizing oven SV 16838 that has been studied in this report. Today thetemperature of the hardening vat is controlled very ineffective. The conclusion is that a betteradjustment of the controller would save 180 000 SEK/year with a pay off time around two months. Worth mentioning (SV 16838 included), is that there are at least five similar gas carburizing ovens atthe Scania area in Södertälje. A pinch analysis has also been done for building 64, with it’s primarily conclusion that the groundheating is violating the pinch rules during long periods of the year. To remedy the ground heatingwill only need a different control and will lead to a saving between 20 000 – 75 000 SEK/year. Tomore accurate determine the saving, an investigation of the ground heating during winter time isneeded. Another conclusion concerning the pinch analysis is that the method for a real scenariorather shows the potential of the system than gives you an optimal solution possible to implement. More actions are to use the exhaustions of the endo gas generators and that the washing andrinsing systems if possible not should be heated with electricity. The exhaustions from the endo gasgenerators have a very high temperature, more then 300 °C. If these, instead of hot water boilers,could warm the closely located water for the LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) evaporation, 125 000 SEK/year can be saved. Today the hot water boilers are heated with electricity. If the washing andrinsing systems existing electricity heating instead can be heated with secondary heat (˜ districtheating), a save of 500 000 SEK/year is possible. For waste heat solutions there are a few different approaches. Close to building 64, the largestpotential to use waste heat is in building 62 and 75, where air heaters are assessed with the largestpotential. In difference to other investigated buildings, building 210 has the possibility to use wasteheat even during the summer. This building is located 1 km from building 64. To use waste water inbuilding 210, a complex net of waste heating will be required where several buildings with asurplus of waste heat can be connected. A net like this has calculated pipe costs of 5, 2 million SEK. The saving for the use of waste heat only in building 210 will be around 1, 4 million SEK/year. Thissave corresponds to the air handling systems that occur in part 1...|$|E

In this paper we investigate the <b>processes</b> responsible for <b>ventilation</b> of the atmospheric boundary layer during a nonfrontal day that occurred on 9 May 2005 using the UK Met Office Unified Model. Pollution sources are represented by the constant emission of a passive tracer everywhere over land. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>processes</b> observed include shallow convection, turbulent mixing followed by large-scale ascent, a sea breeze circulation and coastal outflow. Vertical distributions of tracer are validated qualitatively with AMPEP (Aircraft Measurement of chemical Processing Export fluxes of Pollutants over the UK) CO aircraft measurements and are shown to agree impressively well.
