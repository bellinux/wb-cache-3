40|$|The uptake of Cd. Se(IV) and Zn by the {{freshwater}} alga Scenedesmus obliquus {{and the subsequent}} transfer and release budget in Daphnia were investigated under different nutrient additions and cell incubation conditions. An increase in ambient phosphate concentrations from 0. 5 mumol 1 (- 1) to 50 mumol 1 (- 1) significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of Cd (by 18 x) and Zn (by 5 x). but decreased the accumulation of Se (by 126 x) in the alga. The percentage of these metals distributing in the intracellular pool of algae also increased Substantially with increasing ambient P concentrations. Nitrate addition from 5. 0 to 200 mumol 1 (- 1) did not influence the uptake {{of any of the}} three metals, although a significant decrease in the intracellular Se distribution was observed. Radiolabeled algae Under different nutrient manipulations (semi-continuous culture, starvation, and <b>P-pulse</b> treatments) were used to measure trophic transfer assimilation efficiency (AE) in Daphnia. When the algal cells were grown in a semi-continuous culture, starved for N and P. or were treated with <b>P-pulse,</b> the AEs of Cd and Zn were generally independent of the nutritional conditions, but the Se AE was significantly affected by different P levels. The efflux rate constants, determined during 10 d depuration following 7 days of dietary uptake. decreased significantly for Cd and Zn, but were relatively constant for Se with increasing P concentration. N-addition caused no effect on the metal efflux rate constants. P- or N-additions did not influence the release budget (including molting neonates. excretion and feces) for all three elements in Daphnia. Our study indicated that phosphate enrichment may substantially increase metal uptake in green alga S. obliquus. Responses of trophic transfer in Daphnia to nutrient enrichment were metal specific. P-enrichment can possibly lead to considerable decrease on Se transfer from algae to zooplankton (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of structure from the inversion of teleseismic receiver functions may {{be improved by}} removing {{the contribution of the}} free surface. The free surface interaction gives rise to the highest amplitude signal on standard receiver functions and yet this initial pulse tells us little about the receiver structure below the surface layer. We apply a transformation to P, S and Horizontal wavevector components, which removes the free surface response and hence the initial <b>P-pulse.</b> A pure receiver function is calculated by deconvolving the S-wavevector component with the P-wavevector. In general, converted phase amplitudes within the receiver function waveform are better matched by the inverse algorithm, resulting in an improved estimation of seismic structure. In particular, low amplitude receiver function waveforms, often associated with poorly constrained structure, now yield a successful inverse...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} solution for complete population inversion in a four-level ladder system obtained {{by using a}} full <b>p-pulse</b> illumination scheme with resonant ultrashort phase-locked Gaussian laser pulses. We find that a set of pulse areas such as v 3 p, v 2 p, and v 3 p completely inverts the four-level system considering identical effective dipole coupling coefficients. The solution is consistent provided the involved electric fields are not too strong and it is amply accurate also {{in the case of}} diverse transition dipole moments. We study the effect of detuning and chirp of the laser pulses on the complete population inversion using the level structure of atomic sodium interacting with ps and fs pulses as an example. Our result opens the door for multiple applications such as efficient ultrashort pulse lasing in the UV or the engineering of quantum states for quantum computing.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the role of}} enhanced antigen presentation in dendritic cell (DC) -based immunotherapy. Here, we describe {{the development of a}} cell-penetrating mucin 1 (MUC 1) antigen and its immunotherapeutic potential against tumors. After animal groups received two immunizations of MUC 1 -MPA 11 <b>P-pulsed</b> DCs, we observed a marked tumor regression compared with the mice treated with DCs alone or DCs pulsed with MUC 1 peptide. We confirmed the migration and homing of DCs in the popliteal lymph node using magnetic resonance imaging during the study. In summary, enhanced antigen uptake using an MPA 11 P delivery molecule improves cell therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributing}} role of circulating human {{dendritic cell}} (DC) populations and basophils {{in the presentation}} and augmentation of Th 2 responses remains to be determined. The present study aimed at elucidating the functional role of CD 1 c(+) myeloid DCs (mDCs), CD 123 (+) plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), monocyte-derived DCs and basophils in allergen presentation and Th 2 activation. By coculturing Phleum pratense (Phl p) -pulsed CD 1 c(+) mDCs, CD 123 (+) pDCs, monocyte-derived DCs and basophils with autologous CD 4 (+) effector memory T cells, we assessed T-cell proliferation {{as well as the}} frequency of interleukin- 4 - and interferon-γ-producing T cells. Interestingly, a Th 2 -stimulating ability was observed for Phl p-challenged CD 1 c(+) mDCs and monocyte-derived DCs, while CD 123 (+) pDCs and basophils did not affect the Th-balance. In addition, both Phl <b>p-pulsed</b> CD 1 c(+) mDCs and monocyte-derived DCs stimulated increased T-cell proliferation compared to basophils and CD 123 (+) pDCs. Together, these results point to a prominent role for circulating CD 1 c(+) mDCs in allergen presentation and augmentation of Th 2 responses, making them promising therapeutic targets for Type I hypersensitivity reactions.

40|$|Background: Type 1 myeloid {{dendritic}} cells (mDCs) {{contribute to}} inception of allergic asthma (AA) and are regulated by epithelial-derived cytokines. Objectives: To evaluate whether mDCs from AA patients are primed for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) -driven responses. Methods: mDCs from 18 AA and 15 controls were purified using immunomagnetic sorting. Cells were pulsed with TSLP or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) allergen, before FACS phenotyping and co-culture with allogeneic CD 4 + T cells. Bronchial biopsies from 15 AA and 4 controls were immunostained for CD 1 c and TSLP receptor (TSLPR). Results: AA patients {{had a higher}} proportion of TSLPR+ mDCs, in blood and bronchial mucosa. When compared to mDCs from controls, both TSLP- and Der <b>p-pulsed</b> blood mDCs from AA induced increased polarization of CD 4 + T cells into Th 2 cells (IL- 5, IL- 13 and GATA 3 +), while only TSLP-mDCs promoted Th 9 cells (IL- 9 and PU. 1 +/IRF 4 +). In addition, OX 40 L was induced upon TSLP stimulation and was required for induction of Th 2 but not Th 9 cells. In contrast, development of Th 9 cells in this model depended on TGF- 1. Conclusion: Our data indicate overlapping but partially distinct effects of TSLP and Der p allergen pathways, showing that DCs are primed in human asthma for TSLP-driven induction of both Th 2 and Th 9 cells. This novel TSLP/mDC/Th 9 axis operates through a distinct, OX 40 L-independent pathway. These data further highlight the TSLP pathway as a relevant target in human asthma...|$|R
40|$|Aims. We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the accreting X-ray pulsar system 4 U 1907 + 09 based on INTEGRAL data. The main focus of this analysis is a study of the timing behavior of this source. In addition we also show {{an analysis of}} the 5 - 90 keV spectrum. Methods. The data were extracted using the official INTEGRAL software OSA 5. 1. Timing analysis was performed using epoch folding and pulsar pulse phasing. Results. We have measured 12 individual pulse periods for the years 2003 to 2005. We confirm earlier RXTE results that during 2003 the spin down became slower and show furthermore that after this phase 4 U 1907 + 09 started to spin up with. <b>P-pulse</b> = - 0. 158 s yr(- 1) in 2004. The similarity of the pulse period histories of 4 U 1907 + 09 and 4 U 1626 - 26 suggests that accretion onto an oblique rotator, as recently proposed by Perna et al., is a possible explanation for this change...|$|E
