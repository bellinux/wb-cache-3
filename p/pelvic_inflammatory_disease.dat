5|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease</b> is {{more likely}} to reoccur when there is a prior history of the infection, recent sexual contact, recent onset of menses, or an IUD (intrauterine device) in place or if the partner has a sexually {{transmitted}} infection.|$|E
5|$|Acute <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease</b> {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic sepsis (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E

5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, bone or joint infections, <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease,</b> strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease</b> (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>{{inflammatory}}</b> <b>disease</b> or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is {{an infection}} of {{the upper part of}} the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
30|$|For the {{treatment}} of patients with uncomplicated forms of <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> laparoscopy has advantages and prospects compared with long-term conservative treatment- it expands the range of clinical diagnosis and makes targeted treatment possible, {{in some cases it}} eliminates the cause of infertility, at once it is particularly important for young patients for preservation and restoration of their reproductive function.|$|R

30|$|Although rare, colovesical fistulas {{represent}} {{the most common}} form (65 % of cases) of an acquired bladder–enteric fistula and most frequently occur between the recto-sigmoid and the bladder dome [8]. Diverticular disease represents their major cause (two-thirds of cases), followed by colorectal carcinoma, whereas uncommon aetiologies include Crohn’s disease, bladder or uterine neoplasms, previous irradiation, female <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases,</b> periappendiceal abscesses penetrating trauma or foreign bodies [9, 10].|$|R
5|$|While copper IUDs may {{increase}} menstrual bleeding {{and result in}} more painful cramps hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether. Cramping can be treated with NSAIDs. Other potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely perforation of the uterus (less than 0.7%). A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was {{associated with an increased}} risk of <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease,</b> however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.|$|E

25|$|Infertility is {{the major}} symptom of TFI and is {{generally}} defined as a woman under 35 who has not become pregnant after 12 months {{without the use of}} contraception. Twelve months is the lower reference limit for Time to Pregnancy (TTP) by the World Health Organization. When the inability to conceive is accompanied by signs and symptoms of <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease</b> such as lower abdominal pain, TFI may be present. A history of <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease,</b> the laproscopic evidence of scarring and a diagnosis of salpingitis supports the diagnosis.|$|E

50|$|Mycoplasma is a genus of {{bacteria}} that lack a cell wall around their cell membrane. Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. They can be parasitic or saprotrophic. Several species are pathogenic in humans, including M. pneumoniae, {{which is an}} important cause of atypical pneumonia and other respiratory disorders, and M. genitalium, which {{is believed to be}} involved in <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Mycoplasma species are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered, can survive without oxygen, and come in various shapes. For example, M. genitalium is flask-shaped (about 300 x 600 nm), while M. pneumoniae is more elongated (about 100 x 1000 nm). Hundreds of mycoplasma species infect animals.|$|R
40|$|The {{proper use}} of {{hormonal}} contraceptives represents an effective and safe prevention of unintended pregnancies which are still associated with morbidity and mortality. The side effects of the hormonal method are of concern to many young women even if a lot of adolescents are unaware of health benefits associated with their use except for those regarding menstrual disorders. Effective contraception improves health and may gives non contraceptives benefits such as a decreased risk of developing <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> and improvement of endometriosis. However, incorrect or inconsistent use and discontinuation rate are higher in young girls than in older women determining {{a higher incidence of}} voluntary abortion. The use of hormonal contraception in adolescents is still a topic of discussion among medical practitioners.

40|$|Background: The {{etiology}} of infertility has direct {{influence on the}} plan and outcome of its management. In this paper we showed the effect of history of tuberculosis (TB) on female infertility among infertilecouples admitted to Royan infertility management center. Material and Methods: This case control study was performed on cases that were diagnosed withfemale infertility (308 women). Controls were women whose husbands were infertile due to some malefactor (314 women). Those who had both female and male infertility {{were excluded from the}} study. Theobserved variables were BMI> 25 kg/m 2, positive history of smoking, tuberculosis, sexually transmitteddisease and <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results: The age adjusted odds ratio of history of tuberculosis for female infertility was 6. 21 (95 CI: 1. 31 - 29. 56).

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis is the causing {{agent of}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial sexually-transmitted diseases worldwide and is an underlying cause of chronic <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> and cervical cancer. It is an obligate intracellular bacterium that establishes {{a close relationship with}} the Golgi complex and parasites the biosynthetic machinery of host cells. In a recent study, we have demonstrated that Rab 14, a newly-described Golgi-associated Rab, is involved in the delivery of sphingolipids to the growing bacteria-containing vacuole. The interference with Rab 14 -controlled trafficking pathways delays chlamydial inclusion enlargement, decreases bacterial lipid uptake, negatively impact on bacterial differentiation, and reduces bacterial progeny and infectivity. C. trachomatis manipulation of host trafficking pathways for the acquisition of endogenously-biosynthesized nutrients arises as one of the characteristics of this highly evolved pathogen. The development of therapeutic strategies targeted to interfere with bacterium-host cell interaction is a new challenge for pharmacological approaches to control chlamydial infections...|$|R
50|$|Infection with M. genitalium {{sometimes}} produces clinical symptoms, or {{a combination}} of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the urethra (urethritis) both in men and women, which is associated with mucopurulent discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating. In women, it causes cervicitis and <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases,</b> including endometritis and salpingitis. Women may also experience bleeding after sex and it is also suspected with tubal factor infertility. For men, the most common signs are painful urination or a watery discharge from the penis. Polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that it is a cause of acute non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and probably chronic NGU. Unlike other Mycoplasma, the infection is not associated with bacterial vaginosis. It is highly associated with the intensity of HIV infection. It is also suspected {{to play a role in}} the development of prostate and ovarian cancers and lymphomas.|$|R
25|$|As <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease</b> is {{the major}} cause of hydrosalpinx formation, steps to reduce sexually {{transmitted}} disease will reduce incidence of hydrosalpinx. Also, as hydrosalpinx is a sequel to a pelvic infection, adequate and early antibiotic treatment of a pelvic infection is called for.|$|E
25|$|Salpingitis is an {{infection}} and inflammation in the Fallopian tubes. It {{is often used}} synonymously with <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease</b> (PID), although PID lacks an accurate definition and can refer to several diseases of the female upper genital tract, such as endometritis, oophoritis, myometritis, parametritis and infection in the pelvic peritoneum.|$|E

40|$|An {{aqueous extract}} of human {{placenta}} exhibits strong gelatinase/collagenase activity in zymography. 2 -D gel electrophoresis of the extract with gelatin zymography {{in the second}} dimension displayed a single spot, identified as ubiquitin-like component upon MALDI/TOF MS/MS analysis. Immunoblot indicated presence of ubiquitin and absence of collagenase in the extract. Collagenase activity of the ubiquitin-like component was confirmed from the change in solubility of collagen in aqueous buffer, degradation of collagen by size-exclusion HPLC and atomic force microscopy. Quantification with DQ-gelatin showed that the extract contains 0. 04 U/ml of collagenase activity that was inhibited up to 95 % by ubiquitin antibody. Ubiquitin from bovine erythrocytes demonstrated mild collagenase activity. Bioinformatics studies suggest that placental ubiquitin and collagenase follow structurally divergent evolution.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} Danzhi decoction (DZD) on chronic pelvic pain (CPP), hemodynamics, and proinflammatory factors of sequelae of <b>pelvic</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> (SPID) in murine model. Methods. SPID mice were randomly treated with high-dose DZD, mid-dose DZD, low-dose DZD, aspirin, and vehicle for 3 estrous circles. The Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was performed to evaluate CPP; blood flows of the upper genital tract, pelvic wall, and mesentery {{were used to assess}} hemodynamics in SPID mice; expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2), and osteopontin (OPN) were measured by Western blot and immunochemistry. Results. Treatment with dose-dependent DZD significantly decreased the MGS scores, accelerated blood flows of the pelvis, and reduced expressions of VEGF, Ang- 2, and OPN in the upper genital tract. Conclusions and Discussions. DZD was effective in relieving CPP and improving hemodynamics of the pelvic blood-stasis microenvironment in SPID mice. There was a relationship between CPP and the pelvic blood-stasis microenvironment. Furthermore, DZD might play a positive role in the anti-inflammatory process...|$|R
