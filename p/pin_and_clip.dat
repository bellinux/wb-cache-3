50|$|Another {{problem with}} the weapon {{was that it was}} overcomplicated {{compared}} to the M203. It was difficult to disassemble and had many small parts that could be easily lost while cleaning the weapon in the field. Where the M203 broke down into receiver group, barrel group, hand guard group and quadrant sight (the quadrant sight being the smallest piece), the XM148 broke down into barrel, pistol grip, receiver, hand guard, quadrant sight, <b>and</b> several small <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> <b>clips.</b> These issues led the U.S. military to adopt the M203 over the XM148, though the U.S. Air Force did keep a number of the XM148s. In fact U.S. Air Force Security Forces were still being trained on the XM148 in lieu of the M203 as late as 1989. Some security police units still had them in their armories until the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|These systems {{consist of}} {{prefabricated}} timber, steel or aluminum beams and formwork modules. Modules are often {{no larger than}} 3 to 6 feet or 1 to 2 metres in size. The beams and formwork are typically set by hand <b>and</b> <b>pinned,</b> <b>clipped,</b> or screwed together. The advantages of a modular system are: {{does not require a}} crane to place the formwork, speed of construction with unskilled labor, formwork modules can be removed after concrete sets leaving only beams in place prior to achieving design strength.|$|R
50|$|Name tags may be {{attached}} to garments with adhesive or worn {{with the assistance of}} a magnet or pin. Plastic or metal name tags can {{be attached}} to various backings used to attach to the clothing of the wearer. There are many types of name tag backings, including magnetic backings, locking pins, swivel clips, military clutch <b>pins,</b> alligator <b>clips,</b> <b>and</b> cell phone attachments. Magnetic backings, because they do not puncture clothing with pins, have recently become more popular for name tags. Some name tags are worn around the neck using a lanyard or necklace.|$|R
5000|$|M91/30 Pattern: Domestically {{produced}} version Soviet pattern M91 {{during the}} year 1955. Some of the guns are marked [...] "INSTRUCTIE" [...] and held in reserve for a secondary line of defense in case of invasion. The Instructie mark is typically, but not always, accompanied by a broad red band on the buttstock. Some collectors do not consider these safe to fire, but most {{appear to be in}} good working order although well worn and somewhat neglected. The [...] "EXERCITIU" [...] mark is found on rifles that seem to have been used specifically for training purposes only. The [...] "EXERCITIU" [...] rifles are easily recognized by the black paint on the entire butt of the stock. They are not intended to be fired since the firing <b>pin</b> is <b>clipped</b> <b>and</b> many times parts critical to their proper function are missing.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{security}} risk of a commercial aircraft, passengers are not allowed to take certain items in their carry-on baggage. For this reason, human operators are trained to detect prohibited items using a manually controlled baggage screening process. The inspection process, however, is highly complex as hazardous items are very difficult to detect when placed in close packed bags, superimposed by other objects, and/or rotated showing an unrecognizable profile. In this paper, we review certain advances achieved by our research group in this field. Our methodology is based on multiple view analysis, because it can be a powerful tool for examining complex objects in cases in which uncertainty can lead to misinterpretation. In our approach, multiple views (taken from fixed points of view, or using an active vision approach in which the best views are automated selected) are analyzed in the detection of regular objects. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experimental results on recognizing guns, razor blades, <b>pins,</b> <b>clips</b> <b>and</b> springs in baggage inspection are presented achieving around 90 % accuracy. We believe that {{it would be possible to}} design an automated aid in a target detection task using the proposed algorithm. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{surfaces}} {{chosen for}} the reproduction of the firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breech face impression were lead and plasticine. These surfaces were chosen due to tendency of being softer than firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breech face and the marks could be easily reproduced without destroying the original surface. The surface of firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breechface were cleaned with acetone to remove dust material adhered to it and then plasticine/lead were pressed against firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breechface surfaces the surface impression.|$|R

5000|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{increase}} the safety of bridges with <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assemblies by adding some form of redundancy to the assembly. Retrofits that add redundancy to <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assemblies include adding a [...] "catcher's mitt"a short steel beam attached {{to the bottom of the}} cantilevered girder that extends out beneath the suspended girder to [...] "catch" [...] the suspended girder should the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assembly fail. Another redundancy is connecting the cantilevered and suspended girders at the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assembly with welded blocks and tie rods. Finally, a bridge may be retrofitted by eliminating the expansion joint, replacing the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assembly with a pair of gusset plates on each girder.|$|R
50|$|Clipping {{is defined}} as the {{interaction}} of subject <b>and</b> <b>clip</b> polygons. While clipping usually involves finding the intersections (regions of overlap) of subject <b>and</b> <b>clip</b> polygons, clipping algorithms can also be applied with other boolean clipping operations: difference, where the clipping polygons remove overlapping regions from the subject; union, where clipping returns the regions covered by either subject or clip polygons, and; xor, where clipping returns the regions covered by either subject or clip polygons except where they are covered by both subject <b>and</b> <b>clip</b> polygons.|$|R

30|$|For the {{preparation}} of the impression of the firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breech face two surfaces were selected. First surface was placticine. Plasticine was pressed against the hard surface of the firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breech face to reproduce the surface impression.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger {{assemblies}} {{are considered}} fracture critical bridge components, {{meaning that the}} assemblies are non-redundant and failure of these systems could cause part {{or all of the}} bridge to collapse. The collapse of the Mianus River Bridge in Connecticut exposed potential flaws with <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger bridges that could lead to catastrophic failures, if left unchecked. Because of this, state departments of transportation incur costly expenses on bridges with <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assemblies, as they require constant inspection and maintenance. As a result of these safety concerns, and advances in bridge design to allow longer spans, <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assemblies are no longer used on new bridges in the United States.|$|R

Seedlings in the field, released from midstory and understory woody competition, showed significant increases in gas-exchange compared to non-released seedlings due to increases in light levels reaching seedlings. Concurrently, little difference occurred in the CO 2 -exchange rate between intact <b>and</b> <b>clipped</b> seedlings in the released treatment although clipped seedlings maintained a consistently greater rate of stomatal conductance. In order to reduce the high variability of light levels recorded in the field, gas-exchange measurements {{were conducted on}} intact <b>and</b> <b>clipped</b> cherrybark oak seedlings growing in a nursery bed under consistent light conditions. Again, no differences were found in the CO 2 - exchange rate between intact <b>and</b> <b>clipped</b> seedlings. Furthermore, no differences were found in stomatal conductance and transpiration between intact <b>and</b> <b>clipped</b> seedlings. However, significant differences in gas-exchange were found between first-flush and second-flush leaves regardless of seedling treatment (intact or a sprout). Greater rates of gas-exchange in second-flush leaves can be attributed to developing third-flush steams and leaves...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal wetland (dambo) {{cultivation}} in smallholder farming {{areas is}} important because it improves household food security. However, most farming practices, such as burning of vegetation and conventional tillage in dambo gardens, may reduce soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient dynamics. We evaluated the effects of simulated burning, vegetation clearing <b>and</b> <b>clipping,</b> <b>and</b> conventional tillage in dambo gardens on SOC, nutrient contents and biomass production over a 3 -year period. The results showed that clearing <b>and</b> <b>clipping</b> of vegetation <b>and</b> conventional tillage reduced SOC, soil nutrient contents and biomass yields, while burning increased SOC and soil nutrient contents. For the 0 – 10 cm depth, conventional tillage, clearing <b>and</b> <b>clipping</b> resulted in a 37 %, 34 % and 18 % decrease in SOC, respectively, after three seasons, burning resulted in a 25 % increase in SOC, while there were no changes in the control after 3 years. For the 0 – 40 cm depth, the average change in SOC was 32 %, 25 % and 16 % for conventional tillage, clearing <b>and</b> <b>clipping,</b> respectively. Locally <b>and</b> regionally, conventional tillage, clearing <b>and</b> <b>clipping</b> reduce SOC, nutrient contents and biomass production in dambos. Though annual burning increased SOC and nutrient contents in the short term, the long-term effects are uncertain, hence {{there is a need for}} long-term studies...|$|R
