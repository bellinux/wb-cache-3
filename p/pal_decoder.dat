50|$|Early color sets {{intended}} for the UK market had a <b>PAL</b> <b>decoder</b> that was different from those invented and licensed by Telefunken of Germany, who invented the PAL color system. The decoder inside the UK-sold Sony color Trinitron sets, from the KV-1300UB to the KV-1330UB, had an NTSC decoder adapted for PAL. The decoder used a 64 microsecond delay line to store every other line, but instead of using the delay line to average out the phase of the current line and the previous line, it simply repeated the same line twice. Any phase errors could then be compensated for by using a tint control knob {{on the front of}} the set, normally unneeded on a PAL set.|$|E

In this paper, {{based on}} the FPGA and with a <b>PAL</b> <b>decoder</b> chip, LVDS coding chip and large {{capacity}} SRAM, the design and implementation of a PAL system for analog signals to the LVDS conversion of the video signal interface board. First of all, convert the analog signal of PAL to RGB 565 digital video signal, and transform the interlaced scan into progressive scan. Then, through the frame rate conversion, resolution expansion etc. algorithm method to handle. Finally, to achieve the interlaced scanning, a resolution of 720 × 576, 25 Hz PAL analog video signal, is converted to a progressive scan, a resolution of 1024 × 768, 60 Hz LVDS video signal transmission. After the measurement, the resolution and frame rate of the video signal conversion interface board are all meet the design requirements. It has been verified the effectiveness of scheme...|$|E

40|$|Connection-oriented guaranteed-throughput mesh-based {{networks}} on chip {{have been}} proposed {{as a replacement for}} buses in real-time embedded multiprocessor systems such as software defined radios. Even with attractive features like throughput and latency guarantees they are not always used because their hardware cost tends to be higher than buses. In this paper we present a communication ring that provides throughput and latency guarantees. This ring is an attractive communication network as replacement for buses for small to medium scale embedded multiprocessor systems for real-time stream processing because of its relatively low hardware cost. We show that the data serialization of our ring makes it contention free and enables sharing of buffers which reduces the hardware cost. A further cost reduction is achieved by implementing end-to-end flow-control in software and by supporting only writes over the network. Data-flow analysis techniques are used to prove that throughput and latency guarantees can be given despite that the proposed communication ring is connectionless. We evaluated the performance and hardware cost of our communication ring using a 16 core multiprocessor system and a real-time <b>PAL</b> video <b>decoder</b> application. This design was implemented on a Virtex 6 FPGA and the ring was found to use roughly 2 % of the logic cells used for the complete MPSoC design. Such a low hardware cost can justify the use of the ring in systems with low bandwidth utilization, as is the case for our <b>PAL</b> video <b>decoder</b> application which uses only 3 % of the available bandwidth...|$|R
50|$|However, the {{alternation}} of colour information—Hanover bars—can lead {{to picture}} grain on pictures with extreme phase errors even in <b>PAL</b> systems, if <b>decoder</b> circuits are misaligned {{or use the}} simplified decoders of early designs (typically to overcome royalty restrictions). In most cases such extreme phase shifts do not occur. This effect will usually be observed when the transmission path is poor, typically in built up areas or where the terrain is unfavourable. The effect is more noticeable on UHF than VHF signals as VHF signals {{tend to be more}} robust.|$|R
40|$|Connection-oriented Guaranteed-Throughput (GT) mesh-based Networks on Chip (NoCs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{as a replacement for}} buses in real-time stream processing systems but are currently rarely used as hardware cost tends to be higher than conventional interconnects. Recently an interconnect with a ring topology was introduced as a low-cost alternative for use in medium scale homogeneous Multiple Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) designs. Cost-effective integration of stream processing accelerators would require an extension of this ring interconnect. We present a dual-ring communication infrastructure for heterogeneous MPSoC designs. Data and credits are transferred between tiles using their separate, oppositely directed, rings. The minimum throughput is determined by analysis of a Cyclo-Static Data Flow (CSDF) model for a system with communication between accelerators and processors. The performance benefits and costs are evaluated by integration of our dual ring and an accelerator in a 16 core MPSoC which is mapped on a Virtex 6 FPGA. On this MPSoC a real-time <b>PAL</b> video <b>decoder</b> is executed. A performance gain of a factor 3. 6 was obtained at an increase in hardware cost of only 8. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Modal {{multi-rate}} {{stream processing}} applications with real-time constraints which are executed on multi-core embedded systems often cannot be conveniently specified using current programming languages. An important {{issue is that}} sequential programming languages do not allow for convenient programming of multi-rate behavior, whereas parallel programming languages are insufficiently analyzable such that deadlock-freedom and a sufficient throughput cannot be guaranteed. In this paper a programming language is proposed by which a sequential specification {{of the behavior of}} an application can be nested in a concurrent specification. Multi-rate behavior can be conveniently expressed using concurrent modules which have well-defined, but restricted interfaces. Complex control behavior can be expressed in the sequential specification of the body of a module. The language is not Turing complete such that a Compositional Temporal Analysis (CTA) model can be derived. It is shown that the CTA model can be used despite the presence of control statements and that the composition of black-box components is possible. Algorithms with a polynomial time complexity can be used to verify whether throughput and latency constraints are met and to determine sufficient buffer capacities. A Phase Alternating Line (<b>PAL)</b> video <b>decoder</b> application is used to demonstrate the applicability of the presented language and analysis approach...|$|R
