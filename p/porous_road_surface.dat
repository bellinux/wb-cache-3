In the following, frequency ranges and conditions under which an inversion has the best chances to be successful is determinated. The models used in this paper are Biot-Allard model and Johnson-Champoux-Allard model, involving respectively 3 and 5 parameters. This analysis showed than on some frequency ranges only one parameter is influent. This helped to build an inversion procedure which will be tested with surface impedance measurements...|$|E
40|$|In {{improving}} {{traffic safety}} and reducing traffic noise road building experts from Slovenia {{and the world}} are faced with permeable surfaces - namely porous asphalt. There is hardly any water retention on road surfaces {{with the use of}} porous asphalt, what Slovenian engineers efficiently use on motorways where transverse profile changes its direction. Lately, porous asphalt is also being used for traffic noise reduction. However, <b>porous</b> <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> has some important disadvantages due to its permeable structure. The reason why porous asphalt is less frequently used is its useful life. Although the science of road construction is progressing, weather conditions and heavy traffic loads cause visible damage on road surface after only a few years. Less porous asphalt surfaces have a proven longer useful life, which is the main reason why, for economic viability, investors rarely decide for road surface made of porous asphalt. ...|$|E
40|$|Road {{surfaces}} made of {{porous asphalt}} {{are widely used}} to reduce the tire-road-noise generated during the rolling process of passenger cars and trucks. As the engine noise was reduced significantly in the last decades the tire-road-noise is the main sound source for driving speeds of 40 kmph (25 mph) and higher for passenger cars. This means that low noise road surfaces may not only be used on highways but also on inner-city main roads to generate a significant reduction on traffic noise. However, the acoustic performance of road surfaces made of porous asphalt is limited {{as a result of}} the trade-off between acoustic properties and road surface durability. By including resonators e. g. of Helmholtz type in the <b>porous</b> <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> it is possible to improve its absorbing performance without loss in durability. The paper describes recent research activities on such resonators in porous road surfaces made in the European project HOS ANN A. The acoustic properties in terms of insertion loss have been calculated for different arrays of resonators. Measurements on realized porous road surfaces including resonators were carried out. The results show that resonators can improve the acoustic performance of porous road surfaces substantially. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} {{a method for}} road managers to assess the sideways-force coefficient (SFC) in porous asphalt with low-cost standard tests. SFC {{can be used as a}} component in <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> condition surveys and asset management decisions. A standard piece of equipment for determining SFC is the sideways-force coefficient routine investigation machine (SCRIM), which can be truck or trailer mounted. This equipment is often beyond the budget of most small, low-volume road agencies. An empirical model for the indirect estimation of SFC for <b>porous</b> <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> was developed as a result of this study. With hand-held equipment the portable skid resistance tester [to derive the British pendulum number (BPN) ] and the sand patch method [height in sand (HS) test] a correlation of these test results can be made, and a reasonable approximation to SFC with the use of the SCRIM method can be attained. BPN, the unit of measurement of the skid tester, is a representation of the microroughness of the wearing surface, and the sand patch method (HS test) results yield the macroroughness of the pavement. The study was conducted over 20 -km segments of low-volume roadway in southern Italy. The initial results are promising, with a maximum percentage of error of less than 15. 2 %. Further study is needed to adapt the model to other <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{monitoring}} results over 2005 for the A 2 motorway at Breukelen in the Netherlands have remained practically unchanged. At the A 10 motorway near Amsterdam, a slight {{decrease in the}} noise reduction of the pavement was found. Here {{it was found that}} the noise emission of wet <b>porous</b> <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> is significantly higher than the noise emission at dry weather conditions and that rainfall can incidentally increase noise levels up to 5 dBA. The results for the N 256 motorway at Colijnsplaat in Zeeland in 2005 are in agreement with 2004 and show a discrepancy in measured and calculated noise emissions for all vehicle categories. At this site during rainfall the traffic noise emissions increased with approximately 1, 5 dBA. The noise emissions of heavy trucks here are almost independent of temperature. Furthermore there is a large variation in vehicle noise emissions within the distinguished categories. In March of 2006, a small sample set of additional measurements was therefore carried out at the Amsterdamsestraatweg in Utrecht in order to gain further insight into these variations. The results are also included in this report. Finally, noise emission levels at the railway track between Amsterdam and Utrecht at Breukelen have remained practically unchanged over 2000 - 2005 and are in agreement with assumptions in Dutch calculation models. In the future a more thorough validation for different stock will become possible from the noise monitoring sites that were established by the Dutch track manager Prorail in april 2006. These all represent the main results of an RIVM noise monitoring programme aimed at monitoring noise trends important to environmental quality, both in urban and rural areas. This programme has been operational since 1999. In the framework of the programme, continuous noise measurements were made at the three highway locations, A 2, A 10 and N 256, along the Utrecht Amsterdam railway trajectories...|$|R

We adopt the British pendulum test method in laboratory conditions to investigate the skid resistance of road asphalt and airfield concrete surfaces covered by volcanic ash sourced from various locations in New Zealand. Controlled variations in ash characteristics include type, depth, wetness, particle size and soluble components. We use Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) for most <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> experiments but also test <b>porous</b> asphalt, line-painted <b>road</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and a roller screed concrete mix used for airfields. Due to their importance for skid resistance, SMA surface macrotexture and microtexture are analysed with semi-quantitative image analysis, microscopy and a standardised sand patch volumetric test, which enables determination of the relative effectiveness of different cleaning techniques. We find that SMA surfaces covered by thin deposits (~ 1 mm) of ash result in skid resistance values slightly lower than those observed on wet uncontaminated surfaces. At these depths, a higher relative soluble content for low-crystalline ash and a coarser particle size results in lower skid resistance. Skid resistance results for relatively thicker deposits (3 – 5 mm) of non-vesiculated basaltic ash are similar to those for thin deposits. There are similarities between road asphalt and airfield concrete, although there is little difference in skid resistance between bare airfield surfaces and airfield surfaces covered by 1 mm of ash. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for maintaining road safety and effective cleaning techniques in volcanic ash environments...|$|R

Noise reductions up to 9 dBA were measured in comparison with and old asphalt concrete at the reference speed of 50 km/h. Several road properties influencing rolling noise have also been measured in situ.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} general {{technique}} for modeling the visible <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> {{in front of}} a vehicle. The common assumption of a planar <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> is often violated in reality. A workaround proposed in the literature is the use of a piecewise linear or quadratic function to approximate the <b>road</b> <b>surface.</b> Our approach is based on representing the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> as a general parametric B-spline curve. The surface parameters are tracked over time using a Kalman filter. The surface parameters are estimated from stereo measurements in the free space. To this end, we adopt a recently proposed road-obstacle segmentation algorithm to include disparity measurements and the B-spline road-surface representation. Experimental results in planar and undulating terrain verify the increase in free-space availability and accuracy using a flexible B-spline for road-surface modeling.

Since the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> temperature is down in winter, <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> freezing causes especially the occurrence of traffic accident. To prevent the occurrence of traffic accident caused by road freezing, the studies and technologiesare needed to predict <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> temperature and provide the driver. Therefore, this study conducts to develop the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> temperature forecasting system using prediction model developed in the previous year. The system proposed {{in this study is}} expected to contribute the research in regards to prevent traffic accidents due to freezing of the road surfac...|$|R
