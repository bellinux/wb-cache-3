5|$|Many of the <b>props</b> in The Wrath of Khan {{had been}} reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many <b>props</b> were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon <b>props</b> were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the <b>props</b> were real and manufactured.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{delivery}} method is described that incorporates taste stimuli into edible strips for determining n-propylthiouracil (<b>PROP)</b> taster status. Edible strips that contained 400 or 600 nanomoles of <b>PROP</b> {{were prepared for}} psychophysical studies. Using these strips, we measured taste intensity, taste hedonics, and taste quality responses {{in a sample of}} healthy volunteers (n =  118). Participants were also asked to assess a single NaCl strip, a quinine strip, 3 NaCl solutions, and 3 <b>PROP</b> solutions. All psychophysical data were subsequently analyzed as a function of TAS 2 R 38 genotype. The use of <b>PROP</b> strips for distinguish-ing between individuals with at least 1 PAV allele and individuals with other genotypes was assessed and compared with the use of <b>PROP</b> solutions for making this same distinction. For the 2 <b>PROP</b> strips and <b>PROP</b> solutions, individuals who expressed at least 1 PAV allele could perceive the bitter taste of <b>PROP.</b> Individuals who expressed 2 AVI alleles responded similarly to 400 nanomole <b>PROP</b> strips and blank strips. Furthermore, individuals with 2 AVI alleles responded to 0. 032 and 0. 32 mM <b>PROP</b> solutions at intensities that were similar to water, though intensity ratings to 3. 2 mM <b>PROP</b> solution exceeded water.

40|$|The domain <b>Prop</b> [11, 30] is a conceptually {{simple and}} elegant {{abstract}} do-main to compute groundness information for Prolog programs, where ab-stract substitutions {{are represented by}} Boolean functions. <b>Prop</b> has raised much theoretical interest recently, but {{little is known about}} the practical accuracy and efficiency of this domain. Experimental evaluation of <b>Prop</b> is particularly important since <b>Prop</b> theoretically needs to solve a co-NP-Complete problem. However, this complexity issue may not matter much in practice because the size of the abstract substitutions is bounded since <b>Prop</b> would only work on the clause variables in many frameworks. The purpose of this paper is to study the performance of domain <b>Prop.</b> Its first contribution is to describe an implementation of the domain <b>Prop</b> and to use it to instantiate a generic abstract interpretation algorithm [17, 23, 27]. A key feature of the implementation is the use of ordered binary decision graphs to provide a compact representation of many Boolean functions. Its second contribution is to describe the design and implementation of a new domain, Pat (<b>Prop),</b> combining the domain <b>Prop</b> with structural infor-mation about the subterms. This new domain may significantly improve the accuracy of the domain <b>Prop</b> on programs manipulating difference-lists. Both implementations (resp. 6000 and 12, 000 lines of C) have been evaluated systematically, and their efficiency and accuracy for groundness inference have been compared with several other abstract domains.

40|$|The genetic {{predisposition}} to taste 6 -n-propylthiouracil (<b>PROP)</b> varies among individuals and {{is associated with}} salivary levels of Ps- 1 and II- 2 peptides, belonging to the basic proline-rich protein family (bPRP). We evaluated the role of these proteins and free amino acids that selectively interact with the <b>PROP</b> molecule, in modulating bitter taste responsiveness. Subjects were classified by their <b>PROP</b> taster status based on ratings of perceived taste intensity for <b>PROP</b> and NaCl solutions. Quantitative and qualitative determinations of Ps- 1 and II- 2 proteins in unstimulated saliva were performed by HPLC-ESI-MS analysis. Subjects rated <b>PROP</b> bitterness after supplementation with Ps- 1 and II- 2, and two amino acids (L-Arg and L-Lys) whose interaction with <b>PROP</b> was demonstrated by (1) H-NMR spectroscopy. ANOVA showed that salivary levels of II- 2 and Ps- 1 proteins were higher in unstimulated saliva of <b>PROP</b> super-tasters and medium tasters than in non-tasters. Supplementation of Ps- 1 protein in individuals lacking it in saliva enhanced their <b>PROP</b> bitter taste responsiveness, and this effect was specific to the non-taster group. (1) H-NMR {{results showed that the}} interaction between <b>PROP</b> and L-Arg is stronger than that involving L-Lys, and taste experiments confirmed that oral supplementation with these two amino acids increased <b>PROP</b> bitterness intensity, more for L-Arg than for L-Lys. These data suggest that Ps- 1 protein facilitates <b>PROP</b> bitter taste perception and identifies a role for free L-Arg and L-Lys in <b>PROP</b> tasting...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in <b>PROP</b> 1 are {{a common}} genetic cause of {{multiple}} pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD). We used a comparative genomics approach to predict the transcriptional regulatory domains of <b>Prop</b> 1 and tested them in cell culture and mice. A BAC transgene containing <b>Prop</b> 1 completely rescues the <b>Prop</b> 1 mutant phenotype, demonstrating that the regulatory elements necessary for proper <b>Prop</b> 1 transcription are contained within the BAC. We generated DNA sequences from the <b>PROP</b> 1 genes in lemur, pig, and five different primate species. Comparison of these with available human and mouse <b>PROP</b> 1 sequences identified three putative regulatory sequences that are highly conserved. These {{are located in the}} <b>PROP</b> 1 promoter proximal region, within the first intron of <b>PROP</b> 1, and downstream of <b>PROP</b> 1. Each of the conserved elements elicited orientation-specific enhancer activity {{in the context of the}} Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase minimal promoter in both heterologous and pituitary-derived cells lines. The intronic element is sufficient to confer dorsal expansion of the pituitary expression domain of a transgene, suggesting that this element is important for the normal spatial expression of endogenous <b>Prop</b> 1 during pituitary development. This study illustrates the usefulness of a comparative genomics approach in the identification of regulatory elements that may be the site of mutations responsible for some cases of MPHD...|$|R
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's <b>props,</b> {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 <b>props</b> for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the <b>props</b> were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the <b>props</b> were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

While past research has suggested {{an association between}} the ability to taste <b>PROP</b> and liking for the taste of sucrose, many aspects of this relationship remain ambiguous. To clarify this further, 60 volunteers (40 women and 20 men) were classified as <b>PROP</b> super- medium or non-tasters and as sweet-likers or dislikers depending on hedonic and intensity ratings for <b>PROP</b> and sucrose. 67 % of <b>PROP</b> super-tasters were sweet dislikers, compared to 12 % of <b>PROP</b> non-tasters. <b>PROP</b> super-tasters also rated the intensity of salty and sweet tastes as greater than did non- or medium <b>PROP</b> tasters, but these differences in sweet intensity could not explain the group differences in sweet liking.

40|$|AbstractTransporter <b>ProP</b> of Escherichia coli, {{a member}} of the major {{facilitator}} superfamily, mediates osmoprotective proline or glycine betaine accumulation by bacteria exposed to high osmolality environments. Morpholinopropane sulfonic acid, a common constituent of microbiological media, accumulates in osmoadapting E. coli cells but it is not osmoprotective and it did not influence <b>proP</b> transcription or <b>ProP</b> activity. The apparent Km for proline uptake via <b>ProP</b> increased with decreasing pH in the range 7. 5 – 4. ProP-dependent proline uptake by de-energized bacteria was associated with alkalinization of the external medium. Thus <b>ProP</b> mediates cotransport of H+ and zwitterionic proline and a transporter functional group with a pKa of 5 – 6 is implicated in catalysis. Exogenous proline or glycine betaine elicits K+ release from osmoadapting E. coli cells and <b>ProP</b> activity is stimulated by exogenous K+. However, uptake of proline or glycine betaine stimulated K+ efflux from K+-loaded bacteria which expressed either <b>ProP</b> or alternative, osmoregulatory transporter ProU. This indicated that <b>ProP</b> was unlikely to mediate K+ efflux. Zwitterions ectoine, pipecolate, proline betaine, N,N-dimethylglycine, carnitine and 1 -carboxymethylpyridinium were identified as alternative <b>ProP</b> substrates.
