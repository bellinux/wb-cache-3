25|$|In 1920, Édouard Claparède and Pierre Bovet {{created a}} new applied {{psychology}} organization called the International Congress of Psychotechnics Applied to Vocational Guidance, later called the International Congress of Psychotechnics and then the International Association of Applied Psychology. The IAAP is considered the oldest international psychology association. Today, at least 65 international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology. In response to male predominance in the field, female <b>psychologists</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. formed National Council of Women <b>Psychologists</b> <b>in</b> 1941. This organization became the International Council of Women Psychologists after World War II, and the International Council of <b>Psychologists</b> <b>in</b> 1959. Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote non-European racial groups in the profession.|$|E

40|$|Submitted {{bachelor}} thesis {{follows the}} professional beginning experiences of <b>psychologist</b> <b>in</b> education. The {{aim of the}} study is to find and describe essentials influencing an entry of the beginning psychologist into education. A label "psychologist in education" includes school <b>psychologists,</b> <b>psychologists</b> working <b>in</b> an educational psychological consultancy or a special education center, according to this thesis. The theoretical part of our study is divided into five parts. We outline a developmental period of young adulthood according to Erikson, general and professional adaptation, coping, professional support forms (supervision, intervision, mentoring) and role of a <b>psychologist</b> <b>in</b> chosen types of institutions. Qualitative methodology is used in an empirical part. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 11 respondents from among beginning <b>psychologists</b> working <b>in</b> assigned types of educational consultancies. The interviews were analyzed by IPA methodology. The results are described in detail and afterwards discussed with available literature. In the conclusion, key points are summarized, which may ease the entry of beginning <b>psychologist</b> <b>in</b> education to employment.

25|$|The {{field of}} {{clinical}} psychology {{in most countries}} is strongly regulated by a code of ethics.

25|$|After {{his illness}} in 1923, Vollenhoven began openly {{to criticize the}} dogma of the {{immortality}} of the soul. This was first initiated by A.

In “The first questions of psychology” (1929), a published lecture, Vollenhoven explained that the soul, as usually understood, is not an immortal substance but rather the psyche {{as a function of}} the human being, which operates within an aspect (or “law-sphere”) of reality. He took the soul itself to be the central unity of the heart of the human being. Vollenhoven had no enemies, but he did gain his first opponents in this connection among <b>psychologists,</b> <b>in</b> particular Jan Waterink, who defended the distinct reality of body, soul, and spirit.|$|E
