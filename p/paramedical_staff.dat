40|$|International audienceThe {{operating}} room represents a major hospital cost centre {{and a highly}} technical area in hospitals. Thus, it is of high interest for human resource management (Guerriero 2011, Butler 1996). Simulations of the surgical process from a human resources perspective are numerous in the literature. However, activities performed outside the {{operating room}} (i. e. “external activities”) are generally neglected (Blake and Carter 1996, Sobolev, Sanchez, and Vasilakis 2011). Our contribution aims to fill this gap and answer the following research question: what {{is the impact of}} external activities planning on surgical activity?The methodology used in this article is a discrete event simulation of both the surgical process and external activities. We apply our model to a case study of three French military hospitals with 20 months of historical data. In this case, external activities are military missions conducted abroad. Medical and <b>paramedical</b> <b>staffs</b> are both involved in the missions. The simulation evaluates the impact of external activities on the volume of surgical care delivered and the number of wasted working hours in the operating suite. Our study shows that external activities often destabilise the surgical process, lowering the operating room efficiency. A global vision of staff activity can be gained through simulation. Critical resources are identified and simulation {{can be used as a}} decision support tool for tactical human resource planning in the operating room...|$|R

Aim: To assess the level of understanding and awareness about hepatitis B infection among the dental undergraduate and postgraduate students, institutional staff of a reputed dental college, dental practitioners, dental auxiliary, and paramedics of a city in Maharashtra. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 350 subjects using a self-administered pretested questionnaire containing 15 questions on awareness about prevention and transmission, vaccination status of hepatitis B, awareness of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and complications associated with hepatitis B. Descriptive analysis was carried out and was presented as a percentage. Results: The response rate was 100 % (n = 350). Majority of the undergraduate and postgraduate students, college staff, and dental practitioners were aware of hepatitis B infection, its vaccination, and its importance but knowledge and awareness regarding the incubation period, PEP, and complications associated were less.

We will also examine recent reactions aimed at remedying to these different pitfalls. In this context, the paper will interest secondly in new entanglements between the public medical sector and the private medical structures emerging at local level.
