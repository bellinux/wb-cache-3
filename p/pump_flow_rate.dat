Controversy continues about the effect of pump flow, pulsatile or nonpulsatile, on the brain and in particular on cerebral blood flow. This study examines the relationship between <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and cerebral hemodynamics during pulsatile and nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. Method: Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to determine cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume (measured as concentration change) in a randomized crossover study. Pulsatile and nonpulsatile flow were used for six 5 -minute intervals at each of three different pump flow rates (0. 6, 1. 2, and 2. 4 L · m 2 · min– 1) in 40 patients, median age 2 months (range 2 weeks to 20 years 5 months). The relations between pulsatile flow, <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> cerebral blood flow, hemoglobin concentration change (cerebral blood volume), mean arterial pressure, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and hematocrit value were prospectively examined by means of multivariate analysis. Results: Cerebral blood flow decreased 36 % per L · m– 2 · min– 1 decrease in <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and was associated with changes in mean arterial pressure but did not differ according to pulsatility.

40|$|Abstract—Tip vortex {{cavitation}} {{is one of}} {{well known}} patterns of cavitation phenomenon which occurs in axial pumps. This pattern of cavitation occurs due to pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of blades of an axial pump. Since the pressure in the pressure side of the blade {{is higher than the}} pressure in its suction side, thus a very small portion of liquid flow flows back from pressure side to the suction side. This fact is cause of tip vortex cavitation and gap cavitation that may occur in axial pumps. In this paper the results of our experimental investigation about movement of tip vortex cavitation along blade edge due to reduction of <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> in an axial pump is reported. Results show that reduction of <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> in conjunction with increasing of outlet pressure causes movement of tip vortex cavitation along blade edge towards the blade tip.
