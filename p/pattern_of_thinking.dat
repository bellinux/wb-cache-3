The May weeks went on into June, and still Mrs. Grandcourt was outwardly in the same place, presenting herself as she was expected {{to do in the}} accustomed scenes, with the accustomed grace, beauty, and costume; from church {{at one end of the}} week, through all the scale of desirable receptions, to opera at the other. Church was not markedly distinguished in her mind from the other forms of self-presentation, for marriage had included no instruction that enabled her to connect liturgy and sermon with any larger order of the world than that of unexplained and perhaps inexplicable social fashions. While a laudable zeal was laboring to carry the light of spiritual law up the alleys where law is chiefly known as the policeman, the brilliant Mrs. Grandcourt, condescending a little to a fashionable rector and conscious of a feminine advantage over a learned dean, was, so far as pastoral care and religious fellowship were concerned, in as complete a solitude as a man in a lighthouse.|$|E

40|$|Taxation {{has been}} a much-discussed subject in the {{literature}} on economics and in writings on the role and meaning of the state. Over the centuries, many authors have put forward views of what qualifies as "good" taxation and what constitutes undesirable tax policy. Consensus on these issues has changed over time, depending on historical circumstances and prevailing modes <b>of</b> economic <b>thinking.</b> In this chapter, we look at analytical views that enjoy broad acceptance in the current literature on taxation. We call these views "rules" or "norms" of analysis. They represent <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> that have wide currency or that have become codified in the literature. The chapter describes eight of the most important rules or norms and then critically examines their validity in a framework that makes explicit allowance for collective choice.

5000|$|However, the Buddha shunned {{any attempt}} to see the spiritual goal in terms of [...] "Self" [...] because in his framework, the craving for a {{permanent}} self is {{the very thing that}} keeps a person in the round of uncontrollable rebirth, preventing him or her from attaining nibbana. At the time of the Buddha some philosophers and meditators posited a root: an abstract principle all things emanated from and that was immanent in all things. When asked about this, instead of following this <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> the Buddha attacks it at its very root: the notion of a principle in the abstract, superimposed on experience. In contrast, a person in training should look for a different kind of [...] "root" [...] — the root of dukkha experienced in the present. According to one Buddhist scholar, theories of this sort have most often originated among meditators who label a particular meditative experience as the ultimate goal, and identify with it in a subtle way.|$|E
5000|$|Jaeger's {{position}} {{concerning the}} history of the interpretation of Plato and Aristotle has been summarized effectively by Harold Cherniss of Johns Hopkins University. In general, {{the history of}} the interpretation of Plato and Aristotle has largely followed the outline of those who subscribe to the position that (a) Aristotle was sympathetic to the reception of Plato's early dialogues and writings, that (b) Aristotle was sympathetic to the reception of Plato's later dialogues and writings, and (c) various combinations and variations of these two positions. Cherniss' reading of Jaeger states, [...] "Werner Jaeger, in whose eyes Plato's philosophy was the 'matter' out of which the newer and higher form of Aristotle's thought proceeded by a gradual but steady and undeviating development (Aristoteles, p. 11), pronounced the 'old controversy,' was whether or not Aristotle understood Plato, to be 'absolut verständnislos.' (absolutely uncomprehending Aristotle). Yet this did not prevent Leisegang from reasserting that Aristotle's own <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> was incompatible with a proper understanding of Plato." [...] Therein Cherniss believed Jaeger to be contrary to Leisegang, and Leisegang was unsympathetic to compatibility between Plato and Aristotle in both (a) and (b) above.|$|E
40|$|My {{thesis is}} about Soren Kierkegaard's thesis, {{entitled}} Om Begrebet Ironi med stadigt Hensyn til Socrates (The concept of irony, especially {{with reference to}} Socrates, 1841). The content of Om Begrebet Ironi is about the three ways that irony manifests itself (Socratic irony, romantic irony and mastered irony). But {{there is more to}} it than that; what it is also about has to do with its form. This form contains four <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> derived from the philosophy of Hegel. The (historical) story of these three manifestations is told in the light <b>of</b> these <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> And this too is not yet all there is: Kierkegaard had little time for Hegel, and none for Hegelianism, which had become an obstacle in his path. It is at this point that the polemicist in him was aroused. Just as Socrates, as a sophist, attacked the Sophists, so Kierkegaard, as a Hegelian, attacked Hegel and the Hegelians. ...|$|R

5000|$|Tucker {{distinguished}} between “real” and “ideal” culture and between “macro-level” and “micro-level” culture. “Real” cultural patterns consist of “prevalent practices in a society”; “ideal” patterns consist of “accepted norms, values, and beliefs”. A “macro-level” {{culture is a}} society’s “complex totality of patterns and sub-patterns” of traditions and orientations; “micro-level” cultural elements are “individual patterns and clusters of them”. Cultural patterns are “ingrained by custom in the conduct and thoughtways {{of large numbers of}} people”. More like an anthropologist than a political scientist, Tucker included behavior as well as values, attitudes, and beliefs in his concept of culture. Tucker affirmed that “a strength of the concept of political culture as an analytic tool (in comparison with such macro concepts as modernization and development) is its micro/macro real/ideal character”. He studied these four characteristics individually and in various juxtapositions, configurations, and interactions. And he hypothesized that different components of political culture “can have differing fates in times of radical change”, especially in revolutionary transitions from one type of political system to another and from one stage of political development to another. Tucker corroborated this hypothesis with evidence from the Soviet Union. In 1987, he affirmed: “The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> one thing in private and being conformist in public will not vanish or radically change simply because glasnost has come into currency as a watchword of policy. Changing the pattern will take time and effort and, above all, some risk-taking openness in action by citizens who speak up ... and forsake the pattern of pretence which for so long has governed public life in their country.” In 1993, he elaborated: “Although communism as a belief system ... is dying out post-Soviet Russia, very many of the real culture patterns of the Soviet period, including that very “’bureaucratism’ that made a comeback after the revolutionary break in 1917, are still tenaciously holding on.” And, in 1995, he added: “The banning of the CPSU, the elimination of communism as a state creed, and the breakup of the USSR as an imperial formation marked in a deep sense the ending of the Soviet era. But {{in part because of the}} abruptness with which these events came about, much of the statist Soviet system and political culture survived into the 1990s.” [...] As Tucker saw it, the “ideal” and “macro” political cultures of the Communist party collapsed with the Soviet Union, but the “real” and “micro” political cultures of tsarist and Soviet Russia adapted to the emerging governmental, commercial, legal, and moral cultures of post-Soviet Russia. He underscored the impact of tsarist political culture on Soviet political culture and, in turn, their combined impact on post-Soviet political culture. Tucker was not a historical determinist, but he observed that centuries-old statism was alive and well in Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.|$|E
