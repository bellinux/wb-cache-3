40|$|Incorporating {{fields of}} sociology, criminology, and public policy, this book {{provides}} a more complete understanding of the issues surrounding drugs. The primary purpose of this work is to teach students about the dynamics of drugs (both legal and illegal) in American society, while providing a look at historical law creation and current law enforcement. Unique coverage includes topics such as the history of drugs in the U. S., the integral role of race {{in the creation of}} drug laws, the elaboration of the global trade in <b>drugs,</b> the U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> control policies and the impact of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> war on international relations.

The findings show that strong foreign patent rights enhance the market power of U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> exporters across countries with weak imitative abilities. Alternatively, strong foreign patent rights stimulate the market expansion of U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> exports across countries with strong imitative abilities.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRecent state-level changes in drug policy {{have raised the}} prospect that similar changes in federal policy may one day follow. Any such changes will have profound effects on U. S. relations with its neighbors to the south. This thesis attempts to analyze the effects of U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> policy on the overall character of U. S. relations with Latin America. U.

40|$|In the 1970 s and 1980 s, many {{pharmaceutical}} firms launched {{new drugs}} abroad prior to gaining U. S. approval. Consequently, U. S. patients often faced delays in accessing important new medicines. High regulatory barriers to entry, {{such as a}} stringent regulation and a lengthy drug review process, contributed to this problem. This Article examines {{the impact of the}} Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), and subsequent increases in the speed of FDA review, on the likelihood of initial U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> launches. These factors are hypothesized to lower regulatory barriers to entry in the U. S. pharmaceutical market. The results show that increased drug review speed and other reform-related changes, such as those affecting drug development times or the probability of approval, have increased the likelihood of initial U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> launches. Overall, the results suggest that PDUFA did improve U. S. patients 2 ̆ 7 access to new medicines by encouraging more first drug launches in the U. S. market...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{testing of}} athletes has become {{common in the}} present day sports world.

This paper will explain each league 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>drug</b> testing program and then compare specific aspects. Special attention will be paid to four categories: administration, testing, treatment and discipline.

40|$|The use {{of illicit}} drugs {{continues}} to be a problem around the world, particularly in the United States. Many individuals relapse following treatment for substance abuse; however, the role that drug attitude plays in the amount of time between treatment and relapse is not known. Research regarding the relationship between attitude and behavior change, drug use and relapse, gender differences in relapse, ways to measure drug attitude, and the relationship between drug attitude and drug use are discussed. The present study utilized a data set that consisted of one hundred subjects who participated in residential treatment for addiction. All subjects were dually diagnosed with major mental illness and a substance use or abuse disorder. The overall {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the relationship between drug attitude at intake and time to relapse following completion of residential treatment. Results indicated that there was no significant relationship between drug attitude and time to relapse following treatment. Results further indicated that there were no differences in scores on Campbell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Drug</b> Attitude Scale for males and females and no difference in time to relapse for males and females.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} effect of United States counter-drug policy on nationalism in small states, focusing on Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. The states were selected for their roles and geostrategic importance in the illegal drug trade; Jamaica being the largest drug producing country in the Anglophone Caribbean and having strong links to the trade of Colombian cocaine, and Trinidad being a mere seven miles from the South American coast. ^ Since U. S. counterdrug policies have frequently been viewed {{in the region as}} imperialistic, this dovetails into ideas on the perceptions of smallness and powerlessness of Caribbean nations. Hence, U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> policies affect every vulnerability faced by the Caribbean, individually and collectively. Thus, U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> policy was deemed the most appropriate independent variable, with nationalism as the dependent variable. ^ In both countries four Focus Groups and one Delphi Study were conducted resulting in a total of 60 participants. Focus Group participants, recruited from the general population, were asked about their perception of the illegal drug trade in the country and the policies their government had created. They were also asked their perception on how deeply involved the U. S. was in the creation of these policies and their opinions on whether this involvement was positive or negative. The Delphi Study participants were experts in the field of local drug policies and also gave their interpretations of the role the U. S. played in local policy creation. Coupled with this data, content analysis was conducted on various newspaper articles, press releases, and speeches made regarding the topic. ^ In comparing both countries, it was found that there is a disconnect between government actions and the knowledge and perceptions of the general public. In Trinidad and Tobago this disconnect was more apparent given the lack of awareness of local drug policies and the utter lack of faith in government solutions. The emerging conclusion was that the impact of U. <b>S.</b> <b>drug</b> policy on nationalism was more visible in Trinidad and Tobago where there was a weaker civil society-government relationship, while the impact on nationalism was more obscure in Jamaica, which had a stronger civil-society government relationship. ...|$|R
