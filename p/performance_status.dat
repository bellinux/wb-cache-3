5|$|Prognostic {{factors in}} NSCLC include {{presence}} of pulmonary symptoms, large tumor size (>3cm), nonsquamous cell type (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. For people with inoperable disease, outcomes are worse {{in those with}} poor <b>performance</b> <b>status</b> and weight loss of more than 10%.

5|$|Treatment for {{lung cancer}} {{depends on the}} cancer's {{specific}} cell type, how far it has spread, and the person's <b>performance</b> <b>status.</b> Common treatments include palliative care, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

40|$|Combination {{chemotherapy}} {{has been}} shown to improve overall survival compared with best supportive care in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The survival advantage is modest and was initially demonstrated with cisplatin-containing regimens in a large meta-analysis of randomized trials reported in 1995. Newer chemotherapy combinations {{have been shown to be}} better tolerated than older cisplatin-based combinations, and some trials have also shown greater efficacy and survival benefits with these newer combinations. Combination chemotherapy is, therefore, the currently accepted standard of care for patients with good <b>performance</b> <b>statuses</b> aged less than 70 years with advanced NSCLC. However, there are limited data from clinical trials to support the use of combination chemotherapy in elderly patients over 70 years of age with advanced NSCLC. Subgroup analyses of large randomized phase III trials suggest that elderly patients with good <b>performance</b> <b>statuses</b> do as well as younger patients treated with combination chemotherapy. There are few randomized trials reported that evaluate chemotherapy in patients aged greater than 70 years only. Based on data from trials performed by an Italian group, single-agent vinorelbine {{has been shown}} to have significant activity in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC and to be well tolerated by those patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group <b>performance</b> <b>statuses</b> of two or less, with associated improvements in measures of global health...|$|R

25|$|Because LCLC-RP is so rare, no {{clinical}} trials {{have ever been}} conducted that specifically address treatment of this lung cancer variant. Because LCLC-RP is considered a form of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), most physicians adhere to published NSCLC treatment guidelines in rhabdoid carcinoma cases. When possible, radical surgical resection with curative intent is the primary treatment of choice in early stage NSCLC's, and can be administered with or without adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, depending on the disease stage and <b>performance</b> <b>status</b> of the individual patient.|$|E
500|$|Surgery {{with the}} {{intention}} of a cure is only possible in around one-fifth (20%) of new cases. [...] Although CT scans help, in practice {{it can be difficult to}} determine whether the tumor can be fully removed (its [...] "resectability"), and it may only become apparent during surgery that it is not possible to successfully remove the tumor without damaging other vital tissues. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on various factors, including the precise extent of local anatomical adjacency to, or involvement of, the venous or arterial blood vessels, as well as surgical expertise and a careful consideration of projected post-operative recovery. The age of the person is not in itself a reason not to operate, but their general <b>performance</b> <b>status</b> needs to be adequate for a major operation.|$|E

By the end of 2013, both FOLFIRINOX and nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine were regarded as good choices for those able to tolerate the side-effects, and gemcitabine remained an effective option {{for those who were}} not. [...] A head-to-head trial between the two new options is awaited, and trials investigating other variations continue.
