5|$|The {{rejection}} of traditional forms <b>and</b> structures for <b>poetry</b> {{that began in}} the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of <b>poetry</b> <b>and</b> of distinctions between <b>poetry</b> <b>and</b> prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose <b>and</b> <b>prosaic</b> <b>poetry.</b> Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.|$|R

40|$|Cross-linguistically, {{reduplication}} {{associated with}} iconic readings, such as plurality, iteration, and continuation, is prevalent in ideophones. However, not all reduplicative processes in ideophones are clearly iconic. Notably, both less and more iconic uses of reduplication are encountered in ordinary vocabulary {{resulting in the}} overlapping semantic functions of reduplication between ideophonic and non-ideophonic (i. e., prosaic) lexical categories. Given this, {{the aim of this}} paper is not to establish one clear-cut point to distinguish ideophonic reduplication from prosaic reduplication that may be impossible, but to specify dimensions of possibilities along which several instances of ideophonic <b>and</b> <b>prosaic</b> reduplication can be calibrated, using Canonical Typology (Corbett 2003; 2005; 2006; 2007; 2012; 2015). The current paper adopts the canonical approach of typology in an innovative way – not to compare a reduplicative phenomenon across languages (classic “typology”), but within a language by drawing ideophonic <b>and</b> <b>prosaic</b> data from Japanese, which is rich in reduplication and ideophones. Measuring the canonicity values of the various occurring types of ideophonic <b>and</b> <b>prosaic</b> reduplication against six criteria for canonical ideophonic reduplication, this paper shows how many and what criteria can differentiate the two sets of phenomena. Consequently, it reveals how ideophonic <b>and</b> <b>prosaic</b> reduplication are alike or different from each other. It also demonstrates the utility of Localized Canonical Typology, for the precise description and analysis of complex categories in a single language...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the {{mechanisms by which}} intergenerationally gifted assets are transformed into inalienable wealth and describes how such gifts convey and transfer meaning within families. The study's findings reveal that individuals employ indexical accounts to allocate assets in support of relational goals <b>and</b> employ <b>prosaic</b> accounts to achieve utilitarian goals. These findings contribute to intergenerational gifting theories by demonstrating how an asset transitions between inalienable and alienable states, identifying antecedents <b>and</b> consequences of <b>prosaic</b> <b>and</b> indexical accounts, explaining the interactions between inalienable and alienable states and between indexical <b>and</b> <b>prosaic</b> account allocations, <b>and</b> discussing the implications of labeled assets on consumer behavior.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to contemplation of lexical items {{presenting}} the lexical semantic field «destiny» in M. Y. Lermontov`s poetic <b>and</b> <b>prosaic</b> texts.  The aim of this work is {{determination of the content}} of the concept «destiny» in Lermontov`s creativities. To investigate the lexical-semantic field «destiny» was chosen the most significant for the understanding of the poet`s works of 1828 - 1839 period. Method of research is the direction of Cognitive analysis of the form to meaning. Scientific novelty of the paper is that the linguistic analysis performed for the first the concept «destiny» in the works of Lermontov. The study of lexical-semantic field «destiny» in <b>poetry</b> <b>and</b> prose Lermontov`s texts has allowed us to draw the following conclusions: 1) the concept «destiny» refers to the most important concepts in Lermontov`s idiostyle; 2) the content of the concept «destiny» in the poet`s creativities includes a characteristic semantic content of the coincident category in the Russian language picture of the world; 3) the concept «destiny» is linked to the works of Lermontov with the categories of time and space, as well as the categories of material and non-material world.
