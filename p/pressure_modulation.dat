50|$|An {{exhaust brake}} is {{a device that}} {{essentially}} creates a major restriction in the exhaust system, and creates substantial exhaust back pressure to retard engine speed and offer some supplemental braking. In most cases, an exhaust brake is so effective that it can slow a heavily loaded vehicle on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicle's service brakes. Exhaust brakes are manufactured by many companies. The brakes vary in design, but essentially operate as described above. More advanced exhaust brakes have exhaust <b>pressure</b> <b>modulation</b> (EPM) that controls the back pressure which in turn improves the braking performance {{across a range of}} engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|Valve and Pump SystemsThe {{main parts}} which {{are part of}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>modulation</b> system are solenoid inlet and outlet valves, a pump, motor and accumulators/reservoirs. The number of the valves differs from model to model due to {{additional}} functionalities and the number of brake channels. Based on the input of the ECU, coils operate the in- and outlet valves. During pressure release the brake fluid is stored in accumulators. In this open system approach the fluid is then brought back in the brake circuit via a pump operated by a motor which is felt through pulsation on the brake lever.|$|E
50|$|Piston SystemsThe {{pressure}} release {{in this system}} is realized through movement of a spring-tensioned piston. When pressure should be released, a linear motor pulls back the plunger piston and opens up more space for the fluid. The system was used for example in the ABS I (1988) and ABS II (1993) of BMW. The ABS II differed in size and an electronically controlled friction clutch was mounted on the shaft instead of a plunger. Further displacement sensors record the travel distance of the piston to allow the control unit a more precise regulation. Honda also uses this system of <b>pressure</b> <b>modulation</b> for big sports and touring bikes.|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, an {{analytical}} investigation on active, semi-active and passive vibration control mechanisms {{is presented in}} order to achieve improved shock and vibration isolation of mechanical systems, especially ground vehicle applications. A hybrid active vibration isolation system, incorporating an electro-magnetic force generator along with passive damping and spring elements, is mathematically modeled based on fundamental physical laws and taking into account the generator dynamics. Complete vibration isolation characteristics of the hybrid active control system are evaluated for various feedback variables and control schemes, using numerical simulations. Influence of the force generator dynamics on vibration isolation performance is illustrated through the simulation results. A concept of tunable <b>pressure</b> limiting <b>modulation</b> is proposed in hydraulic damper systems. A hydraulic orifice damper is modified by using the proposed tunable <b>pressure</b> limiting <b>modulation</b> to achieve variable damping in vibration isolation systems, without requiring any external energy source, sophisticated control devices and feedback instrumentation that are essential for active and semi-active isolators. The fluid flow equations are employed to develop the nonlinear mathematical model of the hydraulic damper, incorporating the fluid and mechanical compliance, and the dynamics of the pressure limiting mechanism. The computer simulation reveals that the shock and vibration isolation performance of the tunable pressure limited hydraulic damper systems is comparable to that of the semi-active 'on-off' vibration control systems. A generalized harmonic linearization technique, based on a principle of energy similarity of dynamic elements, is proposed to derive equivalent linear representations of both nonlinear damping and spring elements, in the frequency domain. An analysis of the nonlinear in-plane vehicle model, with air-springs, orifice damping and <b>pressure</b> limiting <b>modulation</b> due to tunable hydraulic shock absorbers, is carried out to establish the stochastic response to random road inputs in terms of power spectral density, and to illustrate the improved vehicle ride performance due to tunable shock absorbers. An interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension with tunable pressure limiting mechanism is presented to achieve improved vehicle ride and handling performance. Analysis of a roll plane model of a vehicle employing the tunable interconnected suspension shows that the connections of fluid flow within the interconnected suspension provide an enhanced static roll stability; while the tunable <b>pressure</b> limiting <b>modulation</b> between the strut and the accumulator of each suspension unit offers an improved vehicle ride performanc...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} and validate {{a pressure}} measurement paradigm that reduces extracerebral contamination from superficial tissues in optical monitoring of {{cerebral blood flow}} with diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS). The scheme determines subject-specific contributions of extracerebral and cerebral tissues to the DCS signal by utilizing probe <b>pressure</b> <b>modulation</b> to induce variations in extracerebral blood flow. For analysis, the head is modeled as a two-layer medium and is probed with long and short source-detector separations. Then a combination of <b>pressure</b> <b>modulation</b> and a modified Beer-Lambert law for flow enables experimenters to linearly relate differential DCS signals to cerebral and extracerebral blood flow variation without a priori anatomical information.

40|$|National audienceIn {{order to}} produce sound on a wind instrument, the {{respiratory}} system and muscles contract or relax to create the required pressure, flow and velocity for each instrument (Bouhuys, 1977, Brown, 1990). In the case of low pressure instruments, researchers agree that some inspiratory muscles are recruited as antagonists during the expiratory phase (Bouhuys, 1977, Roos, 1936). Only few studies actually measured the respiratory muscle recruitment during wind instrument playing (Berger, 1968, Cossette et al. 2000, 2008). The authors' study (2008) reported that flute 'breath support', which is associated with high quality playing, entails antagonistic contraction of non-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles. The rib cage is held at higher lung volume during long legato phrase playing. Relieved from the task of producing the right mouth pressure, especially at lower lung volume, the expiratory muscles contribute more to the finer control of mouth <b>pressure</b> <b>modulations.</b> Furthermore, during 'support', the lung volume at which playing a phrase ends is usually above Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) and rarely far below it. The strong expiratory muscle pressures required to play the flute at low lung volumes are generally avoided, while advantage is taken of the high relaxation pressures at high lung volumes. For this study, we compared the respiratory patterns and muscle recruitment above and under FRC while four standing young professional flautists' were performing melodies and long tones with and without 'breath support' at different intensities. These musical tasks required the performers to use most of their vital capacity during loud playing. Recordings included optoelectronic plethysmographic measurements of the chest wall volume and its compartments, surface electromyography of the respiratory muscles (scalene, lateral abdominal, rectus abdominus, and sternocleidomastoid), mouth pressure, and sound. Preliminary analysis suggests that volume (rather than time only), condition (with/without support), as well as intensity (forte/piano) are all determinants of muscle activation...|$|R

To attenuate the large pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber, the fuel is pulsed so that the heat release rate fluctuations damp the pressure oscillations in the combustor.
