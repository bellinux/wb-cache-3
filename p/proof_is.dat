5000|$|The case n = 7 was proven by Gabriel Lamé in 1839. [...] His rather {{complicated}} <b>proof</b> <b>was</b> simplified in 1840 by Victor-Amédée Lebesgue, {{and still}} simpler <b>proofs</b> <b>were</b> published by Angelo Genocchi in 1864, 1874 and 1876.

5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. The <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{correlation}} between location of Stylidium species and proximity of known carnivorous species, like sundews (Drosera), bladderworts (Utricularia), the Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and the rainbow plant (Byblis). While this alone does not prove that Stylidium species are themselves carnivorous, the hypothesis is that the association arose because Stylidium species and the known carnivorous plants obtain scarce nutrients using the same source, namely captured insects. Preliminary <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> given that the trapping mechanisms of two associated plants are the same (the tentacles of Byblis and Drosera), though this may be only a coincidence and further research must be done.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} towards Living Proof was mixed. Some music critics {{noted that}} it was even better than Believe, while others criticized the excessive use of Auto-Tune. Commercially, the album did not reach the same success as its predecessor, debuting at number nine on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 82,000 copies. It was also received moderately in Europe, peaking within the top 30 in Sweden and the top 50 in the United Kingdom, despite being certified gold by both Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Living <b>Proof</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have sold {{more than a million}} copies worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The {{notion of}} {{analytic}} <b>proof</b> <b>was</b> introduced into <b>proof</b> theory by Gerhard Gentzen for the sequent calculus; the analytic <b>proofs</b> <b>are</b> {{those that are}} cut-free.

He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v.

25|$|To {{establish}} a mathematical statement as a theorem, a <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> required, that is, {{a line of}} reasoning from axioms in the system (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated. However, the <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> usually considered as separate from the theorem statement. Although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> required to establish {{the status of a}} statement as a theorem. The Pythagorean theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> formalized {{in the field of}} {{mathematical}} logic. A formal <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> written in a formal language instead of a natural language. A formal <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> defined as sequence of formulas in a formal language, in which each formula is a logical consequence of preceding formulas. Having a definition of formal proof makes the concept of proof amenable to study. Indeed, the field of proof theory studies formal proofs and their properties, for example, the property that a statement has a formal proof. An application of proof theory is to show that certain undecidable statements are not provable.|$|E
