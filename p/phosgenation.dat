40|$|Due to its {{relevance}} in {{the synthesis of}} well-defined oligopeptides, the l-leucine-N-carboxyanhydride (leucine-NCA) synthesis was selected for fine chemical scale-up with a scope on application on larger scales. The heterogeneous gas-solid-liquid nature of the leucine-NCA synthesis implied a mass transfer limited reaction rate towards <b>phosgenation</b> and was investigated on bench scale. Upon scale increase, the liquid-gas mass transport of HCl is drastically reduced, retarding the reaction and consequently rendering the process unsuitable for scale-up.

It has been postulated these ureas undergo further reaction with phosgene to produce a precursor to chlorine radicals, which could then attack the MDI backbone forming conjugated systems that would promote colour in the final products. To investigate this process model compounds including 4 -benzylaniline (4 -BA) and 1, 3 -diphenylurea were used as starting materials. The reactions carried out showed the <b>phosgenation</b> of the urea forms a chloroformamidine-N-carbonyl chloride (CCC) which upon heating > 303 K can break down to form an isocyanide dichloride (ID). Conventional synthesis routes were used to gain high yields of p-tolyl and phenyl isocyanide dichlorides in order to analyse the compounds. It was found that upon heating to 453 K or irradiating the isocyanide dichlorides in the process solvent (chlorobenzene) coloured solutions were formed; with the presence of MDI and oxygen increasing the intensity of the colouration.

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{encountered}} during the industrial synthesis of isocyanates, {{is the loss}} of amine starting material through reaction with the hydrogen chloride (HC 1) by-product. HC 1 is formed by the <b>phosgenation</b> of polymeric amines and also by the subsequent decomposition of the carbamyl chloride, Equation (1). HC 1 readily reacts with the polymeric amine to form an unwanted and highly insoluble amine hydrochloride salt. (Fig. 3620) Methylene dianiline (MDA) and 4 -benzylaniline (4 -BA) were used as models for the industrial amine starting material with their hydrochloride counterparts methylene dianiline dihydrochloride (MDA. 2 HC 1) and 4 -benzylaniline hydrochloride (4 -BA. HC 1) as models for the industrial waste material. To understand the forces controlling the structure and stability of these solid amine hydrochloride salts the sold state structures of MDA, MDA. 2 HCl, methylene dianiline monohydrochloride (MDA. HCl), 4 -BA and 4 -BA. HCl were investigated using single crystal X-ray diffraction which led to the determination of their lattice energies. The XRD studies were also used as a basis for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The information obtained from the solid state structures, combined with an investigation of the solution phase behaviour of 4 -BA. HCl(s), resulted in the determination of a kinetic model for the recovery of amine starting material. The proposed reaction scheme describes the conditions under which the dissociation of 4 -BA. HCl(s) can occur. Reaction in a closed system shows no amine production while reaction in an open system permits, within solubility limits, the complete consumption of solid waste to produce free amine. From these two extremes the conversion of waste hydrochloride salt in the industrial reactor can be rationalised. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Methylene {{diphenyl}} diisocyanate (MDI) is {{the most}} widely employed diisocyanate {{for the production of}} polyurethanes (PUs). This family of polymers is used for many applications including adhesives and coatings where an important characteristic is good adhesion. Considering how widely PUs are employed, the importance of MDI production in the world becomes evident. The <b>phosgenation</b> step, in the MDI production process, ultimately leads to fouling of the climbing �lm evaporators (CFEs) employed, resulting in the loss of their thermal e�- ciency. This work is concerned with the interactions between MDI (and related compounds) with metal substrates such as steels, which are employed in the CFEs as well as substrates for adhesion. For this study, surface analysis techniques, in particular X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of ight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), have been employed. Both substrates (316 L and duplex steels) and adsorbates (MDI, polymeric MDI, methylene diphenyl amine and amine hydrochloride) have been characterised. The interaction between phenyl ring � electrons (present in MDI and related compounds) and metal have been studied by observing the XPS �-�� shake-up satellite at high spectral resolution. The interface between MDI and related compounds was then investigated. After the investigation of the model samples, plant facsimile samples were produced and analysed. Finally, actual plant samples were characterised. Proof was found of interaction between the phenyl ring � electrons and the silicon substrate, as well as the formation of covalent bonds at the interface between MDI and steel {{as a result of the}} reaction between isocyanate and metal oxides and hydroxides, present on the surface of the steel. The facsimile samples showed the same types of interactions observed in the model samples and it was also found that the corrosion of the metal strongly influences the adhesion and fouling mechanisms.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} study addresses {{two important}} topics - {{development of a}} non-phosgene route for manufacture of isocyanates & a life cycle analysis comparison between polycarbonate and Tritan. Isocyanates are currently manufactured by the <b>phosgenation</b> route which involves reaction of an amine with phosgene. This process requires handling of hazardous chemicals and is not considered environmentally benign due to issues related to disposal / recycle of the hydrochloric acid formed as a byproduct. William McGhee et al have previously worked on a non-phosgene route for manufacture isocyanates from primary amine, carbon dioxide, nitrogenous base and an electrophilic dehydrating agent. However, due to the generation of large amount of salt of the dehydrating agent and the base, and due {{to the absence of}} an appropriate recycling strategy this route could not be commercialized. To reduce the salt formed, a modification to this route is presented by eliminating the use of the nitrogenous base and carrying out the reaction in excess of carbon dioxide. The effect of different solvents, dehydrating agents, varying temperature and pressures on the conversion to isocyanate and a recycling strategy for the by-products formed has been studied. The energy requirement for this process is compared with the traditional route using ASPEN Plus. The results have been used to understand the potential roadblocks in the commercialization of the new process and the future direction of work to improve it. The second part of the study is a life cycle analysis (LCA) comparison of polycarbonates with Tritan, which has been claimed to be an effective replacement for polycarbonates as it does not contain bisphenol-A, but still matches its physical and mechanical properties. However, the environmental impacts due the production of Tritan had not been studied yet. Hence, LCA study for polycarbonate and Tritan is performed on the basis of published literature. Effect due to different recycling strategies and different allocation techniques are studied on the overall environmental impact of these polymers. The study indicates that Tritan has lower impacts compared to polycarbonates in most of the impact categories studied. However, the extent to which Tritan performs better strongly depends on the functional unit considered...|$|E
40|$|The first aim of {{this work}} was to prepare water soluble [B 12 H 12] 2 - {{containing}} amino acids. This task was reached by using the ability of dodecaborate derivatives such as ammonio-undecahydro-closo-dodecaborate BNH 3, hydroxo-undecahydro-closo-dodecaborate BOH and S-(2 -cyanoethyl) -thio-undecahydro-closo-dodecaborate(2 -) CE-BSH to undergo alkylation reactions. With this idea we used halogen substituted monoalkylated educts such as:- 4 -Bromobutylacetamidodiethylmalonate. Alkylation reactions with BOH 4 and CE-BSH were made with high yield (93 %) for CE-BSH and with moderate yield (53 %) for BOH. Alkylation of BNH 3 gave a mixture of mono- and dialkyl-substituted products. Separation of this mixture could not be achieved. - Chloroacetone. Alkylation of CE-BSH and BOH with chloroacetone was carried out with quantitative yields. We showed the ability of these ketones formed to give appropriate hydantoins. - (2 S) - 2 -[(Tert-butoxycarbonyl) amino]- 3 -(p-tolylsulfonyl-oxy) propionate. It was shown that alkylation of CE-BSH with tosylated serine is possible. All alkylated derivatives were hydrolyzed in 6 M NaOH to yield free amino acids. The solubility of synthesized amino acids depends of the cation. Cs increases solubility in water. In vitro toxicity tests were carried out with two amino acids having different number of carbons and two different heteroatoms between cluster and side chain. Toxicity test was done with V 79 Chinese hamster cells. For amino acid 13 a LD 50 was 5. 7 mM and for 16 a LD 50 was 5. 0 mM. According to these results, {{we can say that}} addition of an amino acid group to, e. g. the BSH cage, does not change the toxicity. For the second task of this work - synthesis of D,L-polypeptides - the ring-opening polymerization method was chosen. We showed the ability of the synthesized dodecaborate-containing amino acids to form N-carboxy anhydride by <b>phosgenation.</b> Polymerization was carried out with two initiators: n-butylamine and dansyl amine. It was shown that the initiator did not interact to the polymer structure, but act as a catalyst in the AM mechanism. The determination of the molecular weight of the synthesized polymers (number of monomers) failed, however. All synthesized compounds were identified by 1 H-, 13 C-, 11 B-NMR, mass spectrometry, IR spectra.

Abstract In this {{research}} the technological and economical feasibility {{of a new}} technology {{for the production of}} methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is assessed. Context The global consumption of MDI totalled 4, 150 kT in 2009 and an annual growth of 4. 6 % is expected until 2013. MDI is almost exclusively used for the production of polyurethane (PU). Currently the growth has stagnated due to the financial crisis, but it is still expected that this downfall is temporary, and that additional capacity investments are needed in the future. At the moment all commercial MDI production technology is based on a <b>phosgenation</b> process. In this process phosgene is used as a feedstock component. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas and therefore causes major safety hazards. It is also a controversial material because it can, and {{has been used as a}} chemical warfare agent. Consequently phosgene using production processes are banned from many regions, especially the Middle East. A lot of scientific research has been conducted on phosgene free production processes of MDI, though none of these processes has been commercialized. This study assesses the technological and the economical feasibility of the most viable phosgene free route to MDI. The studied route consists of three steps: • The synthesis of methyl phenyl carbamate (MPC) from aniline and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) feedstock. • MPC is condensed with formaldehyde to form dimethyl methylene diphenyl dicarbamate (MDC). • MDC is thermally decomposed to MDI. Methanol is produced as a valuable by-product. The major advantages of a phosgene free route to MDI are: (1) the process contains less safety hazards and (2) the availability of a competitive phosgene free route to MDI does comply with the strict regulations in all regions and thus create new business opportunities. The research was initiated by Fluor; Fluor is a “Fortune 500 ” company that delivers engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance (EPCM), and project management to governments and clients in diverse industries around the world, including the PU industry. The research is intended for use in business development activities. Goal The goal of {{this research}} is to assess the process technologies and economics of a phosgene free production process of MDI in an effort to support a Fluor strategy for further development in these markets. This goal has led to two main research questions: 1. Is it technologically feasible to produce phosgene free MDI on a commercial scale? 2. Is it economically feasible to produce phosgene free MDI on a commercial scale? Conclusions - Technological feasibility The studied phosgene free production process is technologically feasible but it still contains many uncertainties. Therefore additional research is necessary before the phosgene free technology can be implemented on a commercial scale. The most important uncertainties are the following. 1. The actual reaction performance of all three synthesis reactions on a large scale. 2. The quality and functionality of the produced MDI. 3. The physical properties of all process components. 4. The separation of the DMC:methanol azeotrope. Based on these conclusions, four steps are necessary to develop a proven process that can be up scaled to a production plant of commercial scale: 1. The physical properties and process behaviour of many components need to be investigated. 2. A reliable catalyst system for each reaction needs to be developed. 3. A separation method for the DMC:methanol azeotrope needs to be developed. 4. A pilot plant needs to be set up to prove and optimize the process. Conclusions - Economical feasibility The currently available phosgene free MDI production technology is economically inferior to the conventional technology. The new technology does need financial investments, but the current financial situation, with low MDI prices, is not an incentive for additional capacity investments. Moreover, the currently installed production capacity of MDI is expected to be sufficient to meet the global demand until 2013 at least. Regardless of the financial crisis, growths in the MDI markets are still expected. Even though the phosgene free technology is not competitive today, this study indicates that it does have the potential to become cost competitive. Governments and legislative institutions could impose stricter legislation and thereby stimulate the development of the phosgene free technology and enforce a transition in this market. This is a very plausible situation since the new technology can be cost competitive in comparison to the conventional technology and it does show significant improvements concerning HSE (Health, Safety, Environment). The polycarbonate case is similar to that of MDI and does confirm this sequence of events. The phosgene free MDI production technology may eventually become economically feasible when future circumstances change, for instance if (1) stricter legislation is imposed, (2) the performance of the phosgene free process is improved and/or (3) if the DMC cost is decreased. Path forward – Fluor Phosgene free production of MDI is not expected to become reality in the near future and new MDI plants will probably still be based on the conventional <b>phosgenation</b> production process, unless there are significant improvements in the phosgene free technology or stricter governmental legislation is imposed that would restrict the phosgene using MDI production technology and enforces alternative technologies. The latter case is not unlikely as it happened before in the similar polycarbonate technology. For Fluor this implicates that there are multiple options possible; which range from an active to a proactive stance. The active stance means that no immediate action is taken. The situation and developments in the MDI market will be monitored and if the business environment changes, i. e. due to technological breakthroughs or stricter governmental regulations, Fluor can act accordingly. As long as the status quo is maintained, business is continued as usual. The proactive stance implies that Fluor will interfere in the discussion by actively promoting the development of the phosgene free MDI production technology. Promotion can be done by, for example, publishing articles that support the development of the new technology or collaborating with public or private research institutions to increase scientific progress in this field. In this way it could accelerate a transition to a new production technology in the MDI markets. By finding strategic partners and be directly involved in new developments, this option could result in Fluor being a frontrunner in an emerging market of phosgene free MDI production. Fluor has a very active policy concerning HSE; therefore the proactive stance would be in line with the company’s strong sense of global responsibility and could even strengthen the position of Fluor in this field. However, Fluor is also a public owned company and therefore focused on profits; active involvement in the development of this new technology will consume resources and it is not certain whether it will be profitable. A trade-off has to be made between the degree of involvement and the amount of resources that Fluor is willing to dedicate to the development of a phosgene free MDI production technology. Path forward – Scientific community Phosgene free MDI production is not economically viable based on the current knowledge. However, this research does show that the cost of the described phosgene free process is similar to that of the conventional process. Moreover, there is definitely a cost competitive potential; especially if legislation is enforced to accelerate the development of the phosgene free MDI production technology. The major disadvantage of the technology is that the described phosgene free process is new and therefore contains many uncertainties, as opposed to the fully developed conventional production process. As described in the ‘Conclusions - Technological feasibility’ paragraph above, there are four major steps necessary to develop a proven process for phosgene free MDI production. These steps serve as recommendations for further research and can be addressed by the scientific community. However, to utilize the economical potential of the new technology, it does not only need to be proven but it does need improvement. Therefore more concrete targets for experimental research are set. These targets are derived from the economical feasibility study. Reaching these targets would significantly improve the competitive position of the phosgene free technology. The targets are the following. • The amount of nitrobenzene needed has to be decreased by at least 50 %. • The reaction performance of the MPC synthesis reaction has to be improved; (1) the DMC:aniline ratio needs to be decreased from 7 : 1 to 2 : 1 and (2) the residence time of 8 hours needs to be decreased in order to minimize the reactor volume...|$|E
