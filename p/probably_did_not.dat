5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} idiopathic scoliosis. In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, it <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> cause any major physical deformity {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|E
5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as {{indifferent}} or even favourable to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals. Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> play any role in the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed the instructions of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.|$|E

5|$|Jesus {{appears as}} an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is {{typically}} joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. Francis of Assisi (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the calcaneum is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The castle was garrisoned {{throughout}} most of the 17th century. In the civil war of the 1640s between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was held for Parliament, {{under the control of the}} Governor of Poole. The castle was refortified and in 1644, Parliament ordered that four pieces of artillery and four chests of muskets be sent to the castle, which by 1646 had a garrison of 20 men. During the Interregnum, the wealthy merchant Sir Robert Clayton bought the surrounding island. Clayton <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> live in the castle, however, and it fell into disrepair; by the end of the century the town of Poole refused to garrison the decaying defences.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> form {{where it is}} found today. Because of the {{decreased}} gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|E
5|$|The see of Canterbury {{seems at}} this time to have been passing through a period of {{comparative}} obscurity. During Deusdedit's nine years as archbishop, all the new bishops in England were consecrated by Celtic or foreign bishops, with one exception: Deusdedit consecrated Damianus, Ithamar's successor as Bishop of Rochester. Deusdedit did, however, found a nunnery in the Isle of Thanet and helped with the foundation of Medeshamstede Abbey, later Peterborough Abbey, in 657. He was long overshadowed by Agilbert, bishop to the West Saxons, and his authority as archbishop <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> extend past his own diocese and that of Rochester, which had traditionally been dependent on Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, {{escaped from}} slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman {{had been hired}} out to Dr. Anthony Thompson, who owned a large {{plantation}} in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the Cambridge Democrat, offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned. Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts. Ben may have just become a father. The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them.|$|E

5|$|After 1805, the {{exploits}} of 40,000French, Russian, and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination. General Schmitt's grave has never been found, but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor, the gate leading from the old village of Krems to the hamlet of Stein. The house in which Captain von Stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle. In 1840, a Spanish lithographer created {{an image of the}} battle, which was later expanded by English lithographer John Outhwaite. The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the Danube flotilla (see Infobox image) on a moonlit night. In fact, the moon was in its last quarter phase 48hours later, and on 11 November <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> provide as much light as depicted in the image.|$|E
5|$|Around 1498, Josquin {{most likely}} re-entered {{the service of}} the Sforza family, on the {{evidence}} of a pair of letters between the Gonzaga and Sforza families. He <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> stay in Milan long, for in 1499 Louis XII captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin most likely returned to France, although documented details of his career {{around the turn of the}} 16th century are lacking. Prior to departing Italy he most likely wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola El grillo (the Cricket), as well as In te Domine speravi ("I have placed my hope in you, Lord"), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was the Dominican friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{expanded}} westward in {{the early}} 19th century, government officials sought to buy as much Native American land as possible. In 1804, territorial governor William Henry Harrison negotiated a treaty in St. Louis in which a group of Sauk and Meskwaki leaders supposedly sold their lands east of the Mississippi for more than $2,200, in goods and annual payments of $1,000 in goods. The treaty became controversial because the Native leaders had not been authorized by their tribal councils to cede lands. Historian Robert Owens argued that the chiefs <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> intend to give up ownership of the land, {{and that they would}} not have sold so much valuable territory for such a modest price. Historian Patrick Jung concluded that the Sauk and Meskwaki chiefs intended to cede a little land, but that the Americans included more territory in the treaty's language than the Natives realized. According to Jung, the Sauks and Meskwakis did not learn the true extent of the cession until years later.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{viewed the}} {{partially}} finished results at Kenilworth in 1572, but the complete effect of Leicester's work was only apparent during the queen's last visit in 1575. Leicester was keen to impress Elizabeth {{in a final}} attempt to convince her to marry him, and no expense was spared. Elizabeth brought an entourage of thirty-one barons and four hundred staff for the royal visit that lasted an exceptional nineteen days; twenty horsemen a day arrived at the castle to communicate royal messages. Leicester entertained the Queen {{and much of the}} neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. The cost was reputed to have amounted to many thousand pounds, almost bankrupting Leicester, though it <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> exceed £1,700 in reality. The event was considered a huge success and formed the longest stay at such a property during any of Elizabeth's tours, yet the queen did not decide to marry Leicester.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the free}} peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non-free serfs. Whether this change was due entirely to the conquest is unclear, but the {{invasion}} and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by {{the coming of the}} Normans to England. The lifestyle of the peasantry <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> greatly change in the decades after 1066. Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued {{to have the ability to}} dispose of their property as they wished.|$|E
5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.|$|E

5|$|Spruyt {{was the son}} of Jacobus Spuyt (1796–1839), a Dutch medical doctor, and Antje Landskroon. Both the Spruyt and Landskroon {{families}} {{stood in}} a tradition of medical practice, and three of the four brothers Spruyt had were doctors in the Netherlands. Spruyt himself trained as a lawyer at Leiden University, but <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> finish his studies. He went on to work as a schoolteacher in the village of Oosterwolde in the north of the Netherlands. It was here that professor U.G. Lauts recruited him for South Africa in 1851. Lauts was {{one of a group of}} Dutchmen, interested in the development of good education in the new Boer settlements in South Africa. As such, Spruyt was one of the many Dutch immigrants that settled in the new Boer republics around the middle of the nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu was the {{smallest}} of all emus, and had darker plumage than the mainland emu. It was black and brown, and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus) {{in a number of}} osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs and a broad tail. Some aspects of the vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, or sitting, posture. The animal may also have been capable of climbing, perhaps {{in a manner similar to}} gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but may also have eaten other soft food, and because of its small size <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E
50|$|Age to Maturity: Bulmer's {{fruit bat}} is not sexually active by the {{beginning}} of its second year and <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> breed until its third year.|$|R
