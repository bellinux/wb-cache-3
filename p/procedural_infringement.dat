40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to present current {{judicial}} practice, concerning hearing cases stemming from appeals of Polish Competition Authority decisions. The relevant court tends to review the cases only on merits, omitting to address procedural infringements, clearly stated by the parties in appeals. In author’s opinion this common practice does not have a legal leg to stand on. Author analyses relevant laws and precedents pointing out, that full review of the decision is Court’s duty, which could not be neglected. Furthermore, according to ECHR rulings procedural guaranties should be assured on high level, especially in matters, where quasi-criminal fines are concerned. As a legal practitioner Author perceives possible crippling effect on effectiveness, assuming that the Court would have to review all steps of the proceedings before Competition Authority. So in conclusion Author proposes a compromise solution asserting, that the Court should at least address all <b>procedural</b> <b>infringement</b> counts stated in appeal. Michał Mija...|$|E
50|$|Ten {{days after}} the close, the Presidium of the Supreme Court revived the prosecution, ruling that <b>procedural</b> <b>infringements</b> {{regarding}} the amnesty had occurred. The Presidium arranged a new hearing and assigned a new judge, Viktor Aleksandrovich Yaskin. He conducted the case review using revised court procedures. Yaskin offered the defendants amnesty, and all but Varennikov accepted it. Varennikov was acquitted on the argument that he was following the orders of Minister of Defense.|$|R
500|$|Bolivia's National Electoral Court (Corte Nacional Electoral – CNE) {{refused to}} {{recognize}} the ASP, citing minor <b>procedural</b> <b>infringements.</b> The coca activists circumvented this problem by running {{under the banner of}} the United Left (IU), a coalition of leftist parties headed by the Communist Party of Bolivia (Partido Comunista Boliviano – PCB). They won landslide victories in those areas which were local strongholds of the movement, producing 11 mayors and 49 municipal councilors. Morales was elected to the National Congress as a representative for El Chapare, having secured 70.1% of the local vote. In the national elections of 1997, the IU/ASP gained four seats in Congress, obtaining 3.7% of the national vote, with this rising to 17.5% in the department of Cochabamba. The election resulted in the establishment of a coalition government led by the right-wing Nationalist Democratic Action (Acción Democrática Nacionalista – ADN), with Hugo Banzer as President; Morales lambasted him as [...] "the worst politician in Bolivian history".|$|R

There {{are a lot}} {{of discussions}} about the {{practical}} problems of criminal procedure, imperfection of the rules of the Criminal Procedure Code (later in the text – Code) and so on. However, almost nobody talks about the consequences which resulted from the violation of the procedure, set in the Code. When the criminal procedure ends, pre-trial investigators, prosecutors and judges usually don’t care about the consequences of the proceedings which were announced by the court as violating the Code. Usually officers associate such violations only with their own disciplinary responsibility. But the disciplinary responsibility of the officer who was performing such actions is not the only consequence of the proceedings done when violating the Code. Based on the systemic analysis of the procedural and other legal acts, authors distinguish four main groups of the consequences of the proceedings, done when violating the Code: 1) criminal or disciplinary responsibility of the officer; 2) data, collected in the pre-trial investigation and not admitted as evidence; 3) consequences, which eliminate unlawfully collected evidences, from the further criminal procedure; 4) duty of the state to compensate the damage to the person, who suffered from the actions, announced by the court as unlawful in the proceedings. In this article, authors note that investigators and other officers usually are not informed about the court’s decisions, which are related with the concrete breaches of the Code. Such situation doesn’t allow to improve officers’ qualification, and also allows to reiterate the same <b>procedural</b> <b>infringements</b> in the future. The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania obliges the legislator to establish legal regulation, which will guarantee compensation for the person who suffered harm in the proceedings, done when violating the Code. Performing that duty, the legislator established rules which are regulating the compensation of the mentioned harm. But the problem is that such rules are set in the three different legal acts. It can be noticed that not all of these acts are directly concerned with the criminal procedure. According to these legal acts, a person acquires the right to require the compensation only if she/he experienced the harm by the illegal temporary detention, arrest, other procedural coercive measures, or by the illegal conviction. But, according to these rules of law, the person has no right to require compensation if she/he suffered harm from the criminal procedure which lasted too long or other, not mentioned, proceedings which violated the Code. Analysis of the court‘s cases, done in this article, allows to state that such legal regulation is contrary to the international treaties and general principles of the law. For that reason authors suggest to consider a possibility to change such existing legal regulation by removing an exhaustive list of <b>procedural</b> <b>infringements</b> from the law and by providing to the person a right to require compensation in all cases if the damage to her/him was done when violating the Code...|$|R
