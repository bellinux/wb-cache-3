25|$|In {{addition}} to antibaryons, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created.

In 1965, a group of researchers led by Antonino Zichichi reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the <b>Proton</b> <b>Synchrotron</b> at CERN.

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the W and Z bosons themselves {{had to wait for}} the construction of a particle accelerator powerful enough to produce them. The first such machine that became available was the Super <b>Proton</b> <b>Synchrotron,</b> where unambiguous signals of W bosons were seen in January 1983 during a series of experiments made possible by Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. The actual experiments were called UA1 (led by Rubbia) and UA2 (led by Pierre Darriulat), and were the collaborative effort of many people. Van der Meer was the driving force on the accelerator end (stochastic cooling). UA1 and UA2 found the Z boson a few months later, in May 1983. Rubbia and van der Meer were promptly awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics, a most unusual step for the conservative Nobel Foundation.|$|E

40|$|A thin {{metallic}} beam pipe {{reinforced by}} multi-layer spiral metallic ribs is proposed for rapid cycling <b>proton</b> <b>synchrotrons.</b> The pipe {{is made of}} Inconel 718 with thickness of a few tenths of mm. Each spiral rib has {{a cross section of}} about 0. 3 mm{sup 2 } and can be bonded to the pipe by using laser deposition technique (e. g., precision metal deposition, or PMD). Compared with other designs (e. g., ceramic beam pipe with a metallic cage used in the ISIS at the RAL), this new pipe will reduce the magnet aperture significantly, which, in turn, reduces the construction and operating cost of a synchrotron. Numerical simulations and analytical modeling are used to investigate the structural strength and deformation, and the eddy current effects, including heating, magnetic field distortion and the electro-magnetic force on the beam pipe. The results show that this new beam pipe will work. It can be employed to high intensity rapid cycling <b>proton</b> <b>synchrotrons,</b> such as the proton driver at FERMILAB and the JHF at JAERI/KEK. Effort to build a prototype is under way...|$|R
