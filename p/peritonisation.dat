30|$|The {{occlusion}} {{syndrome is}} a complication generally reported with a frequency of 1.5 – 3 % {{depending on the}} series [11, 12, 30, 32]. Any abdominal operation runs this risk, and the existence in addition of a deep pelvic fossa crossed in the anterio-posterior direction by prosthetic material increases this risk. The occurrence of occlusion is connected in {{the great majority of}} cases with a defect in <b>peritonisation.</b> To help avoid this complication certain authors, such as Cosson et al. [20] and Lefranc and Blondon [10], recommend sub-total or even total hysterectomy in order to make <b>peritonisation</b> easier, for this is recognised as being difficult when the uterus remains in place [33, 34]. In our series, all the occlusion problems occurred in patients who had a prior history of hysterectomy, which thus contradicts this theory. We observed no case of spondylodiscitis in our study, despite the vaginal, bladder and rectal injuries. The same is true for the other laparoscopy series [35, 36]. The other complications reported in the literature for laparotomy are parietal sepsis and pulmonary embolism, which have not been mentioned with the laparoscopic route.|$|E
30|$|Laparoscopy {{revealed}} thin vaginal mucosa {{in spite}} of intense topical oestrogen therapy. The bladder and rectum were reflected from the vagina. A Y-shaped type 1 light weight polypropylene mesh was placed over and sutured to {{the upper half of}} anterior vaginal wall and two thirds of posterior wall of the vagina with interrupted polydioxanone sutures. Great care was taken to keep the mesh lying flat over vaginal mucosa to minimise erosion. The vault was suspended from the sacral promontory by the tail of the Y-mesh using Protak fasteners [1], and complete mesh <b>peritonisation</b> was performed with poliglecaprone. Continuous topical oestrogen therapy was re-commenced 2  weeks postoperatively.|$|E
30|$|The presacral {{space is}} then entered as the sigmoid colon is {{reflected}} towards the left pelvic sidewall. The sacral promontory is palpated with the laparoscopic grasping forceps, and the presacral vessels are identified. The peritoneum overlying the sacral promontory is then incised longitudinally. This {{is done with}} great care to avoid the bifurcation of the aorta above, the common iliac vessels and ureters laterally, and the mesentery of the sigmoid colon to the left. A laparoscopic dissector is used to expose the anterior longitudinal ligament of the sacrum. The surgeon then staples the synthetic mesh with titanium spirals, having checked vaginally the right tension of the mesh (Fig.  1). Using tacks is our usual practice because it decreases operating time significantly. Care is taken to avoid excessive tension, but the mesh must be tight enough to provide adequate support when the patient is standing. We do not bury the mesh. There is no evidence in the literature that <b>peritonisation</b> has any advantages.|$|E
30|$|Surgical technique: until June 1998 all {{procedures}} were performed using a Pfannenstiel incision. In {{the second half}} of the study all cases were performed by laparoscopy. In laparotomy the bowel was packed off, the vagina was elevated with a pelotte, and the peritoneal surface was resected from the vaginal apex. The laparoscopy was performed through four ports (two 5  mm, two 10  mm). In both approaches the graft was sutured to the posterior, sometimes to the anterior, site of the vault, using polydioxanone sutures (PDS) in laparotomy and Ethibond sutures (Johnson&Johnson, Ethicon, Cincinnati, USA) in laparoscopy. In laparotomy the graft was attached to the promontory by polydioxanone sutures, in laparoscopy by hernia staples (Johnson&Johnson, Endosurgery, Cincinnati, USA) without undue tension. In cases of urodynamically confirmed stress incontinence, the sacral colpopexy was combined with a colposuspension according to Burch, by laparotomy or by a laparoscopic approach. If a rectocele was present, a posterior colporrhaphy was performed. <b>Peritonisation</b> of the graft was not performed, and the pouch of Douglas was not closed on a routine basis. All {{procedures were}} performed by one of the authors (HB).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Vaginal {{hysterectomy}} with concomitant vaginal wall repair for POP is a routinely performed operation. Despite many {{variations in}} technique {{to stabilize the}} vaginal vault there is no standard procedure described for Level-I-fixation. Objective: We analyzed our single-center standardized technique in its functional, anatomical and subjective outcome to provide data to discuss and improve the standard operation procedure. Methods: We examined patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy for symptomatic POP ≥ III° with consecutive anterior vaginal wall repair. Vaginal vault fixation was performed in all patients involving high <b>peritonisation</b> including tightening and fixation of Ligg. sacrouterina and rotunda into the vaginal vault. Other concomitant operations were exclusion criteria. Follow-up examination involved anatomical (gynecologic examination using POP-Q scale, introital ultrasound), functional and subjective results (Likert-scale for patient satisfaction, validated German Pelvic Floor Questionnaire). In the descriptive analysis, number and percent or mean, median and interquartile range were calculated. Differences between groups were tested by Chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: 70 patients (mean 69 years, BMI 26. 3, TVL 9 cm) with preoperative descensus uteri and cystocele ≥ III° were invited to follow-up 3 years (mean) after operation. Anatomical results: C: 0 ° n= 55 (78, 6 %), I° n= 15 (21, 4 %). Anterior vaginal wall: 0 /I°: n= 35 (50 %), II°: n= 34 (48, 6 %), III°: n= 1 (1, 4 %). De-novo Rectocele ≥ II° occurred in n= 11 (15, 7 %), {{two of them were}} symptomatic and required surgical treatment. Postvoidal residual (> 100 ml) declined to n= 2 patients (preoperative: n= 21). Urgency: n= 14 (20, 0 %), SUI n= 10 (14, 3 %). We did not find a correlation between avulsion of M. Levator ani and rate of recurrence in sonographical finding. In multivariable analysis, cystocele ≥ II° was significantly associated with BMI > 25 (p= 0, 017). 87 % stated improvement in quality of life after surgery, there was no correlation of anatomical recurrence and subjective signs and symptoms of prolapse. Conclusions: We present an efficient surgical procedure with good anatomical, functional and subjective results without the usage of permanent sutures to stabilize Level I highlighting the lack of benefit of routinely performed additional sacrospinous ligament fixation (Amreich-Richter-operation). Although recurrent cystocele are of less functional impairment and lower grade than before operation, there remains the necessity of improving the surgical approach of anterior vaginal wall reconstruction. The small number of postoperative rectoceles does not justify a prophylactic surgical intervention...|$|E
