The Mayor is elected by the city council, and presides over council meetings and served as the Chief Elected Official for the city. The city council consists of five members that serve staggered, four-year terms. A city manager is hired by the city council, and is comparable to a corporation's chief executive officer. This person is usually a professionally trained <b>public</b> <b>administrator,</b> who is charged with implementing the policies and directives of the city council, and has broad administrative authority with strict rules prohibiting political interference in administrative matters.|$|E

5000|$|John Rohr, in {{defining}} bureaucrats as <b>public</b> <b>administrators,</b> approaches ethic standards in {{government as a}} requirement {{due to the nature}} of the work of administrators. He writes, “because bureaucrats govern through authority that is discretionary, and because they are not elected, the ordinary means of popular control are inapplicable”. [...] Rohr assumes that <b>public</b> <b>administrators</b> are working to benefit the general public’s needs. When an elected official does not act in line with the public’s expectations, they can be removed from office. However, <b>public</b> <b>administrators</b> are protected with due process rights as government employees, and ethical violations can be difficult to justify the removal of a person from an office.|$|R

Doubts about the professional status of public administration seem to rely on one or another sociological definition having little to recommend it outside sociology.

25|$|When <b>public</b> <b>administrators</b> perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they are {{on the front lines of}} the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker <b>public</b> <b>administrators</b> use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>administrators</b> are {{the people}} who not only {{administer}} public services, but who are also expected to carry out reform and to embed 'new ways of doing things' in the machinery and mentality of public sector organisations. Yet, research has shown that, in pursuing change initiatives, due attention is rarely paid to how <b>public</b> <b>administrators</b> feel, think and make meaning. As a direct consequence, public administrative reforms frequently disappoint by failing to generate the promised positive results. Hence, this thesis explores the nebulous phenomenon of subjective meaning-making in the context of Abu Dhabi Government's customercentric reform. This is accomplished in two practical steps: Firstly, the study employs Q Methodology to identify five viewpoints that different groups of <b>public</b> <b>administrators</b> share: (1) The benefactor's epic fail, (2) Managerialism in modern Arabiya, (3) Triumph of the cherished patriarch, (4) The traditional ways of the Bedouins, and (5) The reign of formulas over culture. In the second step, a Cultural Reference Group drills down into each shared viewpoint to reveal group-specific knowledge structures, or collective schemata. The study discovers that content schemata and context schemata interact with situational influencers in producing shared viewpoints, and a socio-cognitive model is proposed to illuminate these processes. The findings contribute {{to an understanding of the}} subjective constructions that <b>public</b> <b>administrators</b> share at group-level, and how these impact ou the opportunities for meaningful reform...|$|R

6000|$|We need waste {{little time}} nowadays, I submit, in {{disposing}} of Encyclopaedic conceptions of College Education, conceptions that {{played a part}} in almost all educational schemes--Bentham's stupendous Chrestomathia is the fearful example--before the middle nineteenth century. We are all agreed in theory, at any rate, that to know one subject or group of subjects exhaustively is far better than a universal smattering, that the ideal of education is more particularly [...] "all about something" [...] with [...] "something about everything" [...] in a very subordinate place. The fact remains that the normal curriculum of our higher schools and colleges is a pointless non-educational miscellany, and the average graduate in Arts knows something, but not enough, of science, mathematics, Latin, Greek, literature, and history; he has paid tribute to several conflicting schemes of education, and is a credit to none. We {{have to get rid of}} this state of affairs, and we have to provide (i) a substantial mental training which shall lead at last to a broad and comprehensive view of things, and which shall be a training in generalization, abstraction, and the examination of evidence, stimulating and disciplining the imagination and developing the habit of patient, sustained, enterprising and thorough work, and (ii) we have to add a general culture, a circle of ideas about moral, aesthetic, and social matters that shall form a common basis for the social and intellectual life of the community. The former of these two elements must at some stage develop--after two or five or seven or some such period of years, which may be different in different cases--into the special training for the definite function of the individual in the social body, whether as engineer, business manager, doctor, priest, journalist, <b>public</b> <b>administrator,</b> professional soldier, or what not.
