40|$|Background: <b>Physical</b> {{activity}} and <b>fitness</b> in adolescence may improve cognition in adulthood by increasing insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Methods: As {{part of the}} Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study, following subjects from age 13 to 42 years, <b>physical</b> {{activity and}} <b>fitness</b> of 303 subjects were assessed annually between the ages 13 to 16. At mean age 36, <b>physical</b> activity, <b>fitness</b> and IGF-I were measured. At mean age 42, IGF-I and cognitive factors (ie, executive functioning and visual-spatial memory) were measured. The linear regression of <b>physical</b> activity and <b>fitness</b> in adolescence and IGF-I in adulthood on cognitive scores in adulthood was investigated. Results: A significant association was found in males between physical activity in adolescence and executive function in adulthood (Spatial Working Memory Between Errors: Î² = -. 18, B = -. 13, 95 % CI = -. 259 to -. 010; Spatial Working Memory Strategy: Î² = -. 20, B = -. 08, 95 % CI = -. 147 to -. 014). No association between <b>physical</b> activity or <b>fitness</b> in adolescence and cognitive function in adulthood was found in females, nor any intermediate role for IGF-I in either sex. Conclusions: The results suggest a stimulating effect of adolescent physical activity in males on executive functions in adulthood, emphasizing the importance of an active lifestyle among adolescent males.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{determine}} whether the provision of higher levels of compulsory school physical activity is associated with higher <b>physical</b> activity and <b>fitness</b> levels and less overweight in childhood and 20 years later. Methods As part of the 1985 Australian Schools Health and Fitness Survey, 109 schools reported how much compulsory physical education (PE) and school sport they provided and were classified as low (2) cutpoints. 9, 12 and 15 year-olds (n = 2, 595) completed a cycle ergometer <b>fitness</b> test (<b>physical</b> working capacity at heart rate 170, PWC 170). At follow-up in 2004 – 5, 2, 346 participants kept a pedometer record, completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and/or a PWC 170 fitness test; and had height and weight measured (overweight = BMI≥ 25 m/kg 2). Results At baseline and follow-up, median total <b>physical</b> activity, <b>fitness</b> and BMI were similar in participants who attended low, medium and high physical activity schools, and those attending high physical activity schools reported only modestly higher school physical activity. There {{was no difference in}} the prevalence of high total <b>physical</b> activity and <b>fitness</b> levels in childhood or adulthood across compulsory school physical activity categories. The prevalence of overweight in childhood and adulthood was similar across low, medium and high compulsory physical activity schools. Conclusion The amount of compulsory physical activity reported by schools was not associated with total <b>physical</b> activity, <b>fitness</b> or overweight in childhood or in adulthood. Policies promoting amounts of compulsory school physical activity in this range may not be sufficient to increase <b>physical</b> activity and <b>fitness</b> or reduce the prevalence of obesity in children. </p...|$|R
