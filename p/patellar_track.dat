40|$|Background: Patellofemoral pain {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the most common knee problems and may be related to abnormal <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking.</b> Our purpose was to compare, in vivo and noninvasively, the <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> patterns in symptomatic patients with patellofemoral pain and those in healthy subjects during squatting. We tested the hypothesis that patients with patellofemoral pain exhibit characteristic patterns of <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> that are different from those of healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|Knee pain is {{a common}} {{presenting}} complaint by athletes and the general population. Disorders of the patellofemoral joint are {{responsible for most of}} these disorders. Abnormal <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> is thought to be the principal cause. <b>Patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> is influenced by a number of dynamic and static factors. These can be assessed with a careful history and physical examination. A treatment program can be designed to alter the precipitating factors. Lower-extremity malalignment, principally hyperpronation of the foot, is believed to be a major cause of abnormal <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking.</b> Conservative treatment programs have had successful results, and less emphasis is now being placed on surgical procedures...|$|R
40|$|Medial {{transfer}} of the tibial tubercle is commonly implemented to correct patellar alignment in patients with patellar instability. However, the extent of transfer needed is difficult to determine. This article reports a pilot-study experience with a novel technique employing intraoperative femoral nerve stimulation to better determine the distance of tubercle transfer required for proper <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking.</b> this pilot study is a case series involving seven knees, all with a clinical history of dislocation, evidence of maltracking, and excessive medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) laxity {{to the point of}} producing a positive apprehension sign. All seven knees received femoral nerve stimulation for <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> assessment as part of a modified Fulkerson osteotomy. All knees received clinical follow-up for a minimum of 24 months. six of the seven cases in this series remained stable during two years of follow-up. through these findings we conclude that the use of femoral nerve stimulation for <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> assessment may be associated with a sufficiently high rate of success to warrant more extensive investigation...|$|R
30|$|The {{tourniquet}} was deflated and hemostasis {{was performed}} before the graft was fixed. We {{believe that an}} inflated tourniquet can affect <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> due to its binding effect on the extensor mechanism.|$|R
40|$|A hardware-assisted intensity-based {{registration}} method {{developed for}} assessing <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> was discussed. It was also proposed to generate digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) {{in real time}} without any precomputation for 2 D/ 3 D registration. The CT slices were first transferred to the texture memory of the video card and a particular pose was rendered by setting the camera geometry according to the information from fluoroscope calibation, to generate a DRR. The results shows that hardware generation of DRRs did not need precomputation and was 25 times faster than software computation. The main advantage of the method was that it allowed the assessment of <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> to be done using commonly available graphics hardware...|$|R
30|$|Prior {{studies have}} {{explored}} {{the effect of}} altering VMO tension on <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> (Goh et al. 1995), however {{the role of the}} quadriceps in providing mechanical stability to the patella (patellar resistance to lateral displacement) has not previously been closely examined. Such an investigation would help support the role of quadriceps rehabilitation programmes and conservative management for patients post patellar dislocation. Prior cadaveric work examining the effect of altered VMO loading has also not examined contact mechanics and joint kinematics simultaneously, through full range of knee flexion (Goh et al. 1995; Elias et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2002; Wünschel et al. 2011). It is widely hypothesised that abnormal <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> causes increased contact stresses and subsequent cartilage wear, and having contact pressure data alongside tracking data would help support or negate this theory (Dye et al. 1998). Furthermore, no work has so far examined the effect of deactivation of the VMM (the VMO plus the vastus medialis longus – VML) which may occur during traumatic patellar dislocation when the fibres are torn. Based on prior research examining VMO weakness and current knowledge we hypothesised that deactivation of the VMM would result in increased lateral <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking,</b> increased lateral cartilage contact pressure and reduced patellar stability.|$|R
40|$|High tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) {{can cause}} alterations in patellar height, {{depending on the}} surgical technique, the amount of correction and the postoperative management. Alterations in patella location after HTO may lead to postoperative complications. However, information on changes in dynamic patellar kinematics following HTO is very limited. We conducted a biomechanical study, to analyze the effect of open (OWO) and closed wedge osteotomy (CWO) on <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking.</b> Using an inventive experimental set-up, we studied the 3 D dynamic <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> in ten cadaver knees before and after valgus HTO. In each specimen, corrections of 7 degrees and 15 degrees of valgus according to, both, the OWO and CWO technique, were performed. Patellar height significantly increased with CWO and decreased with OWO. Both, OWO and CWO led to {{significant changes in the}} <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> parameters tilt and rotation. We also found significant differences between OWO and CWO. Valgus high tibial osteotomy increased the medial patellar tilt and reduced the medial patellar rotation. These effects were more profound after OWO. No significant differences were found for the effect on medial-lateral patellar translation. These observations can be taken into consideration in the decision whether to perform an OWO or a CWO in a patient with medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee...|$|R
30|$|In {{literature}} {{there are}} few reports about the treatment of failed patellofemoral arthroplasty. Sisto et al. [53] in 1997 reported good results using a total knee arthroplasty. The recent development of minimally invasive surgical techniques may ultimately offer reduced morbidity when a patellofemoral prosthesis is implanted, but the need to access both the trochlear and the retropatellar surfaces without the ability to “decompress” the extensor mechanism by resection of distal, femoral, and proximal tibia bone leaves little cope for significant developments in minimally invasive access. Computer assisted alignment systems are now available even for these implants to address both the implant alignment and the <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> in all the range of motion helping the surgeon in a guided soft tissue release to improve <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> and tilting [54].|$|R
40|$|Permanent patellar {{dislocation}} with tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis is {{a relatively}} rare condition. To treat this condition, total knee arthroplasty with proximal or distal realignment of the extensor mechanism has been reported. We report a challenging case of an 80 -year-old woman diagnosed with permanent patellar dislocation with tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis treated by a mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty utilizing navigation system. Lateral retinaculum release was performed to improve patellar tracking; other proximal or distal realignment of the extensor mechanism was not necessary. Postoperative radiographs show stable <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> and recurrent <b>patellar</b> dislocation was not observed. This clinical case indicates that the implant’s precise alignment and rotation during total knee arthroplasty could settle anatomical abnormalities of permanent patellar dislocation and the mobile bearing insert could contribute to stabilizing <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking...</b>|$|R
40|$|Optimal <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> and {{component}} alignment {{are important in}} achieving a well-functioning total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The patella is constrained partly by design of the prosthetic trochlear groove, and <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> is governed {{by a combination of}} static and dynamic factors. Maltracking may result from excessive or unbalanced tension in the surrounding soft tissues. This article describes a staged progressive lateral release of the patellar retinaculum in TKA, which is classified into 6 stages. Stage 1 transects the deep lateral patellofemoral ligament; stages 2 to 6 extend the lateral patellar incision distally from vastus lateralis to the tibial tubercle. This technique was used in a series of 96 primary TKAs. We report the rates of the various stages of lateral release and the variables that might affect the decision to perform such a release...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of femoral component positioning on <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> is critical. The various possibilities of modifying {{the position of}} the femoral component relative to the distal femoral epiphysis are analyzed, and the ideal positioning in the medio-lateral, antero-posterior, and proximal-distal directions is described. Special emphasis is placed on the rotational positioning of the femoral component...|$|R
30|$|Vastus Medialis Muscles (VMM) {{damage has}} been widely {{identified}} following patellar dislocation. Rehabilitation programmes have been suggested to strengthen the VMM and reduce clinical symptoms of pain and instability. This controlled laboratory study investigated the hypothesis that reduced Vastus Medialis Obliquus (VMO) and Vastus Medialis Longus (VML) muscle tension would alter <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking,</b> stability and PFJ contact pressures.|$|R
30|$|In {{previous}} studies, various {{surgical procedures}} {{have been proposed}} to reduce PF contact pressures and improve <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking.</b> Hauser [15] and Maquet [16] et al. performed straight anteriorization of the tibial tubercle to reduce PFJ pressure. The Hauser procedure resulted in late severe osteoarthritis and yielded less favorable results [17]. Accordingly, this procedure is not frequently used today.|$|R
40|$|Abnormal <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> {{results in}} patello-femoral (PF) joint {{disorders}} and frequently in failure of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It {{is fundamental to}} assess this tracking intra-operatively, i. e. since the implantation of the femoral and tibial components. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the feasibility of three-dimensional anatomical-based <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> intra-operatively in standard TKA. A surgical navigation system was utilized to test the new technique in-vitro. An original tracking device and a reference frame were designed and an articular convention for the description of PF joint kinematics was adopted. Six fresh-frozen amputated legs were analyzed with the new technique. Landmark digitations were used to define anatomical reference frames for the femur, tibia, and patella. Five trials of passive flexion were performed with 100 N force on the quadriceps, before and after standard knee arthroplasty. Patellar flexion, tilt, rotation and shift were calculated in addition to standard tibio-femoral (TF) joint kinematics. An intra-specimen repeatable path of motion over repetitions and a coupled path of motion throughout the flexion-extension cycle were observed in all intact knees, both at the TF and PF joints. Replication of the original PF motion in the intact knee was not fully accomplished in the replaced knee. These results revealed the feasibility and the necessity of <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> during TKA. By monitoring intra-operatively also the PF kinematics, the surgeon has a more complete prediction of the performance of the final implant and therefore a valuable support for the most critical surgical decisions...|$|R

40|$|The patella, with {{or without}} resurfacing, plays a {{fundamental}} role in the success of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patellofemoral joint complications are due to problems related to the patient, to the surgical technique, or to the design of the components. <b>Patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> is influenced by several factors: a severe preoperative valgus, the presence of pre-existing patellofemoral dysplasia, the design of the femoral component, the surgical approach, the Q angle, the mechanical alignment of the limb, the tightness of the lateral retinaculum, the positioning of the patellar component in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions, the patella height, the patella (native or resurfaced) thickness, the size of the femoral and the tibial components, and the alignment and rotation of the components. Several factors are crucial to prevent patellar maltracking in TKA: the use of an anatomical femoral component, a meticulous surgical technique, careful dynamic intraoperative assessment of <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking,</b> and, if necessary, the achievement of an adequate lateral release...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the biomechanics of the patellar component following total knee replacement. More specifically we investigated the effect of displacing the femoral component of an Insall-Burstein II total knee replacement on the <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> and patello-femoral contact pressures. DESIGN: We used a validated computer simulation of the knee joint to virtually insert the femoral component with the following four types of placements: (1) no misplacement, (2) 5 degrees of internal rotation, (3) 5 degrees of external rotation and (4) 5 degrees of flexion rotation. The <b>patellar</b> 3 D <b>tracking</b> and patello-femoral contact pressures were computed for each femoral component placement as a function of knee flexion angle. BACKGROUND: Complications at the patello-femoral joint are the among most frequent following total knee replacement. RESULTS: Femoral component placement unevenly affected the associated patellar tracking: a 5 degrees internal rotation tilted and rotated the patella laterally by about 5 degrees throughout knee flexion. A 5 degrees external rotation of the femoral component had less effect on <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking.</b> A rotation of 5 degrees in flexion primarily caused patellar rotation (5 - 10 degrees lateral rotation). Femoral component malalignment had only minor effects on the peak pressure distributions at the patello-femoral interface. CONCLUSION:These results suggest that femoral component positioning primarily affects <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking,</b> with a possible threat for patellar subluxation under external rotation of the femoral component. RELEVANCE: Precise alignment of the prosthetic components is difficult to control during total knee replacement due to the lack of precise anatomical landmarks in the human knee joint. Consequently, the position of each prosthetic component may differ from the ideal one suggested by the manufacturer. Improper alignment of the prosthetic components during total knee replacement may lead to premature implant failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the medial patellar ligamentous structures on <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> has rarely been studied. Thus {{the main purpose of}} this cadaveric biomechanical {{study was to determine the}} {{influence of}} the medial patellofemoral (MPFL), medial patellomeniscal (MPML) and medial patellotibial (MPTL) ligaments on the three-dimensional <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> during knee flexion. This study was conducted using a validated cadaveric optoelectronic protocol for analysis of patellar kinematics. Methods For each cadaveric knee study, four successive acquisitions were performed; first was studied <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> in healthy knees, then the junction between MPFL and vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) was sectioned, the MPFL was released at its patellar attachment and finally was released the insertion of the MPML and MPTL. Results In this study, the MPFL accounts for 50 - 60 % of the medial stabilization forces of the lateral patellar shift during patellar engagement in the femoral trochlea. This work confirm and clarify the role of the MPFL as the primary stabilizer of the patella during the initial 30 ° of knee flexion. Moreover, this study shows no significant results regarding the stabilizing action of the VMO on the patella during knee flexion. Conclusion This in vitro study, conducted with an experimental protocol previously validated in the literature, helps quantify the actions of the MPFL, the VMO, and the MPML/MPTL respectively, and identify areas of joint motion where these structures have the most significant influence. This confirms the importance of reconstruction in the treatment of chronic patellar instability. During its reconstruction, care should be taken to adjust the MPFL balance during the initial 20 °- 30 ° of flexion...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A medialization of the femoral {{component}} {{in a total}} knee arthroplasty (TKA) causes abnormal <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking,</b> which could result in patellar instability, pain, wear, and failure. Previous reports defined medialization {{in relation to the}} neutral position of the femoral component, but omitted to compare it to the anatomical position of the trochlea. We assessed intraoperatively whether there is a systematic error of the position of the prosthetic groove relative to the anatomical trochlea. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A special instrument was developed to measure consecutively the mediolateral position of the anatomical trochlea and the mediolateral position of the prosthetic groove. 3 experienced knee surgeons determined the mediolateral error of the prosthetic groove in primary TKAs in 61 patients. RESULTS: There was a significant medial error of the prosthetic groove relative to the preoperative position of the trochlea, with a mean medial error of 2. 5 mm (SD 3. 3) INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that the trochlea is medialized by TKA. Because a conscious medialization of the femoral {{component in}} a TKA produces abnormal <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> patterns, further investigations will be needed to analyze the clinical consequences of this medialization of the trochlea...|$|R

30|$|Mont et al. [20] {{reported}} on TKA in 30 older patients (more than 55  years of age) with severe PFJ-OA followed up to a mean 81  months. Particularly {{in the case}} of PFJ-OA, they noted {{that it is important to}} be aware of the potential for exaggerated thinning of the patella lateral facet; adequate under-resection of this facet and component placement in the medial border of the patella may be required to maintain bone stock and adequate <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking.</b> Thus, there is an increased risk of impaired knee function because of technical failure.|$|R
40|$|A good {{outcome in}} total knee {{arthroplasty}} depends on many factors: joint alignment, range of motion, <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking</b> and ligament stability. A correct soft tissue balance keeps the joint aligned in flexion and extension, and therefore constitutes {{the most important}} factor for durability of the implant. Indeed, incorrect soft tissue balancing is the primary cause of early implant failure necessitating revision surgery. Soft tissue releases, serving to correct imbalances, are performed until the flexion and extension gaps appear symmetrical and balanced. A knee is considered perfectly balanced when the flexion and extension gaps are perfectly rectangular and all the measurements are absolutely equal...|$|R

30|$|Many {{surgeons}} {{have been}} intrigued by mobile-bearing (MB) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) designs {{due to the}} concept of self-alignment and the suggestion that those designs can accommodate small mismatches in the position of the femoral and tibial components. The natural question of course is whether this self-alignment translates into improved <b>patellar</b> <b>tracking,</b> thus decreasing the prevalence of lateral retinacular releases. In any medical or surgical specialty, the backbone of the literature is randomized clinical trials (RCTs). In this excellent RCT completed by Ferguson et al.

40|$|Abstract.

Each pose in the patellar motion could be obtained from a single as well as multiple calibrated fluoroscopic images. The mean error (SD) varies from 0. 73 (0. 44) to 1. 60 (0. 48) degrees for patellar orientation and from 0. 48 (0. 37) to 1. 20 (0. 57) mm for patellar translation.

The five pigs that underwent the traditional approach showed severe limping in the operative limb following the surgery for at least 72  h, and two pigs required one additional day of IV hydromorphone. Subjectively, these pigs were less interactive following surgery. Of the five pigs that underwent the MIS surgery, all five walked with minimal limp on post-operative day 1. None of the MIS surgery pigs required additional post-operative pain management and all were fully interactive by the third post-operative day.|$|R
