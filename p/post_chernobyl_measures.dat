40|$|The only unequivocal {{radiological}} {{effect of}} the Chernobyl accident on human health is the increase in thyroid cancer in those exposed in childhood or early adolescence. In response to the scientific interest in studying the molecular biology of thyroid cancer <b>post</b> <b>Chernobyl,</b> the Chernobyl Tissue Bank (CTB: www. chernobyltissuebank. com) was established in 1998. Thus far it is has collected biological samples from 3, 861 individuals, and provided 27 research projects with 11, 254 samples. The CTB was designed from its outset as a resource to promote the integration of research and clinical data to facilitate a systems biology approach to radiation related thyroid cancer. The project has therefore developed as a multidisciplinary collaboration between clinicians, dosimetrists, molecular biologists and bioinformaticians {{and serves as a}} paradigm for tissue banking in the omics era...|$|R
40|$|The {{deposition}} of 137 Cs over {{the province of}} Ska>ne (an area of about 100] 100 km 2) {{in the southern part}} of Sweden has been investigated. The origin of the {{deposition of}} 137 Cs is, in about equal parts, from nuclear weapons tests and from the Chernobyl nuclear accident and amounts to about 1 } 3 kBq/m 2. The activity concentrations of 134 Cs and 137 Cs in soil samples from 16 sites distributed in a grid pattern over the investigated area have been measured and the depositions from the nuclear weapons tests and from the Chernobyl accident have been separated. These pre- and <b>post</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> activities have been compared with depositions calculated from measurements of the activity concentrations of 134 Cs and 137 Cs in precipitation at two places and from measurements of the precipitation from a network of between 113 and 143 precipitation stations. Comparisons with in situ measurements and with aerial survey measurements have also been made. The agreement is good and it has been possible to gain a good and detailed knowledge in retrospect of the deposition from measurements of the deposition per mm of precipitation from just a few stations, and of the precipitation from a network of stations...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{due to the}} {{elapsed time}} {{and the nature of}} the Chernobyl accident, the only {{artificial}} radionuclide present in the soil is 137 Cs, with a physical half-life conversion of 30. 17 years. The 137 Cs is quickly integrated into a biological cycle, similar to potassium. Generally, radionuclides are characterized by their mobility in soil. Contamination of materials and food by radionuclides represent a serious problem and has a negative impact on human health. The threat of international terrorism and the inability to forestall the impact of natural disasters on nuclear energetic (Fukushima accident), are also reasons for continuous monitoring of food safety. According screening measurement performed in European countries, high radioactivity levels were reported in the wild boars muscles from Sumava (Czech Republic). Seasonal fluctuation of 137 Cs activity in the wild boar meat samples was observed in the forests on the southern Rhineland. Monitoring of 137 Cs activity in the wild boar meat samples in the hunting grounds in Slovakia was initiated based on the reports on exceeding limits of the content of radiocaesium in the meat of wild boar from the surrounding countries. The aim of this study was to determine the 137 Cs <b>post</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> contamination of wild boars population in different hunting districts of Slovakia during 2013 - 2014. A total of 60 thigh muscle samples from wild boars of different age categories (4 months - 2 years) were evaluated. 137 Cs activity was measured by gamma spectrometry (Canberra). Despite the fact Slovakia is closer to Chernobyl as Czech Republic and Germany, the 137 Cs activity measured was very low and far below the permitted limit. The highest radiocaesium activity level measured in muscle was 37. 2 Bq. kg - 1 ± 4. 7 %. Wild boar originated from Zlate Moravce district. The measurement results show, that 137 Cs contamination levels of game in Slovakia are low. Radiocaesium activity in examined samples was very low and therefore consumption of wild boar meat does not represent a health risk problem.  </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of the gross-beta-activity of the <b>Chernobyl</b> fallout was <b>measured</b> in {{samples from}} glaciers in Tyrol. Great regional differences were obtained. The {{comparison of the}} results of samples collected in 1986 and 1987 shows a significant immigration of the fission products into deeper layers by melt water percolation but without any significant fractionation occuring. Gammaspectra show the dominance of 137 Cs with the ratio 137 Cs/ 134 Cs of 2. 6 to 2. 9 (measurement February 1987) and 3. 7 (measurement January 1988) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} of soil after the <b>Chernobyl</b> accident was <b>measured</b> in Slovenia by different methods. Laboratory Ge-spectrometry was soon partially replaced by field GeHP-spectrometry. More detailed profile studies remained {{limited to the}} locations around Ljubljana and the nuclear installations. After the decay of other elements the {{contamination of}} 137 Cs/ 134 Cs could be studied by a portable NaI(Tl) -spectrometer. The depth profile was estimated from {{the amount of the}} scattered gamma-rays. Several improved methods of indirect or direct in-situ depth profile determination will be considered. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{fission product}} {{ruthenium}} is radiotoxic and in oxidized form as ruthenium-tetroxide (RuO 4) also chemical toxic. During fuel element change or {{in case of}} a leakage in fuel storages, air flows in the containment or fuel storage. If the circulation pump fails, the fuel elements are heated-up, and at high temperatures gaseous ruthenium oxides are formed and rapidly released from the fuel. Due to the significant higher volatility of RuO 4 in the <b>Chernobyl</b> Catastrophe the <b>measured</b> concentration of the Ru-isotopes in the fall-outs was comparable to those of iodine and caesium. In order to get more insight in the chemical and physical behaviour of this fission product under severe accident conditions, the Ruthenium release was studied in a series of Separate Effect Tests (RUSET). In the test short fuel rod segments were used and exposed to air and steam atmosphere at high temperatures. The experiments in air atmosphere showed, that the partial pressures of the released Ru-oxides was two orders of magnitudes lower compared to those measured in previous tests with Ru-powder diluted in a ZrO 2 matrix. It was found that ruthenium was not released in steam atmosphere in the examined temperature range. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the deposition was detected by XRF analysis. JRC.

40|$|CERNA WORKING PAPER SERIES 2012 - 01 This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} innovation in nuclear power reactors between 1974 and 2008 in twelve OECD countries and assesses to what extent nuclear innovation {{has been driven by}} economic incentives, political decisions and safety regulation considerations. We use priority patent applications related to Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) as a proxy for innovating activity. Our results highlight that nuclear innovation is partly driven by the conventional paradigm where both demandpull, measured by NPPs constructions in the innovating country and {{in the rest of the}} world, and technology-push, measured by Research and Development (R&D) expenditures specific to NPPs, have a positive and significant impact on innovation. Our results also evidence that the impact of public R&D expenditures and national NPPs construction on innovation is stronger when the quality of innovation, measured by forward patent citations, is taken into account, and have a long run positive impact on innovation through the stock of knowledge available to innovators. In contrast, we show that political decisions following the Three Miles Island and <b>Chernobyl</b> nuclear accidents, <b>measured</b> by NPPs cancellations, have a negative impact on nuclear innovation. Finally, we find that the nuclear safety authority has an ambivalent effect on innovation. On one hand, regulatory inspections have a positive impact on innovation, one the other hand, regulatory decisions to temporarily close a NPP have an adverse impact on innovation...|$|R
40|$|Data on {{quantification}} {{of erosion}} rates in alpine grasslands remain scarce but are urgently needed to estimate soil degradation. We determined soil-erosion rates based on (CS) -C- 137 in situ measurements. The method integrates soil erosion {{over the last}} 22 y (time after the <b>Chernobyl</b> accident). <b>Measured</b> erosion rates were compared with erosion rates modeled with the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The comparison was done {{in order to find}} out if the USLE is a useful tool for erosion prediction in steep mountainous grassland systems. Three different land-use types were investigated: hayfields, pasture with dwarf shrubs, and pasture without dwarf shrubs. Our test plots are situated in the Urseren Valley (Central Switzerland) with a mean slope steepness of 37 degrees. Mean annual soil-erosion rates determined with (CS) -C- 137 of the investigated sites ranged between the minimum of 4. 7 t ha(- 1) y(- 1) for pastures with dwarf shrubs to < 30 t ha(- 1) y(- 1) at hayfields and pastures without dwarf shrubs. The determined erosion rates are 10 to 20 times higher compared to previous measurements in alpine regions. Our measurements integrated over the last 22 y, including extreme rainfall events as well as winter processes, whereas previous studies mostly reported erosion rates based on summer time and short-term rainfall simulation experiments. These results lead to the assumption that heavy-rainfall events as well as erosion processes during winter time and early spring do have a considerable influence on the high erosion amounts that were measured. The latter can be confirmed by photographs of damaged plots after snowmelt. Erosion rates based on the LISLE are in the same order of magnitude compared to Cs- 137 -based results for the land-use type "pasture with dwarf shrubs". However, erosion amounts on hayfields and pasture without dwarf shrubs are underestimated by the LISLE compared to Cs- 137 -based erosion rates. We assume that the underestimation is due to winter processes that cause soil erosion on sites without dwarf shrubs that is not considered by the USLE. Dwarf shrubs may possibly prevent from damage of soil erosion through winter processes. The USLE is not able to perform well on the affected sites. Thus, a first attempt was done to create an alpine factor for the USLE based on the measured data...|$|R
