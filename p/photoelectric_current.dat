Our calculations found that the replacement of quinoxaline moiety in ZnQMA (having high power conversion efficiency g of 6. 3 %) with other aromatic rings decreases the HOMO-LUMO energy gap mainly due to destabilization of the HOMO level. For all of the investigated compounds, the reorganization energies of electron and hole are in the same order of magnitude as and similar to those of ZnQMA. The absorption spectra in both Soret and Q bands for most of the considered molecules exhibit red shifts to some extent with respect to that of ZnQMA. In the simulated dye-sensitized TiO 2 systems, the bidentate adsorption mode of porphyrin derivatives is computed to be energetically favored compared to the monodentate one, which well confirms the experimental results observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Excitation of the selected rotational levels was achieved by irradiating the flame with a hollow cathode bismuth-lamp emitting the 3067 · 72 Å Bi-line. From the p-values measured in three different hydrogen flames at about 1500 – 1800 °K and 1 atm pressure the specific effective cross-sections(4, 5) S of the excited radical in collision with N 2, O 2 and H 2 O molecules as quenchers could be derived with an accuracy of about 18 per cent.

From these measurements, the specific effective quenching cross section S (averaged over a Maxwellian velocity distribution) of the doublets considered for nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, hydrogen, argon, and water molecules could be derived. Remarkably, the S values for water molecules appeared to be very small compared to the values for the other diatomic and triatomic molecules. For nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and oxygen molecules, the specific effective quenching cross section appeared to be inversely proportional to the temperature in the range from 1700 ° to 2500 °K. The S values found for the diatomic molecules H 2, N 2, and O 2 show a pronounced dependence on the resonance defect ΔE (that is, the difference between the alkali excitation energy and the nearest molecular vibrational energy). Large S values are associated with small energy defects. For a given †E value, however, the unsaturated diatomic carbon monoxide molecule shows a relatively large effective cross section, compared to the other diatomic molecules mentioned. Comparison of our S values with those reported in the literature yields further information about the dependence of S on the mean relative velocity of approach for sodium atoms in collision with nitrogen molecules. The effect of radiative nonequilibrium o on the intensity of the outgoing flame radiation, as calculated in Part I of this paper for a spectral line with Lorentz broadening, was investigated by means of line-reversal temperature measurements as a function of atomic density in the flame.
