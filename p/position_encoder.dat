50|$|The disk of a {{pseudorandom}} encoder has an evenly spaced notch design just as {{an incremental}} encoder to measure distance. A second track of code is used to find the position just like an absolute encoder; however, an absolute <b>encoder</b> tells <b>position</b> from reading from multiple parallel tracks while a pseudorandom encoder uses one single track. This aspect allows pseudorandom rotary encoders to have smaller diameters and larger through-holes. To know its <b>position,</b> the <b>encoder</b> must first move a certain distance to read the code. This distance is generally small, about 1-2 degrees for rotary encoders and 1 mm for linear encoders, though this idiosyncrasy does hinder its usefulness in some applications such as track-balls since position is not immediately known when the system starts.|$|R

40|$|Error {{modeling}} and improved position estimation for optical incremental encoders {{by means of}} time stamping Roel Merry, René van de Molengraft and Maarten Steinbuch Abstract — Optical incremental encoders are extensively used for position measurements in motion systems. The number of slits on the encoder disk defines {{the resolution of the}} encoder and bounds the accuracy of the <b>position</b> measurement. The <b>encoder</b> <b>position</b> measurements suffer from quantization errors. Moreover, encoder imperfections occur due to manufacturing tolerances. In this paper a method, which is based on time stamping, is proposed to obtain more accurate position and velocity estimations. Time stamping makes use of stored events, consisting of the encoder counts and their time instants, which are captured at a high resolution clock. Low order polynomial fitting through these encoder events is combined with active compensation of the encoder errors. The proposed method is applied in real-time experiments to a motion system. The results show an improvement in the position accuracy of up to 87 % in terms of the maximum error. The estimated velocity is also much more accurate than the differentiated quantized encoder output signal. I...|$|R
