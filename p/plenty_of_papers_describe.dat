We describe just such an implementation, and quantitatively explore some of the complex design tradeoffs that make such implementations hard to build.

40|$|While {{there are}} <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> <b>describing</b> {{algorithms}} for detecting distributed {{denial of service}} (DDoS) attacks, here {{an introduction to the}} considerations preceding such an implementation is given. Therefore, a brief history of and introduction to DDoS attacks is given, showing that these kind of attacks are nearly two decades old. It is also depicted that most algorithms used for the detection of DDoS attacks are outlier detection algorithms, such that intrusion detection {{can be seen as a}} part of the KDD research field. It is then pointed out that no well known and up-to-date test cases for DDoS detection system are known. To overcome this problem in a way that allows to test algorithms as well as making results reproducible for others we advice using a simulator for DDoS attacks. The challenge of detecting denial of service attacks in real time is addressed by presenting two recently published methods that try to solve the performance problem in very different ways. We compare both approaches and finally summarise the conclusions drawn from this, especially that methods concentrating on one network traffic parameter only are not able to detect all kinds of distributed denial of service attacks...|$|R

Actually it is critical for many aspects of reservoir engineering to accurately predict the developing performance. This includes reserves estimation, disposal of produced water, and reservoir surveillance and management. For oil reservoirs developed by water injection, especially those with low permeability or with a great density of fractures, prediction of water cut is still a big challenge. Currently, there are two main approaches (numerical simulation technique, and analytical or empirical method) to predict water cut. We focus on the latter approach in this study.|$|R

However, although <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> and books claim it, few results of hardware implementations of stream ciphers are available. In this paper, we provide FPGA implementation results of recent stream ciphers in order to evaluate their actual hardware efficiency. In addition, we compare these results with those of standard block ciphers (AES, 3 DES, Rijndael, Misty 1, [...] .). The selected stream ciphers are LILI-II, Helix and SNOW 2. 0 and the implementation platform is a Virtex-II FPGA from Xilinx. On {{the basis of these}} results, it may be argued that while present stream ciphers allow us to obtain e±cient implementations, they are not overwhelm- ingly more efficient than block ciphers. In general, their efficiency is compara- ble. However, stream ciphers are made of arguably low cost primitives which could provide really compact designs if correctly combined together...|$|R
