5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decreased quality of the content and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led Apple's SuperMicro division, {{which was}} {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} Macintosh and Lisa personal computers. The Macintosh had been successful on university campuses <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apple University Consortium, which allowed students and institutions to buy the computers at a discount. The consortium had earned more than $50million on computers by February 1984.|$|E

5000|$|Interaction {{with the}} {{atmosphere}} significantly influences temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface. Calculations {{show that the}} atmosphere, despite very low pressure, can significantly diminish diurnal variations of this temperature. But there still remain temperature variations of about [...] - <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface due to sublimation of ices.|$|R
50|$|If red, blue, {{and green}} light (the {{additive}} primaries) are mixed, {{the result is}} something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> subtractive mixing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pigments is avoided, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.|$|R
5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, partly due to the prolonged success of The Winner's Journey and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
5|$|McBride's {{tenure as}} owner was viewed favorably, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Browns' on-field success {{but also because}} he gave Paul Brown a free hand to coach and sign players. One of the new {{ownership}} group's first acts was to assure Cleveland fans that Brown would retain complete control over the football side of the operation.|$|E
5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious drives. The Terrans {{frequent use of}} hallucinogens {{is seen as the}} closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious. The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason why they are able to live in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E
50|$|By the 1860s, the Grand Trunk Railway {{was about}} $72 million in debt. Its annual income was about $200. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> Province <b>of</b> Canada pulled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{negotiations}} for the Intercolonial Railway.|$|R
50|$|As always, <b>the</b> host <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament was South Korean club Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma. The {{other teams}} were <b>partly</b> chosen <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Korean {{football}} players {{they have in}} their squads.|$|R

5|$|The {{administration}} of Mashonaland {{did not immediately}} prove profitable for the Company or its investors, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} in 2011 was 838 females per 1,000 {{males in the}} island city, 857 in the suburbs, and 848 as a whole in Greater Mumbai, all numbers lower than the {{national}} average of 914 females per 1,000 males. The low sex ratio is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} medical or screening tests {{that can be}} used in diagnosing Tourette's; it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely recognized and publicized cases). Coughing, eye blinking, and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed.|$|E
50|$|During the Punic Wars, one of Carthage's main {{advantages}} over Roman armies was its {{extensive use of}} Numidian light cavalry. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> Roman general Scipio Africanus recruited his own cavalry from Sicily before his invasion <b>of</b> Tunisia during <b>the</b> Second Punic War.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Het Parool {{quickly became}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest {{newspapers}} in <b>the</b> Netherlands, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population appreciated it {{for being the}} most prolific resistance paper and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> newspapers that had collaborated with the German occupier were banned from publication.|$|R

5|$|WebObjects {{failed to}} achieve wide {{popularity}} <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial high price of US$50,000, but it remains {{the first and most}} prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions as opposed to static content. WebObjects is now bundled with macOS Server and Xcode.|$|E
5|$|Braidwood {{regarded}} Westminster Hall as {{safe from}} destruction by 1:45am, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{actions of the}} floating fire engine, but also because {{a change in the}} direction of the wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that the hall was safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00am, by which time the fire near the Hall was nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The firemen remained in place until about 5:00am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, he was {{appointed}} director of the newly constructed Armagh Planetarium in Northern Ireland, a post he held until 1968. His stay outside England was short <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beginning of The Troubles, a dispute Moore wanted no involvement in. He {{was appointed}} Armagh County secretary of the Scout movement, but resigned after being informed that Catholics could not be admitted. In developing the Planetarium, Moore travelled to Japan to secure a Goto Mars projector. He helped with the redevelopment of the Birr Telescope in the Republic of Ireland. He was {{a key figure in}} the development of the Herschel Museum of Astronomy in Bath.|$|E
25|$|Acidosis such as {{caused by}} {{inflammation}} at a wound partly reduces <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> LAs. This is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anesthetic is ionized and therefore unable {{to cross the}} cell membrane to reach its cytoplasmic-facing site <b>of</b> action on <b>the</b> sodium channel.|$|R
50|$|Castillo de Gauzón (Gauzón Castle) is {{a ruined}} Spanish fortification. It {{is located in}} <b>the</b> {{municipality}} <b>of</b> Castrillón, Asturias. Little remains <b>of</b> it, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stones that formed it were taken by the area residents to build houses and other structures.|$|R

5|$|In June and July 1991, {{the short}} armed {{conflict}} in Slovenia {{came to a}} speedy end, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ethnic homogeneity {{of the population of}} Slovenia. It was later revealed that a military strike against Slovenia, followed by a planned withdrawal, was conceived by Slobodan Milošević and Borisav Jović, then president of the SFR Yugoslavia presidency. Jović published his diary containing the information and repeated it in his testimony at the Milošević trial at the ICTY.|$|E
5|$|Mass transit {{accounts}} for 9% of total U.S. work trips. Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{low population density}} {{throughout much of the}} U.S. interior. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond {{the basic elements of}} his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the nearby}} tribes, the Batangan or the early Batangueños were a non-aggressive people. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tribes in their {{immediate}} environment {{were related to}} them by blood. Some weapons Batangans used included the bakyang (bows and arrows), the bangkaw (spears), and the suwan (bolo).|$|R
50|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early {{accounts}} do {{not even}} mention this incident, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early accounts are either British government- or colonial-supported publications or secondary texts. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary texts published during first decade or so after the Emergency were sympathetic to <b>the</b> British/Colonist/Loyalist point <b>of</b> view.|$|R
50|$|Conwell {{also claimed}} that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost status <b>of</b> Louisiana French had been restored, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French interpreters that the American army had used in World War II were Louisiana French speakers. Also, {{there were more}} French radio and {{television}} programs and French was being taught in elementary schools.|$|R
5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically {{possible for the}} foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point {{to any of these}} models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
5|$|San Diego's roadway system {{provides}} an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown {{tend to be}} utility cycling oriented. This is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E
50|$|Gerardus {{was born}} in <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> Hoorn, <b>The</b> Netherlands on December 25, 1927. His {{education}} was <b>partly</b> interrupted <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German occupation. Self study and evening classes helped to overcome this lack. At <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> fourteen he started work and became familiar with the electrical trade. Eventually he became an Electrical Supervisor.|$|R
60|$|I {{had heard}} the Story Girl tell many a more {{dramatic}} tale; but that one stands out for me in memory above them all, <b>partly,</b> perhaps, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spot in which she told it, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{it was the last}} one I was to hear her tell for many years--the last one she was ever to tell me on the golden road.|$|R
50|$|On August 3, 1999, {{the company}} would have to restate first-quarter results downward, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> changes in <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> {{landfills}} and otherassets in connection with its acquisition last year of Wheelabrator Technologies Inc.|$|R
