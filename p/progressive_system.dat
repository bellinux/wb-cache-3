The Scout method is a <b>progressive</b> <b>system</b> designed to achieve these goals, comprising seven elements: law and promise, learning by doing, team system, symbolic framework, personal progression, nature, and adult support. While community service is a major element of both the WOSM and WAGGGS programs, WAGGGS includes it as an extra element of the Scout method: service in the community.|$|E
25|$|Charles Cameron Kingston, PC (22 October 1850 – 11 May 1908) was an Australian politician. He was {{an early}} radical liberal Premier of South Australia serving from 1893 to 1899 {{with the support of}} Labor led by John McPherson from 1893 and Lee Batchelor from 1897 in the House of Assembly, winning the 1893, 1896 and 1899 colonial {{elections}} against the conservatives. He was a leading proponent of and contributed extensively on the Federation of Australia, and was elected to the federal House of Representatives with the most votes amongst the seven elected in the single statewide Division of South Australia at the 1901 election, serving under the Protectionist Party, going on to represent the Division of Adelaide at the 1903 election. A radical liberal in state politics, his government introduced such progressive measures as: electoral reform including the first law to give votes to women in Australia (and second in the world only to New Zealand), a legitimation Act, the first conciliation and arbitration Act in Australia, establishment of a state bank, a high protective tariff, regulation of factories, a <b>progressive</b> <b>system</b> of land and income taxation, a public works programme, and more extensive workers’ compensation.|$|E

The Culture itself is an [...] "ideal-typical" [...] liberal society; that is, as pure an example {{as one can}} reasonably imagine. It is highly egalitarian; the liberty of the individual is its most important value; and all actions and decisions {{are expected to be}} determined according to a standard of reasonability and sociability inculcated into all people through a <b>progressive</b> <b>system</b> of education. It is a society so beyond material scarcity that for almost all practical purposes its people can have and do what they want. If they do not like the behavior or opinions of others, they can easily move to a more congenial Culture population centre (or Culture subgroup), and hence there is little need to enforce codes of behavior.|$|E
2500|$|In Estonia, {{which has}} had a flat tax since 1994 (rate has been 20% since 2015, and used to be 21-26%), {{studies have shown that}} the {{significant}} increase in tax revenue experienced was caused partly by a disproportionately rising VAT revenue. Moreover, Estonia and Slovakia have high social contributions, pegged to wage levels. Both matters raise questions regarding the justice of the flat tax system, and thus its long-term political sustainability. The Estonian economist and former chairman of his country's parliamentary budget committee Olev Raju, stated in September 2005 that [...] "income disparities are rising and calls for a <b>progressive</b> <b>system</b> of taxation are getting louder – this could put an end to the flat tax after the next election". However, this did not happen, because after the 2007 elections a right-wing coalition was formed which stated its will to keep the flat tax in existence. However, critics argue that the tax rates these countries have are actually more progressive than flat.|$|E
2500|$|Albertans are the lowest-taxed {{people in}} Canada, {{mostly because of}} the province's {{considerable}} oil and gas income {{as well as the}} more conservative financial philosophies of successive governments. [...] It is also the only province in Canada where there is no provincial sales tax. Unlike the other provinces, which use a progressive income tax regime, Alberta used a flat rate income tax (currently at 10%), while equal for all, it also puts a higher burden of taxes on the lower-classes versus the upper-classes than found elsewhere. As a campaign promise, the New Democratic Party implemented a <b>progressive</b> <b>system</b> in 2015 after their electoral success. Alberta is one of few provinces that consistently has not received equalization payments from the federal government since 1962 (the others being British Columbia and (until 2008) Ontario, the original benchmark provinces). Alberta is now the largest net contributor to the program, which is intended to ensure that all provinces are able to provide similar levels of public services. [...] The province's wealth is largely due to the abundance of natural resources, and the provincial government's generous policies toward oil and wood pulp companies, etc. that have harvested the natural resources for export markets at a very high rate. As a result, Alberta is the only province in Canada that has (recently) eliminated its provincial debt.|$|E

A <b>progressive</b> penalty <b>system</b> {{is often}} called a <b>progressive</b> fines <b>system</b> if it involves increasingly higher financial penalties (fines), but (other) recidivism schemes such as demerit points systems {{can also be seen}} as a <b>progressive</b> penalty <b>systems.</b> The Netherlands has no general demerit points system such as England, France and Germany have, but it does have a demerit points system for novice drivers, a demerit points system for alcohol offenders, a scheme for repeat-offenders and recidivism schemes for various other serious traffic violations. Research shows us that progressive sanctions in the form of demerit points systems have a positive road safety effect with a duration of up to 1. 5 years. The road safety effect of progressive (financial) fines has not as such been investigated in the Netherlands nor in other countries. A scenario analysis indicates that a <b>progressive</b> fines <b>system</b> could save 5 % of the road deaths per year. Research shows that there is considerable public support for the introduction of a general demerit points system; citizens and experts also seem to support a <b>progressive</b> fines <b>system.</b> On 20 June 2017 the Minister of of Security and Justice in the Netherlands has announced to investigate the possibility to introduce a <b>progressive</b> fines <b>system</b> on licence plate.

Such, then, {{being the}} {{characters}} required {{in order to}} constitute high art, if the reader will think over them a little, and over the various ways in which they may be falsely assumed, he will easily perceive how spacious and dangerous a field of discussion they open to the ambitious critic, and of error to the ambitious artist; he will see how difficult it must be, either to distinguish what is truly great art from the mockeries of it, or to rank the real artists in any thing like a <b>progressive</b> <b>system</b> of greater and less. For it will have been observed that the various qualities which form greatness are partly inconsistent with each other (as some virtues are, docility and firmness for instance), and partly independent of each other; and the fact is, that artists differ not more by mere capacity, than by the component elements of their capacity, each possessing in very different proportions the several attributes of greatness; so that, classed by one kind of merit, as, for instance, purity of expression, Angelico will stand highest; classed by another, sincerity of manner, Veronese will stand highest; classed by another, love of beauty, Leonardo will stand highest; and so on; hence arise continual disputes and misunderstandings among those who think that high art must always be one and the same, and that great artists ought to unite all great attributes in an equal degree.|$|E
