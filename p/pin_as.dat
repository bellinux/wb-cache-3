5|$|In 1942, {{not long}} after the invasion, Prime Minister Pibulsonggram assumed the post of {{education}} minister himself, and appointed ML <b>Pin</b> <b>as</b> Director-General of the Department of General Education. Although resources were limited due to the war, ML Pin was able to manage the budget and personnel to allow a countrywide 12baht salary for rural local schoolteachers. During his term, every province was provided with at least one upper-secondary school. He also became involved in frequent school migrations due to both the war and changing policy.|$|E

ML Pin lobbied {{for the construction of}} Vajiravudhanusorn Hall, a museum displaying the King's works and duties, at the National Library. The hall was opened in 1981, despite budget problems during construction, which ML Pin had to sell part of the property on Damrongrak Road to help fund.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match. In an Iron Man match, a {{time-limit}} {{is set for}} a particular amount, in this case thirty-minutes. The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout. Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold. Later on, Daniels earned a two-count after landing on Styles with his signature B.M.E. aerial maneuver. Styles also gained a near-fall by holding Daniels on his shoulders before twisting him off and slamming him to the mat {{for what he calls}} a Rack Bomb. With only 13 seconds left in the match and the score still tied zero to zero, Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the <b>pin.</b> <b>As</b> time ran out, Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E

5|$|Árbenz's role {{as defense}} {{minister}} {{had already made}} him a strong candidate for the presidency, and his firm support of the government during the 1949 uprising further increased his prestige. In 1950 the economically moderate Partido de Integridad Nacional (PIN) announced that Árbenz would be its presidential candidate in the upcoming election. The announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, {{as well as from}} labor unions. Árbenz carefully chose the <b>PIN</b> <b>as</b> the party to nominate him. Based on the advice of his friends and colleagues, he believed it would make his candidacy appear more moderate. Árbenz himself resigned his position as Defense Minister on February 20 and declared his candidacy for the presidency. Arévalo wrote him an enthusiastic personal letter in response but publicly only reluctantly endorsed him, preferring, it is thought, his friend Víctor Manuel Giordani, who was then Health Minister. It was only the support Árbenz had, and the impossibility of Giordani being elected, that led to Arévalo deciding to support Árbenz.|$|E

25|$|Zbyszko {{took part}} in an eighteen-man battle royal in Saint Paul, Minnesota on February 7, 1989 to fill the vacant AWA World Heavyweight Championship. By {{stalling}} and avoiding confrontations with other wrestlers, Zbyszko was able {{to remain in the}} match until only two men remained: himself and Tom Zenk. The two men fought for several minutes. When Zenk went for a pin, referee Gary DeRusha inexplicably entered the ring to make the count. Zbyszko kicked out and the two continued in what now appeared to be a conventional wrestling match. DeRusha ended up taking a bump and was unable to make the three count when Zenk covered Zbyszko for the <b>pin.</b> <b>As</b> DeRusha slowly recovered, Zenk continued to dominate the match. As he attempted a flying body press, however, Zbyszko managed to catch him in mid-air and deliver a fallaway slam, throwing him over the top rope and to the ground below. Zbyszko was thus the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder <b>pin.</b> <b>As</b> the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E

Thus RGMII consists only of: RX_CTL, RXC, RXD3:0, TX_CTL, TXC, TXD3:0 (12 <b>pins,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to GMII's 24).|$|R

500|$|Of these improvements, {{the slide}} lock {{is the one}} that made the Model 1897 into a safe firearm. This {{improved}} slide lock kept the shotgun locked until actual firing occurred which prevented it from jamming {{in the case of a}} misfire. The slide lock [...] "stands in such a relation to the body of the firing <b>pin</b> <b>as</b> will prevent the firing pin reaching the primer until the pin has moved forward a sufficient distance to insure locking of the breech bolt". This prevents the action sleeve [...] "from being retracted by the hand of the gunner until after firing, and hence rendering the firearm more safe".|$|E
500|$|The Alternate Mode reconfigures {{the four}} SuperSpeed {{differential}} pairs present in USB-C {{to carry the}} three HDMI TMDS channels and the clock signal. The two Sideband Use pins (SBU1 and SBU2) are used to carry the HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel and the Hot Plug Detect functionality (HEAC+/Utility pin and HEAC−/HPD <b>pin).</b> <b>As</b> {{there are not enough}} reconfigurable pins remaining in USB-C to accommodate the DDC clock (SCL), DDC data (SDA), and CEC – these three signals are bridged between the HDMI source and sink via the USB Power Delivery 2.0 (USB-PD) protocol, and are carried over the USB-C Configuration Channel (CC) wire. This is possible because the cable is [...] electronically marked (i.e., it contains a USB-PD node) that serves to tunnel the DDC and CEC from the source over the Configuration Channel to the node in the cable, these USB-PD messages are received and relayed to the HDMI sink as regenerated DDC (SCL and SDA signals), or CEC signals.|$|E

500|$|The next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers (accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa) {{against a}} team calling {{themselves}} the Four Doinks. After Bigelow's team was introduced, Doink the Clown's theme song began to play, but immediately {{switched to the}} theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs, with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon. As the fans waited to see who would be the other two Doinks, the intro to Doink's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as [...] "Doinks on a Mission". Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks, which he willfully bit into. Samu was stunned to find out that the balloon was full of water, which caused him to stumble back in surprise and Luke rolled him up and pinned him. Later, Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him. However, Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana. As Booger was looking to perform the move again, his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees. Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match. He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel with curiosity. Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making {{like he was going to}} toss the contents of the bucket onto him. This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him. Meanwhile, Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna, which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner. Bigelow fell, Mabel performed a splash on him, and the referee counted the <b>pin</b> <b>as</b> the other three Doinks piled on. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.|$|E
