25|$|There are 10 known {{mutations}} in the voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit NaV1.7 encoding gene, SCN9A. This channel is expressed primarily in nociceptors of the {{dorsal root ganglion}} and the sympathetic ganglion neurons. Nine of these mutations have received further study and they have all shown to result in similar biophysical alterations, Table 1. As {{can be seen from}} table 1, the <b>primary</b> effect of <b>erythromelalgia</b> mutations is NaV1.7 channels that activate at more hyperpolarized potentials. NaV1.7 channels act largely as threshold sensors and initiate action potentials. Consequently, this shift in their activation profile results in channels that open closer to the resting membrane potential. In many mutations, this shift of activation is accompanied by shifts in the voltage sensitivity of fast and/or slow inactivation, often in the depolarized direction. This results in channels that are open for a longer of period of time, producing larger and more prolonged changes in membrane potential.|$|R

While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability.

In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the sodium channel NaV1.7.

25|$|Erythromelalgia, {{formerly}} known as Mitchell's disease (after Silas Weir Mitchell), is a rare vascular peripheral pain disorder in which blood vessels, usually in the lower extremities or hands, are episodically blocked (frequently on and off daily), then become hyperemic and inflamed.

In 2004 erythromelalgia became the first human disorder in which it has been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain; when its pathophysiology was initially published in the Journal of Medical Genetics.

50|$|Mutation in Nav1.7 {{may result}} in <b>primary</b> <b>erythromelalgia</b> (PE), an {{autosomal}} dominant, inherited disorder which is characterized by attacks or episodes of symmetrical burning pain of the feet, lower legs, and sometimes hands, elevated skin temperature of affected areas, and reddened extremities. The mutation causes excessive channel activity which suggests that Nav1.7 sets the gain on pain signaling in humans. It was observed that a missense mutation in the SCN9A gene affected conserved residues in the pore-forming α subunit of the Nav1.7 channel. Many studies have found a dozen SCN9A mutations in multiple families as causing erythromelagia. All of the observed erythromelalgia mutations that are observed are missense mutations that change important and highly conserved amino acid residues of the Nav1.7 protein. The majority of mutations that cause PE are located in cytoplasmic linkers of the Nav1.7 channel, however some mutations are present in transmembrane domains of the channel. The PE mutations cause a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation, which allows the channel to be activated by smaller than normal depolarizations, thus enhancing the activity of Nav1.7. Moreover, {{the majority of the}} PE mutations also slow deactivation, thus keeping the channel open longer once it is activated. In addition, in response to a slow, depolarizing stimulus, most mutant channels will generate a larger than normal sodium current. Each of these alterations in activation and deactivation can contribute to the hyperexcitability of pain-signaling DRG neurons expressing these mutant channels, thus causing extreme sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia). While the expression of PE Nav1.7 mutations produces hyperexcitability in DRG neurons, studies on cultured rat in sympathetic ganglion neurons indicate that expression of these same PE mutations results in reduction of excitability of these cells. This occurs because Nav1.8 channels, which are selectively expressed in addition to Nav1.7 in DRG neurons, are not present within sympathetic ganglion neurons. Thus lack of Nav1.7 results in inactivation of the sodium channels results in reduced excitability. Thus physiological interaction of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 can explain the reason that PE presents with pain due to hyperexcitability of nociceptors and with sympathetic dysfunction that is most likely due to hypoexcitability of sympathetic ganglion neurons.Recent studies have associated a defect in SCN9A with congenital insensitivity to pain.|$|E

CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 12 -year-old boy experiencing <b>primary</b> <b>erythromelalgia</b> had a 4 -year history of recurrent attacks of severe burning pain in both feet, accompanied by local reddening, swelling, and heating of the skin. The attacks were triggered by warmth and exercise. The pain was relieved only by elevation and cooling of the lower limbs, which he achieved by immersing his legs in a bucket of ice water, resulting in severe ulceration of the skin. INTERVENTION: Because of the gradual aggravation of the signs and symptoms and resistance of the patient's condition to several medical therapies, the patient received spinal cord stimulation. The implants were removed twice because of recurrent infection. Finally, the patient was treated with bilateral electrical stimulation of the ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus, which resulted in important pain control until 3 years later.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Primary</b> <b>erythromelalgia</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant pain disorder characterized by burning pain and skin redness in the extremities, with onset of symptoms {{during the first}} decade in the families whose mutations have been physiologically studied to date. Several mutations of voltage-gated Na + channel Na V 1. 7 have been linked with <b>primary</b> <b>erythromelalgia.</b> Recently, a new substitution Na V 1. 7 /I 136 V {{has been reported in}} a Taiwanese family, in which pain appeared at later ages (9 – 22 years, with onset at 17 years of age or later in 5 of 7 family members), with relatively slow progression (8 – 10 years) to involvement of the hands. The proband reported onset of symptoms first in his feet at the age of 11, which then progressed to his hands at the age of 19. The new mutation is located in transmembrane segment 1 (S 1) of domain I (DI) in contrast to all Na V 1. 7 mutations reported to date, which have been localized in the voltage sensor S 4, the linker joining segments S 4 and S 5 or pore-lining segments S 5 and S 6 in DI, II and III. Results In this study, we characterized the gating and kinetic properties of I 136 V mutant channels in HEK 293 cells using whole-cell patch clamp. I 136 V shifts the voltage-dependence of activation by - 5. 7 mV, a smaller shift in activation than the other erythromelalgia mutations that have been characterized. I 136 V also decreases the deactivation rate, and generates larger ramp currents. Conclusion The I 136 V substitution in Na V 1. 7 alters channel gating and kinetic properties. Each of these changes may contribute to increased excitability of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons, which underlies pain in erythromelalgia. The smaller shift in voltage-dependence of activation of Na V 1. 7, compared to the other reported cases of inherited erythromelalgia, may contribute to the later age of onset and slower progression of the symptoms reported in association with this mutation. </p...|$|E
