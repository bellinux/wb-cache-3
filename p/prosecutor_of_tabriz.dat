40|$|Background and Objective: The rapid {{expansion}} of knowledge and information, fragmentation and dispersion of various sectors of traditional curricula, and little connection {{with the real world}} have made learners {{pay more attention to the}} issue of integration in curricula. The aim of this study was to compare the viewpoints of academic staff <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> University <b>of</b> Medical Sciences with the University <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> about integration steps. Materials and Methods: This study is descriptive -survey. The population of study were 650 academic staff employed at University <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> and 324 members of the academic staff at the <b>Tabriz</b> University <b>of</b> Medical Sciences. The sample for the study was randomly selected, 242 academic staff from Tabriz University and 177 from <b>Tabriz</b> University <b>of</b> Medical Sciences based on Morag sampling Table. Data were collected using a researcher- made questionnaire. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics (Mean and Standard deviation indicators) and inferential statistics (MANOVA) through SPSS 22. Results: MANOVA test Results showed that there was a big gap between the opinion of the academic staff <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> University <b>of</b> Medical Sciences and the University <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> on the steps of awareness, harmonization, nesting, multi-disciplinary and inter- disciplinary are a significant difference. The mean of academic staff <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> University <b>of</b> Medical Sciences in the mentioned steps was greater than the mean of the University <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> academic staff. Results, on the other hand, showed that the gap was not significant between the two regarding steps of isolation, temporal co-ordination, sharing, correlation, complementary program and trans-disciplinary. Conclusion: The results showed that the academic staff <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> University <b>of</b> Medical Sciences paid more attention to the steps of awareness, harmonization, nesting, multi-disciplinary and inter- disciplinary than those <b>of</b> <b>Tabriz</b> University. Therefore, more attention should be paid to integration in medical curricula...|$|R
