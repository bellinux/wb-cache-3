40|$|To achieve {{thinner and}} longer floor slabs, rapid construction, and tight control of inservice deflections, modern {{concrete}} structures increasingly use high-strength, posttensioned <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> as reinforcement. The resulting structures are called posttensioned (PT) concrete. Post-tensioned concrete slabs are {{widely believed to}} benefit from ‘inherent fire endurance. ’ This belief is based largely on results {{from a series of}} standard fire tests performed on simply-supported specimens some five decades ago. Such tests are of debatable credibility; they do not capture the true structural behaviour of real buildings in real fires, nor do they reflect modern PT concrete construction materials or optimization methods. This thesis seeks to develop a more complete understanding of the structural and thermal response of modern <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> and PT concrete slabs, particularly those with unbonded <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> conditions, to high temperature, in an effort to steer current practice and future research towards the development of defensible, performance-based, safe fire designs. An exhaustive literature review of previous experimentation and real case studies of fire exposed PT concrete structures is presented to address whether current code guidance is adequate. Both bonded and unbonded <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> configurations are considered, and research needs are identified. For unbonded <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> in a localised fire, the review shows that the interaction between thermal relaxation and plastic deformation could result in tendon failure and loss of tensile reinforcement to the concrete, earlier than predicted by available design guidance. Since <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> runs continuously in unbonded PT slabs, local damage to <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> will affect the integrity of adjacent bays in a building. In the event that no bonded steel reinforcement is provided (as permitted by some design codes) a PT slab could lose tensile reinforcement across multiple bays; even those remote from fire. Using existing literature and design guidance, preliminary simplified modelling is presented to illustrate the stress-temperature-time interactions for stressed, unbonded <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> under localised heating. This exercise showed that the observed behaviour cannot be rationally described by the existing design guidance. The high temperature mechanical properties of modern <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> are subsequently considered in detail, both experimentally and analytically. Tests are presented on <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> specimens under constant axial stress at high temperature using a high resolution digital image correlation (DIC) technique to accurately measure deformations. A novel, accurate analytical model of the stresstemperature- time dependent deformation of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> is developed and validated for both transient and steady-state conditions. Modern <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> behaviour is then compared to its historical <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> counterparts, showing significant differences at high temperature. Attention then turns to other structural actions of a real PT concrete structure (e. g. thermal bowing, restraint, concrete stiffness loss, continuity, spalling, slab splitting etc.) all of which also play inter-related roles influencing a PT slab’s response in fire. A series of three non-standard structural fire experiments on heavily instrumented, continuous, restrained PT concrete slabs under representative sustained service loads were conducted in an effort to better understand the response of PT concrete structures to localised heating. To the author’s knowledge {{this is the first time}} a continuous PT slab which includes axial, vertical and rotational restraint has been studied at high temperature, particularly under localised heating. The structural response of all three tests indicates a complex deflection trend in heating and in cooling which differs considerably from the response of a simply supported slab in a standard fire test. Deflection trends in the continuous slab tests were due to a combination of thermal expansion and plastic damage. The test data will enable future efforts to validate computational models which account for the requisite complexities. Overall, the research presented herein shows that some of the design guidance for modern PT concrete slabs is inadequate and should be updated. The high temperature deformation of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> under localised heating, as would be expected in a real fire, should be considered, since uniform heating of simplysupported elements is both unrealistic and unconservative with respect to tensile rupture of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> tendons. The most obvious impact of this finding would be to increase the minimum concrete covers required for unbonded PT construction, and to require adequate amounts of bonded steel reinforcement to allow load shedding to the bonded steel at high temperature in the event that the <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> fails or is severely damaged by fire...|$|E

40|$|The stress {{corrosion}} cracking process developing in metals is at present an unknown mechanism of deterioration. It is a surface process that implies a corrosion and stress synergy, but the most practical consequence is that {{stress corrosion}} cracking can modify the mechanical characteristics of the metal.

This research deals with steels for prestressed concrete and aims {{to show that the}} fracture toughness changes when the steel is susceptible to {{stress corrosion cracking}}, questioning the idea that the toughness is an intrinsic characteristic of the material. The reduction in the fracture toughness of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steels</b> when they are in contact with aggressive media, involves that the material, for the same stress level, may reach a fracture having a lower crack size.

However, fire may cause irrecoverable damages to such slabs including rupture of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> tendons, concrete spalling, large downward deflection and even progressive collapse. Therefore, thorough investigations of the slabs under fire condition are desirable to formulate performance-based fire resistance design guidance. Numerical modelling of PT {{concrete slabs}} with unbonded tendons under fire condition was carried out based on available test results in the literature. Finite element (FE) models were established employing the commercial package ABAQUS. Results from the preliminary study achieved acceptable agreement with the test results. Parametric study was further conducted for better understanding of the structural responses and failure modes of the slabs. The behaviour of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> tendons at elevated temperature was then investigated with emphasis on thermal creep, where a three-dimensional (3 D) model incorporating Harmathy’s thermal creep model was proposed and verified. As there was limited data of thermal creep, thermal creep tests of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> to GB/T 55224 and BS 5896 were conducted, from which parameters of Harmathy’s creep model were obtained. Making use of the parameters obtained and the proposed 3 D model, the thermal relaxation of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> tendons could be accurately predicted as compared with the results of thermal relaxation tests of the both types of <b>prestressing</b> <b>steel</b> conducted in the present study.

Moreover, the transient creep strain of concrete was further incorporated into the FE models of PT concrete slabs, and the results showed that the transient creep strain had obvious effect on the downward deflections of slabs, and hence the transient creep strain should not be ignored. Tests and numerical modelling of PT two-way slabs with high-strength self-compacting concrete and unbonded tendons under ISO 834 standard fire condition were conducted. Useful results were obtained from four fire tests including the vertical and horizontal deflections, crack patterns, possible tensile membrane action and explosive concrete spalling.

The experiments have revealed {{a relationship between the}} homogeneity of the tested materials and the consistency of the reflection measurements. The repetition of simultaneous measurements of wave reflections and compressive strength on mortar results in similar strength-reflection loss relationships. Multiple measurements on the same concrete gave multiple strength-reflection loss relationships. The accuracy of the strength predictions made with the proposed method is discussed and compared to other nondestructive test methods...|$|R
50|$|The 1922 Memorial Bridge {{includes}} the longest single concrete arch span in Massachusetts. Its self-supporting steel rib arches represent an uncommon refinement of Melan's original idea - {{by making the}} steel arches self-supporting, and using them to support their own load plus {{the weight of the}} formwork and the wet concrete during construction, an initial compressive stress was developed in the steel prior to the setting of the concrete. This <b>prestressing</b> of the <b>steel</b> allowed a much higher proportion of its ultimate strength to be utilized, allowing, in turn, the use of smaller and lighter arch ribs and a less massive substructure.|$|R
