25|$|The Ayyubid {{army had}} lacked {{a clear and}} {{permanent}} hierarchical system and one of Baybars' early reforms was creating a military hierarchy. To that end, he began the system of assigning emirs ranks of ten, forty and one hundred, with the particular number indicating how many mounted mamluk troops were assigned to an emir's command. In addition, an emir of one hundred could be assigned one thousand mounted troops during battle. Baybars instituted uniformity within the army {{and put an end}} to the previous improvised nature of the various Ayyubid military forces of Egypt and Syria. To bring further uniformity to the military, Baybars and Qalawun standardized the undefined Ayyubid policies regarding the distribution of iqtaʿat to emirs. The reformation of iqtaʿ distribution created a clear link between an emir's rank and the size of his iqtaʿ. For example, an emir of forty would be given an iqtaʿ a third of the size of an emir of one hundred's iqtaʿ. Baybars also began biweekly inspections of the troops to verify that sultanic orders were carried out, in addition to the <b>periodic</b> <b>inspections</b> in which he would distribute new weaponry to the mamluk troops. Starting with the reign of Qalawun, the sultan and the military administration maintained lists of all emirs throughout the sultanate and defined their roles as part of the right or left flanks of the army should they be mobilized for war.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} {{option is}} to provide updates whenever a vehicle is brought in for inspection or servicing. [...] A major limitation here is that updating {{would be in the}} hands of the user. [...] Some vehicle owners maintain their vehicles themselves, and <b>periodic</b> <b>inspections</b> or servicing are considered too infrequent for updating VII. [...] Motorists might also be reluctant to stop at rest-stops for an update if they do not have the possibility of driving in an internet-enabled city.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2011, the FAA {{issued an}} {{emergency}} Airworthiness Directive (AD) requiring operators of 737 series 300, 400 and 500 aircraft {{to increase the}} frequency of inspections of lap joints on high flight cycle airframes. The AD requires that aircraft with over 30,000 cycles be inspected within 20 days of receipt of the AD, or upon reaching 30,000 cycles. For aircraft with over 35,000 cycles, the inspection is required within 5 days. The AD also requires <b>periodic</b> <b>inspections</b> of the same joints at every 500 cycles for aircraft with over 30,000 cycles. The AD refers {{to a range of}} airframes, line numbers 2553–3132 inclusive, totaling 580 aircraft. Of the total of 580 aircraft, only 175 aircraft currently meet the 30,000 cycle requirement, with 80 of those operating in the United States. [...] The FAA AD is effective to only the portion of those that are registered in the United States, since the FAA can only mandate such changes in the United States. Countries with reciprocity airworthiness agreements will also follow the AD, but other nations are not required to adhere to the ruling. As a result of the incident, the FAA investigated Boeing's manufacturing techniques to discover whether or not they had any bearing on the cause of the failure. The incident aircraft was not considered to have a high number of cycles. Boeing co-operated with the FAA in the investigation.|$|E

The new approximation is computationally simple, and outperforms the existing approximation. The new approximation yields expected total costs that are typically well within one percent of optimal. reliability: inspection, statistics: regression, decision analysis: approximations...|$|R
