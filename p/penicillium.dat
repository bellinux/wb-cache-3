5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and <b>Penicillium.</b> Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold <b>Penicillium</b> rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as <b>Penicillium</b> notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{bacteria}} such as Pseudomonas and Salmonella attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs. Fungi such as <b>Penicillium</b> infect loggerhead {{sea turtle}} nests and cloacae.|$|E
5|$|The {{cholesterol-lowering}} drugs, the statins, {{were initially}} produced by fungi including <b>Penicillium.</b> The first commercial statin, lovastatin, was fermented by the mould Aspergillus terreus.|$|E
5|$|The mould <b>Penicillium</b> roqueforti {{contributes}} {{the blue}} coloration {{and much of}} the flavour in blue cheeses such as Roquefort and Stilton. Mould fungi are processed to produce vegetarian meat substitutes such as Quorn.|$|E
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by <b>Penicillium</b> chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from <b>Penicillium</b> griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from <b>Penicillium</b> citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera <b>Penicillium</b> and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with <b>Penicillium</b> roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Penicillium</b> moulds cause {{soft rot}} such as of apples, while Aspergillus moulds create patches {{on the surface}} of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as plums and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol. Scientific {{understanding}} of spoilage began in the 19th century with works such as Louis Pasteur's 1879 Studies on Fermentation, which investigated the spoilage of beer.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large-scale}} production of penicillin {{took place in}} the town. In 1938 Howard Florey was working at Lincoln College, Oxford University with Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley, when he read Alexander Fleming's paper discussing the antibacterial effects of <b>Penicillium</b> notatum mould. He made arrangements for this to be grown in deep culture tanks at the Medical Research Council's Antibiotic Research Station in Clevedon, enabling mass production of this mould for the injections of the forthcoming soldiers of World War II who suffered from infections.|$|E
5|$|Charles Thom (November 11, 1872 – May 24, 1956) was an American {{microbiologist}} and mycologist. Born {{and raised}} in Illinois, he received his PhD from the University of Missouri, the first such degree awarded by that institution. He was {{best known for his}} work on the microbiology of dairy products and soil fungi, and in particular his research into the genera Aspergillus and <b>Penicillium.</b> His work influenced the establishment of standards for food handling and processing in the USA. He pioneered the use of culture media to grow microorganisms, and, with food chemist James N. Currie, developed a process to mass-produce citric acid using Aspergillus. Thom {{played an important role in}} the development of penicillin in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, <b>Penicillium</b> marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E
5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like <b>Penicillium</b> and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, <b>Penicillium,</b> Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
25|$|Alexander Fleming's {{accidental}} {{discovery of}} the antibiotic penicillin involved a <b>Penicillium</b> mold called <b>Penicillium</b> notatum (although the species identity is disputed as possibly being <b>Penicillium</b> chrysogenum or <b>Penicillium</b> rubens). Fleming continued to investigate Penicillin, showing that it could inhibit various types of bacteria found in infections and other ailments, but {{he was unable to}} produce the compound in large enough amounts necessary for production of a medicine. His work was expanded by a team at Oxford University; Clutterbuck, Lovell, and Raistrick, who began to work on the problem in 1931. This team was also unable to produce the pure compound in any large amount, and found that the purification process diminished its effectiveness and negated the anti-bacterial properties it had.|$|E
25|$|<b>Penicillium</b> roqueforti also {{produces}} the neurotoxin roquefortine C.|$|E
25|$|Bristol-Myers Squibb {{manufactures}} paclitaxel using <b>Penicillium</b> raistrickii {{and plant}} cell fermentation (PCF).|$|E
25|$|The fungi Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus tamarii, Aspergillus sulphureus, Aspergillus repens, Mucor hiemalis (not a human pathogen), <b>Penicillium</b> chrysogenum, <b>Penicillium</b> italicum and Rhizopus nigrans {{have been}} found in moldy cannabis. Aspergillus mold species can infect the lungs via smoking or {{handling}} of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly aspergillosis. Some of the microorganisms found create aflatoxins, which are toxic and carcinogenic. Researchers suggest that moldy cannabis should thus be discarded to avoid these serious risks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Penicillium</b> roqueforti is {{a common}} saprotrophic fungus from the family Trichocomaceae. Widespread in nature, it can be {{isolated}} from soil, decaying organic matter, and plants.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{inhibits}} Actinomucor elegans, Aspergillus niger, Bacterium linens, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Brevibacterium erythrogenes, Candida utilis, <b>Penicillium</b> chrysogenum, Rhizopus niveus, Saccharomyces mandshuricus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in concentrations above 10g/L.|$|E
25|$|They feed on skin flakes from humans, and animals, and on some mold. Dermatophagoides farinae fungal {{food choices}} in 16 tested species {{commonly}} found in homes was observed in vitro to be Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, and Wallemia sebi, and they disliked <b>Penicillium</b> chrysogenum, Aspergillus versicolor, and Stachybotrys chartarum.|$|E
25|$|The {{antifungal}} {{efficacy of}} copper {{was compared to}} aluminium on the following organisms that can cause human infections: Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., <b>Penicillium</b> chrysogenum, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. An increased die-off of fungal spores was found on copper surfaces compared with aluminium. Aspergillus niger growth occurred on the aluminium coupons; growth was inhibited on and around copper coupons.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{and copper}} alloy {{surfaces}} have demonstrated a die-off of Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., <b>Penicillium</b> chrysogenum, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans fungal spores. Hence, {{the potential to}} help {{prevent the spread of}} fungi that cause human infections by using copper alloys (instead of non-antifungal metals) in air conditioning systems is worthy of further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} in S. aureus was uncommon when penicillin {{was first introduced}} in 1943. Indeed, the original Petri dish on which Alexander Fleming of Imperial College London observed the antibacterial activity of the <b>Penicillium</b> fungus was growing a culture of S. aureus. By 1950, 40% of hospital S. aureus isolates were penicillin-resistant; by 1960, this had risen to 80%.|$|E
25|$|Biotechnology {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of antibiotics. In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered the mold <b>Penicillium.</b> His work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley – to form what we today know as penicillin. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans.|$|E
25|$|The male bed bug penis {{has been}} shown to carry five (human) {{pathogenic}} microbes, and the exoskeleton of female bed bugs nine, including <b>Penicillium</b> chrysogenum, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacillus licheniformis, and Micrococcus luteus. Tests with blood agar have shown some of these species can survive in vivo. This suggests infections from these species may contribute to the increased mortality rate in bed bugs due to traumatic insemination.|$|E
25|$|Industrial-scale {{citric acid}} {{production}} first began in 1890 {{based on the}} Italian citrus fruit industry, where the juice was treated with hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) to precipitate calcium citrate, which was isolated and converted back to the acid using diluted sulfuric acid. In 1893, C. Wehmer discovered <b>Penicillium</b> mold could produce citric acid from sugar. However, microbial production of citric acid did not become industrially important until World War I disrupted Italian citrus exports.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} fungi have been domesticated for use {{directly}} as food, or in fermentation to produce foods and drugs. The white button mushroom Agaricus bisporus is widely grown for food. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{have been used}} for thousands of years to ferment beer and wine, and to leaven bread. Mould fungi including <b>Penicillium</b> are used to mature cheeses and other dairy products, as well as to make drugs such as antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Dietary {{intake of}} patulin from apple juice has been {{estimated}} at between 0.03 and 0.26 μg/kg bw/day in various age groups and populations. Content of patulin in apple juice {{is estimated to be}} less than 10–15μg/L. A number of studies have looked into comparisons of organic vs conventional harvest of apples and levels of patulin contamination. For example, one study showed 0.9% of children drinking organic apple juice exceeded the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for patulin. A recent article described detection of patulin in marine strains of <b>Penicillium,</b> indicating a potential risk in shellfish consumption.|$|E
25|$|Foods such as Gorgonzola, Parmigiano-Reggiano, feta, the Waterford blaas, Herve cheese, Melton Mowbray pork pies, Piave cheese, Asiago cheese, camembert, Herefordshire cider, cognac, {{armagnac}} {{and champagne}} {{can only be}} labelled as such if {{they come from the}} designated region. To qualify as roquefort, for example, cheese must be made from milk of a certain breed of sheep, and matured in the natural caves near the town of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon in the Aveyron region of France, where it is colonised by the fungus <b>Penicillium</b> roqueforti that grows in these caves.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{responsible}} for bunch rot of grape berries are filamentous fungi, {{the most common}} of these being Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) However, there are a range of other fungi {{responsible for}} the rotting of grapes such as Aspergillus spp., <b>Penicillium</b> spp., and fungi found in subtropical climates (e.g., Colletotrichum spp. (ripe rot) and Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot)). A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis viticola). Compounds found in bunch rot affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, fenchol and fenchone.|$|E
25|$|The piling, wetting, {{and mixing}} of the piled máochá ensures even fermentation. The {{bacterial}} and fungal cultures {{found in the}} fermenting piles were found to vary widely from factory to factory throughout Yunnan, consisting of multiple strains of Aspergillus spp., <b>Penicillium</b> spp., yeasts, and {{a wide range of}} other microflora. Control over the multiple variables in the ripening process, particularly humidity and the growth of Aspergillus spp., is key in producing ripened pu'er of high quality. Poor control in fermentation/oxidation process can result in bad ripened pu'er, characterized by badly decomposed leaves and an aroma and texture reminiscent of compost. The ripening process typically takes between 45 and 60 days on average.|$|E
25|$|Geosmin is a {{compound}} {{with a very}} distinct earthy, musty, beetroot, even turnip flavour and aroma and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous actinomycetes such as Streptomyces, and moulds such as Botrytis cinerea and <b>Penicillium</b> expansum, on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to terroir. The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and {{has been found in}} recent vintages of red wines from Beaujolais, Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Loire in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in cork taint.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 an {{improved}} experiment {{was conducted by}} ISRO. On April 20, 2005, air samples were collected from the upper atmosphere at altitudes ranging from 20km to more than 40km. The samples were tested at two labs in India. The labs found 12 bacterial and 6 different fungal species in these samples. The fungi were <b>Penicillium</b> decumbens, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Alternaria sp. and Tilletiopsis albescens. Out of the 12 bacterial samples, three were identified as new species and named Janibacter hoylei (after Fred Hoyle), Bacillus isronensis (named after ISRO) and Bacillus aryabhattai (named after the ancient Indian mathematician, Aryabhata). These three new species showed {{that they were more}} resistant to UV radiation than similar bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Patulin is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} a variety of molds, in particular, Aspergillus and <b>Penicillium</b> and Byssochlamys. Most commonly found in rotting apples, in general the amount of patulin in apple products is viewed as a measure {{of the quality of the}} apples used in production. In addition, patulin has been found in other foods such as grains, fruits, and vegetables. While not considered a particularly potent toxin, a number of studies have shown patulin to be genotoxic, which has led some to theorize that it may be a carcinogen, although animal studies have remained inconclusive. Patulin has shown antimicrobial properties against some microorganisms. Several countries have instituted patulin restrictions in apple products. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum concentration of 50µg/L in apple juice.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{research}} in Hunter Valley vineyards {{discovered that a}} wide range of pathogens caused various occurrences of bunch rot in the vineyards. These other pathogens included Colletotrichum acutatum (ripe rot), Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot) and other fungi from the genera of Aspergillus, <b>Penicillium</b> and Alternaria. Susceptibility of certain wine grape varieties were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent Botrytis grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe rot, in particular, seemed to thrive at the higher ultraviolet B (280–320nm) light exposure that open canopies allow. To compound the potential problem for Hunter Valley wine growers is that, as of 2010, there wasn't any fungicides registered for use for this disease.|$|E
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (<b>Penicillium</b> roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
