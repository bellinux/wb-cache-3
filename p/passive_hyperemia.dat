40|$|Inadvertent {{embolization}} of {{the veins}} that drain arteriovenous intracranial shunts {{is likely to}} precipitate <b>passive</b> <b>hyperemia</b> with subsequent hemorrhage and brain edema. The mainstay of therapy for this complication is to decrease the flow through the shunt {{as much as possible}} and maintain the patient's blood pressure below baseline. We herein report our successful attempts at glue removal from partially obstructed straight sinus in two cases using a microsnare. This complication occurred during intracranial arteriovenous shunt embolization...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) {{is recommended}} for select patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Here, we describe {{the case of a}} 62 -year-old patient with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, of functional class NYHA III, with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and 90 % stenosis of the great cardiac vein (GCV), which was revealed as a result of coronary sinus venography during a CRT-P implantation procedure. A left-ventricular electrode was introduced to the posterolateral vein. Following CRT-P implantation a partial improvement was observed. In view of the patient's remaining apical segment contractility disorder and the coexistence of great cardiac vein stenosis, a hypothesis was put forward that the cause of these disorders was <b>passive</b> <b>hyperemia</b> of a portion of the left ventricle. Successful GCV angioplasty and BMS implantation was followed by clinical and echocardiographic improvement. Two months after the angioplasty, occlusion of the vein was detected, but repeated percutaneous treatment was unsuccessful...|$|E
40|$|Histological {{analysis}} {{was performed on the}} liver of 27 cats of different breeds, age and sex, autopsied at the Department of Pathological Morphology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Belgrade, and findings showed lymphoplasmocytic cholangiohepatitis, different degrees of fibrosis, <b>passive</b> <b>hyperemia,</b> fatty changes, cholestase, and neoplasms. The mentioned entities occurred very rarely as individual morphological manifestations, because the liver has different functions so that one morphological change often causes others to follow. Thus, for example, fibrosis was often followed by intrahepatic cholestase. Histopathological evaluation of liver disease is important not only in the autopsied samples, but also in diagnostics of liver diseases, in samples obtained by biopsy, which is important for making a precise diagnosis. The interpretation of the established histological changes in the liver requires close cooperation between clinicians and pathologists, because the final diagnosis is made on the grounds of morphological, biochemical and clinical findings...|$|E
40|$|To better {{characterize}} {{the contribution of}} both central and peripheral mechanisms to <b>passive</b> limb movement-induced <b>hyperemia,</b> we studied nine recent (< 2 yr) heart transplant (HTx) recipients (56 ± 4 yr) and nine healthy controls (58 ± 5 yr). Measurements of heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and femoral artery blood flow were recorded during passive knee extension. Peripheral vascular function was assessed using brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). During passive limb movement, the HTx recipients lacked an HR response (0 ± 0 beats/min, Δ 0 %) but displayed {{a significant increase in}} CO (0. 4 ± 0. 1 l/min, Δ 5 %) although attenuated compared with controls (1. 0 ± 0. 2 l/min, Δ 18 %). Therefore, the rise in CO in the HTx recipients was solely dependent on increased SV (5 ± 1 ml, Δ 5 %) in contrast with the controls who displayed significant increases in both HR (6 ± 2 beats/min, Δ 11 %) and SV (5 ± 2 ml, Δ 7 %). The transient increase in femoral blood volume entering the leg during the first 40 s of passive movement was attenuated in the HTx recipients (24 ± 8 ml) compared with controls (93 ± 7 ml), whereas peripheral vascular function (FMD) appeared similar between HTx recipients (8 ± 2 %) and controls (6 ± 1 %). These data reveal that the absence of an HR increase in HTx recipients significantly impacts the peripheral vascular response to passive movement in this population and supports the concept that an increase in CO is a major contributor to exercise-induced hyperemia...|$|R
30|$|Bone changes {{adjacent}} to VMs (also {{referred to as}} “soft-tissue hemangiomas” in the literature) were observed in 19 - 63 % of patients on plain film or MRI (Mendonca et al. 2010; Ly et al. 2003; Goto et al. 2001; Sung et al. 1998; Enjolras et al. 1997; Breugem et al. 2001; Pourbagher et al. 2011). In our cohort, 12 patients (30 %) had bone changes {{adjacent to}} VMs. The precise mechanism of adjacent bone change remains unknown. Several factors could contribute to adjacent bone change, including physical irritation, an extrinsic pressure and <b>passive</b> <b>hyperemia</b> (Sung et al. 1998; Goto et al. 2001; Pourbagher et al. 2011). Bone homeostasis is maintained by the balance between bone resorption and formation and is affected by local oxygen tension and pH, various cytokines, and hormones (Arnett 2010). We postulate that some cytokines and the change in local oxygen tension and pH due to latent microshunts and congestion {{may be one of}} the important factors developing the adjacent bone change around VMs, but it is still no better than a conjecture.|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{individual}} resistance to tuberculosis is associated with activity of the lymphoid tissues. Webb and Williams (1, 2) observed a direct relationship between the lymphocyte count and the extent and activity of the disease. Soon afterward Webb, Williams, and Basinger (3) reported beneficial effects in clinical tuberculosis which they interpreted as due to the lymphocytosis induced by altitude and by <b>passive</b> <b>hyperemia.</b> Webb (4) then reported the observation of phagocytos]s of tubercle bacilli by lymphocytes in cockroaches and grasshoppers. At this time, however, no differentiation had been made between lymphocytes and monocytes in the classification of the blood cells. The workof Schilling (5) and Sabin (6) has since established the fact that the monocyte is a distinct cellular entity. More recent investigations (7 - 9) have shown that it is this cell, not the lymphocyte, which phagocytizes tubercle bacilli. Nevertheless, further work has confirmed the belief of Webb, Williams, and Basinger, that lymphocytosis is correlated with resistance to tuberculosis. Murphy and Ellis (10) observed increased susceptibility to this disease in mice, guinea pigs, an...|$|E
40|$|The autopsy {{of a case}} of CHAGAS'S {{disease or}} American tryponosomiasis (a girl, 5 years old), dead in the 22 nd day of illness is reported. The {{anatomic}} diagnosis was a follows: Acute diffuse chagasic nyocarditis. Chagasic encephalitis. Chagasic lymphadenitis of the right posterior auricular node. Tuberculosis of the bronchial and pulmonary nodes. Chronic <b>passive</b> <b>hyperemia</b> and atelectasia of the lungs. Chronic passive congestion and hemorrhages of the spleen. Serous hepatitis. Parotiditis. Edema of the right eyelids. Bilateral hydrothorax. Hydropericardium. Hydroperitoneum. The morphology of Schizotrypanum cruzi in the myocardium is considered. Besides agglomerates with typical small oval or round intracellular bodies, pre-flagellate and flagellate organisms, others are found in which the great amount of parasites and marked pressure exerted by them against each other render very difficult their identification; sometimes the similitude of such agglamerates to Toxoplasma is striking (Fig. 1 and 1 A). In such a case, {{the structure of the}} blepharoplast (Fig. 1 and IA), usually preserved, is profitable and allows the identification of the pre-flagellate and flagellate forms of Schizotrypanum cruzi. Most of the small sensitive nerves in the epicardium shows mononuclear infiltration of the perineurium (perineuritis, Figs. 12 - 14). Microscopically there is extensive Zenker's degeneration (Figs. 6 - 8) and parasitism of the heart muscle fibers, marked cellular infiltration of the interstitial connective tissue, which are found in the ordinary musculature of every chamber of the heart (Figs. 10 - 11) as well as in Tawara's node (Fig. 9), main bundle (Fig. 2) and right (Fig. 4) and left (Fig. 5) septal divisions of the bundle of His, and perineuritis. Those anatomic changes are associated to an abnormal electrocardiogram presenting some similitude to that of an anemic infarct of the anterior wall of the heart and which will be discussed elsewhere (unpublished paper by Dias, Nobrega & Laranja) ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the purpose}} to {{study on the}} {{pathologic}} physiology of liver in aged people, the weight and histological findings of liver were observed on the autopsy cases without {{the cause of death}} of liver disease in each age over 60 years old for 3 years in 1955 - 58, besides, the correlation between the histological findings and liver function was observed on the aged people over 57 years old by the liver autopsy under the classification of normal blood pressure, arterial hypertension and essential hypertension, and the liver function was observed on them in each age. 1. The liver weight in aged people decreased and its degree was remarkable with their years. 2. The main region of liver cells' anisocytoiss and liver atrophy was at the central zone. The main region of nucleolar anisocytosis and concentration was diffuse, but it was rather strong at the marginal zone. 3. The sclerosis of liver artery in aged people was rarely observed on the cases with normal blood presure, but it was observed on 2 / 3 of the cases with arterial hypertension and it was slightly observed on most of the cases with essential hypertension. And it was known that there was considerably close correlation between the sclerosis of liver artery and the sclerosis of minor artery in the kidney. 4. The dilatation of central vein in the liver was observed on most of the cases in aged people and it was supposed that the <b>passive</b> <b>hyperemia</b> of liver was numerous in old people. 5. The brown pigmentation increased with the increase of decade. 6. The thickening and multiplication of cross fiber or the dilatation of capillary vessel were observed on the central and middle zones. 7. The multiplication of stroma was slightly observed and no difference by the blood pressure or ages was observed. 8. As for the liver function in aged people, the antidotal function was mainly disturbed, but the disturbance of other liver functions i. e. excreting function and serum colloidal reaction etc. were slight, even though those disturbances. The disturbance of liver function was more worse on 7 th decade than that on 6 th decade, but it was more mild on 8 th decade than that on 6 th or 7 th decade. And the disturbance of liver function was more remarkable in the cases with hypertension than that on the cases with normal blood pressure. 9. The parallel relation between the findings of liver tissue and liver function was not always observed...|$|E
