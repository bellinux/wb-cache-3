50|$|Ducts can be {{purchased}} {{with a variety of}} options or features. One such enhancement is <b>pre-lubrication.</b> Pre-lubricated ducts may be either permanently impregnated with anti-friction compounds or coated with liquid lubricant during manufacture (see GR-3155). This may or may not eliminate the need for supplementary lubrication when pulling cable into the duct. Before using a supplementary lubricant with a pre-lubricated duct, the user should check with the manufacturer to determine if the added lubricant is compatible with the pre-lubricated surface of the duct. Failure to do this may result in the cable seizing up rather than reducing the friction coefficient of the duct.|$|E
50|$|Either an {{electrical}} starter or an air-start system {{is used to}} start the engine turning. On large engines, <b>pre-lubrication</b> and slow turning of an engine, as well as heating, are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military diesels can be started with an explosive cartridge, called a Coffman starter, which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the past, Caterpillar and John Deere used a small petrol pony engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine. The pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an International Harvester design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system, and started on petrol. Once warmed, the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the engine cool before turning it off).|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine {{performance}} of various lubricants for aluminium alloy AA 5083. Conventional ring compression tests were conducted at 200 °C. Samples were compressed to 50 % of the initial height with a constant ram velocity 0. 5 mm/s using a servo-controlled hydraulic press. The optimization procedure was implemented in self-developed software to identify friction factors from experiments. The application launches remotely finite element (FE) simulations of ring compression with a changing friction factor until a difference between experiment and numerical prediction of the internal diameter of the sample is smaller than 0. 5 %. FE simulations were run using Forge 3 commercial software. The obtained friction factor quantitatively describes performance of a lubricant and can be used as an input parameter in FE simulation of other processes. It was shown that application of calcium aluminate conversion coating as <b>pre-lubrication</b> surface treatment reduced friction factor from 0. 28 to 0. 18 for MoS 2 paste. It was also revealed that commercially available graphite-based lubricant with an addition of calcium fluoride applied on conversion coating of calcium aluminate had even lower friction factor of 0. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{production}} of automotive body parts and panels {{is a very}} complex process, starting with the raw materials and ending in the paint shop. Due to the fact that aluminium sheet metal has to be lubricated before forming, all of the following processes have to be considered. Lubricants, such as oils, dry-film lubricants or recently introduced hotmelts have to protect the material’s surface, reduce friction whilst drawing the panels and should not compromise further treatments [1]. Different types of lubricants show different characteristics. This difference is especially noticeable when comparing liquid and dry-film lubricants. As dry-film lubricants do not run off the blanks ’ surface and are distributed homogeneously, they show different tribological properties compared to conventional liquid lubricants. The effect on friction of aluminium sheet metal is shown through several basic experiments [2, 3]. In addition, the paper shows the effect of further operations within the production chain. The advantages and disadvantages not only for drawing, but also for assembly lines and the painting process are described in this paper. Assembly issues are carried out on stability testings of riveted and clinched assemblies. These trials show how the assembly process is affected by different proceedings. The fact that every car body has to be completely free of grease before painting, signifies the necessity to get lubrication off the car body’s surface before painting. The interactions between lubrication and paint shop are shown on typical process parameters. Most typical characteristics considering bonding and riveting were tested out on a hood assembly of the current BMW 7 -series. In addition to that, experiences made in the press shop at BMW’s Dingolfing plant were figured out and carried over to a long-term strategy of <b>pre-lubrication</b> of aluminium sheet metal. This includes adhesive compatibility as well as the above mentioned assembly process...|$|E
