25|$|For {{the process}} of {{pollination}} to be successful, a <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> produced by the anther, the male part of a flower, must be transferred to a stigma, the female part of the flower, of a plant of the same species. The process is rather different in angiosperms (flowering plants) from what it is in gymnosperms (other seed plants). In angiosperms, after the <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> has landed on the stigma, it creates a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches the ovary. Sperm cells from the <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> then move along the pollen tube, enter the egg cell through the micropyle and fertilise it, resulting {{in the production of}} a seed.|$|E
25|$|The pollen wall {{protects the}} sperm while the <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> is {{moving from the}} anther to the stigma; it protects the vital genetic {{material}} from drying out and solar radiation. The <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> surface is covered with waxes and proteins, which are {{held in place by}} structures called sculpture elements {{on the surface of the}} grain. The outer pollen wall, which prevents the <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation, is composed of two layers. These two layers are the tectum and the foot layer, which is just above the intine. The tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella, which is composed of strengthening rods. The outer wall is constructed with a resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{germination}} {{has three}} stages; hydration, activation and pollen tube emergence. The <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> is severely dehydrated {{so that its}} mass is reduced enabling it to be more easily transported from flower to flower. Germination only takes place after rehydration, ensuring that premature germination does not {{take place in the}} anther. Hydration allows the plasma membrane of the <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> to reform into its normal bilayer organization providing an effective osmotic membrane. Activation involves the development of actin filaments throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, which eventually become concentrated at the point from which the pollen tube will emerge. Hydration and activation continue as the pollen tube begins to grow.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{morphology}} of <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> yielded by male Gymnosperm fructifications from the Jurassic flora of Yorkshire is studied and discussed. Several new male fructifications were found and described: Hastystrobus gen. nov. was erected for male cones yielding the Eucommiidites type of <b>pollen</b> <b>grains.</b> This genus is monotypic {{and the type}} species Hastystrobus muirii yielded <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> that agree with Eucommiidites troedssonii. Hastystrobus muirii very probably has Cycadalean affinities, because the whole abaxial surface of the microsporophylls is covered with sporangia. For {{the first time the}} male fructification of Ginkgo huttoni (Heer) Sternberg is described. It resembles in general the male fructification of the recent Ginkgo biloba L., and the <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> agree with those of Ginkgo biloba. Male cones associated with Brachyphyllum crucis Kendall have been found and described. They yielded <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> that after short maceration were identifiable as Circulina, while after prolonged maceration they could be assigned to Classopollis multistriatus Burger. Brachyphyllum crucis is provisionally assigned to the Hirmerella-group {{on the basis of its}} male cone and <b>pollen</b> <b>grains.</b> The cones were compared with other male cones containing Classopollis pollen, which were also attributed to the Hirmerella-group. It is suggested that all members of the Hirmerella-group have an epidermis with a special type of stoma. Masculostrobus harrisii sp. nov. is described. This male cone resembles closely the male cone of Elatides williamsoni (Brgt) Sew., but its <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> are of the Inaperturopollenites-type, instead of the Perinopollenites-type. The new species Pityanthus scalbiensis yielding bisaccate <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> of a rather primitive type is described; there is almost no saccus infrastructure present. The Czekanowskia-group (including Leptostrobus and Solenites) in all probability does not belong to the Ginkgoales but to the Conifers. An interesting find was that the <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> of the Araucariaceous Brachyphyllum mamillare Brgt are of two types: In type 1 the nexine and sexine are attached to each other, while in type 2 the nexine is loose from the sexine and is somewhat shrunk. In the latter type also <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> were found that are somewhat trilobate. A similar dimorphism of <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> was also found in the recent Araucaria araucana (Molina) K. Koch. The <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> from the various male fructifications were compared with those from other male fructifications related to them. If the cones were assigned to recent taxa, the <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> were compared with recent <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> from those taxa (Cycadales, Ginkgoales and Coniferospermae).

25|$|During microgametogenesis, the {{unicellular}} microspores undergo mitosis {{and develop}} into mature microgametophytes containing the gametes.

25|$|Another {{germination}} event {{during the}} life cycle of gymnosperms and flowering plants is the germination of a <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> after pollination. Like seeds, pollen grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a protective coat containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2-3 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a tube cell. Once the <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> lands on the stigma of a receptive flower (or a female cone in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by hydration on the stigma, {{as well as by the}} structure and physiology of the stigma and style.

25|$|Pollen {{itself is}} not the male gamete. Each <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> {{contains}} vegetative (non-reproductive) cells (only a single cell in most flowering plants but several in other seed plants) and a generative (reproductive) cell.

The aim of the work was to verify either if quality and number of <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> were similar in 'off' year with respect to 'on' year or differences occurred among olive cultivars. In 2006 and 2007, the viability and number of <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> per anther have been investigated in four Italian olive cultivars: 'Ascolana Tenera', 'Cazzinicchio', 'Cima di Melfi' and 'Coratina'.

25|$|Conifers are heterosporous, {{generating}} {{two different}} types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores. These spores develop on separate male and female sporophylls on separate male and female cones. In the male cones, microspores are produced from microsporocytes by meiosis. The microspores develop into pollen grains, which are male gametophytes. Large amounts of pollen are released and carried by the wind. Some pollen grains will land on a female cone for pollination. The generative cell in the <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis leading {{to the development of the}} pollen tube. At fertilization, one of the sperm cells unites its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of an egg cell. The female cone develops two ovule, each of which contains haploid haploid megaspores. A megasporocyte is divided by meiosis in each ovule. Each winged <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> is a four celled male gametophyte Three of the four cells break down leaving only a single surviving cell which will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte. The female gametophytes grow to produce two or more archegonia, each of which contains an egg. Upon fertilization, the diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, and a seed is produced. The female cone then opens, releasing the seeds which grow to a young seedling.|$|E
25|$|In {{plants with}} SI, when a <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> {{produced}} in a plant reaches a stigma {{of the same}} plant or another plant with a similar genotype, the process of pollen germination, pollen-tube growth, ovule fertilization and embryo development is halted at one of its stages and consequently no seeds are produced.

The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as spinulose (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as echinate.

25|$|Many {{plants have}} flowers {{and these are}} the sexual organs of those plants. Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, {{producing}} both male and female gametes. The female parts, {{in the center of a}} flower, are the pistils, each unit consisting of a carpel, a style and a stigma. One or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound pistil. Within the carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the stamens: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in anthers at their tips. When a <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a pollen tube that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{apertures}} are {{regions of}} the pollen wall that may involve exine thinning or {{a significant reduction in}} exine thickness.

Elongated apertures or furrows in the <b>pollen</b> <b>grain</b> are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: sulcus). Apertures that are more circular are called pores. Colpi, sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen. Pollen may be referred to as inaperturate (apertures absent) or aperturate (apertures present). The aperture may have a lid (operculum), hence is described as operculate. However the term inaperturate covers a wide range of morphological types, such as functionally inaperturate (cryptoaperturate) and omniaperturate. Inaperaturate pollen grains often have thin walls, which facilitates pollen tube germination at any position. Terms such as uniaperturate and triaperturate refer to the number of apertures present (one and three respectively).|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether low temperature experienced by the root, panicle, or foliage is responsible for increased spikelet sterility. In temperature-controlled glasshouse experiments, water depth, and water and air temperatures, were changed independently to investigate the effects of low temperature in the root, panicle, and foliage during microspore development on spikelet sterility. The total number of pollen and number of engorged <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> per anther, and the number of intercepted and germinated <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> per stigma, were measured. Spikelet sterility was then analysed in relation to the total number of <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> per spikelet and the efficiency with which these <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> became engorged, were intercepted by the stigma, germinated, and were involved in fertilisation. There was a significant combined effect of average minimum panicle and root temperatures on spikelet sterility that accounted for 86 % of the variation in spikelet sterility. Total number of <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> per anther was reduced by low panicle temperature, but not by low root temperature. Whereas engorgement efficiency (the percentage of <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> that were engorged) was determined by both root and panicle temperature, germination efficiency (the percentage of germinated <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> relative to the number of engorged <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> intercepted by the stigma) was determined only by root temperature. Interception efficiency (i. e. percentage of engorged <b>pollen</b> <b>grains</b> intercepted by the stigma), however, was not affected by either root or panicle temperature. Engorgement efficiency was the dominant factor explaining the variation in spikelet sterility.
