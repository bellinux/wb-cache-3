Good repeatability(n= 6) was obtained in all the cases with The relative standard deviation lower 9. 7 %. Pyrethroid <b>pesticides</b> <b>residues</b> in 4 real tea samples can be determined rapidly by this method, their pyrethroid <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> are all less than MRL of China and European union...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the Malaysian {{agriculture}} industry {{has contributed to the}} growth and major contributors to national income and export earnings. It is become basis of economic growth and main contributor in national economy prior to the 1970 s. However, in order to increase the food production such as vegetables and fruits, pesticides is widely used in agriculture industry to prevent, destroying or mitigating any pest that can cause harm to plant. Unfortunately, the pesticide residue level in vegetables is dangerous and can cause harm to human health if excessive consumption of pesticides in vegetables is highly taken. Commonly, people tend to wash the vegetables only by using tap water before cook or eaten raw without knowing kevel of food safety before these commodities been consumed. Thus, the objective of this thesis are to determine and compare the concentration of pesticide residue level in selected vegetables after being washed by using distilled water and vegetables detergent and to determine the food safety of these commodities by comparing the pesticides concentration result with Malaysian Maximum Residue Limits standard that has been listed out by Ministry of Health under Food Regulation 1985. In this study, presence of chlorpyrfos pesticides is detected in cabbage and eggplant vegetables. Both vegetable samples are washed and soaked with distilled water and vegetables detergent (Pureen Liquid Cleanser) before sample preparation is made and analyzed by using Gas Chromatogrpahy-Electron Capture Detector method. From the result, it has showed the presence of chlorpyrfos pesticide in both vegetable samples and concentration <b>pesticides</b> <b>residue</b> is lower when washed and soaked with vegetables detergent compare when washed and soaked with distilled water. It proved that vegetable detergent is an effective way to remove or kill the pesticide residue that left in these vegetable. Result from this study then is compare with Maximum Residue Limits to determine the level of food safety of this type of commodities and from the comparison, concentration of <b>pesticides</b> <b>residue</b> in vegetable could not be consider a serious public health problem. However, continuous monitoring and tighter regulation of pesticide residue of chlorpyrjfos in vegetables is recommended...|$|E
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>pesticides</b> <b>residue,</b> especially organochlorines (OCs) {{in the environment}} is a great worry due to their tendency for long-range transport. Also their capacity to bioaccumulate in food chain {{poses a threat to}} {{human health and the environment}} (Chau 2005; Zhou et al. 2006; Pandit et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2008). Pesticides enter and pollute any component of the environment in a number of ways, including application, accidental spillage or through the unauthorized dumping of pesticide products or their containers (Cox 2002). Contamination of water bodies for example is a major concern for fish and other aquatic organisms such as mussels, oysters, prawns and lobsters which are major sources of protein (Essumang and Chokky 2009). Accumulation of pesticides in these organisms has become a serious public health issue worldwide. Fish are used extensively for environmental monitoring because they concentrate pollutants directly from water and diet, thus enabling the assessment of transfer of pollutants through the food web (Bruggeman 1982; Fisk et al. 1998; Lanfranchi et al. 2006; Das et al. 2002).|$|E
30|$|The strong {{positive}} correlation between pH and (diazinon and pirimiphos-methyl) and EC and (diazinon and chlorpyrifos) indicates that pH and EC of water could have enhanced the adsorption of these pesticide compounds. Thus, increase in pH and EC resulted in a corresponding increase in concentrations of diazion and pirimiphos-methyl, and diazinon and chlorpyrifos respectively. In addition, the strong {{positive correlation}} between TDS and (diazinon and chlorpyrifos) and TSS and (diazinon) suggests that these <b>pesticides</b> <b>residue</b> levels in water possibly increased with TDS and TSS content of the water. Also, the {{positive correlation between}} ammonia and (diazinon), phosphate and (pirimiphos-methyl), sodium and (chlorpyrifos), and potassium and (pirimiphos-methyl) suggests that these nutrients in water have significant influence {{on the distribution of}} pesticides and an increase in the level of these nutrients resulted in a corresponding increase in their respective pesticide residues. On the other hand, the negative correlation between temperature and pirimiphos-methyl indicates that pirimiphos-methyl pesticide residue levels in water decrease with increase in water temperature and vice versa. This could be due to decomposition of pirimiphos-methyl pesticide with increase in water temperature.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 1057 samples of fresh {{vegetables}} from import and domestic production were analyzed (cold pepper, egg plant, carrot, cucumber, potato, hot pepper, cultivation tomato, squash, beans, okra, onions, cauliflower, and green house tomato). The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> in market foods in Riyadh, which have been collected from Riyadh Development Company (Al-Tamer Vegetables Market). <b>Pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> were determined by gas chromatography with mass selective detector (GC-MSD). A multiresidue method was developed and described for simultaneous determination of 86 pesticides commonly used in crop protection. This method used to determine 86 <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> with a broad range of physicochemical properties in fresh vegetables related to organophosphorus (OPP), organochlorines (OCP), pyrethroids, and carbamates mainly used in agriculture. Sample extract was cleaned up by using AOAC method. <b>Pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> above the maximum residue limits (MRL) were detected in 15. 89 % of the total samples (168 from 1057 samples), but 83. 90 % of the total samples (887 from 1057 samples) has no <b>residues</b> or contained <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> at or below MRL. The detected and most frequently found <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> were permethrin (45 times) and endosulfan (34 times) followed by deltamethrin (27 times). The findings of this study pointed to the following recommendations: the need for a monitoring program for <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> in imported food crops...|$|R
