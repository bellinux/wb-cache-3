5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the <b>Perpetual</b> Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the <b>Perpetual</b> Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|For 37 years, Castro {{publicly}} wore {{nothing but}} olive-green military fatigues, emphasizing {{his role as}} the <b>perpetual</b> revolutionary, but in the mid-1990s began wearing dark civilian suits and guayabera publicly as well.|$|E
5|$|Nat was the <b>perpetual</b> runaway and rebellious slave feared by slaveowners. Named after Nat Turner, the Nat {{character}} retaliated against slaveowners and was subdued {{and punished}} only when overcome by greater numbers.|$|E

5|$|After the Ateneo de Manila, La Salle, and San Beda left, the NCAA {{opened its}} doors to new members. In 1984, <b>Perpetual</b> Help College of Rizal was {{accepted}} as a new member, while Trinity College of Quezon City became a full member in 1985 (despite earlier explanation that the Stallions were admitted earlier, in 1974). San Beda rejoined the league in 1986, while Trinity left in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Character {{development}} is a primary element of Oblivion. At {{the beginning of the}} game, players select one of many human or anthropomorphic races, each of which has different natural abilities, and customize their character's appearance. A <b>perpetual</b> objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas.|$|E
5|$|Charles Redheffer was an American {{inventor}} {{who claimed}} to have invented a <b>perpetual</b> motion machine. First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he applied to the government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered the machine was actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.|$|E
5|$|In 1468 Orkney was pledged by Christian I, in his {{capacity}} as king of Norway, as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland. As the money was never paid, the connection with the crown of Scotland has become <b>perpetual.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thus, a release-critical bug in a {{new version}} of a shared library on which many {{packages}} depend may prevent those packages from entering Testing, because the updated library must meet the requirements too. From the branch viewpoint, the migration process happens twice per day, rendering Testing in <b>perpetual</b> beta.|$|E
5|$|While {{the flag}} {{itself is the}} <b>perpetual</b> legacy of Agoncillo, she is also commemorated through museums and monuments like the marker in Hong Kong (where her family {{temporarily}} sojourned), at her ancestral home in Taal, Batangas which {{has been turned into}} a museum, in paintings by notable painters as well as through other visual arts.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} he {{returned}} to Dorothea's Courland court, where {{he served as a}} tutor for her daughter. Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain <b>perpetual</b> peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This {{takes the form of a}} handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the <b>perpetual</b> property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in <b>perpetual</b> darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along {{the rim of the}} crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson are {{credited}} with creating the Joker, but their {{accounts of the}} character's conception differ, each providing {{his own version of}} events. Finger's, Kane's, and Robinson's versions acknowledge that Finger produced an image of actor Conrad Veidt in character as Gwynplaine (a man with a disfigured face, giving him a <b>perpetual</b> grin) in the 1928 film The Man Who Laughs as an inspiration for the Joker's appearance, and Robinson produced a sketch of a joker playing card (right).|$|E
5|$|By 1857 the <b>Perpetual</b> Emigration Fund was exhausted; {{almost all}} of the {{handcart}} emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition, on its way to Utah to confront Young and the Mormons, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.|$|E
5|$|Charles Redheffer and {{his machine}} became {{well known in}} Philadelphia in 1812. Redheffer claimed he had invented a <b>perpetual</b> motion machine and {{exhibited}} it in a house near the Schuylkill River in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He charged an admission fee of $5 (some sources claim $1) for men to view it; depending on the source, women were admitted free or at a charge of $1. The machine caused a sensation, and Redheffer lobbied for funds to build a larger version.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{projects}} such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself <b>perpetual</b> censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis, under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.|$|E
5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} <b>perpetual</b> darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above. To what extent deep-water coral reefs provide a safe nursery area for juvenile fish has not been established, {{but they may be}} important for many cold-water species.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{used to be}} a British colony {{with the}} <b>perpetual</b> cession of Hong Kong Island from the Qing Empire after the First Opium War (1839–1842). The colony {{expanded}} to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and acquired a 99-year lease of the New Territories from 1898. Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China {{with a high degree of}} autonomy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection {{between himself and the}} other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques. In The <b>Perpetual</b> Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, {{of all his}} inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to {{in the title of}} his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a <b>perpetual</b> baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|John Jones, who was Dean of Bangor Cathedral from 1689 to 1727, {{was also}} rector of St Ffinan's during that time, {{as it was}} one of the benefices {{attached}} to the deanery. Jones is commememorated by a stone tablet on the wall of St Mary's Church, Pentraeth, also in Anglesey. The antiquarian Nicholas Owen was <b>perpetual</b> curate here from 1790 until his death in 1811; he is buried at St Tyfrydog's Church, Llandyfrydog, Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre's first {{assignment}} as a Holy Ghost Father was as {{a professor}} at St. John's Seminary in Libreville, Gabon. In 1934 he was made rector of the seminary. On 28 September 1935 he made his <b>perpetual</b> vows. He served as superior {{of a number of}} missions of the Holy Ghost Fathers in Gabon. In October 1945 Lefebvre was ordered by the superior general to return to France and take up new duties as rector of the Holy Ghost Fathers seminary in Mortain.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a <b>perpetual</b> copyright.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{has named}} {{the rim of}} Shackleton as a {{potential}} candidate for its lunar outpost, slated to {{be up and running}} by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024. The location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents, as <b>perpetual</b> sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May, Carlsen {{played an}} {{exhibition}} game at Oslo City against the people of Norway, assisted by a grandmaster panel consisting of Simen Agdestein, Jon Ludvig Hammer, and Leif Erlend Johannessen. Each of the panel members proposed a move and the public could then vote over the proposed moves. Each panel member was allowed three chances to let chess engine Houdini propose a move during the game. Norway's moves were executed by Oddvar Brå who was disguised in a red spandex suit for the occasion. The game was drawn when Carlsen forced a <b>perpetual</b> check.|$|E
5|$|People {{associated}} with the church include Henry Maurice (elected Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford {{shortly before his death}} in 1691; his father, Thomas, was the <b>perpetual</b> curate of the church) and the 19th-century writer and priest Owen Wynne Jones (who was the curate for a time in the early 1860s). The 19th-century Calvinistic Methodist preacher Richard Owen was born in the parish, and is buried in the graveyard that surrounds the church.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo {{also made}} {{hypotheses}} {{in regards to}} geology and climatology in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. Shen believed that land was reshaped over time due to <b>perpetual</b> erosion, uplift, and deposition of silt, and cited his observance of horizontal strata of fossils embedded in a cliffside at Taihang {{as evidence that the}} area was once the location of an ancient seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles east over an enormous span of time. Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.|$|E
5|$|The Annunciation was {{a popular}} theme in European art, {{although}} a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with Christ as she becomes the tabernacle for the Word made flesh. Mary as Theotokos, the God-bearer, was affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation– that Christ was of two natures (God and Man)– and her <b>perpetual</b> virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vimy Ridge was {{the first}} {{occasion}} on which all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, {{and it became a}} Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada <b>perpetual</b> use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the understanding that Canada use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters, and unexploded munitions still honeycomb the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.|$|E
5|$|The caretaker's cottage is two storeys high, {{built of}} {{limestone}} ashlar with a slate roof. It has sash windows {{to the south}} and north, with false windows on the east and west ends. Access to the pool is through the ground floor lobby of the cottage. Inside, the original panelled ceiling remains intact as well as a hob and fireplace in the bedroom and another early 19th-century fireplace on the ground floor. On either side of the cottage are six changing cubicles with sloping roofs covered with asbestos sheets. At the western end are two further dressing rooms and the <b>perpetual</b> shower which was linked to the ladies' pool.|$|E
5|$|The elder Sellers was {{convinced}} {{the machine was}} a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens to build a similar machine, using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged {{a demonstration of the}} machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it. Meanwhile, Redheffer's machine appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that the machine was genuine, and that Redheffer had discovered <b>perpetual</b> motion.|$|E
5|$|Threefold {{repetition}} of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side {{is able to}} avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of <b>perpetual</b> check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by threefold repetition.|$|E
5|$|With the Bábí {{community}} now irrevocably divided, {{the followers}} of Mirza Yahya tried to discredit Bahá'u'lláh to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government. While an investigation cleared Bahá'u'lláh, it did bring {{to the attention of}} the government that Bahá'u'lláh and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing that this might cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'Bábí' leaders. A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábís to <b>perpetual</b> imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire— Famagusta, Cyprus for Mirza Yahya and his followers, and Acre, in Ottoman Palestine, for Bahá'u'lláh and his followers.|$|E
5|$|With the {{ambition}} to become London's sole burial site in perpetuity, the LNC {{were aware that}} if their plans were successful, their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance. As a consequence, the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind, {{in contrast to the}} squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded. The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere of <b>perpetual</b> spring in the cemetery, and chose the plants for the cemetery accordingly. It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil. Robert Donald, the owner of an arboretum near Woking, was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for the cemetery. The railway line through the cemetery and the major roads and paths within the cemetery were lined with giant sequoia trees, the first significant planting of these trees (only introduced to Europe in 1853) in Britain. As well as the giant sequoias, the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia, rhododendron, coastal redwood, azalea, andromeda and monkeypuzzle, with the intention of creating <b>perpetual</b> greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout the cemetery.|$|E
