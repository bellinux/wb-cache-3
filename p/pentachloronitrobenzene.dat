50|$|In Brazil, it is {{recommended}} not to plant seed lots with more than 30 percent black point in order to limit spot blotch. Seed treatment {{may prove to be}} appropriate, although the inoculum remaining on secondary hosts or in the soil may reduce the treatment efficiency. Seed treatments with phytoalexin inducer appeared to provide good protection to wheat seedlings against ''''''B. sorokiniana'''''' infection (Hait and Sinha, 1986). Seed treatment with fungicide will help protect germinating seed and seedlings from fungi causing seedling blights. Fungicide seed treatments include: captan, mancozeb, maneb, thiram, <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> (PCNB) or carboxin guazatine plus, iprodione and triadimefon (Stack and McMullen, 1988; Mehta, 1993).

50|$|As conidial {{morphology}} {{can vary}} depending {{not only on}} factors such as temperature, {{but also on the}} components of the growth medium, precision, and consistency in the production and use of growth media is important. potato dextrose agar (PDA) is widely used for growing Fusarium species, but its use is limited by the fact that sporulation can take up to two months on this medium. Peptone <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> (PCNB) medium, historically known as Nash medium, is considered the most effective selective medium for the fusaria. Although its formulation is now considered somewhat outdated, PCNB has historically been useful for the rapid distinction between different Fusarium species in soil samples.

40|$|The {{freezing}} of {{the cooperative}} reorientational motions in orientationally disordered (OD) molecular crystals marks the so-called glassy transition, {{which may be}} considered a lower-dimensional version of the structural glass transition. Although structural glasses display both positional and orientational disorder, in orientational glasses, however, the disorder involves exclusively the orientational degrees of freedom of the constituent molecules, while the molecular centers of mass form an ordered lattice. We report here on a glass-forming system with even fewer degrees of freedom, namely, the OD phase of a dipolar benzene derivative, <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> (C 6 Cl 5 NO 2). We probe the orientational dynamics of <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> {{as a function of}} temperature and pressure by means of dielectric spectroscopy (and high-pressure density measurements), and we show that, due to its anisotropy, the system exhibits a double primary relaxation feature associated with two distinct motions of the molecular dipole moment. This complex relaxation scenario shows a scaled dependence on the thermodynamic variables (P,T), with all relaxation times collapsing onto a single curve for each relaxation when plotted versus a specific-volume-dependent scaled variable TVπ.

40|$|Nocardioides sp. strain PD 653 was {{the first}} {{identified}} aerobic bacterium capable of mineralizing hexachlorobenzene (HCB). In this study, strain PD 653 -B 2, which was unexpectedly isolated from a subculture of strain PD 653, was found to lack the ability to transform HCB or <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> into pentachlorophenol. Comparative genome analysis of the two strains revealed that genetic rearrangement had occurred in strain PD 653 -B 2, with a genomic region present in strain PD 653 being deleted. In silico analysis allowed three open reading frames within this region {{to be identified as}} candidate genes involved in HCB dechlorination. Assays using recombinant Escherichia coli cells revealed that an operon is responsible for both oxidative HCB dechlorination and <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> denitration. The metabolite pentachlorophenol was detected in the cultures produced in the E. coli assays. Significantly less HCB-degrading activity occurred in assays under oxygen-limited conditions ([O- 2] < 0. 5 mg liter(- 1)) than under aerobic assays, suggesting that monooxygenase is involved in the reaction. In this operon, hcbA 1 was found to encode a monooxygenase involved in HCB dechlorination. This monooxygenase may form a complex with the flavin reductase encoded by hcbA 3, increasing the HCB-degrading activity of PD 653. IMPORTANCE The organochlorine fungicide HCB is widely distributed in the environment. Bioremediation can effectively remove HCB from contaminated sites, but HCB-degrading microorganisms have been isolated in few studies and the genes involved in HCB degradation have not been identified.

Culture-independent high throughput sequencing identified a different subset of the microbial community within the enrichment microcosms to the culture dependent method.

We successfully evaluated the combination of <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> and vancomycin added to the yeast-mannitol medium to inhibit most fungi and Gram-positive soybean microbiota, thus producing reliable counts of B. japonicum from inoculated soybean seeds. Percentages of recovery and survival factors were obtained and used to construct a two-phase exponential decay non-linear regression function. High temperature and desiccation decreased these parameters, while the optimization of temperature and the use of osmoprotective compounds with inoculants increased them. The use of this protocol minimized heterogeneity between experiments and may be considered more reliable than the simple expression of direct colony count of bacteria recovered from seeds.|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} and qualitative study of the mycoflora of both commercial and industrial sorghum malt was undertaken. Samples were collected from three industrial (22 samples) and 10 commercial (65 samples) maltsters {{over a period of}} three years. Fungal propagule counts were made of surface sterilized kernels on four different media (potato dextrose agar, acidified Czapeks-Dox medium, malt-salt agar and <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> medium) using both the dilution plate and the whole kernel method. Counts were unacceptably high in many samples, especially in certain commercial malts. Counts differed between malts from different industrial malt producers, some consistently showing higher contamination levels than others. Differences were found between the dominant fungi occurring in the two malt types and the two evaluation methods also gave different results regarding certain taxa. In all, 61 different species representing 29 genera were found to occur in sorghum malt. Fungi most frequently encountered were: Yeasts, Rhizopus rhizopodiformis (Cohn) Zopf, R. oryzae Went & Prinsen Geerligs. Aspergillus clavatus Desmazières. A. flavus Link, Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon, F. moniliforme Sheldon var. subglutinans Wollenw. & Reinking, F. chlamydosporum Wollenw. & Reinking and Phoma sorghina (Sacc.)

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{nurseries}} in eastern Oklahoma has identified southern blight, caused by Sclerotium rolfsii, as an economically important {{disease in the}} production of field-grown apple seedlings and rootstock. S. rolfsii can infect trees up to three years old. Chemical and biological control studies were conducted to evaluate rates and time of application of three fungicides and three formulations of the biological control-fungus, Trichoderma harzianum. On the basis of "dummy " regression models for analysis of disease progress, the fungicides benodanil and <b>pentachloronitrobenzene</b> (PCNB) were effective in delaying the onset of the disease and in slowing disease progress. Combinations of PCNB and Trichoderma harzianum were more effective in reducing disease rate than PCNB alone. T. harzianum formulated with a food-base (infested oat-seed) was more effective in reducing disease progress than either conidial or chlamydospore formulations. In addition to sclerotia, incorporation of residue from infested woody plant parts provided overwintering sites and initial inoculum for S. rolfsii in the spring. Weed control, rouging of diseased trees, and avoidance of highly infested fields and fields previously planted to soybean are important management practices to reduce losses in seedling production due to southern blight...|$|E
