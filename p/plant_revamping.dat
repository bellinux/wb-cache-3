The main concept of the new technology manifested itself in: production of a steel DeV product free from phosphorus, sulfur, gases and detrimental non-ferrous impurities; secondary metallurgy which offers minimum gas pickup in steel and low non-metallic inclusions; continuous casting of steel into billets which imply higher quality of the final product and higher yield...|$|E
40|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} how mixing primary-tertiary or secondary-tertiary amines have improved {{the efficiency of}} amine-sweetening processes in terms of gas purification and process energy requirements. This article discusses the use of amine solvents that consist of two tertiary amines, methyl-diethanolamine (MDEA) and triethanolamine (TEA). A kinetic approach was used to explain results obtained from a process simulation of the Habshan gas sweetening unit in Abu Dhabi. New technologies are being implemented recently to treat highly sour natural gas with different gas sweetening processes. Many recent researches {{have focused on the}} mixing of different amine solvents and how their use affects both acid gas components' absorption and the energy price of the process. Since both MDEA and TEA are tertiary amines, this article is more concerned with the reaction mechanism associating these types of solvents.

40|$|Owing {{to recent}} strict legislation, {{environmental}} impact of combustion processes is nowadays {{one of the most}} important problems involving both scientific community and burner manufacturers. In the case of natural gas combustion, nitric oxides (NOx) reduction is the most critical aim to achieve, often requesting for industrial applications heavy and highcost <b>plant</b> <b>revamping</b> (for instance, adoption of low-NOx burners or burned gases de-NOx treatment). Moreover, although NOx formation mechanisms are today quite understood, many unsolved questions are connected to the interaction between fluid dynamic and chemistry inside the burner device and this makes the CFD codes not yet fully predictive. This paper presents the results obtained for pollutant emissions (nitric oxides and carbon monoxide) upon two different natural gas burner typologies: a swirl burner equipped with two different fuel injectors (co-axial or transverse with respect to the rotating air stream) and a premixed burner with a flame generated downstream a metallic grid. The analysis has been carried out varying the operating conditions of the devices (equivalence ratio, swirl number) ...|$|E

40|$|Case StudyA {{modification}} of seven 560 hp vertical-turbine pumps {{was carried out}} with outstanding results to improve their actual capacity. The installation was limited to 64 % of its rated capacity, which was never reached, and the operating demand required to maintain all seven pumps in continuous service. Reliability of the pumps was additionally impaired by severe cavitation damage of impellers. A <b>plant</b> <b>revamp</b> required increased and reliable cooling water flow, with a limited time frame of seven months for full implementation. Original cast iron impellers were reverse engineered and manufactured oversize in 18 Cr- 16 Mn steel. Bowls were modified for the larger impellers. Performance for all pumps was adjusted in a test stand and the efficiency improved not to exceed the rated horsepower of installed electric motors. As a result, {{the capacity of the}} installation reached its rated value. Operation was optimized with six pumps in operation and one in standby feeding 33 % more water. After 26 months in service, none of the pumps had shown capacity drop or required maintenance beyond repacking. Significant savings were attained compared to the installation of new pumps...|$|R
40|$|In {{chemical}} engineering, absorption {{processes are}} used in many cases {{for the purpose of}} selective separation of one or more gas components from a multicomponent gas stream. Compared to adsorption, which uses large solid surfaces, absorption has one main advantage: i. e. a countercurrent flow of both gas stream and scrubbing liquid can be obtained easily. Thus the gas loaded liquid leaving the absorption column can directly be recycled in a desorber and used for absorption again in a continuous process. For this reason absorption processes are very widespread in industry. Absorption uses the effect that gases are soluble in liquids. Different interactions between the soluble gases and solvent components lead to different solubilities and selectivities. E. g. polar gases dissolve very well in polar solvents but non-polar gases do not. Some scrubbing liquids contain agents, which react chemically with {{one or more of the}} dissolved gas components. A process using these kinds of agents is called "chemical absorption". Because dissolved gases are partially transformed to reaction products the capacity of the solvent for these reacting components is increased significantly. Thus in chemical absorption processes, typically a high selectivity is observed. So chemical absorptions are used frequently for many kinds of industrial purposes. Aqueous alkanolamine solutions are well suited for the selective absorption of sour gases like hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. Alkanolamines are mainly used to clean fuel gas or synthesis gas. The most important field for the application of alkanolamines is the purification of natural gas. In case of using the alkanolamine of type N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) the absorption of carbon dioxide is strongly hindered owing to a slow chemical reaction. So, MDEA is an alkanolamine especially suited for the selective removal of hydrogen sulfide from gases where the co-absorption of carbon dioxide is not economical. This is a constraint for many industrial applications. To project and optimise a chemical process effectively, the use of a mathematical simulation model is a reasonable tool. Such a simulation model helps in building a <b>plant,</b> <b>revamping</b> an existing one or calculating how an existing plant should be operated if process constraints have to be changed. In most absorption processes fast changes in composition or gas flow are quite rare. Hence for the reason of planning or optimization of absorption plants stationary process models are adequate. Equilibrium models are well known and often used in process simulation. But the use of equilibrium models is only sensible for processes, where the state variables do not differ much compared to those in case of the thermodynamic equilibrium. On the other hand for processes, where strong kinetic effects hinder the system's way to equilibrium, the classic equilibrium model fails. A special kind of these processes is the sour gas absorption with aqueous MDEA solutions, which is the example process used in this work. Because of the fast development of computer performance in the last years, the application of highly complex models is now possible. For the purpose of process simulation of a reactive separation process, the use of models with different degrees of complexity can be adequate. Usually, complex models will take more time for computing and have more difficulties in achieving the convergence. Thus the quest for a simple model, which gives good prediction, is extremely important. All the included correlations for the properties of the occurring fluids, apparatus and kinetic effects show a significant influence on the simulation results. For a proper comparison of different process models the use of exact identical correlations and properties of substances are essential. In this work, different complex process models for sour gas absorption with MDEA solutions are shown and used for simulation of plants, for which complete sets of experimental data are available. For the purpose of validation the simulation results with experimental data have to be compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of the ethylene and/or propylene refrigerant compressors and their steam turbine drives is often {{one of the major}} cost components in the <b>revamp</b> of ethylene <b>plants.</b> The chosen increase in plant capacity may require new, larger compressor casings and/or new compressor foundations. In some cases, the {{replacement of}} compressor casing and compressor foundation work can be avoided by including a thorough evaluation of process heat integration and equipment performance during the revamp feasibility study, and by involving the compressor and turbine vendors early on in the study. A process heat integration study (Pinch Analysis) can help identify process design changes that reduce refrigerant compressor shaft-work power, i. e. stage volumetric flowrates. Equipment performance analysis defines actual capability of heat exchangers, compressors, turbines and distillation columns. This information can then be used to decide how best to change plant operating conditions and where best to invest capital in revamped or new equipment. Compressor vendors can provide information on the stage volumetric flowrate limits and the most suitable inter-stage operating pressures to minimize machine modifications. Interaction and iteration between the process consultant and vendors can result in an optimal final 2 process design that avoids expensive {{replacement of the}} refrigerant compressors and minimizes driver revamp costs. This paper describes a recent ethylene <b>plant</b> <b>revamp</b> where ethylene producer, consultant and vendors worked together during the feasibility study to change the original design, and establish new process operating conditions that avoided replacing the ethylene and propylene compressors...|$|R
40|$|The Lethal Yellowing Disease locally {{referred}} to as the “Cape St Paul Wilt Disease ” {{is the single most important}} disease that has devastated several hectares of coconut plantations in Ghana. Two decades of coconut screening for tolerant planting material has identified the Sri Lankan Green Dwarf crossed Vanuatu Tall (SGD x VTT) coconut hybrid as the most promising planting material in the context of disease. To provide farmers with planting material that has high dis-ease tolerance and also good agronomic characteristics, the study compared some basic traits of the coconut hybrid with other important coconut varieties with the objective of determining the suitability of the SGD x VTT as alternative <b>planting</b> material to <b>revamp</b> the coconut industry in Ghana. Mean sample size of 25 palms per coconut variety under the study was analyzed us-ing two sample t-test procedure. The study indicated that the yield performance of the SGD x VTT coconut hybrid was better than the tall coconut types including the local West African Tall (WAT) and compared favourably with the Malayan Yellow Dwarf crossed Vanuatu Tall (MYD x VTT) coconut hybrid.

The analysis reveals that the revamped case can be further improved to achieve more energy saving. This is done by applying one of the golden rules in pinch analysis, which is not to transfer heat across the pinch.

40|$|Anywhere liquid {{pressure}} is reduced across a throttling device, {{there is a}} potential application for a hydraulic power recovery motor (HPRM). Cost of power makes HPRM's attractive with recoveries as small as 25 hp on a continuous basis. When incorporated into new <b>plants,</b> expansions, or <b>revamps,</b> payback can occur in as little as six months. When adapted to existing installations, payback may require 12 to 18 months depending on the extent of new hardware necessary. Because it is a positive displacement device, the HPRM torque and speed are almost completely independent - unlike hydraulic power recovery turbines (centrifugal motors). Three screw HPRM's have low moments of inertia, operate at low vibration and noise levels and extract power in the 70 - 85 % efficiency range. Output power levels to 600 hp and differential pressures to 2500 psi are possible. A primary application for the HPRM is driving process pumps. Where a full capacity process pump is used, an HPRM can through-drive it augmenting the primary driver and reducing power requirements by Higher speed special designs also are available 75 %...|$|R

40|$|Oil {{industry}} is continuously evolving chasing the fast {{development of the}} contrasting requirements of modern life. From one side, it tries to satisfy the growing energy demand adopting its production to provide the energy resources requred by the market while considering {{at the same time}} the increasing pressure to the environmental protection. For this reason, the increasing demand for diesel fuels coupled with the progressive tightening of environmental specifications has brought new emphasis on the research on gasoil production. Worldwide refineries, also in consideration of the varyng quality of the feedstock, are tryng to optimaze the current process operation to maximize the utilization of the available sources. Depending of the specific constraints, this is realizable through the construction of the new <b>plants</b> or the <b>revamp</b> of pre-existing units coupled to the utilization of state of the art catalysts. In any case, optimization of operating conditions is crucial. In this context, this thesis proposes a phenomenological model that could be used to optimize the operating conditions of hydroprocessing plants that, due to their hydrogenation, hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation reactions, are the refinery plants devoted to the improvement of gasoil quality. In this way the optimization of the process can always guarantee the satisfaction of more critical specifications...|$|R
40|$|When first {{received}} by a refinery, the crude oil usually contains some water, mineral salts, and sediments. The salt appears in different forms, most often times it is dissolved {{in the formation}} water {{that comes with the}} crude i. e. in brine form, but it could also be present as solid crystals, water-insoluble particles of corrosion products or scale and metal-organic compounds such as prophyrins and naphthenates. The amount of salt in the crude can vary typically between 5 to 200 PTB depending on the crude source, API, viscosity and other properties of the crude. For the following reasons, it is of utmost importance {{to reduce the amount of}} salt in the crude before processing the crude in the Crude Distillation Unit and consequently downstream processing units of a refinery. 1. Salt causes corrosion in the equipment. 2. Salt fouls inside the equipment. The fouling problem not only negatively impacts the heat transfer rates in the exchangers and furnace tubes but also affects the hydraulics of the system by increasing the pressure drops and hence requiring more pumping power to the system. Salt also plugs the fractionator trays and causes reduced mass transfer i. e. reduced separation efficiency and therefore need for increased re-boiler/condenser duties. 3. The salt in the crude usually has a source of metallic compounds, which could cause poisoning of catalyst in hydrotreating and other refinery units. Until a few years ago, salt concentrations as high as 10 PTB (1 PTB = 1 lb salt per 1000 bbl crude) was acceptable for desalted crude; However, most of the refineries have adopted more stringent measures for salt content and recent specs only allow 1 PTB in the desalted crude. This would require many existing refineries to improve their desalting units to achieve the tighter salt spec. This study will focus on optimizing the salt removal efficiency of a desalting unit which currently has an existing single-stage desalter. By adding a second stage desalter, the required salt spec in the desalted crude will be met. Also, focus will be on improving the heat integration of the desalting process, and optimization of the desalting temperature to achieve the best operating conditions in the <b>plant</b> after <b>revamp.</b> 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|Dusts {{removal from}} gaseous streams {{is a very}} common {{operation}} carried out {{in a number of}} industrial plants, e. g. those ones dedicated to the manufacturing of cement and steel, {{in order to meet the}} more increasingly stringent law requirements. Therefore, in the last decades, such industries have been to face more and more often the necessity to improve their de-dusting systems inspired by the principle of the “maximum safety technologically feasible”, but also pushed by the increased penetration of environmental issues into the public opinion. Unfortunately, the budget dedicated for all these improvements is often very low because de-dusting is, in the major part of the practical cases, an operation having a low influence on production performances; therefore it is seen more as a “necessary cost” than a profit generator. The unavoidable consequence is that plant managers investments are dedicated to other more fruitful processes than de-dusting, addressing the low budget available for gas stream purification to the so-called revamping strategies: that is, the reuse of existing de-dusting plants, either by enhancing their efficiencies through the use of various technical tricks or by adding another pieces of equipment, rather than install new and more technologically advanced plants. This solution is considered very interesting in terms of profit since the costs for the decommissioning of the obsolete equipments does not exist (in fact the old plant remains). Obviously, all the economic benefits derived from these strategies are counterbalanced by a series of technical disadvantages. In particular, a systematic risk assessment of safety of the whole new configuration of the <b>revamped</b> <b>plant</b> is necessary. In fact such an evaluation can not be limited to a safe design of the new installed equipment, but it has to be extended to the already existing equipment also considering the impact that changes in process conditions (induced by the new equipment) can have on the whole plant. In this work, the relevant problem of an explosion in the de-dusting section of a cement plant, due to the establishment of an overpressure inside the apparatus, has been considered. Particularly, using fault tree analysis, it has been evaluated the changing in the overall risk (considering, for simplicity, one year of mission time) of explosion referring to a hybrid-like collector realized by introducing a Fabric Filter (FF) downstream with respect to an Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP). Results have shown that a chain of failures in the FF section may affect relevantly the explosion risk in the collector leading to the unavoidable need for the introduction of mitigation actions into the system...|$|R
