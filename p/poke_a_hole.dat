40|$|Objective: We here {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} bilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions, a rat model for Parkinson's disease (PD), on impulsivity and attention in an auditory oddball paradigm. In PD, the progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra leads to disturbed motor function, but cognitive disturbances, including attentional deficits and impulsivity, are increasingly recognized as disabling factors. Rats with 6 -OHDA induced nigrostriatal lesions of dopamine neurons show significant motor impairment reminiscent of PD, and recent studies also indicate cognitive impairment in this model. Methods: Rats were trained in a 3 -class auditory oddball paradigm, where they had to nose <b>poke</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> after an infrequent correct tone, which was rewarded by a pellet, but to ignore a frequent standard tone and infrequent distractor tone. After reaching a criterion of 90 % correct hits, retrograde degeneration of DA neurons in the substantia nigra were induced by bilateral striatal injection of 6 -OHDA (10 μg in 1 μl PBS; n= 12), sham-lesioned rats (controls; n= 8) received vehicle. Four weeks after surgery the rats were re-tested in the oddball paradigm. Results: After 6 -OHDA lesions, rats show deteriorated attention, as indicated by {{a significant decrease in}} the hit rate to the correct tone. Additionally, the number of impulsive nose pokes was reduced compared to controls, which would indicate less impulsive behavior. Conclusion: We conclude that rats with bilateral 6 -OHDA lesions may be used to investigate the biological basis of attentional deficits in PD, and to develop and test new therapeutic strategies for these symptoms ranging from pharmacological treatment to neurosurgical intervention...|$|E

The restoration effort began in the mid-1950s when he <b>poked</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> in the ceiling and felt the molding, spurring his desire {{to see what was}} underneath. The ceiling was removed and the room was restored and then it moved to the next room. Avery removed plaster off the fireplaces, replaced the wide floor boards and replicated the wainscotting. Upon Amos Avery's death in July 1998, aged 96, the house passed to his oldest son Edward.

The trial court found the defendant guilty of larceny for the rum and arson for the ship. The Court for Crown Cases Reserved reversed based on jury instructions that allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty of the arson even if they found that he only had intent to commit the larceny. The court held that the intent to commit the larceny did not necessarily mean that the defendant had the intent to commit the arson, so the jury instructions were improper.|$|R

Rahner had accidentally killed Axel Vigg, so he made Vigg's death look like a suicide and then took any evidence of foul play from Leupolz's apartment. The drawstring on the trash bag containing the evidence is tied in a way similar to the knots on the shoes Dr. Rahner wears. Although Rahner is angered by Monk's claims, Monk explains that when you have six fingers on your right hand, you can't find a perfect set of gloves. Rahner <b>poked</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> in one of the gloves he used in the murder to fit his extra finger in, and then he cut off a finger from another glove to cover it. Even more so, using the pillow as a silencer caused Dr. Rahner to get feathers all over his clothes.

Eiko, who is [...] "determined to take from men and give nothing in return", reacts to his love by being reticent. One night while sailing on Tatsuya's boat, the couple makes passionate love, activating Eiko's love for him. After this, Eiko becomes devoted to him, resulting in her being jealous of his other casual relationships, and Tatsuya starts taking advantage of this to be cruel to her. One day while sailing with friends, Tatsuya takes the virginity of a university student while Eiko has sex with Tatsuya's brother Michihisa. Michihisa informs Tatsuya that he will [...] "take over" [...] Eiko for him because she doesn't love him anymore, and Tatsuya sells her to him for five thousand yen. When Eiko discovers this arrangement, she pays the money back to Michihisa, and again when Tatsuya renews it, resulting in her paying twenty thousand yen in total. After a few months, Eiko meets Tatsuya to inform him that she is pregnant with his baby, and he tells her on a whim {{that it is not a}} bad idea to have a baby. However, after seeing a newspaper picture of a boxer holding a baby, he changes his mind and tells her to have an abortion.

50|$|Although {{the device}} can provide some useful data {{on its own}} (positions of charted objects, {{distances}} and bearings between points), in practice it is invariably linked to a source of position data such as GPS. This enables many useful features, {{the most important of}} which is the fixing on the chart of the vessel's current position. In position mode, four illuminated arrows around a transparent area on the mouse are used. The device is pushed across the chart, following the arrows, until all four of them are extinguished. This indicates that the mouse is directly over the vessel's current position on the chart; if required, a pencil can be <b>poked</b> through <b>a</b> small <b>hole</b> to mark the fix on the chart.

40|$|Wireless mesh {{networks}} promise cheap Internet access, easy deployment, {{and extended}} range. In their current form, however, these networks suffer from both limited throughput and low reliability; hence they cannot {{meet the demands}} of applications such as file sharing, high definition video, and gaming. Motivated by these problems, we explore an alternative design that addresses these challenges. This dissertation presents a network coded architecture that significantly improves throughput and reliability. It makes a simple yet fundamental switch in network design: instead of routers just storing and forwarding received packets, they mix (or code) packets' content before forwarding. We show through practical systems how routers can exploit this new functionality to harness the intrinsic characteristics of the wireless medium to improve performance. We develop three systems; each reveals a different benefit of our network coded design. COPE observes that wireless broadcast naturally creates an overlap in packets received across routers, and develops a new network coding algorithm to exploit this overlap to deliver the same data in fewer transmissions, thereby improving throughput. ANC pushes network coding to the signal level, showing how to exploit strategic interference to correctly deliver data from concurrent senders, further increasing throughput. Finally, MIXIT presents a symbol-level network code that exploits wireless spatial diversity, forwarding correct symbols even if they are contained in corrupted packets to provide high throughput reliable transfers. The contributions of this dissertation are multifold. First, it builds a strong connection between the theory of network coding and wireless system design. Specifically, the systems presented in this dissertation were the first to show that network coding can be cleanly integrated into the wireless network stack to deliver practical and measurable gains. The work also presents novel algorithms that enrich the theory of network coding, extending it to operate over multiple unicast flows, analog signals, and soft-information. (cont.) Second, we present prototype implementations and testbed evaluations of our systems. Our results show that network coding delivers large performance gains ranging from a few percent to several-fold depending on the traffic mix and the topology. Finally, this work makes a clear departure from conventional network design. Research in wireless networks has largely proceeded in isolation, with the electrical engineers focusing on the physical and lower layers, while the computer scientists worked up from the network layer, with the packet being the only interface. This dissertation <b>pokes</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> in this contract, disposing of artificial abstractions such as indivisible packets and point-to-point links in favor of a more natural abstraction that allows the network and the lower layers to collaborate on the common objectives of improving throughput and reliability using network coding as the building block. At the same time, the design maintains desirable properties such as being distributed, low-complexity, implementable, and integrable {{with the rest of the}} network stack. by Sachin Rajsekhar Katti.
