500|$|In 1990, Roderick Spencer and Selwyn Tillett {{discovered}} the ballet from Act II of Thespis. Two {{of the five}} movements, in the same hand that had copied the score of [...] "Climbing over rocky mountain", were found together with the surviving <b>performance</b> <b>materials</b> for Sullivan's 1864 ballet, L'Île Enchantée. Another section {{was found in the}} material for his 1897 ballet, Victoria and Merrie England. The page numbering of the surviving three sections gave approximate lengths for the missing pieces, and a contemporary engraving, seen at left, along with other circumstantial evidence, allowed plausible identifications of the two remaining movements: a dragon costume, used nowhere in the libretto, is presumably from the ballet, and the harp visible in the orchestra pit was an unusual instrument for the Gaiety's orchestra. Movements of appropriate length that made sense of these oddities were found in Sullivan's other ballets, and the reconstructed ballet has been recorded twice on CD.|$|E
