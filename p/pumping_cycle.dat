Pulsatile VADs use positive displacement pumps.

40|$|AbstractTransient {{performance}} of a cascade heat pump system is experimentally investigated. The cascade heat pump consists of 4 systems: the chilled water system, the low-temperature refrigeration cycle using R 22, the high-temperature heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> using R 134 a and the hot water system. The cascade heat pump produces both chilled water for cooling application and hot water for heating application. A transient performance is observed when the hot water system is in a closed-loop operation. As the hot water temperature increases, the condensing pressure of the heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> also increases but the other refrigerant pressures have marginal changes. The operation of the test rig is terminated when the condensing pressure reaches the limit of the system. The condensing pressure at high hot water flow rate increases at a lower rate than that in case of the low hot water flow rate, so the working period is higher. The compressor power of the heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> increases continuously with time whereas the compressor power of the refrigeration cycle is almost constant. The condensation heat and cooling load rapidly increase at the beginning, and the condensation heat gradually increases whereas the cooling load is almost constant. The COP of the heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> gradually decreases with time after the rapid increase at the beginning, but the COP of the refrigeration cycle is almost constant. It can be concluded that the variation of the condensing pressure of the heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> with time has a little influences to the refrigeration cycle. By comparing {{the high and low}} hot water flow rate, the COP of the heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> and the final hot water temperature in the storage tank are higher whereas the others are the same...|$|R

50|$|Most {{residues}} {{participating in}} the trimerization are not conserved in bacteriorhodopsin, a homologous protein capable of forming a trimeric structure {{in the absence of}} bacterioruberin. Despite a large alteration in the amino acid sequence, the shape of the intratrimer hydrophobic space filled by lipids is highly conserved between archaerhodopsin-2 and bacteriorhodopsin. Since a transmembrane helix facing this space undergoes a large conformational change during the proton <b>pumping</b> <b>cycle,</b> it is feasible that trimerization is an important strategy to capture special lipid components that are relevant to the protein activity.|$|E
40|$|An {{irreversible}} universal {{steady flow}} heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> model with variable-temperature heat reservoirs and the losses of heat-resistance and internal irreversibility is established {{by using the}} theory of finite time thermodynamics. The universal heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> model consists of two heat-absorbing branches, two heat-releasing branches and two adiabatic branches. Expressions of heating load, coefficient of performance (COP) and profit rate of the universal heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> model are derived, respectively. By means of numerical calculations, heat conductance distributions between hot- and cold-side heat exchangers are optimized by taking the maximum profit rate as objective. There exist an optimal heat conductance distribution and an optimal thermal capacity rate matching between the working fluid and heat reservoirs which lead to a double maximum profit rate. The effects of internal irreversibility, total heat exchanger inventory, thermal capacity rate of the working fluid and heat capacity ratio of the heat reservoirs on the optimal finite time exergoeconomic performance of the cycle are discussed in detail. The results obtained herein include the optimal finite time exergoeconomic performances of endoreversible and irreversible, constant- and variable-temperature heat reservoir Brayton, Otto, Diesel, Atkinson, Dual, Miller and Carnot heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} circulation composition in a heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> for considering the effect of its difference from the charged composition on the cycle performance prediction. The experiment was conducted with a vapor compression heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> using a compressor developed for R 410 A. The tested refrigerants are R 1234 ze(E) /R 32 (20 / 80 mass%) ，R 1234 ze(E) /R 32 (50 / 50 mass%), and R 1234 ze(E) /R 32 (80 / 20 mass%). Compared with the charged composition, the measured mass fraction of the more volatile component R 1234 ze(E) increases at inlet of the expansion valve. When the difference between vapor and liquid composition is large in the two-phase flow, the difference between circulation and changed composition {{is large enough to}} affect the COP evaluation. The circulation composition depends on the velocity ratio of vapor and liquid, the operating pressure of heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle,</b> and the degree of subcool at condenser outlet...|$|R

50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the pump's inlet port. As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the pump's inlet to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the pumping chamber and inlet port is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the discharge port again and the <b>pumping</b> <b>cycle</b> starts over.|$|E
50|$|Inductive {{pumps are}} {{considered}} highly accurate and energy efficient. Inductive pumps use two primary parameters to control flow, they are Rate and Dwell. Rate {{is used to}} determine the number of strokes per second or in any given time interval. Dwell is used to control the length of time the energizing coil remains on during the Rate cycle. Essentially if the piston has completed its stroke and is waiting for the reverse cycle to occur, {{there is no need to}} continue energizing the coil as most of this energy will be converted to heat as no more work is being done by the piston. The Dwell setting allows adjustment of this ON time during the rate cycle. Also the Dwell setting allows for a true pressure control parameter for the pump. By reducing the Dwell time even further one can reduce the total energy applied to the piston during the <b>pumping</b> <b>cycle.</b> This can reduce the maximum output pressure during pumping. This differs from many other pumps as they commonly reduce flow to reduce pressure in a given circumstance, however if an occlusion occurs to the output channel other pumps tend to build up to their maximum pressure until they either burst the tubing or damage their internal mechanism. Inductive pumps can be shut off at the outlet and will not exceed the pressure they are set at. Pumping against a close output does not cause damage to the pump.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} the {{antimycotic}} drug clotrimazole (CLT) on the Na,K-ATPase was investigated using fluorescence and electrical measurements. The results obtained by steady-state fluorescence experiments with the electrochromic styryl dye RH 421 were combined with those achieved by a pre-steady-state method based on fast solution exchange on a solid supported membrane that adsorbs the protein. Both techniques are suitable for monitoring the electrogenic steps of the <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> and are in general complementary, yielding distinct kinetic information. The experiments show clearly that CLT affects specific partial reactions of the <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> of the Na,K-ATPase with an affinity in the low micromolar range and in a reversible manner.

40|$|The voltage {{dependence}} of steady and transient changes in Na+/K+ pump current, {{in response to}} step changes in membrane potential, was investigated in guinea pig ventricular myocytes voltage clamped and internally dialyzed under experimental conditions designed to support four separate modes of Na+/K+ pump activity. Voltage jumps elicited transient pump currents when the <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> was running forward or backward, or when pumps were limited to Na+ translocation, but not when they were made to carry out K+/K+ exchange. This result indicates that K+ translocation involves no net charge movement across the membrane field and is therefore voltage insensitive. The transient pump currents seen during Na+/K+ transport demonstrate that both forward and reverse <b>pump</b> <b>cycles</b> are rate limited not by the voltage-dependent step but by a voltage-independent step, probably K+ translocation.

Here, we report the analogous fractional quantization of the spin transport in a topological spin pump realized in a one-dimensional lattice via a periodically modulated Zeeman field. In the proposed model, which is a spinfull generalization of the Harper-Hofstadter model, the amount of spin current pumped during well-defined fractions of the <b>pumping</b> <b>cycle</b> is quantized as fractions of the spin Chern number.

40|$|In {{this report}} {{different}} air-water heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycles</b> under the operating {{conditions of the}} retrofit market and in the low heating power range are examined. The already existing heat pump models show excessive power and efficiency loss at very low ambient temperatures. Due to the variations of the source temperatures the heat pump system has to be improved over a relatively wide application range. The existing perfomances are insufficient and new solutions have to be found. The introduction of a supplementary compressor, {{as well as the}} efficient use of the liquid subcooling are two examples, which will determine the selection of the cycles (see pages 4 - 7). By simulation of the suggested cycles, like the heat pump with the auxiliary liquid subcooling cycle, as well as the two stage cycles (with intermediate expansion or intermediate injection) it can be shown that these cylces operate with an improved seasonal coefficient of performance up to 10 % - 15 % (see table 4. 4). Heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycles</b> with more than one compressor permit a better adjustment of the heat output. The seasonal coefficient of performance of these heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycles</b> is calculated with the temperature distribution of the climate in Zurich and a given heat curve. The cycle components are simulated on a purely theoretical base, {{with the exception of the}} compressors characteristics and inlcuding the real heat output from the heat <b>pump.</b> The <b>cycles</b> are calculated with pure refrigerant and with zeotropic mixtures. The results with propane show equivalent seasonal coefficients of performance on all suggested <b>cycles.</b> The heat <b>pump</b> <b>cycle</b> with liquid subcooling shows good performance in the middle range of the air temperatures. The main compressor will then work at its best conditions. At low external temperatures the two-stage cycles with two serial connected compressors, show very good performance. And at low temperature differences between the air and the heating water single-stage heat pump are the best with the actual compressor types. With zeotropic refrigerant mixtures (R 407 C, R 290 /R 600 a), the advantages of the proposed cycle with liquid subcooling in the condensing part are not significant and the losses, due to the low performance of the auxiliar compressor. will lower the coefficient of performance under the level of the other two-stage cycles (see table 4. 3). The simulation results show that several solutions can be considered for this application. An evaluation of the costs and the resulting technical problems can only be mentioned at this time...|$|R
