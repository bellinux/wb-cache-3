40|$|Resistance welding is used very {{extensively}} in industry {{for a wide}} range of applications. Knowledge and measurement of the dynamic characteristics of resistance welding equipment is important in the design of the equipment and in optimization of welding procedures using finite element software. This is especially true for <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> where accurate measurements of effective lumped mass and damping of the welding head as well as its maximal acceleration and velocity are required for accurate modelling. This thesis describes a new concept where a mechanical model of the welding head is used together with the imposition of a mechanical load step function with simultaneous measurement of resulting head motion to calculate effective lumped mass and damping factor. Two test systems were devised to implement the step function. In the “free fracture test”, a metal or ceramic bar is loaded to its breaking point and resulting welding head velocity is measured. This data allows accurate calculation of machine parameters. The second test uses the explosion of a small metallic element to impose a step function, when the welding current causes the metallic element to explode. The final version of this test “the exploding button test” uses a small cylindrical element fabricated from welding filler wire, with the advantage that both button geometry and material can be controlled. The exploding button test has proved to be very effective, can easily be used for in-situ measurements and avoids the vibrations associated with the free fracture test. These test were applied to evaluate a range of resistance <b>welding</b> <b>machines.</b> Finally, an innovative projection geometry was developed to significantly increase <b>projection</b> <b>weld</b> quality and this design has now been used {{extensively in}} industry. The techniques developed in this thesis have been shown to be practical and effective and have enabled much better understanding of machine kinematics. The measurements provide essential data for modelling of <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> and in guiding the development of resistance <b>welding</b> <b>machines</b> and procedures.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Projection</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{variation}} of electric resistance welding with the dynamic changes of the flow paths for heat and electrical properties with changing temperature caused by the large plastic deformation with collapse of projection. The common standards of <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> are AWS, IIW and Harris & Riley which have been established and in use for some time. All these standards have the slots located under the projection.

This fitting has built-in conductive plastics that are used to weld the joint together as a heating element. In order to explain the mechanism of the new machine, 1) the resistance characteristics of the heating element were explained, 2) the method of electric welding that uses the electrofusion fitting was described, and 3) the method of power supply based on controlling the firing angle was explained. A control system for an intelligent electrofusion <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> was proposed. This system has the ability to recognize the diameter of an electrofusion fitting using a lookup-table based on the difference of resistance curves according to fitting types, and it is able to weld the fittings regardless of the ambient temperature.
