50|$|Even {{though the}} drugs {{have a similar}} {{mechanism}} of action, there are subtle differences between acarbose and miglitol. Acarbose is an oligosaccharide, whereas miglitol resembles a monosaccharide. Miglitol is fairly well absorbed by the body, as opposed to acarbose. Moreover, acarbose inhibits <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> in addition to alpha-glucosidase.|$|E
50|$|Acarbose {{inhibits}} enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) {{needed to}} digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha-glucosidase enzymes {{in the brush}} border of the small intestines, and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase.</b> <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level. This reduction averages an absolute decrease of 0.7%, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies.|$|E

METHODS [...] The activity and proteins of pancreatic enzymes (<b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase,</b> lipase, trypsin/trypsinogen) in hepatic bile were investigated using biochemical and western blot analyses in 25 patients with extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. Immunolocalization of enzyme proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 20 necropsy livers with extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. RESULTS [...] Western blot analysis showed proteins of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase,</b> lipase, and trypsin in 19 of 25 (76 %), 10 of 25 (40 %), and 14 of 25 (56 %) patients, respectively. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> and lipase activities was present in every bile specimen. Radioimmunoassay showed that trypsin was present in every bile sample. Immunohistochemically, the immunoreactivity of the three enzymes was present in epithelia and in the lumina of intrahepatic large bile ducts, septal bile ducts, and peribiliary glands in all cases. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results strongly suggest that biliary epithelia of larger intrahepatic ducts produce <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase,</b> lipase, and trypsin, and that these enzymes are secreted into the lumina of intrahepatic bile ducts...|$|E

The use of carbohydrate digestive enzyme inhibitors from natural resources could be a possible strategy to block dietary carbohydrate absorption with less adverse effects than synthetic drugs. Areas covered: This review covers the latest evidence regarding in vitro and in vivo studies in relation to <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> inhibitors of plant origin, and presents bioactive compounds of phenolic nature that exhibit anti-amylase activity. Expert opinion: <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> inhibitors from traditional plant extracts are a promising tool for diabetes treatment. Many studies have confirmed the alpha-amylase inhibitory activity of plants and their bioactive compounds in vitro, but few studies corroborate these findings in rodents and very few in humans.

In order to find compounds that would be effective amylase inhibitors, in vitro and in vivo models are usually used. The accuracy of models is limited, but these tools are nonetheless valuable. In vitro models {{could be used in}} large screenings involving thousands of chemicals that are tested to find potential lead compounds. In vivo models are still used as preliminary mean of testing compounds behavior in the whole organism. In the case of alpha-amylase inhibitors, both rats and rabbits could be chosen as in vivo models. The question was which animal could present more accuracy with regard to its <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase.</b> Results As there is no crystal structure of these enzymes, a molecular modeling study was done in order to compare the rabbit and rat enzymes with the human one. The overall result is that rabbit enzyme could probably be a better choice in this regard, {{but in the case of}} large ligands, which could make putative interactions with the − 4 subsite of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase,</b> interpretation of results should be made cautiously.

The susceptibilities to enzyme hydrolysis varied among the starches. The rate and extent of hydrolysis of amylomaize- 5 and amylomaize- 7 into glucose were greater than for other starches.

40|$|The {{structure}} of human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> {{has been determined}} to 1. 8 A resolution using X-ray diffraction techniques. This enzyme {{is found to be}} composed of three structural domains. The largest is Domain A (residues 1 - 99, 169 - 404), which forms a central eight-stranded parallel beta-barrel, to one end of which are located the active site residues Asp 197, Glu 233, and Asp 300. Also found in this vicinity is a bound chloride ion that forms ligand interactions to Arg 195, Asn 298, and Arg 337. Domain B is the smallest (residues 100 - 168) and serves to form a calcium binding site {{against the wall of the}} beta-barrel of Domain A. Protein groups making ligand interactions to this calcium include Asn 100, Arg 158, Asp 167, and His 201. Domain C (residues 405 - 496) is made up of anti-parallel beta-structure and is only loosely associated with Domains A and B. It is notable that the N-terminal glutamine residue of human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> undergoes a posttranslational modification to form a stable pyrrolidone derivative that may provide protection against other digestive enzymes. Structure-based comparisons of human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> with functionally related enzymes serve to emphasize three points. Firstly, despite this approach facilitating primary sequence alignments with respect to the numerous insertions and deletions present, overall there is only approximately 15 % sequence homology between the mammalian and fungal alpha-amylases. Secondly, in contrast, these same studies indicate that significant structural homology is present and of the order of approximately 70 %. Thirdly, the positioning of Domain C can vary considerably between alpha-amylases. In terms of the more closely related porcine enzyme, there are four regions of polypeptide chain (residues 237 - 250, 304 - 310, 346 - 354, and 458 - 461) with significantly different conformations from those in human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase.</b> At least two of these could play a role in observed differential substrate and cleavage pattern specificities between these enzymes.

Incubation with normal adult serum yielded twice as much glucose than incubation with cord serum. The degradation of zymosan could be mimicked by incubation with purified <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase.</b> A correlation was also found between the amount of oligosaccharides released from the particles during their incubation with serum and the concentration of amylase in the sera. The latter is low in newborns and increases several-fold, to nearly adult levels, at 3 - 6 months of age. Preincubation of zymosan with purified <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> resulted in an approximately 50 % increase in the binding of radioactive anti-C 3 c in the supernates obtained after subsequent incubation with cord serum but not with adult serum. With six of 24 cord sera, but not with adult serum, it also resulted in an augmentation of the chemiluminescence accompanying the phagocytosis of the particles after their opsonization.

When produced as recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, these active site binders appear to be potent enzyme inhibitors when tested in chromogenic assays. The low complexity of the antigen-binding site of these single-domain antibodies composed of only three loops could be valuable for designing smaller synthetic inhibitors...|$|E

The electron density map {{was established by}} multiple isomorphous replacement (m. i. r.; using 5 derivatives) and subsequent solvent-flattening at 2. 8 A resolution. The sequence was built into the well-defined regions of the m. i. r. map; this partial model was refined using a simulated annealing refinement method with phase restraints. Phase combination of m. i. r. phases and phases of the partial model allowed {{the completion of the}} model. The final refinement was based on 29, 838 independent reflections in the 8 to 2. 1 A resolution range. A final R-factor of 15. 6 % was obtained with a model obeying standard geometry within 0. 014 A in bond lengths and 2. 8 degrees in bond angles. The final model consists of all 496 amino acid residues, 1 calcium ion, 1 chloride ion and 353 water molecules. The model is described in detail; the calcium and chloride binding sites are characterized.

40|$|Despite a high {{capacity}} for secretion of homologous proteins, the secretion of heterologous proteins by Bacillus subtilis is frequently inefficient. In the present studies, we have investigated and compared bottlenecks in the secretion of four heterologous proteins: Bacillus lichenifomis alpha-amylase (AmyL), Escherichia coli TEM p-lactamase (Bla), human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> (HPA), and a lysozyme-specific single-chain antibody. The same expression and secretion signals {{were used for}} all four of these proteins. Notably, all identified bottlenecks relate to late stages in secretion, following translocation of the preproteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. These bottlenecks include processing by signal peptidase, passage through the cell wall, and degradation in the wall and growth medium. Strikingly, all translocated HPA was misfolded, its stability depending on the formation of disulfide bonds. This suggests that the disulfide bond oxidoreductases of B. subtilis cannot form the disulfide bonds in HPA correctly. As the secretion bottlenecks differed for each heterologous protein tested, it is anticipated that the efficient secretion of particular groups of heterologous proteins with the same secretion bottlenecks mill require the engineering of specifically optimized host strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{seeds of}} pea (Pisum sativum L.) contain several {{proteins}} in the albumin solubility fraction that are significant components of total cotyledonary protein (5 - 10 %) and are accumulated in developing seeds concurrently with storage-protein synthesis. One of these proteins, of low Mr and designated 'Psa LA', has been purified, characterized and sequenced. Psa LA has an Mr of 11000 and contains polypeptides of Mr 6000, {{suggesting that the}} protein molecules are dimeric. The amino acid sequence contains 54 residues, with a high content (10 / 54) of asparagine/aspartate. It has no inhibitory action towards trypsin or chymotrypsin, and is distinct from the inhibitors of those enzymes found in pea seeds, nor does it inhibit hog <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase.</b> The protein contains no methionine, but significant amounts of cysteine (four residues per polypeptide), suggesting a possible role as a sulphur storage protein. However, its sequence is not homologous with low-Mr (2 S) storage proteins from castor bean (Ricinus communis) or rape (Brassica napus). Psa LA therefore represents {{a new type of}} low-Mr seed protein...|$|E
40|$|Human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> (HPA) was {{expressed}} in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and two mutants (D 197 A and D 197 N) of a completely conserved active site carboxylic acid were generated. All recombinant proteins were shown by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to be glycosylated and the site of attachment was shown to be Asn 461 by peptide mapping in conjunction with ESI-MS. Treatment of these proteins with endoglycosidase F demonstrated that they contained a single N-linked oligosaccharide and yielded a protein product with a single N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), which could be crystallized. Solution of the crystal structure to a resolution of 2. 0 A confirmed {{the location of the}} glycosyl group as Asn 461 and showed that the recombinant protein had essentially the same conformation as the native enzyme. The kinetic parameters of the glycosylated and deglycosylated wild-type proteins were the same while the k(cat) /Km values for D 197 A and D 197 N were 10 (6) - 10 (7) times lower than the wild-type enzyme. The decreased k(cat) /Km values for the mutants confirm that D 197 plays {{a crucial role in the}} hydrolytic activity of HPA, presumably as the catalytic nucleophile...|$|E
