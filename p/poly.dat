5|$|California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (CPP, Cal <b>Poly</b> Pomona, or Cal <b>Poly)</b> is {{a public}} polytechnic {{university}} located in Pomona, California, United States. It {{is one of two}} polytechnics in the California State University system.|$|E
5|$|Cal <b>Poly</b> Pomona {{underwent}} further {{growth in}} the late 20th and early 21st centuries, {{with the construction of}} the CLA Building (soon to be demolished), academic facilities, expansion to the Cal <b>Poly</b> Pomona University Library and the addition of programs such as the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies, the I-Poly High School and the U.R. Bronco undergraduate research program. Under then-president J. Michael Ortiz, Cal <b>Poly</b> Pomona launched its first comprehensive capital campaign in fall of 2008 to increase its permanent endowment. Nevertheless, the negative economic effects caused by the late-2000s recession has increased student fees, reduced enrollment availability, eliminated two athletic programs and introduced a mandatory furlough calendar for most of its 47,000 employees.|$|E
5|$|During World War II most of {{the student}} body was called to active {{military}} duty, enrollment declined and the campus closed in 1943. Reopening after the war, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit operated in San Dimas until 1956 when it moved to Will Keith Kellogg’s former horse ranch in the neighboring city of Pomona, California. Acknowledging its Kellogg legacy, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit changed its name to Cal <b>Poly</b> Kellogg-Voorhis Unit and offered six programs in agriculture. The inaugural class of 1957 at the new campus consisted of 57 students graduating with bachelor’s degrees in a ceremony held at the Rose Garden in Pomona and religious services at Voorhis Chapel in San Dimas. Also in 1957, Cal <b>Poly</b> Kellogg-Voorhis introduced the College of Engineering, the second academic unit after the College of Agriculture. The California Master Plan for Higher Education added the two Cal <b>Poly</b> campuses to the new California State College system in 1961 and Cal <b>Poly</b> Kellogg-Voorhis Unit opened its doors {{for the first time to}} 329 female students. President McPhee retired in 1966, and Cal <b>Poly</b> split into two different and independent universities. The partnership between the two campuses remains with their involvement in the annual Cal <b>Poly</b> Universities Rose Float.|$|E
