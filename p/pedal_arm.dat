50|$|Automobile {{accelerator}} pedals {{have historically}} been mechanical assemblies which link the pedal to the engine throttle by mechanical linkages or a Bowden cable. With the advent of electronic throttle control, accelerator pedals consist of a spring-loaded <b>pedal</b> <b>arm</b> connected to an electronic transducer. This transducer, typically a potentiometer orHall effect sensor, converts {{the position of the}} <b>pedal</b> <b>arm</b> to an electronic signal which is sent to an electronic control unit (ECU).|$|E
40|$|Abst ract: During {{the whole}} vehicle design and {{development}} phase, the brake <b>pedal</b> <b>arm</b> strength {{is vital to}} vehicle drive control. In this paper, the original FEA model was built in Hypermesh and the strength analysis was operated based on ABAQUS Standard module. Because the 1 st stress result couldn’t match stress requirement, the brake <b>pedal</b> <b>arm</b> structure was optimized and recalculated again until it passed the design requirement. This analysis process may be applied in verifying the brake <b>pedal</b> <b>arm</b> strength of a new developing vehicle and guiding other parts ’ strength before the real experiments in the lab...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on brake pedal design of Formula Student vehicle. The first part of thesis {{is focused on}} main parts of car’s brake systems. Main goal of thesis is to determine value of pedal ratio to gain optimal operating force acting on pedal. Low weight and functionality of the pedal were important factors affecting the research. The design of <b>pedal</b> <b>arm</b> and its holder was checked by final element method and was redesigned according to results...|$|E
50|$|Typical {{applications}} are in fixing a crank to its crankshaft, as in a bicycle, or a piston rod to a crosshead, as in a steam engine. Note: {{the angle of}} the wedge determines the position of the parts being held, therefore on a bicycle the <b>pedal</b> <b>arms</b> will only be at 180 degrees to each other if {{the angle of the}} cotter pin's wedge is the same on both pins.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{crank sensor}} {{is used on}} {{bicycles}} to monitor {{the position of the}} crankset, usually for the cadence readout of a cyclocomputer. These are usually reed switches mounted on the bicycle frame with a corresponding magnet attached to one of the <b>pedal</b> crankset <b>arms.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this work, Concurrent Engineering (CE) {{approach}} {{has been used to}} determine the most optimum decision on design concept and material of the composite accelerator pedal at conceptual design stage. Comprehensive studies are carried out to prepare the design specifications of composite accelerator pedal. Various design concepts are generated using the Morphological approach. In particular at design stage, CATIA is used to generate various design concepts followed by analysis on ANSYS. Simultaneously, material selection is done on the basis of past research &amp; specifications. Rating/weighting matrix evaluation method is used to select the best concept for the profile of <b>pedal</b> <b>arm</b> on the basis of mass, volume, stress and deformation results achieved on ANSYS. The composite accelerator pedal is optimized and analyzed for safety parameters and finally prototyped using Selective Laser Sintering. The results reveals the feasibility of composite accelerator pedal with glass filled polyamide providing substantial weight saving and better properties than existing metallic pedal...|$|E
5000|$|Félix Rafael Cárdenas Ravalo (born November 24, 1973 in Encino, Santander) is a Colombian road bicycle racer, who rides for the Formesan amateur squad. He {{previously}} rode for UCI Professional Continental team [...] {{until the}} team's demise in 2009. In the 2001 Tour de France, Cardenas {{took one of}} the biggest victory of his career on the mountainous stage 12. He crossed the line solo in Ax-les-Thermes, with Roberto Laiseka and Lance Armstrong rounding the podium. He performed his trademark victory salute, standing on the <b>pedals</b> with <b>arms</b> raised high in the air.|$|R
50|$|The Rock {{climbing}} modification included {{simulations of}} blindness, deafness, lower limb paralysis, and implementing adaptive techniques to allow individuals with such disabilities to still {{participate in these}} activities through training of the recreation therapy specialists and modified equipment, modified harness and hoist for rock climbing example, or <b>arm</b> <b>pedals</b> instead of leg pedals for adaptive bicycling.|$|R
