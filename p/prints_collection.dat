50|$|Max Jakob Friedländer (5 July 1867, Berlin - 11 October 1958, Amsterdam) was a German curator and art historian. He was a {{specialist}} in Early Netherlandish painting and the Northern Renaissance, who volunteered at the Kupferstichkabinett or <b>prints</b> <b>collection</b> of the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin in 1891 under Friedrich Lippmann. On Lippmann's recommendation, Wilhelm von Bode took him on as his assistant in 1896 for the paintings division. He was appointed deputy director under Bode in 1904 and became director himself from 1924 to 1932, working on his history From Van Eyck to Bruegel and the 14-volume (printed in 16, with supplements) survey Early Netherlandish Painting. He also donated several works to the collection {{and worked in the}} art trade as an advisor, to Hermann Göring among others. He moved to Amsterdam in 1939. He attained the rank and title of geheimrat (privy councillor) under the German Empire.|$|E
50|$|Paper {{prints were}} the {{positive}} opaque copies of their transparent film negative source. Just like film wound {{on a film}} core, the paper print was also tightly wound in the same way. Most accounts of the paper <b>prints</b> <b>collection</b> never mention the chemical composition of the photographs, but archivists at Ohio State University who received one of the restoration printers used for the conversion project refer to these photographic prints as existing on bromide photographic paper. No specifications could {{be found on the}} composition of bromide paper of the time, but one manufacturer today is Kentmere. Their bromide paper “features a conventional double weight fiber-base, coated with a neutral tone bromide emulsion…Glossy unglazed surface only. The double weight paper is approximately 276 g/m² and a thickness of approximately 260 μm.” Photos of the paper on cores have a density that look very much like the films would, although there are no specifications on film of the time. Motion picture film was not standardized in the early years, and therefore, neither were their paper copies.|$|E
