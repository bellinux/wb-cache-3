Heinlein dedicated Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), a novel which explored sexual freedom as one of its primary themes. Moreover, Fire and the Night (1962) is a mainstream novel about an interracial romance; it features sociological and psychosexual twists. In Night of Light (1966), he devised an alien race where aliens have only one mother but several fathers, perhaps because of an unusual or untenable <b>physical</b> <b>position</b> that cannot be reached or continued by two individuals acting alone. Both Image of the Beast and the sequel Blown from 1968–1969 explore group sex, interplanetary travel, and interplay between fictional figures like Childe Harold and real people like Forry Ackerman.

40|$|The {{concurrent}} {{development of}} high-throughput genotyping platforms and {{next generation sequencing}} (NGS) has increased the number and density of genetic markers, the efficiency of constructing detailed linkage maps, and our ability to overlay recombination and physical maps of the genome. We developed an array for tomato with 8, 784 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) mainly discovered based on NGS-derived transcriptome sequences. Of the SNPs, 7, 720 (88 %) passed manufacturing quality control and could be scored in tomato germplasm. The array was used to generate high-density linkage maps for three interspecific F- 2 populations: EXPEN 2000 (Solanum lycopersicum LA 0925 x S. pennellii LA 0716, 79 individuals), EXPEN 2012 (S. lycopersicum Moneymaker x S. pennellii LA 0716, 160 individuals), and EXPIM 2012 (S. lycopersicum Moneymaker x S. pimpinellifolium LA 0121, 183 individuals). The EXPEN 2000 -SNP and EXPEN 2012 maps consisted of 3, 503 and 3, 687 markers representing 1, 076 and 1, 229 unique map positions (genetic bins), respectively. The EXPEN 2000 -SNP map had an average marker bin interval of 1. 6 cM, while the EXPEN 2012 map had an average bin interval of 0. 9 cM. The EXPIM 2012 map was constructed with 4, 491 markers (1, 358 bins) and an average bin interval of 0. 8 cM. All three linkage maps revealed an uneven distribution of markers across the genome. The dense EXPEN 2012 and EXPIM 2012 maps showed high levels of colinearity across all 12 chromosomes, and also revealed evidence of small inversions between LA 0716 and LA 0121. <b>Physical</b> <b>positions</b> of 7, 666 SNPs were identified relative to the tomato genome sequence. The genetic and <b>physical</b> <b>positions</b> were mostly consistent. Exceptions were observed for chromosomes 3, 10 and 12. Comparing genetic <b>positions</b> relative to <b>physical</b> <b>positions</b> revealed that genomic regions with high recombination rates {{were consistent with the}} known distribution of euchromatin across the 12 chromosomes, while very low recombination rates were observed in the heterochromatic regions...|$|R

This review included gramene accessions, number of genes/QTLs, their names, synonyms and symbols, the genetic populations {{in which they}} were mapped. Their donor’s parents as well as their genetic position and their co-localized markers in various mapping populations were also reported here. In the same way, <b>physical</b> <b>positions</b> were recorded if available (Supplementary data). The different genetic maps used were SSR Cornell 2000, RIL IR 64 x Azucena, DH IR 4 x Azucena, RIL Lemont x Tequin, RIL Zhenshan 97 x Minghui 63, JRGP RFLP 2000 Nipponbare x Kasalath, Cornell RFLP 2001 O. sativa x O. longistaminata, and the reference MSU 7. <b>Physical</b> <b>positions</b> of the cloned genes such as Xa 1, Xa 7, Xa 10, Xa 23, Xa 26, Xa 27, xa 5, xa 13 and xa 25 were directly reported on the integrative map.

Other genes and QTLs with conflicting positions, as well as those that have been not mapped such as Xa 11, Xa 12, Xa 15, xa 32 (t), AQBT 026 and AQBT 030, were not positioned on the integrative map.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Through-silicon vias (TSVs) are {{required}} for transmitting signals among different dies for the 3 -D integrated circuit (IC) technology. The significant silicon areas occupied by TSVs bring critical challenges for 3 -D IC placement. Unlike most published 3 -D placement works that only minimize the number of TSVs during placement due to the limitations in their techniques, this paper proposes a new 3 -D cell placement algorithm that can additionally consider the sizes of TSVs and the <b>physical</b> <b>positions</b> for TSV insertion during placement. The algorithm consists of three stages: 1) 3 -D analytical global placement with density optimization and whitespace reservation for TSVs; 2) TSV insertion and TSV-aware legalization; and 3) layer-by-layer detailed placement. In particular, the global placement {{is based on a}} novel weighted-average (WA) wirelength model, giving the first published model that can outperform the well-known log-sum-exp wirelength model theoretically and empirically. Also, a scheme is proposed to enhance the numerical stability of the WA wirelength model. Furthermore, 3 -D routing can easily be accomplished by traditional 2 -D routers since the <b>physical</b> <b>positions</b> of TSVs are determined during placement. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithm. Compared with state-of-the-art 3 -D cell placement works, our algorithm can achieve the best routed wirelength, TSV counts, and total silicon area, in shortest running time.
