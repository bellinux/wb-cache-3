5|$|On October23, two Hurricane Hunter {{missions}} both {{revealed the}} storm to have acquired maximum sustained winds of 205mph (335km/h) and a pressure of 879mbar (hPa; 25.96inHg). Since the <b>peak</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>was</b> assessed {{to have occurred}} between the missions, the National Hurricane Center ultimately estimated Patricia to have acquired winds of 215mph (345km/h) and pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg). This ranked it just below Typhoon Tip of 1979 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record. Patricia's exceptional intensity prompted the retirement of its name in April2016. Late on October23, Patricia made landfall in a significantly weakened state near Cuixmala, Jalisco. Despite weakening greatly, it was the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico with winds estimated at 150mph (240km/h). Interaction with the mountainous terrain of Mexico induced dramatic weakening, faster than the storm had intensified. Within 24hours of moving ashore, Patricia degraded into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter late on October24.|$|E
5|$|On September1, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{into the}} low found a closed circulation center and tropical storm-force winds. Upon finding the low-level circulation center, the NHC began monitoring {{the system as}} Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the 2009 season. Erika was slightly disorganized due to moderate wind shear, with the center partially devoid of convection. However, with warm sea surface temperatures, the storm was forecast to intensify to a strong tropical storm within a few days. A mid-level ridge to the north led to Erika maintaining a general westward track {{for most of its}} existence. Several hours after being classified, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1004mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg). However, the <b>peak</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>was</b> operationally placed at 60mph (95km/h) based on readings from reconnaissance missions. In post-storm analysis of these readings, it was determined that the NHC had overestimated the wind speeds in an area of unusually heavy rains. By the morning of September2, Erika became significantly disorganized, and Hurricane Hunters reported the possibility that multiple circulation centers existed within the broader storm system.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} {{system in the}} Bay of Campeche {{continued}} to struggle in its organization, a new cluster of thunderstorms concentrated in a band developed to the depression's northwest late on June18. Over the next 24hours, this new area of precipitation began to wrap cyclonically around a new and dominant circulation center; the NHC assumed the tropical depression to have relocated to the northwest and classified the system as Tropical Storm Arlene at 1200UTC on June19. As Arlene would not strengthen after classification, <b>peak</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>was</b> attained concurrent with its upgrade to tropical storm strength with maximum sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg). Meandering {{off the coast of}} South Texas due to the presence of a shortwave trough to its north, Arlene eventually made landfall at 0900UTC on June20 at a virtually unchanged intensity at point on Padre Island roughly 45mi (70km) south of Corpus Christi, Texas. The tropical storm quickly deteriorated to tropical depression intensity after landfall, and was no longer considered a tropical cyclone after 0600UTC on June21. The remnants of Arlene continued to track across the Rio Grande Valley before they faded into the ambient environment.|$|E
