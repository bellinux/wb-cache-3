40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the availability of}} information from <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and other sources that would characterise the nature of accidental exposure to household chemical products to improve risk management. The DeNaMiC project was funded by European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and {{was carried out by}} the <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> in Göttingen, Lille, London and Prague, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the World Health Organization and the Health Protection Agency (UK). Method: The project involved developing an analytical tool to compare data on accidental poisoning obtained from the published literature, <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> annual reports and official mortality and morbidity statistics, and comparing and mapping the data collection and product classification schemes used by three <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> (Göttingen, Lille and London). A retrospective analysis of 3 years of enquiry data from Göttingen and Lille was also carried out to determine routinely available data on circumstances of exposure. European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> were surveyed to {{determine the}} availability of data useful for product risk assessment. In addition, an analysis of published literature on toxicovigilance and a survey of toxicovigilance activities of European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> was carried out. Finally, the project explored the feasibility of using <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> to obtain additional information about circumstances of exposure through a prospective followup study. Results: A range of publicly available data on accidental exposures was found; however, this provided little on the circumstances of exposure and could only be compared qualitatively. The product classification schemes used by three <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> showed some degree of comparability for household products. European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> collected the same base data set but varied in collecting data relevant for risk assessment. European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> varied in their understanding of ‘toxicovigilance’ but most stated that they perform it. It was possible to collect additional prospective data on exposures to household products relevant for risk assessment and management. Conclusions: <b>Poisons</b> <b>centres</b> are an important potential source of data useful for product risk assessment and management. In most cases, however, this requires additional work that needs to be resourced. Cooperation between <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and industry can contribute to improving product safety...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionThe {{burden of}} {{poisoning}} exposures in Africa {{is a significant}} public health concern, yet only ten African countries have <b>poisons</b> information <b>centres.</b> The establishment of <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> was subsequently identified as a priority. This article focuses on workshop discussions with international multi-sector stakeholders in Eastern Africa regarding {{the possibility of a}} sub-regional <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> serving multiple countries. MethodsThe project was led by an independent consultant under the guidance of an international steering group. Steering group members provided input at international multi-stakeholder meetings and during monthly teleconferences. ResultsParticipants of the stakeholder meetings agreed that the establishment of a sub-regional <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> in Eastern Africa was necessary and feasible. Virtual collaboration is possible due to recent technological developments, and the overall suggestion was for countries to establish their own <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and to network and coordinate these centres through a network hub. ConclusionA number of benefits might result from such a <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> network hub, including: (1) Improved cooperation between countries on poisoning problems; (2) Harmonisation and strengthening of research and surveillance; (3) Common standards and best practices e. g. regulating chemicals, data management, and staff training; and (4) Greater bargaining power to secure resources.

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} poisonings in {{companion}} animals, including horses, farm animals and wildlife, investigated and recorded {{during the past}} ten years at the Laboratory of Toxicology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (Ghent University) and the National <b>Poison</b> <b>Centre</b> in Belgium. The causative agents of poisoning incidents vary among the different species. The Laboratory of Toxicology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine reports that the majority of poisoning incidents in companion animals, and especially in dogs and cats, are due to contact with insecticides and pesticides, whereas horses are more frequently poisoned by plant toxins. Farm animals, on the other hand, are mainly intoxicated by heavy metals, toxic plants and agrochemicals. The Belgian <b>Poison</b> <b>Centre</b> reports that intoxications in companion animals are mostly with agrochemicals, household products and drugs, whereas in farm animals intoxications with agrochemicals are a common problem. This review gives an overview of the most common causes of intoxication and their association with the different animal species.

Priorities after initial stablization and during physical examination and laboratory confirmation are preventing toxicity by removing the toxin from the gastrointestinal tract, decreasing its absorption, and increasing its elimination. For a limited number of substances, antidotes may be beneficial.

40|$|The {{establishment}} and strengthening of <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> {{was identified as}} a regional priority at the first African regional meeting on the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) in June 2006. At this meeting, the possibility of a subregional <b>poisons</b> <b>centre,</b> that is, a centre in one country serving multiple countries, was suggested. The WHO Headquarters following consultation with counterparts at the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and the SAICM Africa Regional Focal Point successfully submitted a proposal to the SAICM Quick Start Programme (QSP) Trust Fund Committee for a feasibility study into a subregional <b>poisons</b> <b>centre</b> in the Eastern Africa subregion.

40|$|Context: Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) such as “Spice”, “K 2 ”, etc. {{are widely}} {{available}} via the internet despite increasing legal restrictions. Currently, the prevalence of use is typically low in the general community (< 1 %) although it is higher among students and some niche groups subject to drug testing. Early evidence suggests that adverse outcomes {{associated with the use}} of SCs may be more prevalent and severe than those arising from cannabis consumption. Objectives: To identify systematically the scientific reports of adverse events associated with the consumption of SCs in the medical literature and <b>poison</b> <b>centre</b> data. Method: We searched online databases (Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, Google Scholar and Pubmed) and manually searched reference lists up to December 2014. To be eligible for inclusion, data had to be from hospital, emergency department, drug rehabilitation services or <b>poison</b> <b>centre</b> records of adverse events involving SCs and included both self-reported and/or analytically confirmed consumption. Results: From 256 reports, we identified 106 eligible studies including 37 conference abstracts on about 4000 cases involving at least 26 deaths. Major complications include cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and emboli), acute kidney injury (AKI), generalized tonic-clonic seizures, psychiatric presentations (including first episode psychosis, paranoia, self-harm/suicide ideation) and hyperemesis. However, most presentations were not serious, typically involved young males with tachycardia (≈ 37 – 77 %), agitation (≈ 16 – 41 %) and nausea (≈ 13 – 94 %) requiring only symptomatic care with a length of stay of less than 8 hours. Conclusions: SCs most frequently result in tachycardia, agitation and nausea. These symptoms typically resolve with symptomatic care, including intravenous fluids, benzodiazepines and anti-emetics, and may not require inpatient care. Severe adverse events (stroke, seizure, myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis, AKI, psychosis and hyperemesis) and associated deaths manifest less commonly. Precise estimates of their incidence are difficult to calculate due to the lack of widely available, rapid laboratory confirmation, the variety of SC compounds and the unknown number of exposed individuals.

40|$|Objective: Within the European Union {{there is}} a mesh of rapid alert systems (RAS) for {{different}} hazards, e. g. food and feed (RASFF), dangerous consumer products (RAPEX) and communicable diseases (EWRS = early warning and response system). The abbreviation RAPEX stands for the rapid alert system for all dangerous consumer products, {{with the exception of}} food, pharmaceutical and medical devices. These systems link national and European public health authorities. Although the rapid alert system for biological and chemical attacks (RAS-BICHAT) connects national focal points in case of confirmed terror attacks with chemicals, there is still a gap for chemical hazards in cases of mere suspicion: in the future <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> and the EAPCCT will {{play an important role in}} the process of exchanging warnings concerning these hazards within the European Union. The ASHT research project prepares tools for these important new functions. The scope of the ASHT I projects was the creation of an EUwide alerting system to detect covert release of chemicals with a criminal or terrorist intent. The acronym “ASHT” stands for “Alerting System and Development of a Health Surveillance System for the Deliberate Release of Chemicals by Terrorists”. In ASHT II this task expands to all chemical incidents. Methods: Description of political, financial, toxicological and technical aspects of the project. Results: In the first phase of the project, ASHT I, two major tasks were accomplished: the feasibility of both a rapid alert system for chemicals (RAS-CHEM) by creating DEV RAS-CHEM, a preliminary “developmental” version, and a European surveillance system between <b>poisons</b> <b>centres.</b> Like ASHT I the second phase of the project is funded by the European Commission, the EAPCCT and the other project members. The duration of the project is 36 months. In ASHT II several tasks will have to be accomplished. Firstly, the DEV RAS-CHEM draft version must be converted into an EU-wide operating rapid alert system for chemicals (RAS-CHEM). The data base must be accessible via the internet. The data base shall carry out the delivery of “chemical event” alerting. The member states’ public health surveillance authorities are to be integrated in the process. On the other hand the ‘EU PC Forum’ as a means of emergency communication between European <b>poisons</b> <b>centres</b> is to be created. This includes the testing of a prototype toxicosurveillance tool using automated data sampling in <b>poisons</b> <b>centres.</b> Toxicological aspects include the refinement of lists of chemicals, symptoms or toxidromes as important bases for mutual data exchange. Concerning the information technology level, several requirements are to be taken into consideration: for the creation of an event and for retrieval functions an appropriate relational data base structure is essential. National Public Health Authorities of the member states of the European Union and the WHO are integrated into the project as associate partners. Conclusion: The early warning system for chemicals (RAS-CHEM) will be integrated into the suite of other pre-existing EU early warning systems in the near future.
