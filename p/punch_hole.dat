40|$|AbstractA {{method for}} solving dual and triple Fourier-Bessel series {{equations}} is proposed. It {{is based on}} a novel operator transforming Bessel functions into the sine function and on an inversion formula analogous to one for Bessel series. As a result, the dual and triple equations are transformed into the Fredholm integral equations of the second kind or into the singular integral equations of a well-known type. The suggested approach differs from the existing and provides new possibilities for applications. This is demonstrated by the torsional problem for an annular punch in contact with an inhomogeneous elastic cylinder. The asymptotic solution is derived as a distance between the punch edge and the lateral cylinder surface is short provided that the <b>punch</b> <b>hole</b> is small.

A butterfly-type test specimen was employed to experimentally obtain stress states ranging from simple shear to plane strain tension including mixed tensile and shear loading. The numerically-derived failure surface was implemented into the phenomenological GISSMO damage model in the commercial finite element code LS-DYNA and the accuracy of the failure surface was determined using finite element predictions of the characterization experiments. A series of independent validation experiments related to sheet metal forming were performed including a hole tension test, a conical and flat <b>punch</b> <b>hole</b> expansion test, and a hemispherical punch test.

40|$|Background. Coronary artery bypass {{grafting}} (CABG) {{has come}} full circle-it started as an off-pump affair, then became an on pump one {{and now we}} are trying to keep off the pump again. One of the main reasons for this has been the neurological sequelae subsequent to CABG. But neurological problems kept causing concern even in off-pump CABGs (OPCAB). Side clamping the aorta was thought to be the major factor and thus came the concept of ‘no touch proximal anastomoses ’ onto the aorta (1). Though a variety of proximal anastamotic devices are available in themarket, high cost is amatter of real concern in thirdworld countries like India. Hence, this endeavor of ours to fabricate an anastamotic device of our own—‘the Vettath’s anastamotic obturator ’ (VAO) for proximal anastomoses of saphenous vein grafts (SVG) onto the aorta. VAO is a stainless steel rod with three grooves and a guard at the end, which sinks into the aorta, through a <b>punch</b> <b>hole,</b> cordoned off by two wide purse string sutures. Methods. After trials on perfused animal heart models, we started using this device on humans. We have performed 269 proximal anastomoses using the VAO in 177 of our OPCAB patients in the past 1 year (till July 2003). Ninety-five of them had single top ends, 72 had 2 top ends and 10 had 3 top ends onto the aorta. We have used this on disease free islands on four patients with palpable aortic plaques. Initially all anastomoses were of the proximal first type (to ensure that the flow was adequate). Now-a-days, wit...|$|E

It contains the passengers’ journey with the narrow 363 meter stretch of planks and metal ballasts which lead them to board the ferry at the far end.

So too, the edge of the ticket is intensified by the punch holes spaces, and by passengers’ quotes which carry meaning through the inter-related composition and correspondence of each phrase. To this day the threads of the coat captures utilitarian as well as poetic felt experiences in the warm, worn and fraying red fibres; concomitantly packets of used transport tickets are seemingly insubstantial everyday ephemera that are no longer valued as a commodity or document of travel and could easily be thrown away. However I would suggest that the tangible mater of a used transport ticket is capable of carrying the stories of others, revealed in the creases and wear and tear of a used tickets surface, and its intimate use and storage in a purse, back pocket or wallet. Concomitantly fragmented memories captured in the re-articulation of warp and weft threads from the seams and inside pockets of used outdoor clothing may be reactivated through the surface of the tickets form...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to have accurate and reliable measurements of soft tissue thickness for specific landmarks of the face and scalp when producing a facial reconstruction. In the past several methods have been created to measure facial soft tissue thickness (FSTT) in cadavers and in the living. The conventional spiral CT is mostly used to determine the FSTT but is associated with high radiation doses. The cone beam CT (CBCT) is a relatively new computer tomography system that focuses on head and neck regions and has much lower radiation doses. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the accuracy and reliability of CBCT scans to measure the soft tissue thicknesses of the face. Seven cadaver heads were used. Eleven soft tissue landmarks were identified on each head and a <b>punch</b> <b>hole</b> was made on each landmark using a dermal biopsy punch. The seven cadaver heads were scanned in the CBCT with 0. 3 and 0. 4 mm resolution. The FSTT at the 11 different sites (soft tissue landmarks) were measured using SimPlant-ortho volumetric software. These measurements were compared to the physical measurements. Statistical analysis for the reliability was done by means of the interclass coefficient (ICC) and the accuracy by means of the absolute error (AE) and absolute percentage error (APE). The intra-observer (0. 976 - 0. 999) and inter-observer (0. 982 - 0. 997) correlations of the CBCT and physical measurements were very high. There was no clinical significant difference between the measurements made on the CBCT images and the physical measurements. Increasing the voxel size from 0. 4 to 0. 3 mm resulted in a slight increase of accuracy. Cone beam CT images of the face using routine scanning protocols are reliable for measuring soft tissue thickness in the facial region and give a good representation of the facial soft tissues. For more accurate data collection the 0. 3 mm voxel size should be considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} {{and restoration}} of tissue mass after organ damage or injury in adult higher vertebrates {{is critical to}} the architecture and function of the organ. If replacement occurs with scar tissue, this often results in adverse effects on function and growth as well as an undesirable cosmetic appearance. However, certain mammals, such as the MRL/MpJ mouse, have shown a restricted capacity for regeneration, rather than scar tissue formation, after an excisional ear punch wound. To investigate the changes in tissue architecture leading to ear wound closure, initial ear wounding studies with a 2 -mm clinical biopsy punch were performed on MRL/MpJ mice, by using C 57 BL/ 6 mice as a nonregenerative control strain. In contrast to previously reported studies on mouse ear regeneration, we observed that C 57 BL/ 6 mice in fact showed a limited regenerative capacity. One explanation for this difference could be attributed to the method of wounding used; both previous studies on mouse ear regeneration used a thumb punch, whereas our approach was to use a clinical biopsy punch. This approach led us to further investigate whether the severity of trauma applied influenced the rate of wound healing. We, therefore, compared the effects of the sharp clinical biopsy punch with that of a cruder thumb punch, and introduced a third strain of mouse, Balb/c, known to be a slow-healing strain. A new method to quantify ear <b>punch</b> <b>hole</b> closure was developed and a histologic investigation conducted up to 4 months after wounding. Image analysis data showed a reduction in original ear wound area of 85 % in MRL/MpJ mice at 4 weeks and of 91. 7 % over 4 months by using a biopsy punch. In contrast, the crude thumb punch methodology resulted in an increase in wound area of up to 58 % in Balb/c ears; thought to be due to increased necrosis of the wound site. All biopsy-punched wound areas plateaued in healing between days 28 and 112. Only 5 of 80 MRL/MpJ mouse ears showed no residual holes macroscopically after 28 days. Histologically, all strains of mice healed their ear wounds in a similar manner involving re-epithelialization, blastema-like formation, dermal extension, blood vessel formation, chondrogenesis, folliculogenesis, and skeletal muscle and fat differentiation. However, all regenerative features were more pronounced and accelerated in MRL/MpJ mice when compared with C 57 BL/ 6 and Balb/c biopsy-punched mouse ears...|$|E
