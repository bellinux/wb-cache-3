We investigated the effect of ultraviolet radiation in antimicrobial activity of <b>paint</b> <b>coats.</b> Methods Bacteria being tested included E. coli, S. aureus and C. albicans. We left the suspension of bacteria in contact with <b>paint</b> <b>coats</b> and we taken samples in defined time intervals. The first part of samples was irradiated by UV radiation for 30 minutes before application of microbial suspension. The second part of samples was irradiated by UV radiation for 30 minutes {{at the same time}} with microbial suspension. The third part of samples was not irradiated by UV radiation. The results were evaluated by bacterial colony plate counting. Results The <b>paint</b> <b>coats</b> have antimicrobial activity even without application of UV radiation. UV radiation enhances the antimicrobial properties and activates <b>paint</b> <b>coats.</b> Conclusions We have demonstrated the antimicrobial effects against all of the three species of bacteria.

50|$|Man-made {{structures}} {{are often the}} objects to which frazil ice adheres. As such, the choice of materials for these structures should include consideration of ice adhesion. Steel structures, for example will rust, and rust-to-ice adhesion is very strong.

50|$|Silicate mineral paints or mineral {{colors are}} <b>paint</b> <b>coats</b> with mineral binding agents. Two {{relevant}} mineral binders {{play a role}} in the field of colors: Lime and silicate.|$|R
50|$|The {{result is}} a highly durable {{connection}} between <b>paint</b> <b>coat</b> and substrate. Above that the binding agent water glass is highly resistant against UV light. While organic binders such as dispersions based on acrylate or silicone resin under UV over the years tend to grow brittle, chalky and develop cracks which finally result in damage to <b>paint</b> <b>coats,</b> the inorganic binder water glass remains stable. The chemical fusion with the substrate and the UV stability of the binder are the fundamental reasons for the extraordinarily high lifetime of silicate paints.|$|R

50|$|Silicate paints {{are highly}} color-tone stable. As they are solely dyed with mineral {{pigments}} {{that do not}} fade with exposure to UV radiation, the silicate <b>paint</b> <b>coats</b> remain constant in color for decades.|$|R
50|$|By adding {{pigments}} to {{the natural}} silicone rubber {{it is possible to}} create keys in various colors which can be molded together (Flowing colors) during the compression process to form a multi key keypad. Individual legends can be printed on to a key allowing full customization of the keypad for its application. Techniques have also been developed to allow for keypads to be spray painted and legends then laser etched through the <b>paint</b> <b>coating.</b> This allows individual key to be illuminated using SMT LEDs placed on the printed circuit board. Also several coating materials such as Sealplast coating can be done to ensure a smooth surface where the printed legend last longer with good feeling of touch.|$|E
50|$|Near large {{cultivated}} areas, where fertilizers {{are applied}} by airplanes, the wind may carry nitrates, phosphates, and ammonium compounds {{to settle on}} metallic components of the above-ground telephone plant. Similarly, in residential areas, lawn fertilizers and herbicides can cause corrosion. In regions with snow, the salts used to melt snow and ice on roadways can accelerate corrosion. Under extreme conditions, pedestals and cabinets may be flooded with water that contains mud and corrosive salts. Corrosion of these flooded components may be accelerated {{by the presence of}} dc voltages used to power the networks. Secretions from insects can also accelerate corrosion. Finally, chewing by rodents may expose metallic components, normally protected by a polymer or <b>paint</b> <b>coating,</b> to a corrosive environment.|$|E
5000|$|Treatments for saltillo include: coating {{them with}} a surface sealant prior to {{grouting}} (as mentioned earlier), applying an admixture of linseed oil and paint thinner, applying natural stone colour enhancers, applying floor hardeners, applying shine, painting {{them with a}} water-based <b>paint,</b> <b>coating</b> them with wood stain, etc. As the tile is incredibly porous it will readily absorb just about any liquid. Please note any of these treatments may be used on the tile, however some of them such as penetrating sealeant, enhancers or linseed oil treatments penetrate into the tile and may affect the ability of later coatings {{to adhere to the}} tile. Ultra-durable, water-based polyurethane makes an excellent coating for adding slip resistance, beautiful appearance and protection from penetrating stains. Look for a polyurethane coating that has no VOCs for maximum environmental friendliness.|$|E

He enters her house several times unexpectedly, takes her spinning, and even steels her car so she must pass by the police office. Ironically, Hélène seems to have something to reproach herself, because she does art traffic with her lover Marc. When she leaves for Geneva to sell paintings of Amedeo Modigliani hidden under a <b>paint</b> <b>coating</b> to let think that they are contemporary paintings, she defies Leroux to follow her flight by car, what he does. He finally discovers the truth once arrived in Switzerland, becomes angry at Hélène and suddenly has a pain. While Hélène gives her a cold shower, he kisses her by surprise.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{completion}} of the new bridge, traffic volume on both banks of the Irtish River increased to an extent that greatly exceeded the assumptions at the time of appraisal. Moreover, traffic flow became smooth. There was some concern with regard to safety, but the project objective has been satisfactorily achieved overall, and so the effectiveness is judged to be high. However, after construction, the bridge hasn't been inspected for over periods of time which resulted some concerns over the conditions of the bridge. Japanese experts have inspected the technical condition of the suspension bridge which concluded that the bridge is in a good condition, the only concern was about the <b>paint</b> <b>coating</b> due to some corrosion that needed to be removed. However the local budget has no funds for the expensive repairs of the bridge. In Japan, the government spends 2-3 billion tenge ($13-20 million) annually to maintain one such bridge, whereas in Semey, the budget allocates only 3 million tenge ($20 thousand) annually.|$|E
50|$|Steel pallets {{are strong}} {{and are used}} for heavy loads, high-stacking loads, long term dry storage, and loads moved by abusive {{logistic}} systems. They are often used for military ammunition. Metal pallets make up less than 1% of the market. Materials include carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. Of these, carbon steel offers excellent durability at the lowest cost. Stainless steel doesn’t require a <b>paint</b> <b>coating,</b> and is preferred for such applications as clean room environments. Carbon steel units are expensive compared to wood, and stainless and aluminum cost about 2-3 times that of carbon steel. Long term costs, however, can be lower than wood. General advantages of metal pallets are high strength and stiffness, excellent durability, bug free, no splinters, sanitary, and recyclable. Disadvantages include a higher initial price, significant weight, low friction, and susceptibility to rusting (carbon steel). Metal is primarily used in captive or closed loop environments where durability and product protection are key performance requirements. Metal units today are increasingly price competitive and lighter in weight. Primary industries that use metal pallets include automotive, pharmaceutical, lawn tractors, motorcycles, and tires.|$|E

40|$|When {{evaluating}} the carbonation resistance of <b>paint</b> <b>coated</b> concrete, {{the effects of}} both the strength grade and the curing conditions (standard curing and accelerated curing) of concrete substrate on carbonation resistance of <b>paint</b> <b>coated</b> concrete were investigated. The concept of the carbonation suppression ratio of paint was presented for evaluation of the anti-carbonation performance of {{the two types of}} paints (exterior and interior paints) when applied to a reference concrete substrate. The test results showed a good linear relationship between the carbonation depths of the <b>paint</b> <b>coated</b> concrete and the square root of exposure times. Concrete with higher strength grade exhibited greater carbonation resistance. The carbonation depth of the C 35 standard cured concrete was reduced by 56 % in comparison with that of the C 25 standard cured concrete. It was found that concrete substrate prepared by accelerated curing method displayed lower carbonation resistance than standard cured concrete. Compared with the standard cured specimen, the carbonation depth of the accelerated cured specimen increased by 61 % for the control C 25 concrete and by 56 % for the control C 35 concrete. This phenomenon was attributed to the formation of a higher volume of capillary pores in concrete prepared by accelerated curing. Additionally, the exterior paint had a higher carbonation suppression ratio than the interior paint. The suppression ratios of the exterior and interior paint coatings applied on C 25 standard cured concrete were 71 % and 56 %, respectively. The exterior <b>paint</b> <b>coated</b> concrete had a better carbonation resistance with longer effective blockage time and smaller carbonation rate...|$|R
