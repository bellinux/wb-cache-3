5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell <b>penetrated</b> {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell <b>penetrated</b> the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four {{propellant}} charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E

5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is {{difficult}} for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society. This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always <b>penetrated</b> Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E

50|$|<b>Penetrating</b> oil, {{also known}} as <b>penetrating</b> fluid, is very low-viscosity oil. It {{can be used to}} free rusted {{mechanical}} parts (such as nuts and bolts) {{so that they can be}} removed, because it can <b>penetrate</b> into the narrow space between the threads of two parts. It can also be used as a general-purpose lubricant, a cleaner, or a corrosion stopper. Using <b>penetrating</b> fluids as general-purpose lubricants is not advisable, because such oils are relatively volatile. As a result, much of the <b>penetrating</b> oil will evaporate in a short amount of time, leaving little residual lubricant.|$|R
