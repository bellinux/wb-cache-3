The guidelines are only guidelines, more useful in some cases than in others.|$|E

"It is arguable {{that the}} patent claims in {{issue in this}} case could fail on the same reasoning, {{depending}} upon whether a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> of the claims in issue leads {{to the conclusion that}} Schlumberger cannot be distinguished because the only inventive aspect of the claimed invention is the algorithm - a mathematical formula - that is programmed into the computer to cause it to take the necessary steps to accomplish a one-click online purchase. On the other hand, it is also arguable that a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> of the claims may lead to the conclusion that Schlumberger is distinguishable because a new one-click method of completing an online purchase is not the whole invention but only {{one of a number of}} essential elements in a novel combination. In my view, the task of <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> of the claims in this case should be undertaken anew by the Commissioner, with a mind open to the possibility that a novel business method may be an essential element of a valid patent claim." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates three <b>purposive</b> <b>constructions</b> in Mandarin Chinese, the lai-purposive, and hao-purposive, and {{the bare}} purposive. It is shown {{that despite the}} fact that all these purposive clauses occur at the right end of the sentence, these <b>purposive</b> <b>constructions</b> in fact do not involve right {{adjunction}} in the formation of their syntactic structures. Our analyses show that the lai-purposive employs complementation, the hao-purposive conjunction, and the bare purposive left-adjunction. This work thus provides an example where a structure which looks as if it involves right-adjunction in fact doesn’t employ right-adjunction at all, in conformity with Kayne’s (1994) theory of Linear Correspondence Axiom (LCA) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe term ‘cultural icon’ is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to individuals or images, objects, visual sign, monuments, space etc. In semiotics the term ‘icon’ is {{used to refer to}} a sign that bears close resemblance to the object that it stands for. Icons are particularly influential signifiers because they are immediately identifiable and carry complex cultural codes in a compact image. In this paper the understanding of ‘cultural icon’ is not limited to semiotics. Following Keyan Tomaselli and David Scott in Cultural Icons (2009), we believe that cultural icons are <b>purposive</b> <b>constructions.</b> An attempt has been made in this paper to analyze the association of ‘desirable’ meanings to a cultural icon (while dropping ‘undesirable’ ones); thus, it is imperative that we look at the changing socio-political contexts behind such <b>purposive</b> <b>constructions.</b> With this in mind, we look at the iconic figure of Bishnuprasad Rabha who {{has been one of the}} most revered figures in the cultural history of Assam and has been appropriated as a cultural icon in different discourses of the national life of Assam that has emerged in recent times...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{agreeing with}} most of the {{substance}} of the Federal Court’s judgement, Justice of Appeal Sharlow, writing for the Federal Court of Appeal, found that it was inappropriate for Justice Phelan to pursue his own <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> of the claims advanced by Amazon.com. <b>Purposive</b> <b>construction</b> must be executed with a foundation of knowledge about the relevant art. Justice Phelan did not have expert evidence before the Federal Court from persons skilled in the art, and therefore it would have been more appropriate for the Commissioner to re-examine the claims, given the expertise of the Patent Office. Accordingly, the Federal Court of Appeal remanded the application to the Commissioner for expedited reconsideration.|$|E

500|$|In {{other common}} law jurisdictions, {{interpretation}} for similar situations is significantly different. In Canada, for example, four different interpretative doctrines {{are used in}} understanding taxation laws; [...] "strict <b>construction,</b> <b>purposive</b> interpretation, the plain meaning rule, and the words-in-total-context approach". In Stubart Investments Limited v The Queen, the Supreme Court of Canada decided to reject a strict approach and instead use the rule that [...] "the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, {{the object of the}} Act, and the intention of Parliament". Since then, however, both the purposive and plain meaning approaches have been used.

The average citizen does not have access to the legislative history of an Act, which under the Pepper approach could very well change the meaning of the statute completely.|$|R
50|$|The current position, therefore, is {{that the}} House of Lords has held that the {{principle}} of <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> is entirely {{in accordance with the}} Protocol to Article 69, but that the Improver questions may not represent the best approach for dealing with every infringement issue.

5000|$|The purposive {{approach}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as purposivism, <b>purposive</b> <b>construction,</b> purposive interpretation, or the [...] "modern principle in construction") is an approach to statutory and constitutional interpretation under which common law courts interpret an enactment (i.e., a statute, part of a statute, or a clause of a constitution) {{within the context of}} the law's purpose.|$|E
50|$|On March 8, 2013, the Canadian Patent Office {{announced}} {{changes in}} patent examination practice {{based on the}} ruling in the Amazon.com case.

40|$|Part 1 of this two-part article {{reviewed}} the four main doctrines to which Canadian courts have referred {{in interpreting the}} Income Tax Act (strict <b>construction,</b> <b>purposive</b> interpretation, the plain meaning rule, and the words-in-total-context approach) and examined leading cases in which these doctrines have been defined and applied. Part 2 of the article evaluates each of the interpretive doctrines examined in part 1 and develops, as an alternative, an explicitly 2 ̆ 2 pragmatic 2 ̆ 2 approach. This alternative approach builds on the words-in-total-context doctrine by interpreting {{the words of the}} Act 2 ̆ 2 in their entire context, 2 ̆ 2 having regard to the scheme of the Act, the purposes of the Act, the intentions of Parliament, and the practical consequences of different interpretations. Following the analysis of the four doctrines, the article outlines the essential features of an explicitly pragmatic approach to statutory interpretation, explains the relevance of practical consequences to judicial decisions, and considers the manner in which consequential considerations and other relevant factors are properly brought together {{in the context of a}} particular interpretive issue. Emphasizing the significance of textual, purposive, and consequential considerations to statutory interpretation, this interpretive approach favours an open and inquiring method of judicial reasoning by which the court should endeavour, where possible, to fashion a mutual harmony among these various interpretive elements. Where this harmony is ultimately unachievable, however, the pragmatic approach advocated here follows the traditional practice of English, US, and Canadian courts by generally weighing textual considerations more heavily than purposive considerations and purposive considerations more heavily than consequential considerations. To the extent that Supreme Court of Canada decisions interpreting the Income Tax Act already examine textual, purposive, and consequential considerations, the pragmatic approach advocated here is not so much a departure from the court 2 ̆ 7 s actual practice of statutory interpretation as a more satisfactory account of that practice than is provided by the various doctrines to which the court now refers. To the extent that these doctrines shape both the process of statutory interpretation and the substance of the decisions themselves, however, the proposed pragmatic approach promises a more open, reasoned, and balanced method of statutory interpretation than each of the alternatives otherwise available...|$|R
40|$|Clause {{is defined}} as a {{grammatical}} unit consisting of the elements of subject (S) and predicate (P), both with object (O) and adverbial (A), and has the capability of being a sentence. Clauses can be categorized based on (i) the core arguments, (ii)  the presence or absence of negative words in predicate, (iii) the categories of words or phrases that occupy predicate function, (iv)   its capacity of being a sentence, (v)  their functions in sentences. A clause can be combined in two ways, first using coordinate conjunction forming a coordinate construction, and second using subordinate conjunction forming a subordinate construction. This research attempted to analyze the strategy of combining clauses in Waijewa Dialect; a Sumbanese language. This research applied qualitative method in which the written data were collected from three key informants and four supporting informants from each district in Waijewa using four techniques namely; (1) observation, (2) structure-based interview, (3) documentation, and (4) triangulation. The collected data were analyzed using distributional method. The theory used to analyze the data was the language typology theory proposed by Dixon (1994) and 2010) and Comrie (1983). The result showed that in Waijewa dialect clauses could be divided into two; namely, the clauses having verbal predicates and the ones having nonverbal predicates. Waijewa dialect has clitic pronouns marking the arguments of the verbs. They showed nominative, accusative, and genitive cases. The coordinate constructions in BSDW could be categorized into two forms such as:  (1) syndetic (construction marked by conjunction) and (2) asyndetic (without conjunction marker). The forms of subordinate clause in subordinate construction were divided into three; namely, (1) relative clause, (2) complementation clause, and (3) adjunct clause. Arguments A and S were relativized by gapping and attaching the prefix {a-} to the V and the relativization of the arguments O, E, locative, and instrument was done by gapping and attaching prefix {pa-} to the V. The complementation clause could be combined using either the conjunction ba ‘that’ or without the conjunction ba, verb serialization, relative clause <b>construction,</b> <b>purposive</b> linking with the conjunction {ka} ‘for’ or without the conjunction ka. The adjunct clause could be combined using either conjunction or without conjunction. </p...|$|R
40|$|This two-part article {{discusses}} the various doctrines to which Canadian courts have referred {{in interpreting the}} Income Tax Act, evaluates these doctrines, and proposes an alternative 2 ̆ 2 pragmatic 2 ̆ 2 approach that offers a more open, reasoned, and balanced method of statutory interpretation than each of the alternatives otherwise available. Part 1 of the article reviews the four main doctrines applied by Canadian courts in interpreting the Income Tax Act: strict <b>construction,</b> <b>purposive</b> interpretation, the plain meaning rule, and the words-in-total context approach. After the characteristics {{of each of these}} four doctrines have been explained, the article examines leading tax cases in which these doctrines have been defined and applied, illustrating {{the manner in which the}} applicable doctrine has influenced the courts 2 ̆ 7 decisions and critically evaluating these decisions in light of the pragmatic approach developed in part 2. While strict construction and the plain meaning rule downplay the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intentions of Parliament, leading to decisions at odds with legislative intentions and statutory purposes (for example, the majority judgment in Friesen), purposive interpretation downplays the words of the Act, resulting in doctrinal confusion (for example, Bronfman Trust and McClurg) and decisions at odds with the text of the Act (for example, Neuman). Although the words-in-total-context approach affirms a more pragmatic outlook, according to which the words of the Act are to be read contextually and 2 ̆ 2 harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament, 2 ̆ 2 the Supreme Court of Canada has yet to acknowledge this approach as an independent interpretive doctrine different from purposive interpretation and the plain meaning rule. Moreover, to the extent that the words-in-total-context approach limits the scope of contextual analysis and disregards the practical consequences of alternative interpretations, it is only partly pragmatic and fails to fully describe the interpretive process that the court implicitly employs. Part 2 of the article evaluates each of the interpretive doctrines examined in part 1, explains the essential features of an explicitly pragmatic approach to statutory interpretation, and advances an argument for this approach as an alternative to each of the interpretive doctrines currently employed...|$|R

50|$|Whirlpool Corp v Camco Inc, 2000 2 S.C.R. 1067; 2000 SCC 67, is {{a leading}} Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} on patent claim construction and double patenting.

50|$|The Court {{then went}} onto {{consider}} the claims {{and find that}} a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> of Amazon.com’s claims disclosed a “machine”, a patentable subject matter under section 2 of the Patent Act, which implemented {{something more than just}} a “mathematical formula”. Given this characterization of Amazon.com’s claims and its rejection of the Commissioner’s decision, the Court sent the case back to the Commissioner with the direction that the claims constitute patentable subject matter.|$|E
5000|$|Catnic {{sued for}} patent {{infringement}}. At trial, the judge held {{there was an}} infringement under the [...] "pith and marrow" [...] doctrine.

5000|$|Lord Diplock changed this {{principle}} in the House of Lords decision in Catnic Components Ltd v Hill & Smith Ltd 1982 RPC 183, 243 {{when he said}} that the new British approach to contract interpretation should also be applied to the construction of patent claims. He summarises this as: [...] "A patent specification should be given a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> rather than a purely literal one", where [...] "purposive construction" [...] means understanding language in accordance with what a reasonable person would understand the author to be using the words to mean.|$|E
50|$|Free World Trust v Électro Santé Inc, 2000 2 S.C.R. 1024, 2000 SCC 66, is {{a leading}} Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} on patents, namely claim construction and the necessity to identify essential elements and non-essential elements. Along with the related decision, Camco v. Whirlpool (2001), 9 C.P.R. (4th) 129 (SCC), the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the doctrine of equivalents applied in the United States and adopted the doctrine of <b>purposive</b> <b>construction,</b> as originally applied by the United Kingdom House of Lords in Catnic v. Hill & Smith. This was a landmark decision as it resolved the uncertainty in Canadian case law between the two doctrines.|$|E
5000|$|Amazon.com {{appealed the}} matter to the Federal Court. The Federal Court {{rejected}} the Commissioner's characterization of [...] "business methods" [...] as an excluded category of subject matter. The court found that instead the patent's claims should be assessed against the five categories of statutory subject matter found in the Patent Act. Justice Phelan held that <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> of the claims clearly disclosed a [...] "machine" [...] and thus were patentable subject matter. The court ordered the application {{sent back to the}} Commissioner for expedited re‑examination with the direction that the claims constitute patentable subject matter. The Commissioner of Patents appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{perfectly}} consistent {{to say that}} a tax avoidance scheme escapes tax (there being no provision to impose a tax charge) and yet constitutes the avoidance of tax. One is seeking the intention of Parliament at a higher, more generalised level. A statute may fail to impose a tax charge, leaving a gap that a court cannot fill even by <b>purposive</b> <b>construction,</b> but nevertheless one can conclude that {{there would have been a}} tax charge had the point been considered. An example is the notorious UK case Ayrshire Employers Mutual Insurance Association v IRC, where the House of Lords held that Parliament had “missed fire”.|$|E
5000|$|The Commissioner {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court found that the [...] "determination of subject matter {{must be based on}} a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> of the patent claims." [...] In doing so, Sharlow J.A., substantially agreed with the reasons below. However, the court vacated the lower courts finding that the claims constituted patentable subject matter, finding instead that the trial judge did not have the benefit of expert evidence necessary to provide a [...] "foundation of knowledge about the relevant art" [...] to support claims construction. [...] The court then ordered the Commissioner to re-examine the patent application on an expedited basis including construction of the claims.|$|E
5000|$|Patents in Canada {{are subject}} to a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction,</b> which relies on reading both the claims and the {{specifications}} to determine the scope of a patent, and extrinsic evidence is not permitted. Therefore, the Canadian courts emphatically reject what they refer to as [...] "file wrapper estoppel". No distinction is drawn between cases involving allegations of literal infringement and those involving substantive infringement, {{which means that the}} negotiations that have taken place between the patentee and the Patent Office cannot be used in order to establish a particular equivalent. Similarly, a patentee is barred from using any previous negotiations with the Patent Office {{in order to determine the}} scope of the claims of the patent (i.e. the negotiations cannot be used by the patentee or against the patentee in determining the scope of the claims within the patent).|$|E
50|$|At the Federal Court, Justice Phelan decisively quashed the Commissioner’s decision. First, the Court {{found that}} the “form and substance” {{formulation}} and analysis of Amazon.com’s claims departed from the approach articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Free World Trust v Électro Santé Inc and Whirlpool Corp v Camco Inc, which stated that {{the identification of the}} invention must be done through a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> of its claims. Second, the Court {{found that the}} “technological” requirement was too restrictive in the test for an “art”. The Court could find nothing in Canadian jurisprudence which would support such a requirement. Third, Justice Phelan concluded that there was no “tradition” for the categorical exclusion of “business methods” from patentability in Canada. Instead, the Court states that business methods were to be assessed pursuant to the five categories found within section 2 of the Patent Act.|$|E
5000|$|Binnie was {{hesitant}} for {{courts to}} attempt to find the [...] "spirit of the invention" [...] which would create more uncertainty and unpredictability. His proposed [...] "purposive construction" [...] approach would avoid literal interpretation while limiting the scope of substantive claims in attempt to balance fairness between the patentee and the public. <b>Purposive</b> <b>construction</b> identifies the essential from the non-essential. The analysis is {{from the perspective of}} a [...] "worker skilled in the art to which the patent relates as of the date the patent is published". If an essential element is different or missing from the challenged invention then there is no infringement. However, there may still be infringement where only non-essential elements are different or missing. A non-essential element is one that, from the words of the claim, are not clearly intended to be essential, or where a skilled reader would have been able to identify a substitute.|$|E
50|$|Canadian patents {{should be}} given a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction.</b> The words used by the {{inventor}} are read {{in a manner consistent with}} what it is presumed the inventor intended; the interpretation should be sympathetic to the express or implicit purpose of the patent. The inventor's intent must be based on the patent, the court is not allowed to use extrinsic evidence of the inventor's intent. Courts should not take a purely literal interpretation of the patent, courts should determine whether a Person Skilled in the Art would conclude that strict adherence was essential or that a substitute or slight variation would not affect the invention. A person skilled in the art is a Canadian legal fiction used in patent law that is meant to denote someone of practical skill and knowledge in the subject matter of the patent, such as a technician. A Person Skilled in the Art is similar to the American standard of Person Having Ordinary Skill in the Art.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2009, {{the project}} [...] "Janus" [...] {{presented}} {{the results of}} an evaluation for public vote by the citizens of Rapperswil-Jona. The city museum will be renewed from January 2010 to autumn 2011, and therefore will be closed for visitors. Its historical intermediate section between Breny house and Breny tower will probably replaced by a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> integrated into the historic street-scape between Stadtpfarrkirche (parish church) and Engelplatz square. This new building serves both, as an exhibition space as well as connection between the two historical museum buildings. The formative north side of the town walls will be kept as it is. Investment and operating costs of around 5.6 million Swiss francs will be borne equally between local community and political community Rapperswil-Jona. Simultaneously with the realization of the project, the accumulated maintenance work on the facades, windows and roofs of the historic buildings and the town wall will be done.|$|E
5000|$|My Lords, {{a patent}} {{specification}} is a unilateral {{statement by the}} patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to those {{likely to have a}} practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e. [...] "skilled in the art"), by which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly. It is called [...] "pith and marrow" [...] of the claim. A patent specification should be given a <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked.|$|E
40|$|In {{the realm}} of tax law, as in other areas {{discussed}} in this book, Lord Hoffmann?s strongest theme {{has been one of}} <b>purposive</b> <b>construction.</b> Lord Hoffmann helped to review and revise an approach to tax avoidance {{at a time when it}} had moved away from <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> toward a judicial rule of doubtful propriety (the so-called ?Ramsay principle?). At one point, however, Lord Hoffmann?s explanation of his approach to construction threatened to create another type of formula - a distinction between commercial and juristic concepts, which proved to be impractical. What might have worked if always in his expert hands would not necessarily work in the hands of others. An approach that cannot be applied at all levels of the legal system is unlikely to be a sensible way forward. There is a tendency amongst lower courts, and those on the ground who have to implement legislation, to look for concrete rules and formulaic guidance. <b>Purposive</b> <b>construction</b> alone may appear to give rise to uncertainty, especially in an area where the purpose of the legislation can be elusive. In such circumstances, references to ?economic? or ?commercial? concepts do not provide the kind of guidance that is sought. This means that, despite the serious intellectual effort and judicial focus that have been brought to bear on the problem of construing tax legislation to give effect to the intention of Parliament, the case law on tax avoidance remains unsatisfactory and resort is frequently taken to legislative ?solutions?. Very often these legislative solutions take the form of specified tax avoidance provisions, but the apparent inability of the judiciary to solve the tax avoidance problem has led also to the introduction of a statutory general anti-abuse rule (GAAR). Lord Hoffmann participated in a study group advising on the development and adoption of a UK GAAR. This suggests an acceptance that the judiciary cannot tackle the problem of tax avoidance resulting from abuse of tax legislation without assistance. The legislative approach in the GAAR is not, however, one that relieves judges of the need to look at the purpose of the legislation. In fact it requires them to look very carefully at the purpose of the legislation, but provides a framework to guide them in this difficult endeavour and, in certain circumstances, allows them to go beyond the confines of pure <b>purposive</b> <b>construction</b> as it is usually applied in the UK. This solution neatly frames Lord Hoffmann?s views of the role of the judiciary in such cases...|$|E
