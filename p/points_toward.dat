5|$|Five weeks later, Oxbow {{was entered}} in the Grade II mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) Risen Star Stakes. Ridden {{for the third time}} by Jon Court, Oxbow was {{assigned}} the far outside post at number ten, and was the second favorite at 4–1. He broke fifth from the gate, moved to third passing the stands, but lost ground by being five horses wide around the first turn. In the stretch, Oxbow took the lead but could not hold it and finished fourth, although he and the three top-placed horses all ended the race within a length and a half of each other in a blanket finish. The winner was I've Struck a Nerve, at odds of 135–1. Oxbow again progressed in performance, earning a speed figure of 98 and five more <b>points</b> <b>toward</b> Derby qualification.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that <b>points</b> <b>toward</b> {{the center of}} Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs are located {{on either side of}} the valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E

5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) <b>points</b> <b>toward</b> {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the mineral}} classes {{detected}} may have formed in environments suitable (i.e., enough {{water and the}} proper pH) for life.

Sulfate deposits preserve chemical and morphological fossils, and fossils of microorganisms form in iron oxides like hematite. The presence of opaline silica <b>points</b> <b>toward</b> a hydrothermal environment that could support life. Silica is also excellent for preserving evidence of microbes.|$|E

25|$|Until about 10,000 years ago, ground sloths such as Megatherium {{lived in}} South America {{as well as}} in much of North America; they colonized the latter as part of the Great American Interchange. Along with many other animals, however, they {{disappeared}} shortly after the appearance of humans on both continents. Large amounts of evidence suggest human hunting contributed to the extinction of the American megafauna, like that of North Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Madagascar. Simultaneous climate change that came {{with the end of the}} last ice age may have also played a role in some cases. However, the survival of Megalocnus on the Antilles until about 5000 years ago (after these islands were finally settled by humans), long after other ground sloths died out on the mainland, <b>points</b> <b>toward</b> human activities as the cause of extinction.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{example of}} the anion-binding {{mechanism}} is the hydrocyanation of imines catalyzed by Jacobsen’s amido-thiourea catalyst depicted in the below diagram. This reaction {{is also one of}} the most extensively studied through computational, spectroscopic, labeling and kinetic experiments. While direct addition of cyanide to a catalyst-bound imine was considered, an alternative mechanism involving formation of an iminium-cyanide ion pair controlled by catalyst was calculated to have a barrier that is lower by 20 kcal/mol. The proposed most likely mechanism begins with binding of the catalyst to HNC, which exists in equilibrium with HCN. This complex then protonates a molecule of imine, forming an iminium-cyanide ion pair with the catalyst binding and stabilizing the cyanide anion. The iminium is thought to also interact with the amide carbonyl on the catalyst molecule (see bifunctional catalysis below). The bound cyanide anion then rotates, and attacks the iminium through carbon. The investigators conclude that though imine-urea binding was observed through spectroscopy and was supported by early kinetic experiments, imine binding is off-cycle and all evidence <b>points</b> <b>toward</b> this mechanism involving thiourea-bound cyanide.|$|E
