When we deleted sequences 50 to 200 nucleotides beyond the <b>s</b> <b>poly(A)</b> site, the s/m mRNA ratio decreased three- to eightfold in B, plasma, and nonlymphoid cells. The activity {{could not be}} localized to a smaller fragment but did function in heterologous contexts. Our data suggest that this region contains an RNA polymerase II pause site that enhances {{the use of the}} <b>s</b> <b>poly(A)</b> site. First, known pause sites replaced the activity of the deleted fragment. Second, the fragment, when placed between tandem poly(A) sites, enhanced the use of the upstream poly(A) site. Finally, nuclear run-ons detected an increase in RNA polymerase loading just down-stream from the <b>s</b> <b>poly(A)</b> site, even when the poly(A) site was inactivated. When this fragment and another pause site were inserted 1 kb downstream from the <b>s</b> <b>poly(A)</b> site, they no longer affected the mRNA expression ratio, suggesting that pause sites affect poly(A) site use over a limited distance. Fragments from the immunoglobulin A gene were also found to have RNA polymerase pause site activity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semiparametric procedure {{to analyze the}} effects of institutional and labor market factors on recent changes in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>distribution</b> of wages. The effects of these factors are estimated by applying kernel density methods to appropriately 'reweighted' samples. The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that {{the decline in the}} real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women.

The 9 <b>S</b> <b>poly(A)</b> +-RNA fraction induced synthesis of newt haemoglobin and globins in frog oocytes {{and in an}} mRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate, confirming its identity as newt globin mRNA. Translation of 9 S globin mRNA in reticulocyte lysate was concentration-dependent, the patterns of globin synthesis suggesting both preferential utilization and unequal amounts of the different globin mRNA subspecies.

40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{measuring}} the settling velocity (V <b>s)</b> <b>distribution</b> of pollen and spores 30 – 100 μm in diameter is detailed and evaluated. The method is called the ‘settling tower' and consists in taking sequential pictures of particles falling under gravity in calm air. The scene is illuminated by a cold light source, while a camera takes 15 pictures per second. Between 20, 000 and 100, 000 images are analysed to obtain the <b>distribution</b> of V <b>s</b> for a given set of particles. The method was validated using two standard particles with mean diameters of 68 and 108 μm, respectively, as well as Lycopodium spores, with a mean diameter of 35 μm. For each set of particles, the theoretical V <b>s</b> <b>distribution</b> was estimated from the particle diameter distribution and the volumetric mass using a non-Stokian law, as the Reynolds numbers of the particles were large. The mean V s was measured with the ‘settling tower' with less than 12 % error, while the standard deviation of the V <b>s</b> <b>distribution</b> was estimated with less than 51 % error. The maximum error on the mean V s was 12 % for the Lycopodium spores and less than 2 % for the two larger particles. The mean V s of Lycopodium spores was 4. 2 cm s− 1, and its standard deviation was 0. 7 cm s− 1. The reason for the small overestimation of V s for Lycopodium spores by the ‘settling tower' method is discussed.
