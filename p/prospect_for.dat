While Abbott supported Turnbull at the time of Andrews' spill, he subsequently resigned from the frontbench. Several others joined Abbott in resigning, including Nick Minchin, Eric Abetz, Sophie Mirabella and Tony Smith.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{sold his}} {{collections}} to the American Museum of Natural History in 1895; his set of 10,000American fossil mammals sold for $32,000, lower than Cope's asking price of $50,000. The purchase was {{financed by the}} donations from New York's high society. Cope sold three other collections for $29,000. While his collection contained more than 13,000specimens, Cope's fossil hoard was still much smaller than Marsh's collection, valued at over a milliondollars. The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope's ethnological artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia's foremost museum, did not bid on any of Cope's sales due to bad blood between Cope and the museum's leaders; as a result, many of Cope's major finds left the city. Cope's proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> fossils on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{marriage}} and children, Walter Jones reportedly had a wandering eye.

Kinne viewed him as a <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> a second husband, but Jones was uninterested in leaving his wife despite the rockiness of their relationship. When he declined to go on a trip to Washington with her in May, Kinne reluctantly went with her brother instead. Although the couple reunited on May 25, shortly after Kinne returned to Missouri, the relationship was quickly set on the rocks when Kinne told Jones that she was pregnant and he was the father of the baby. Jones, instead of responding with what Kinne expected to be an agreement to divorce his wife, ended the affair.|$|E

Leech recovered in time to win the national age title in the 100-metre freestyle in a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds, just 0.1 of a second outside Dawn Fraser's world record. She then posted a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds to defeat Fraser and Lorraine Crapp at another meeting in the following month.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous <b>prospect</b> <b>for</b> British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E
