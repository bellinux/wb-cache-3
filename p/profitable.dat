5|$|In microeconomics, the PPF {{shows the}} options open to an individual, household, or firm in a two-good world. By definition, each {{point on the}} curve is productively efficient, but, {{given the nature of}} market demand, some points will be more <b>profitable</b> than others. Equilibrium for a firm will be the {{combination}} of outputs on the PPF that is most <b>profitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially, Chicago still {{preferred}} palazzo-styled {{buildings with}} large light {{courts in the}} centre, because they remained the most <b>profitable</b> designs. The Wrigley Building, built under the 1920 law, demonstrated the effect of two ornamental towers {{on top of a}} skyscraper. Under the revised law, the Straus Building and the Pittsfield Building took the palazzo design and added somewhat stunted towers on top in the early 1920s, producing <b>profitable</b> buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Givors canal {{played an}} {{important}} role in the early industrialization of Givors and the Gier valley, and became highly <b>profitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The UERL's {{ownership}} of the highly <b>profitable</b> London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less <b>profitable</b> railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had {{a negative impact on}} the profitability of the group.|$|E
5|$|Animal House {{became one}} of the most <b>profitable</b> films in history. Since its initial release, the film has {{garnered}} an estimated return of more than $141 million in the form of video and DVDs, not including merchandising.|$|E
5|$|Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was {{released}} theatrically on 14 January 1959, during the Makar Sankranti festival season. With mediocre earnings {{during its first}} four weeks, the film became an above-average grosser. Its re-release was <b>profitable,</b> {{and it became a}} Telugu cult film.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on strong}} sales of WinFax, by October 1992 Delrina posted its first <b>profitable</b> quarter in three years. At the same time, the firm also {{announced}} {{its intention to}} acquire other software firms that sold into the consumer software market.|$|E
5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} fly to unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not <b>profitable.</b> To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not <b>profitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam {{was part}} of a {{syndicate}} which purchased a controlling stake in the Pettiagalla Estate plantation in Balangoda. He also owned a printing press which, though not <b>profitable,</b> was used to print ITAK's newspaper Suthanthiran (Freedom).|$|E
5|$|Despite closer {{co-operation}} {{and improvements}} {{made to the}} Bakerloo stations and {{to other parts of}} the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly <b>profitable</b> London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenue, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less <b>profitable</b> railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{grossing}} $6,000,000 {{less than}} Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Voyage Home {{was the most}} <b>profitable</b> of the series, grossing $133,000,000 against a $21,000,000 budget.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, George led the Air Transport Command, {{taking it}} from 130 {{obsolescent}} aircraft to 3,000 modern transports, operated by 300,000 airmen.

5|$|During {{his nine}} years as {{territorial}} governor, Edwards {{made a good}} deal of money through several <b>profitable</b> ventures, including farming, land speculation, and investment in sawmills, grist mills, and stores.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert {{eventually}} won the lawsuit, but {{his actions}} and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership {{had been so}} <b>profitable</b> that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer. In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate between two of his most <b>profitable</b> artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the Government of Pakistan {{decided to}} sell off {{seventeen}} <b>profitable</b> organizations including Khewra salt mines, but the plan was shelved. The mine is now operated by the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, a government department.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{were handed}} out at Washington, D.C. Metro train stations, and an online copy is {{available}} at www.washingtonblade.com. It is still unclear if DC Agenda will be a <b>profitable</b> publication.|$|E

5|$|Leopold, however, {{reneged on}} his {{humanitarian}} promises, and instead brutally exploited the locals {{and the land}} to gain what profit he could. Initially, the Congo Free State relied on exporting ivory to pay for its upkeep and to fund the Congo Arab war and Emin Pasha Relief Expedition in the Eastern Congo. As rubber became an important resource in the 1890s, it quickly surpassed ivory as a <b>profitable</b> export, which allowed the colony to become extremely <b>profitable</b> for the first time. Monopoly concessions to collect rubber in large areas of territory were sold to private companies, and the Force Publique, the state's private army, was used to force locals to collect it. In some cases, Congolese people who failed to meet their quota were killed or had one of their hands cut off. The system was immensely <b>profitable,</b> but {{the population of the}} Congo is thought to have been reduced by as many as ten million during the period that the colony was under Leopold's control.|$|E
5|$|Liquor {{was another}} <b>profitable</b> private {{industry}} nationalized {{by the central}} government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the <b>profitable</b> trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain {{at a lower price}} than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.|$|E
5|$|Merle Hay Mall {{lost its}} first anchor in 1991 when the Younkers Store for Homes closed after Younkers {{decided to stop}} selling {{furniture}} and appliances in order to focus on its more <b>profitable</b> fashion business. Kohl's replaced it in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Chickasaw Turnpike {{has been}} fully {{automated}} since shortly after it opened. As Governor Bellmon predicted, {{it has been}} a consistent money loser since opening. Improvements are funded largely through proceeds from the more <b>profitable</b> Turner and Will Rogers Turnpikes.|$|E
5|$|The Peoria {{facility}} {{proved so}} <b>profitable</b> that {{only two years}} later the Peoria facility employed 625 people and was exporting tractors to Argentina, Canada, and Mexico. Tractors were built in both Stockton and East Peoria.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the first boom period in private equity would be marked by the well-publicized success of the Gibson Greetings acquisition in 1982 and would roar ahead through 1983 and 1984 with the soaring stock market driving <b>profitable</b> exits for private equity investors.|$|E
5|$|The film earned $1,782,000 in the US and Canada and $1,420,000 elsewhere. RKO made {{a profit}} of $1,325,000, making it the studio's most <b>profitable</b> film of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of silk through sericulture was <b>profitable</b> for both small-time farmers and large-scale producers. Silk clothing {{was too expensive}} for the poor, who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp. The rural women usually wove all the family's clothes.|$|E
5|$|The public {{loved the}} film, with lines {{stretching}} outside of theaters as {{people had to}} wait for the next showing. This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a very large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period. It was the most <b>profitable</b> black-and-white sound film ever made, and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to Psycho and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films. Psycho was, by a large margin, the most <b>profitable</b> film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $12 million for the studio on release, and $15 million {{by the end of the}} year. Hitchcock's second most <b>profitable</b> was Family Plot ($7,541,000), and third place was a tie between Torn Curtain (1966) and Frenzy (1972), each earning $6,500,000. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $32 million in domestic theaters.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most <b>profitable</b> one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most <b>profitable</b> skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally <b>profitable</b> alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{conflict}} arose with Paramount {{over the}} film's budget. Foster had thirty days {{to set up}} a new deal with another studio, or Paramount would own the exclusive rights. He was inundated with offers and accepted one from First Artists Group, because McQueen would receive no upfront salary, just 10% of the gross receipts from the first dollar taken in on the film. This would become very <b>profitable</b> if the film was a box office hit.|$|E
5|$|A former Intel {{official}} {{reported that}} the Itanium business had become <b>profitable</b> for Intel in late 2009. By 2009, the chip was almost entirely deployed on servers made by HP, which had over 95% of the Itanium server market share, making the main operating system for Itanium HP-UX. On March 22, 2011, Intel reaffirmed its commitment to Itanium with multiple generations of chips in development and on schedule.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Proms {{continued}} much as before. The second {{halves of}} concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over {{sponsorship of the}} Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, {{most of which were}} not <b>profitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although much of {{the upper}} reaches are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept the navigation <b>profitable</b> for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the company}} {{has proven to be}} very <b>profitable,</b> they have had much less success at {{producing}} winning teams. Of the three major franchises they currently own (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only the Maple Leafs have ever won a championship, but not since their 1967 Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly <b>profitable</b> cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population. The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{enjoyed a}} close, happy family {{upbringing}} in Denmark, {{thanks largely to}} Queen Sophie, who nursed the children through their illnesses herself. Suitors from all over Europe sought the hands of Anne and Elizabeth in marriage, including James VI of Scotland, who favoured Denmark as a kingdom reformed in religion and a <b>profitable</b> trading partner.|$|E
5|$|Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was {{released}} on 14 January 1959, during the Makar Sankranti festival season. With average returns during its first four weeks, the film eventually became an above-average grosser and its re-release was <b>profitable.</b> It has cult status in Telugu cinema, and is an acclaimed Prasad film. Goldstone Technologies announced that they would attempt to digitise the film in 2007, but abandoned the attempt three years later.|$|E
