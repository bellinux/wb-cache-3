40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether there are real differences in emergency department (ED) performance between Australian states and territories. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of 2009 - 10 attendances at an ED contributing to the Australian non-admitted patient ED care database. The main outcome measure was difference in waiting time across <b>triage</b> <b>categories.</b> Results There were more than 5. 8 million ED attendances. Raw ED waiting times varied by a range of factors including jurisdiction, <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> geographic location and hospital peer group. All variables were significant in a model designed to test the effect of jurisdiction on ED waiting times, including <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> hospital peer group, patient socioeconomic status and patient remoteness. When the interaction between <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> and jurisdiction entered the model, it {{was found to have}} a significant effect on ED waiting times (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and triage was also significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Jurisdiction was no longer statistically significant (P = 0. 248 using all <b>triage</b> <b>categories</b> and 0. 063 using only Australian Triage Scale 2 and 3). Conclusions Although the Council of Australian Governments has adopted raw measures for its key ED performance indicators, raw waiting time statistics are misleading. There are no consistent differences in ED waiting times between states and territories after other factors are accounted for. What is known about the topic? The length of time patients wait to be treated after presenting at an ED is routinely used to measure ED performance. In national health agreements with the federal government, each state and territory in Australia is expected to meet waiting time performance targets for the five ED <b>triage</b> <b>categories.</b> The raw data indicate differences in performance between states and territories. What does this paper add? Measuring ED performance using raw data gives misleading results. There are no consistent differences in ED waiting times between the states and territories after other factors are taken into account. What are the implications for practitioners? Judgements regarding differences in performance across states and territories for triage waiting times need to take into account the mix of patients and the mix of hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Triage is {{the formal}} nursing {{assessment}} of all patients who present to an Emergency Department (ED). The National Triage Scale (NTS) {{is used in}} most Australian EDs. Triage decision making involves the allocation of every patient presenting to an ED {{to one of the}} five NTS categories. The NTS directly relates a <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> to illness or injury severity and need for emergency care. Triage nurses’ decisions not only have the potential to impact on the health outcomes of ED patients, they are also used, in part, to evaluate ED performance and allocate components of ED funding. This study was a correlational study that used survey methods. Triage decisions were classified as ‘expected triage’, ‘overtriage’ or ‘undertriage’ decisions. Participant’s qualifications were allocated to five categories: ‘nil’; ‘emergency nursing’; ‘critical care nursing’; ‘midwifery’; and ‘tertiary’ qualifications. There was no correlation between triage decisions and length of experience in emergency nursing or triage. ‘Expected triage’ decisions were more common when the predicted <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> was Category 3 (P < 0. 001) and ‘overtriage’ decisions were less common when the predicted <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> was Category 2 (P < 0. 0010). The frequency of ‘undertriage’ decisions decreased significantly when the predicted <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> was Category 3 (P < 0. 001) or Category 4 (P < 0. 001). There was no correlation between triage decisions and qualifications in the ‘nil’, ‘emergency nursing’ or ‘critical care nursing’ categories.

40|$|A lack {{of access}} to primary care services, {{decreasing}} numbers of general practitioners (GPs) and free of charge visits have been cited as factors contributing to the rising demand on emergency departments. This study aims to investigate the sources of patients' referrals to emergency departments and track changes in the source of referral over a six-year period in Queensland. Data from Queensland Emergency Departments Information Systems were analyzed based on records from 21 hospitals for the periods 2003 – 04 to 2008 – 09. The emergency department data were compared with publicly available data on GPs services and patients attendance rates. In Queensland, the majority of patients are self-referred and a 6. 6 % growth between 2003 – 04 and 2008 – 09 (84. 4 % to 90 % respectively) has been observed. The number of referrals made by GPs, hospitals and community services decreased by 29. 4 %, 40 %, 42 % respectively during the six-year period. The full-time workload equivalent GPs per 100, 000 people increased by 4. 5 % and the number of GP attendances measured per capita rose by 4 % (4. 25 to 4. 42). An examination of changes in the <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> of self-referred patients revealed an increase in <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> 1 - 3 by 60 %, 36. 2 %, and 14. 4 % respectively. The number of self-referred patients in <b>triage</b> <b>categories</b> 4 – 5 decreased by 10. 5 % and 21. 9 % respectively. The results of this analysis reveal that although the number of services provided by GPs increased, the amount of referrals decreased, and the proportion of self-referred patients to emergency departments rose during the six-year period. In addition, a growth in urgent <b>triage</b> <b>categories</b> (1 – 3) has been observed, with a {{decline in the number of}} non-urgent categories (4 – 5) among patients who came directly to emergency departments. Understanding the reasons behind this situation is crucial for appropriate demand management.

40|$|Patients {{who fail}} to wait for medical {{assessment}} in the emergency department (ED) have been {{referred to in the}} international literature as "did not wait" (DNW) or "left without being seen" (LWBS) patients or, indeed, simply as "walkouts". This is taken as a performance indicator internationally. In common with many countries, Ireland has very considerable problems in the delivery of ED care due largely to inadequate resources and the inappropriate use of EDs as holding bays for admitted patients. This is the first study of this size to profile the DNW phenomenon in Ireland. The charts of DNW patients were identified and the DNW status was entered into the ED computer record. Data concerning age, sex, time of arrival, date of arrival, <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> and presenting complaint were recorded. In the study period there were 11 662 patient attendances, of whom 871 patients (7. 47 %) did not wait for assessment. <b>Triage</b> <b>category</b> was highly statistically significant, with those in the lowest <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> having the highest numbers not waiting to be seen (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Assessment and {{treatment}} of the acutely ill patient have improved by introducing systematic assessment and accelerated protocols for specific patient groups. Triage systems are widely used, but few studies have investigated {{the ability of the}} triage systems in predicting outcome in the unselected acute population. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the association between the main component of the Hillerød Acute Process Triage (HAPT) system and the outcome measures; Admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality, and to identify the vital signs, scored and categorized at admission, that are most strongly associated with the outcome measures. Methods The HAPT system is a minor modification of the Swedish Adaptive Process Triage (ADAPT) and ranks patients into five level colour-coded <b>triage</b> <b>categories.</b> Each patient is assigned a <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> for the two main descriptors; vital signs, T vitals, and presenting complaint, T complaint. The more urgent of the two determines the final <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> T final. We retrieved 6279 unique adult patients admitted through the Emergency Department (ED) from the Acute Admission Database. We performed regression analysis to evaluate the association between the covariates and the outcome measures. Results The covariates, T vitals, T complaint and T final were all significantly associated with ICU admission and in-hospital mortality, the odds increasing with the urgency of the <b>triage</b> <b>category.</b> The vital signs best predicting in-hospital mortality were saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO 2), respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (BP) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Not only the type, but also the number of abnormal vital signs, were predictive for adverse outcome. The presenting complaints associated with the highest in-hospital mortality were 'dyspnoea' (11. 5 %) and 'altered level of consciousness' (10. 6 %). More than half of the patients had a T complaint more urgent than T vitals, the opposite was true in just 6 % of the patients. Conclusion The HAPT system is valid in terms of predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU admission in the adult acute population. Abnormal vital signs are strongly associated with adverse outcome, while including the presenting complaint in the triage model may result in over-triage. </p...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: The mass {{casualty}} triage system {{known as}} simple triage and rapid treatment (START) {{has been widely}} used in the United States since the 1980 s. However, no outcomes assessment has been conducted after a disaster to determine whether assigned triage levels match patients' actual clinical status. Researchers hypothesize that START achieves at least 90 % sensitivity and specificity for each triage level and ensures that the most critical patients are transported first to area hospitals. METHODS: The performance of START was evaluated at a train crash disaster in 2003. Patient field <b>triage</b> <b>categories</b> and scene times were obtained from county reports. Patient medical records were then reviewed at all receiving hospitals. Victim arrival times were obtained and correct <b>triage</b> <b>categories</b> determined a priori {{using a combination of}} the modified Baxt criteria and hospital admission. Field and outcomes-based <b>triage</b> <b>categories</b> were compared, defining the appropriateness of each triage assignment. RESULTS: Investigators reviewed 148 records at 14 receiving hospitals. Field triage designations comprised 22 red (immediate), 68 yellow (delayed), and 58 green (minor) patients. Outcomes-based designations found 2 red, 26 yellow, and 120 green patients. Seventy-nine patients were overtriaged, 3 were undertriaged, and 66 patients' outcomes matched their triage level. No triage level met both the 90 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity requirement set forth in the hypothesis, although red was 100 % sensitive (95 % confidence interval [CI] 16 % to 100 %) and green was 89. 3 % specific (95 % CI 72 % to 98 %). The Obuchowski statistic was 0. 81, meaning that victims from a higher-acuity outcome group had an 81 % chance of assignment to a higher-acuity <b>triage</b> <b>category.</b> The median arrival time for red patients was more than 1 hour earlier than the other patients. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates poor agreement between triage levels assigned by START at a train crash and a priori outcomes criteria for each level. START ensured acceptable levels of undertriage (100 % red sensitivity and 89 % green specificity) but incorporated a substantial amount of overtriage. START proved useful in prioritizing transport of the most critical patients to area hospitals first...|$|R

Methods: A pre–post-intervention study was used to compare ED performance following an extensive clinical redesign programme. Clinical teams and work sequences were reconfigured to promote the role of the staff specialist, with a focus on earlier decisions regarding disposition. Primary outcome measures were ED length of stay and National Emergency Access Target (NEAT) compliance. Secondary outcomes included referral and workup times, wait times by <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> ambulance offload times, ward discharges and unit transfers within 24 h of admission, representation within 48 h, and Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT) calls within 24 h of admission. Results: Two seasonally matched 26 week intervals were compared with adjustment for demographics, <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> and arrival by ambulance. Overall, there was an 18. 4 % rise in NEAT performance (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 17. 7 – 19. 1) while ED length of stay decreased by a total of 86. 8 min (95 % CI: 83. 6 – 90. 1). Time series analysis did not suggest any preexisting trends to explain these results. The average time to referral decreased by 74. 7 min (95 % CI: 69. 8 – 79. 6) and waiting times decreased across all <b>triage</b> <b>categories.</b> Rates of MERT activation and unplanned representation were unchanged.

40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{emergency}} nursing care of acute stroke by enhancing the use of evidence regarding prevention of early complications. Background. Preventing complications in the first 24 – 48 hours decreases stroke-related mortality. Many patients spend considerable part of the first 24 hours following stroke in the Emergency Department therefore emergency nurses play a key role in patient outcomes following stroke. Design. A pre-test/post-test design was used and the study intervention was a guideline for Emergency Department nursing management of acute stroke. Methods. The following outcomes were measured before and after guideline implementation: <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> waiting time, Emergency Department length of stay, time to specialist assessment, assessment and monitoring of vital signs, temperature and blood glucose and venous-thromboembolism and pressure injury risk assessment and interventions. Results. There was significant improvement in triage decisions (21 Æ 4 % increase in <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> 2, p = 0 Æ 009; 15 Æ 6 % decrease in <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> 4, p = 0 Æ 048). Frequency of assessments of respiratory rate (p = 0 Æ 009), heart rate (p = 0 Æ 022), blood pressure (p = 0 Æ 032) and oxygen saturation (p = 0 Æ 001) increased. In terms of risk management, documentation of pressure area interventions increased by 28 Æ 8 % (p = 0 Æ 006), documentation of nil orally status increased by 13 Æ 8 % (ns), swallow assessment prior to oral intake increased by 41 Æ 3 % (p = 0 Æ 003), speech pathology assessment in Emergency Department increased by 6 Æ 1 % (ns) and there was 93 Æ 5 minute decrease in time to speech pathology assessment for admitted patients (ns). Relevance to clinical practice. An evidence-based guideline can improve emergency nursing care of acute stroke and optimise patient outcomes following stroke. As the continuum of stroke care begins in the Emergency Department, detailed recommendations for evidence-based emergency nursing care should be included in all multidisciplinary guidelines for the management of acute stroke. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} inter-rater {{reliability}} of triages {{performed by the}} Electronic Triage System (ETS) which has recently developed and used in hospital emergency department (ED). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted prospectively and studied 408 visitors of Tabriz Imam Reza hospital’s ED. The variables of interest were age, sex, nurse-assigned <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> physician-assigned <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> disease type (trauma, non-trauma), and the referred room within the ED. Cohen’s un-weighted kappa, linear weighted kappa, and quadratic weighted kappa were {{used to describe the}} reliability. Results: Un-weighted kappa observed to be 0. 186 (95 % CI: 0. 123 - 0. 249). Linear weighted kappa observed as 0. 317 (95 % CI: 0. 251 - 0. 384) and quadratic weighted kappa as 0. 462 (95 % CI: 0. 336 - 0. 589). In general, low agreement was seen between the triage nurses and ED physicians. For trauma patients and for those who were referred to the cardiopulmonary resuscitation room (CPR), all three types of kappa were higher than other visitors of the ED. Conclusion: Inter-rater reliability of the triages performed by the ETS observed as ranging from poor to moderate. Implementing interventions that would create a common language between nurses and physicians about the triage of the ED visitors seems necessary. The more agreement on the triage of trauma and CPR patients might be due to their condition and the more attention to them...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionNurse-led triage, {{using the}} South African Triage Scale, was {{introduced}} to the emergency centre of the tertiary referral hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone in early 2014 prior to the Ebola epidemic. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the effectiveness of the process now that the country has been declared free of Ebola. MethodsThe study was conducted over a five-day consecutive period in the adult emergency centre of the main government teaching hospital in December 2015. The times from arrival to triage and medical assessment were recorded and compared for each <b>triage</b> <b>category.</b> We also assessed the inter-rater reliability of the process. Results 111 patients were included during the study period. In terms of acuity, 6 % were categorised as red, 27 % were orange, 20 % yellow and 47 % green. Triage Early Warning Score was correctly calculated in 90 % of cases and there was inter-rater agreement of colour code and <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> on 92 % of occasions (k= 0. 877, p< 0. 001). Median time from triage to assessment was 15 min for red patients, 20 min for orange, 40 min for yellow and 72 min for green. DiscussionThe triage process is functioning effectively in the emergency centre after the Ebola epidemic and provides a reliable assessment of undifferentiated patients presenting to the hospital to ensure that they are seen in a timely manner based on acuity...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Funding {{bodies have}} {{traditionally}} used attendance figures {{as a way}} of determining the allocation of funding for resources in the EDs. Using attendance figures only might not accurately reflect the funding and resources required. The need to create an easily implemented tool to compare workload and resources required was identified. Using the Australasian Triage Scale, a tool was developed to estimate staffing requirements and resource use within each ED. This, although currently not validated, provides a promising start in finding a way to accurately determine ED workload. METHODS: Existing data on patient acuity, disposition, numbers of patients and the individual costing of each presentation was used to estimate and define the workload of an ED in emergency care workload units (ECWU). The tool is applied to six de-identified hospitals within Queensland to demonstrate its potential use for equitable budget and staffing allocation. RESULTS: The tool was applied to a selection of de-identified EDs within Queensland hospitals. An increased number of ECWU is generated for a patient with a more urgent <b>triage</b> <b>category</b> reflecting a higher resource consumption and workload. DISCUSSION: Although a few studies have been completed in Canada linking workload, resource consumption and cost to <b>triage</b> <b>category,</b> this tool will need to be validated before its use can be fully appreciated. CONCLUSION: This tool provides a simple method to calculate equitable distribution of staffing and budget allocation based on workload across the different EDs within Australia. No Full Tex...|$|R
