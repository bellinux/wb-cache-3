40|$|The β-amyloid {{precursor}} protein is the precursor {{of the main}} component of senile plaques (the β-amyloid peptide or β/A 4) found in the brain of aged humans and, in higher amounts, in the brain of Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome subjects. Four different forms of β-amyloid precursor <b>protein</b> <b>messenger</b> RNAs have been described in humans and rodents: β-amyloid {{precursor protein}} 695, β-amyloid precursor protein 714, β-amyloid precursor protein 751 and β-amyloid precursor protein 770 messenger RNAs (numbers corresponding to the number of encoded amino acids). The two latter forms are characterized by containing in their sequence a region with high homology to the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. We have used oligonucleotide probes to study the distribution of the different messenger RNAs encoding each of the four β-amyloid precursor proteins by in situ hybridization histochemistry in human, rat and mouse brain. We found that β-amyloid precursor protein 695, β-amyloid precursor protein 714 and β-amyloid precursor protein 751 messenger RNAs were widely distributed in the human, rat and mouse brain and that their distribution was roughly similar in most brain areas in these three species. The distribution of β-amyloid precursor protein 770 messenger RNA was not so wide and differed among the three species studied. β-amyloid precursor protein 751 and 770 messenger RNAs were the only forms present at significant levels in rodent choroid plexus and meninges, while β-amyloid precursor <b>protein</b> <b>messenger</b> RNA isoforms containing and lacking the Kunitz domain were detected in the human choroid plexus. We also observed that the relative levels of β-amyloid precursor protein 751 and 770 messenger RNAs in the rat cerebral white matter {{as well as in the}} mouse and human striatum were higher than those of the β-amyloid precursor <b>protein</b> <b>messenger</b> RNAs lacking the Kunitz domain. While the most abundant β-amyloid precursor <b>protein</b> <b>messenger</b> RNAs in the brain of all three species under study were, in descending order, β-amyloid precursor protein 695 and β-amyloid precursor protein 751 messenger RNAs, the least abundant form was not the same for all species: in human it was β-amyloid precursor protein 714 messenger RNA and in rat and mouse brain it was β-amyloid precursor protein 770 messenger RNA. Our results show differences both inter- and intraspecies of the relative abundance and distribution of four β-amyloid precursor <b>protein</b> <b>messenger</b> RNAs in rat, mouse and human brain. The non-coincidence of the distribution of β-amyloid precursor <b>protein</b> <b>messenger</b> RNA isoforms suggests different physiological functions for the β-amyloid precursor proteins.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The 70 kilo Dalton {{heat shock}} protein is up-regulated when cells are under {{physiological}} stress. It prevents protein denaturation and incorrect polypeptide assembly, and inhibits apoptosis {{as well as the}} transcription of genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines. To evaluate if up-regulation of {{heat shock protein}} 70 can occur during pregnancy, we examined whether addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide to human amniochorion membranes in vitro stimulated heat shock protein 70 gene transcription. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amniochorionic membranes (n = 5), collected at the time of elective repeat cesarean section prior to labor from normal term gestations, were placed in an organ explant system. After 48 hour in culture, the membranes were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to an oligo dT primed reverse transcriptase reaction followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using heat shock protein 70 specific primers. PCR products were hybridized with biotinylated internal probes and identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. A p < 0. 05 was significant. RESULTS: Heat shock <b>protein</b> 70 <b>messenger</b> RNA was expressed by all fetal membrane preparations both prior to and following in vitro culture. Addition of lipopolysaccharide increased the concentrations of heat shock <b>protein</b> 70 <b>messenger</b> RNA in each sample tested from a mean of 35. 5 +/- 29. 6 ng/milliliter (12. 1 - 80. 1 ng/milliliter) to 169. 6 +/- 69. 9 ng/ml (51. 7 - 218. 2 ng/milliliter) (p = 0. 03). CONCLUSION: Human fetal membranes constitutively express heat shock <b>protein</b> 70 <b>messenger</b> ribonucleic acid.

In our model, only the charged, mobile <b>messenger</b> <b>proteins</b> contribute to the Debye length.

40|$|SummaryThe {{activation}} of N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors (NMDARs) in synapses provides plasticity and cell survival signals, whereas NMDARs {{residing in the}} neuronal membrane outside synapses trigger neurodegeneration.

In this study, we demonstrate that Jacob is a <b>protein</b> <b>messenger</b> that encodes the origin of synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDAR signals and delivers them to the nucleus. Exclusively synaptic, but not extrasynaptic, NMDAR activation induces phosphorylation of Jacob at serine- 180 by ERK 1 / 2. Long-distance trafficking of Jacob from synaptic, but not extrasynaptic, sites depends on ERK activity, and association with fragments of the intermediate filament α-internexin hinders dephosphorylation of the Jacob/ERK complex during nuclear transit.

To explore the possibility that low levels of vGEC proliferation may occur and participate in such diseases, serial studies were done in the passive Heymann nephritis model of membranous nephropathy, in which the vGEC is the primary target of antibody- and C 5 b- 9 -mediated injury. The results showed mitotic figures and positive staining for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen in cells whose location defined them as vGECs.

Extracellular vesicles have emerged as a new mechanism of cell-to-cell communication in the development of tumor diseases. MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) could mimic the effects of the mesenchymal stem cells from which they originate. Different studies have reported that MSC-EVs may exert various effects on the growth, metastasis, and drug response of different tumor cells by transferring <b>proteins,</b> <b>messenger</b> RNA, and microRNA to recipient cells. In the present review, we summarize the components of MSC-EVs and discuss the roles of MSC-EVs in different malignant diseases, including the related mechanisms that may account for their therapeutic potential. MSC-EVs open up a promising opportunity in the treatment of cancer with increased efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Being able {{to monitor}} cells at {{different}} times is key to tracking fundamental cellular processes such as differentiation and cellular senescence, as well as disease progression {{and the effectiveness of}} drugs. However, most approaches are destructive and involve lysing the cells. Different time points can be studied by using parallel cell cultures, but the inferred changes could also be the result of cell heterogeneity (1, 2). Techniques for extracting small quantities of the cytosol for long-term tracking of a single cell's response must manipulate picoliter-scale volumes, maintain high cell viability, and give an accurate reflection of the cell's multiple biological components, as well as avoid influencing the ongoing development of the cell (see the figure) (1, 3). Cao et al. approached this problem by culturing cells on top of a random arrangement of hollow cylinders, which they call nanostraws (2). These 150 -nm-diameter alumina tubes can sample 5 to 10 % of <b>proteins,</b> <b>messenger</b> RNA (mRNA), and small molecules from the cells but only reduce cell viability by ∼ 5 %. Their approach allows intracellular sampling and characterization at multiple time points from the same cells to track changes...|$|R
40|$|Deadenylation is {{the major}} step {{triggering}} mammalian mRNA decay. One consequence of deadenylation is the formation of nontranslatable <b>messenger</b> RNA (mRNA) <b>protein</b> complexes (<b>messenger</b> ribonucleoproteins [mRNPs]). Nontranslatable mRNPs may accumulate in P-bodies, which contain factors involved in translation repression, decapping, and 5 �-to- 3 � degradation. We demonstrate that deadenylation is required for mammalian P-body formation and mRNA decay. We identify Pan 2, Pan 3, and Caf 1 deadenylases as new P-body components and show that Pan 3 helps recruit Pan 2, Ccr 4, an...|$|R
