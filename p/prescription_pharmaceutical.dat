40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{relationships}} that seniors (aged 55 and above) experience with <b>prescription</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> brands, thus attending to situations where consumers have limited control over brand choice. Design/methodology/approach - A phenomenological study was conducted involving interviews with seniors in two Canadian cities. Phenomenology relies on a small number of interviews that are analyzed in depth and describes the lived consumer experience. Data analysis focused on types of relationships participants had experienced with brands and factors that influenced relationships. Findings - Analysis reveals four types of relationships that seniors hold with <b>prescription</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> brands. The interpersonal relationship metaphor of arranged marriages can be used to describe relationship forms that seniors develop with brands. The quality of relationship seniors have with prescribing physician, who acts as marriage broker, and brand attributes influence relationships with <b>prescription</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> brands. Consumer's ethos and nature of illness also influence brand relationships. Research limitations/implications - The study provides insights into brand choice situations where consumers have low control and addresses impact of intermediaries on consumer experiences. It opens the way for further research on mediated brand relationships. Practical implications - Marketing managers need to understand the role of intermediaries, where applicable, in influencing consumer relationships with brands. Originality/value - The study closes a gap in academic research (which is sparse) on relationships with <b>prescription</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> brands held by consumers - specifically older consumers. It also encourages a critical view of the arranged marriage metaphor as a means of understanding consumer-brand interactions. Griffith Business School, Department of MarketingNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} a mystery we {{uncovered}} while undertaking a detailed audit of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics producer price index (PPl). We summarize our puzzle as follows. From January 1984 through December 1989. the BLS price Index for SIC 28341 (<b>prescription</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> preparations) grew {{at an annual rate}} of 9. 09 %. For purposes of comparison, we have obtained monthly price and quantity sales data on all <b>prescription</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> preparation products sold by four major US pharmaceutical manufacturers, accounting for about 24 % of total industry domestic sales in 1989. Using Laspeyres price index construction procedures on these data that mimic BLS methods, we find that over the same time period. the four-company price index increased at only 6. 68 % per year. Finally. when we employ a Divisia price index procedure with smoothed weights that incorporates new goods immediately, the aggregate price index for these four firms grows at a rate of only 6. 03 % per year. Why is it that the official BLS price index grows approximately 50 % more rapidly (9. 09 % vs. 6. 03 %) than the Divisia price index? That mystery is the focal point of our paper. ...|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{from the}} NOx Budget Program and Ozone Reductions Willingness {{to pay for}} air quality is a {{function}} of health and the costly defensive investments that contribute to health, but there is little research assessing the empirical importance of defensive investments. The setting for this paper is a large US emissions cap and trade market – the NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) – that has greatly reduced NOx emissions since its initiation in 2003. Using rich quasi-experimental variation, we find that the reductions in NOx emissions decreased the number of summer days with high ozone levels by about 25 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: To {{describe}} {{indicators and}} processes developed and implemented for pharmaceutical assistance at the Einstein Program at Paraisópolis Community pharmacy. Methods: This was a descriptive study of retrospective data from January 2012 to December 2015.

The evaluated variables were pharmaceutical assistance to <b>prescription,</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> intervention, orientation (standard and pharmaceutical) and pharmaceutical orientation rate. Results: The pharmacy assisted, on average, 2, 308 prescriptions monthly, dispensing 4, 871 items, including medications, materials and food supplements.

40|$|Customer {{relationship}} management (CRM) can {{be considered}} to cover {{a wide range of}} behaviours, practices and processes that firms adopt to implement relationship marketing in practice. The key fundamentals of CRM, identified in academic literature, incorporate a customer focused strategy, executed through business processes and supported by technology. CRM is assumed to be positively correlated with long-term profitability. Indeed,numerous benefits have been ascribed to CRM throughout the literature. Studies on the quantitative benefits of CRM and customer retention report profit gains across various industries based on reducing customer defections. However, not all CRM projects are successful and further studies have reported on CRM failures attributed to a fundamental lack of understanding of what CRM really means. This dissertation reviews the literature on CRM and incorporates the critical elements, relevant to the practice of CRM, into an employee survey to establish the level of CRM utilised in an Irish subsidiary of a Global <b>prescription</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> company. The literature suggests that the pharmaceutical industry lags behind other industries in the implementation of CRM processes and technology. This theory is tested in the research undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Using {{the basic}} tools of {{intermediate}} microeconomic theory (such as {{taught at the}} level of undergraduate or first-year MBA courses), in this primer I present a framework that helps the reader gain an understanding of economic issues underlying the current political economy debates concerning the impacts on consumers (both US and ex-US) and on <b>prescription</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> manufacturers of moving to a world with more uniform pricing across countries than is currently the case. The impact on global revenues and profitability of moving from differential to uniform global pricing is relatively modest if confined to the North American (US and Canadian) market, with only Canadians bearing the brunt of higher prices, a most unlikely political economy outcome. The impacts on global revenues and profitability from global uniform prices become considerably larger, however, when one incorporates the much larger entire ex-US market, including not only Canada, but also Europe, Asia and other countries. I conclude with some observations on likely longer term outcomes. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E
