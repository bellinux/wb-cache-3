The main data source/informant of the research was Down Syndrome students class VII with inisials Tl. Data collection technique used was direct observation. The data was processed by counting the percentage of fine motor ability which consisted of 3 aspects, namely: <b>painting</b> <b>by</b> using all fingers, <b>painting</b> <b>by</b> using fingers alternately, dexterity coordination or eyes and hand speed.
