40|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining is a {{major and}} {{critical}} regional measure to prevent coal and gas outbursts (CGO) in coal mines. In this study, a novel method for selecting <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> against coal and gas outburst was studied {{on the basis of}} gas geology and rock strata control theories and principles for <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining and relevant regulations, which is that theories of gas geology were used to assess the outburst risk inherent in different seams of this mine, and then make preliminary selection of protective seams, and the technical feasibility of the proposed selection method was then analyzed using the theories and principles for <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining and relevant regulations. The case application study results show that the extraction of the upper <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> (UPS) caused significant decreases in the predicative indicators of outburst risk in the outburst-prone seam and thereby prevented CGO, and the novel method can provide a theoretical basis for selecting <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> against CGO...|$|E
40|$|Consensus on <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining {{technology}} {{to solve the}} problems of coal and gas outburst has been reached. For upper <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining, the effect of pressure relief and permeability in the lower protected layers is determined by the distance between the seams. If the distance is small, the effect of pressure relief and permeability on the lower protected seams is better, but there will be more relief gas flows to the working faces of the <b>protective</b> <b>seam,</b> and gas control of the working faces will be more difficult...|$|E
30|$|This {{technology}} has been further developed to extract desorbed gas from overlying de-stressed coal seams that are spaced {{some distance from the}} first-mined seam. Once the first (<b>protective)</b> <b>seam</b> is mined, the range of the de-stressed region develops upward at a strike fracture angle of 80 °– 85 ° and the de-stressed layer is located 10 – 150  m above the <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> (Yuan 2009 a).|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{reasonable}} {{consideration of the}} role of the second main stress in D-P criterion, the distribution of stress and deformation with the method of finite difference was simulated. And the stress relief angles along incline and strike according to the rules of stress and deformation were obtained. Then the protective area resulted from exploiting the lower <b>protective</b> coal <b>seam</b> were acquired. The results show that the stress relief angles along incline are 75. 5 and 77. 7 degrees, the ones along strike are 78. 4 and 83. 5 degrees in the sense of protection when the advancing distance is 300 m. But the real effective protective area is much smaller. The largest degree of stress relief locates in the protected coal seam corresponding to the upper and middle of the working face. According the simulation results and the water inrush coefficient method of effective water-resisting seam, the water inrush risk area of lower <b>protective</b> coal <b>seam</b> was divided, and the feasibility of exploiting <b>protective</b> coal <b>seam</b> was analysed and judged. Research results are of certain guidance and reference significance in the layout of mining and gas extraction for the similar coal mines...|$|R
30|$|With {{the use of}} a Y-type {{ventilation}} system, {{the coal}} in front of the working face in the first seam is mined, while gas from both the <b>protective</b> and protected <b>seams</b> is extracted through boreholes drilled in the retained roadways. In this way, integrated coal production and gas extraction is achieved. The extracted gas is separated into high- and low-purity components, and transported to the surface for use in electric power plants and domestic cooking and heating, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Different drill-hole {{positions}} {{may produce}} different drainage results in low <b>protective</b> coal <b>seams.</b> To investigate this possibility, a 3 D stope model is established, which covers {{three kinds of}} drill holes. The FLUENT computational fluid mechanics software is used to solve the mass, momentum and species conservation equations of the model. The spatial distributions of oxygen and methane was obtained by calculations and the drainage results of different drill-hole positions were compared. The results show that, from top to bottom, methane dilution by oxygen weakens gradually from the intake to the return side, and methane tends to float; methane and oxygen distribute horizontally. The high-level crossing holes contribute to better methane drainage and a greater level of control. Around these holes, the methane density decreases dramatically and a “half circle” distribution is formed. The methane density decreases on the whole, but a proportion of the methane moves back to deep into the goaf. The research findings provide theoretical grounds for methane drainage.|$|R
30|$|Integrated coal {{production}} and gas extraction is a scientific model for resource developments by integrating coal mining with gas extraction and utilization. Instead {{of the traditional}} “top to bottom” coal mining sequence in multiple seams, the first mining seam (it is also {{often referred to as}} a <b>protective</b> <b>seam)</b> is so selected in the integrated technology that its mining can result in the deformation, de-stressing, enhanced permeability, and easy gas drainage of its overlying and underlying coal seams. In the case {{that there is only one}} seam or no <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> is available, a roadway needs to be special excavation in the roof of the seam and a large number of cross-measure boreholes need to be drilled from the roadway into the seam for gas drainage to ensure that the seam is extracted in the condition of low seam gas content.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the paper is to solve gas {{limitation}} of the upper corner of working face of the <b>protective</b> <b>seam.</b> According to the actual situation of the 12 nd Mine of the Ping Dingshan Mining Group Corporation (hereinafter referred to 12 nd Mine), the technology of progressive and large diameter buried drainage pipe by crossing-hole was put forward, by the way of numerical simulation and field tests.

Then, making the third coal seam in Shaqu coal mine which is a coal and gas outburst mine as the <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> was being exploited and carried out the designs which included roadway, equipments selection and mining process. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, the gas extraction arrangements is designed, which provides the scientific basis and method for industrial experiment of the third coal seam...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{engineering}} practices used in mining the <b>protective</b> coal <b>seam</b> at Huainan coalfield in China, this study investigates the temporal evolution of three-dimensional {{stress of the}} protected coal seam by numerical simulation. The coal body of the protected coal seam should first be loaded and then unloaded with the three-dimensional stress being reduced simultaneously. In accordance with the forcing process around the coal body of the protected coal seam, permeability experiments were performed under fixed axial displacement with unloading confining pressure (FADUCP) and fixed deviatoric stress with unloading confining pressure (FDSUCP) stress paths. During the loading stage before the unloading point, the permeability and axial strain have a negative exponential relationship. However, during the unloading stage after the unloading point, the permeability and axial strain have a positive exponential relationship. Using the relationship between permeability and axial strain, along with the swelling and deformation of the protected coal seam, the permeability distribution characteristics for the protected coal seam was obtained. According to the permeability distribution characteristics of the protected coal seam, drilling designs for gas drainage can be optimized. Finally, the rationality of the drilling design was verified using gas data measured during mining of the protected coal seam...|$|R
40|$|The first mining of a <b>protective</b> coal <b>seam</b> through {{ascending}} stress-relief mining {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective techniques for eliminating the risk of coal and gas outburst during the exploitation of multiple coal seams containing high rich gas. However, the difficulty of controlling roadway stability in the upper protected coal seam above the goaf increases greatly after ascending mining. Based on the geological conditions in Guqiao Coal Mine in China, a numerical simulation model is established by means of Itasca 2 ̆ 7 s Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) software in order to analyze the influence of the ascending mining on the stress distribution of the overlying rock strata and the stability of the roadway with different support parameters in the upper protected coal seam. The results show the impact scopes of stress relief and concentration zones in the overlying rock strata are up to approximately 100 m and 90 m above the goaf. The vertical stress, plastic zone and displacements in one sidewall of the roadway in the upper protected coal seam are bigger than that of the other sidewall close to the underlying goaf side. However, the stability of the roadways can be improved efficiently by using the appropriate support scheme including high strength and pre-stressed thread steel bolt support combined with pre-stressed cables. Field measurements indicate that the displacements of the surrounding rock could be controlled efficiently in 41 days when the roadway is excavated in the upper protected coal seam above the goaf with a compaction duration of 150 days...|$|R
30|$|This {{technology}} {{has also been}} applied to extract desorbed gas from the underlying de-stressed protected coal seams. After the first seam is mined, the de-stressed range develops downward at strike and dip fracture angles of 99 °– 100 ° and 102 °– 110 °, respectively, and the de-stressed layer is located 15 – 100  m below the <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> (Yuan 2009 b).|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on {{the mining}} and {{geological}} conditions in No. 12 Mining District of Jining No. 3 Coal Mine, the variation laws {{of stress and}} deformation of the lower-protected seam along with the mining operation of upper-protective seam are studied by numerical simulation and field test in this paper. The {{results show that the}} distribution of in situ stress in protected seam is changed correspondingly during the <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining. While mining the protected seam, the vertical stresses around the protected seam experienced three stages: stress increasing before mining, decreasing after mining and stepwise steady stage. In addition, the <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining can also cause expansive deformation in protected seam and its surrounding rock, destroy the strata structure and release the elastic energy in advance, thus reducing the rock burst risk in protected seam. The results of numerical analysis and the field monitoring results are basically in agreement. The study in this paper will provide theoretical basis and practical value for reasonable design and safety mining of coal seams with rock burst propensity...|$|E
30|$|A special roadway {{should be}} {{excavated}} in the de-stressed and fractured region {{formed in the}} first or <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> for gas drainage. This technology has been developed to target the gas-rich zones in this region. This gas-rich region, which has a width of 0 – 30  m and height of 8 – 25  m, {{is located in the}} annular-shaped fractured zone above the two roadways of the working face (Yuan 2008 c).|$|E
30|$|The {{permeability}} of coal reservoir in China {{is generally}} low. The coal seams in Huainan are typical “three-high, one-low and one soft” seams, namely high gas content in coal (12 – 26  m 3 /t), high gas pressure (up to 6.2  MPa), high rock stress (the {{maximum principal stress}} is up to 26.8  MPa), low seam permeability (0.001  mD), and soft coal strength (Yuan 2006). The complex geological conditions pose serious threats to coal mining. In high gas seams, gas must be extracted before coal mining, however the low permeability of coal seams seriously affects the gas drainage effect. Based on the geological conditions of the coal seams in Huainan mining area, the technology of integrated coal production and gas extraction was innovated by Yuan Liang through mining a <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> with retained goaf-side roadways and “Y” type ventilation system. A key of the technology is to significantly increase the permeability of the overlying and underlying protected seams and subsequent gas extraction from the protected coal seams by boreholes drilled from the retained roadways (Yuan 2008). The technology of integrated coal production and gas extraction requires a detailed understanding of the deformation and failure of the surrounding rocks in working faces and gas migration and enrichment {{in and around the}} working faces, especially the fracture evolution of overlying strata after the <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> is extracted as the fracture distribution significantly affects the target zones of gas drainage by boreholes.|$|E
30|$|In {{multiple}} seams mining, {{the seam}} with relatively low gas content (<b>protective</b> <b>seam)</b> is often extracted prior to mining its overlying and/or underlying seams of high gas content and low permeability {{to minimize the}} risk of high gas emission and outbursts of coal and gas. A key to success with this mining sequence is to gain a detailed understanding of the movement and fracture evolution of the overlying and underlying strata after the <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> in extracted. In Zhuji mine, the No. 11 - 2 seam is extracted as a <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> with the pillarless mining method by retaining goaf-side roadways prior to its overlying No. 13 - 1 seam. An investigation has been undertaken in the panel 1111 (1) of Zhuji mine to physically simulate the movement and fracture evolution of the overlying strata after the No. 11 - 2 seam is extracted. In the physical simulation, the displacement, strain, and deformation and failure process of the model for simulation were acquired with various means such as grating displacement meter, strain gauges, and digital photography. The simulation result shows that: (1) Initial caving interval of the immediate roof was 21.6  m, the first weighting interval was 23.5 – 37.3  m with the average interval of 33.5  m, and the periodic weighting interval of the main roof was in a range of 8.2 – 20.55  m and averaged at 15.2  m. (2) The maximum height of the caving zone after the extraction of No. 11 - 2 seam was 8.0  m, which was 4 times of the seam mining height and the internal strata of the caving zone collapsed irregularly. The mining-induced fractures developed 8 – 30  m above the mined No. 11 - 2 seam, which was 7.525 times of the seam mining height, the fracture zone was about 65 ° upward from the seam open-off cut toward the goaf, the height of longitudinal joint growth was 4 – 20 times of the mining seam height, and the height of lateral joint growth was 20 – 25 times of the mining seam height. (3) The “arch-in-arch” mechanical structure of the internal goaf was bounded by an expansion angle of broken strata in the lateral direction of the retained goaf-side roadway. The spatial and temporal evolution regularities of overburden’s displacement field and stress field, dynamic development process and distribution of fracture field were analyzed. Based on the simulation results, it is recommended that several goaf drainage methods, i.e. gas drainage with buried pipes in goaf, surface goaf gas drainage, and cross-measure boreholes, should be implemented to ensure the safe mining of the panel 1111 (1).|$|E
30|$|Extensive {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} to characterize the roof gas-enrichment zone in the Huainan mining area. These studies have included physical simulation, numerical modeling, and field measurements, and have shown that a vertical fracture-controlled enrichment zone in the roof strata above the gob is formed after a <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> is mined (Lu et al. 2010). Owing to irregular piling of rocks in caved zones, this zone is ring shaped. A vertical fracture zone also forms between the caved zone and fractured zone above the gob. These zones allow gas accumulation and movement. The gas in these zones can be desorbed from both overlying and underlying seams as well as desorbed from coal left in the gob. The zone in the roof becomes gas enriched.|$|E

The method determines the swelling deformation of protected seam and analyzes it {{from the perspective of}} plane by analyzing the variability of “four invariant points around area” of protected seam before and after the mining of <b>protective</b> <b>seam.</b> Monitoring scheme and area analysis and calculation method are respectively designed applied in coal mine and laboratory; the monitor of “four invariant points around area” has been realized in the mining practice by arranging two measuring lines in the roof and floor of protected seam. The study scheme is designed to analyze the swelling deformation of the protected seam by the application of “four invariant points around area” in the engineering practice; the theoretical calculation method of irregular “four invariant points around area” after swelling deformation of the protected seam is put forward under laboratory conditions based on the Freeman boundary encode vector and measuring the length of quadrilateral side directly with the vernier caliper.; the reasonable scale of the 2 ̆ 2 four invariant points around area 2 ̆ 2 is discussed, it is suggested that different “four invariant points around area” should be established with different scale of 1 times, 1 / 2 times, 1 / 4 times and 1 / 8 times thickness of coal seam.

30|$|The 13 - 1 {{coal seam}} at Huainan mining area {{has a high}} gas content, low permeability, and low strength. The {{interval}} separating 11 - 2 and the 13 - 1 seams is between 70 and 90  m. Practical experience in the Panyi Mine showed that, in the stress relief zones in a protected seam, the dilation deformation is up to 2.6  % and the permeability can increase from 0.01 to around 33  m 2, an increase of 2880 times (Cheng et al. 2004). Because the interval between the protective and protected seams is large {{and there is a}} mudstone layer between the two seams, gas from the protected seam cannot flow into the gob of the <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> despite the permeability of the protected seam being high. The 13 - 1 coal seam therefore becomes a gas-enrichment zone and gas can be drained through boreholes drilled into the protected seam from a gob side retained roadway and from a 13 - 1 bottom roadway.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith the {{reduction}} of mine reserves in shallow coal-bearing series, the mining proportion of steeply dipping thick coal seam in deep strata is increasingly high. Deep exploitation not only increases the chance rock burst happening in mine, but also there are some difficulties for the stability of corollary equipments in working face {{in the process of}} full-seam mining of steeply dipping thick coal seam. 4 # coal seam of Huafeng colliery is under the geological condition of steeply dipping thick coal seam in deep mining. In the process of retreating mining, rock burst and stability of equipments always restrict the mine's production. Through comprehensive analysis of 4 # coal seam, including the places of rock burst happened, comprehensive management actions of rock burst and the relevant mining method and so on, found that adopted the exterior entry layout of dislocated strata gateway in the colliery is still inadequate to improve the problem of stability of equipments along coal seam floor.

40|$|A thin {{coal seam}} mined as a {{protective}} coal seam above a gas outburst coal seam plays {{a central role}} in decreasing the degree of stress placed on a protected seam, thus increasing gas permeability levels and desorption capacities to dramatically eliminate gas outburst risk for the protected seam. However, when multiple layers of coal seams are present, stress-relieved gas from adjacent coal seams can cause a gas explosion. Thus, the post-drainage of gas from fractured and de-stressed strata should be applied. Comprehensive studies of gas permeability evolution mechanisms and gas seepage rules of protected seams close to protective seams that occur during <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining must be carried out. Based on the case of the LongWall (LW) 23209 working face in the Hancheng coal mine, Shaanxi Province, this paper presents a seepage model developed through the FLAC 3 D software program (version 5. 0, Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., Minneapolis, MI, USA) from which gas flow characteristics can be reflected by changes in rock mass permeability. A method involving theoretical analysis and numerical simulation was used to analyze stress relief and gas permeability evolution mechanisms present during broken rock mass compaction in a goaf. This process occurs over a reasonable amount of extraction time and in appropriate locations for comprehensive gas extraction technologies.

40|$|Many Chinese {{coal mines}} are highly gassy with {{abundant}} coal mine methane occurring in complex geological conditions and emitted as a greenhouse gas {{into the atmosphere}} during mining operations. Major accidents due to coal and gas outbursts and gas explosions also frequently occur leading to fatalities and financial losses. Conventional technologies using specialized roadways and extensive short drilling holes are unable {{to meet the demand}} of today 2 ̆ 7 s high production mines with strict safety requirements and environmental regulations such as high carbon emissions. Longhole directional drilling technology has been widely employed in gassy mines due to its obvious advantages such as the high proportion of in-seam boreholes, high efficiency of gas drainage for gas mitigation and reduced cost associated with production down time. The effects were analysed and evaluated based on the application of introduced directional drilling equipment and techniques in Chinese coal mines. These results indicate that the complicated conditions involving soft broken coal, high in situ stress and the presence of faults and folds, present ongoing difficulties and challenges. Longhole directional drilling technology has been successfully applied in some Chinese coal mines for gas exploitation and coal mine gas emission mitigation. Daning Coal Mine (located in the southern Qinshui coalfields) and Baijigou Coal Mine are respectively extracting a thick coal seam. Both coal mines have deployed underground longhole in-seam directional drilling technology for seam gas extraction prior to mining operations. This technology has successfully achieved a high rate of gas recovery therefore reducing mine exhaust ventilation air methane (VAM). However there are still several limitations with the application of longholedirectional drilling technology. These include drilling difficulties in complex conditions, insufficient drill rod strength, poor gas drainage efficiency in low permeability coal seams and the inconsistency of the local Chinese-made equipment. Further studies include systematic evaluation of the drilling applicability within different geological conditions, improving equipment reliability, enhancing the permeability through <b>protective</b> <b>seam</b> mining, hydraulic fracturing and longhole pre-splitting blasting.
