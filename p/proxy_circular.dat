40|$|In Figure 6 we {{inadvertently}} {{labeled the}} <b>proxy</b> <b>circular</b> velocity as the virial {{velocity of the}} dark matter halo instead of what is actually plotted, the maximum circular velocity of the dark matter halo. The maximum halo circular velocity {{is a much better}} estimate of the disk V_c than is V_vir. This confusion influenced the discussion of the Tully-Fisher relation in our paper. In fact, Figure 6 demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} simultaneously reproduce both the local Tully-Fisher relation and luminosity function using semi-analytic techniques applied to the standard LCDM cosmology, thus contradicting previous studies of this issue and our own discussion in Section 3. 6.

40|$|As a {{shareholder}} of Air Canada, {{you have the}} right to vote your shares on all items that come before the meeting. You can vote your shares either by proxy or in person at the meeting. This management <b>proxy</b> <b>circular</b> will provide you with information about these items and how to exercise your right to vote. It will also tell you about the director nominees, the proposed auditors, the compensation of directors and certain officers, our corporate governance practices and special items of business to be addressed at the meeting. During the meeting, we will present management's report for 2009 and discuss our main business priorities for 2010. The achievements of the past year to stabilize the company have allowed us to renew our focus on transforming costs and generating new revenue. We will continue to leverage our international network and partnerships as we pursue opportunities for strategic international growth. We also remain focused on fostering a more nimble and entrepreneurial culture that empowers employees to re-engage customers. These priorities are key to the implementation of our strategy to build a stronger and sustainable Air Canada, creating value for the benefit of our stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|The study {{reports on}} the {{disclosure}} of governance information by Canadian banks. The information was found through their corporate Web sites. The online information {{was taken from the}} Corporate governance Web page and through the annual reports and the <b>proxy</b> <b>circulars.</b> We focused on the disclosure of the corporate governance practices implemented by our sample of 8 banks. A coding sheet was developed to evaluate the corporate governance disclosure of our sample. Our analysis indicates that the bigger the bank, the more disclosure there is. Overall, our results suggest that the choices to disclose and the extent of disclosure are influenced by the strategic considerations of management. We also found that, {{to be able to find}} full and complete information on governance, the investor should refer to the annual reports and the <b>proxy</b> <b>circulars</b> and not only focus on the corporate governance Web page...|$|R
40|$|Details of {{processes}} through which galaxies convert their gas into stars {{need to be}} studied {{in order to obtain}} a complete picture of galaxy formation. One way to tackle these phenomena is to relate the H i gas and the stars in galaxies. Here, we present dynamical properties of Damped and sub-Damped Lyman-α Systems identified in H-α emission with VLT/SINFONI at near infra-red wavelengths. While the DLA towards Q 0302 − 223 is found to be dispersion-dominated, the sub-DLA towards Q 1009 − 0026 shows clear signatures of rotation. We use a <b>proxy</b> to <b>circular</b> velocity to estimate the mass of the halo in which the sub-DLA resides and find Mhalo= 10 12. 6 M. We also derive dynamical masses of these objects, and find Mdyn= 10 10. 3 M and 1010. 9 M. For one of the two systems (towards Q 0302 − 223), we are able to derive a stellar mass of M∗= 109. 5 M from Spectral Energy Distribution fit. The gas fraction in this object is 1 / 3 rd, comparable to similar objects at these redshifts. Our work illustrates that detailed studies of quasar absorbers can offer entirely new insights into our knowledge of the interaction between stars and the interstellar gas in galaxies...|$|R

One way to tackle these phenomena is to relate the HI gas and the stars in galaxies. Here, we present dynamical properties of damped and subdamped Lyman alpha (DLA) systems identified in H alpha emission with VLT/SINFONI at near-infrared wavelengths. While the DLA towards Q 0302 - 223 is found to be dispersion-dominated, the sub-DLA towards Q 1009 - 0026 shows clear signatures of rotation. We use a <b>proxy</b> to <b>circular</b> velocity to estimate the mass of the halo in which the sub-DLA resides and find M-halo = 10 (12. 6) M-circle dot. We also derive dynamical masses of these objects, and find M-dyn = 10 (10. 3) and 10 (10. 9) M-circle dot. For one of the two systems (towards Q 0302 - 223), we are able to derive a stellar mass of M-* = 10 (9. 5) M-circle dot from a spectral energy distribution fit. The gas fraction in this object is one-third, comparable to similar objects at these redshifts.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the {{evolution in the}} dark matter halo circular velocity function, measured at a fixed physical radius of 20 kpc (v_ 20), {{which is likely to}} be a good <b>proxy</b> for galaxy <b>circular</b> velocity, in the Millennium-II simulation. We find that the v_ 20 function evolves remarkably little since z ~ 4. We analyze the histories of the main progenitors of halos, and we find that the dark matter distribution within the central 20 kpc of massive halos has been in place since early times. This provides evidence for the inside-out growth of haloes. The constancy of the central circular velocity of halos may offer a natural explanation for the observational finding that the galaxy circular velocity is an excellent predictor of various galaxy properties. Our results also indicate that we can expect a significant number of galaxies with high circular velocities already at z= 4 (more than one per 10 ^ 6 (Mpc/h) ^ 3 with circular velocities in excess of 450 km/s, and more than one per 10 ^ 4. 5 (Mpc/h) ^ 3 with circular velocities in excess of 350 km/s). Finally, adding baryonic mass and using a simple model for halo adiabatic contraction, we find remarkable agreement with the velocity dispersion functions inferred observationally by Bezanson et al. (2011) up to z ~ 1 and down to about 220 km/s. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures. Resubmitted to ApJ Letters after first referee repor...|$|R
