5000|$|Grooved {{coupling}} <b>pipe</b> <b>joining</b> systems uses a roll grooving {{technique to}} join pipes and <b>pipe</b> <b>joining</b> components. A groove {{is placed on}} the end of two pipes to prepare the pipes engagement with the coupling housing and gasket. The gasket creates a pressure responsive seal on the outside diameter of the pipe, unlike standard compression joints, where pressure acts to separate the seal. The gasket sealing is enhanced as the coupling housing is tightened onto the pipe end. [...] "The economics of the grooved method derive from simplified assembly that involves three basic concepts: a pressure responsive gasket that creates a leak-tight seal; couplings that hold the pipe together; and fasteners that secure the couplings.|$|E

The work uses CFD simulation to analyze the flow characteristics {{in the vicinity of}} the valve, including the pressure distributions and Frequency spectrum of the pressure pulsations downstream the valves and the vortex shedding allow predicting the torque fluctuations acting on the valve shaft and the possibility of generating mechanical vibration and resonance. These fluctuations are due to aerodynamic torque resulting from fluid turbulence and vortex shedding in the valve vicinity. The valve analyzed is located in a pipeline between two opposing 90 o elbows, which exposes the valve and the surrounding structure to the turbulence generated upstream and downstream the elbows at either end of the pipe. CFD simulations show that the best location for the valve from a vibration point of view is in the middle of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joining</b> the elbows...|$|E
40|$|The Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer and Fluid Integrator (SINDA/FLUINT) code {{has often}} been used to {{determine}} the transient and steady-state response of various thermal and fluid flow networks. While this code is an often used design and analysis tool, the validation of this program has been limited to a few simple studies. For the current study, the SINDA/FLUINT code was compared to four different analytical solutions. The thermal analyzer portion of the code (conduction and radiative heat transfer, SINDA portion) was first compared to two separate solutions. The first comparison examined a semi-infinite slab with a periodic surface temperature boundary condition. Next, a small, uniform temperature object (lumped capacitance) was allowed to radiate to a fixed temperature sink. The fluid portion of the code (FLUINT) was also compared to two different analytical solutions. The first study examined a tank filling process by an ideal gas in which there is both control volume work and heat transfer. The final comparison considered the flow in a <b>pipe</b> <b>joining</b> two infinite reservoirs of pressure. The results of all these studies showed that for the situations examined here, the SINDA/FLUINT code was able to match the results of the analytical solutions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Braze Pressure Welding (BPW) {{with high}} {{frequency}} induction heating is a newly developed pressure welding technique using interlayer metals for welding the general steel pipes for pipe arrangement in buildings. BPW enables to make joints by solid-state welding in air using a flux sheet {{which is also}} developed for this technique. In this method, the interlayer metal is expected to play the primary role in making high performance joints. At a joining temperature, the melted interlayer removes contaminations from the joining surfaces of the base metals. Then the liquid filler is discharged from the joining interface by the joining pressure, and forms fillets at the gaps around the joint. In this stage, the joining pressure is relatively small, so the welding deformation can be restrained to a minimum. The fillets have the effects both on relaxing the stress concentration at the joint and on increasing the joining area, which contribute to the strengthening of the joint. Thus, the high quality <b>pipe</b> <b>joining</b> without the dispersion in joint properties due to welder’s skill can be performed. In this report, the concept and merits of BPW are explained, {{and the results of}} the investigation on the cleaning effect of the interlayer metal and the effects of fillet formation on strengthening the joint are discussed. The practical application of BPW in Japan is also introduced. 1. Introduction and General Ide...|$|E

50|$|One area {{in which}} Poisson's effect has a {{considerable}} influence is in pressurized pipe flow.
