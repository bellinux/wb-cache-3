40|$|Abstract:- Increasing area {{overhead}} {{is a major}} design {{concern in}} low-power sub-threshold SRAM designs, due to stability considerations. The extensive growth of battery operated devices has made low-power design important in recent years. As electronics are being integrated into portable devices, the demand grows for increased functionality, with reduced size and long battery life. This implies a need to balance ultra-low power with area-efficient design. An obvious way to minimize energy per operation is to decrease VDD. This decreases active power, as well as leakage power, which is affected by DIB. If VDD is decreased too sharply, however, increased delay time causes the power-delay product (PDP) to rise, can be kept minimum if operated in Subthreshold region. In this paper {{the advantages of the}} sub-threshold inverter compared to the conventional strong inversion inverter with 90 nm technology in Cadence is presented. A one-Bit 6 T SRAM, sense amplifier, and <b>precharge</b> <b>circuit</b> is designed using HSPICE 45 nm technology...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Power-equalization {{schemes for}} digital {{circuits}} aim to harden cryptographic designs against power analysis attacks. With respect to dual-rail logics {{most of these}} schemes have originally been designed for ASIC platforms, but much efforts have been spent to map them to FP-GAs as well. A particular challenge is here to apply those schemes to the predefined logic structures of FPGAs (i. e., slices, LUTs, FFs, and routing switch boxes) for which special tools are required. Due {{to the absence of}} such routing tools Yu and Schaumont presented the idea of duplicating (i. e., dualizing) a fully-placed-and-routed dual-rail <b>precharge</b> <b>circuit</b> with equivalent routing structures on an FPGA. They adopted such architecture from WDDL providing the Double WDDL (DWDDL) scheme. In this work we show that this general technique – regardless of the un-derlying dual-rail logic – is incapable to properly prevent side-channel leakages. Besides theoretical investigations on this issue we present prac-tical evaluations on a Spartan- 6 FPGA to demonstrate the flaws in such an approach. In detail, we consider an AES- 128 encryption module re-alized by three dual-rail precharge logic styles as a case study and show that none of those schemes can provide the desired level of protection. ...|$|E
40|$|Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps are {{becoming}} the preferred lighting option {{for a large}} number of applications due to their high efficiency and long life. Since LED lamps require a power electronic driver to operate from ac line, the LED driver must also have a long life {{to take full advantage of}} the LED 2 ̆ 7 s longevity. However, the life of offline LED drivers is constrained by the use of limited-life electrolytic capacitors, as twice-line-frequency energy buffers, in them. Twice-line-frequency energy buffering is needed in all high power factor power electronic interfaces between single-phase ac and dc. The recently proposed Stacked Switched Capacitor (SSC) energy buffer architecture with film or ceramic capacitors can increase the life of single-phase ac-dc converters by eliminating electrolytic capacitors, while keeping the passive volume of the relatively lower energy density film/ceramic capacitors in check. This thesis presents a methodology for further increasing the effective energy density of enhanced unipolar SSC energy buffers by optimizing the capacitance ratio of the capacitors used in the energy buffer. It is shown that the relative enhancement in energy density depends on the required ripple ratio and the number of supporting capacitors in the energy buffer. The presented methodology is validated using a 1 - 2 enhanced unipolar SSC energy buffer designed for an 8 -W offline LED driver. This thesis also develops a method for precharging the capacitors in the SSC energy buffer that does not require a separate <b>precharge</b> <b>circuit</b> and presents new ground-referenced gate drive circuits suitable for low voltage enhanced unipolar SSC energy buffers...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{details the}} design of an SRAM compiler for quickly creating SRAM blocks for Cal Poly integrated circuit (IC) designs. The compiler generates memory for two process technologies (IBM 180 nm cmrf 7 sf and ON Semiconductor 600 nm SCMOS) and requires a minimum number of specifications from the user for ease of use, while still offering the option to customize the performance for speed or area of the generated SRAM cell. By automatically creating SRAM arrays, the compiler saves the user time from having to layout and test memory and allows for quick updates and changes to a design. Memory compilers with various features already exist, but they have several disadvantages. Most memory compilers are expensive, usually only generate memory for one process technology, and don’t allow for user-defined custom SRAM cell optimizations. This free design makes it available for students and institutions {{that would not be}} able to afford an industry-made compiler. A compiler that offers multiple process technologies allows for more freedom to design in other processes if needed or desired. An attempt was made for this design to be modular for different process technologies so new processes could be added with ease; however, different process technologies have different DRC rules, making that option very difficult to attain. A customizable SRAM cell based on transistor sizing ratios allows for optimized designs in speed, area, or power, and for academic research. Even for an experienced designer, the layout of a single SRAM cell (1 bit) can take an hour. This command-line-based tool can draw a 1 Kb SRAM block in seconds and a 1 Mb SRAM block in about 15 minutes. In addition, this compiler also adds a manually laid out <b>precharge</b> <b>circuit</b> to each of the SRAM columns for an enhanced read operation by ensuring the bit lines have valid logic output values. Finally, an analysis on SRAM cell stability is done for creating a robust cell as the default design for the compiler. The default cell design is verified for stability during read and write operations, and has an area of 14. 067 µm 2 for the cmrf 7 sf process and 246. 42 µm 2 for the SCMOS process. All factors considered, this SRAM compiler design overcomes several of the drawbacks of other existing memory compilers...|$|E

Here, we introduce {{an extension of the}} signature scheme by taking in account additional information related to the addressing order during March test execution. A first advantage of the proposed approach is its capability to distinguish between static and dynamic faults. Another main feature is the correct identification of the location of the failure in a given memory component: the core-cell array, write drivers, sense amplifiers, address decoders and <b>precharge</b> <b>circuits.</b> Moreover, since this approach does not modify the March test, there is no increase of test complexity, conversely to other existing diagnosis techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|The Shared/Common bus {{operation}} of AC drives is becoming popular in many industrial applications due to it's advantages such as cost reduction, reduced space requirements, and improved reliability. Depending {{on the application}} requirements, there are presently two methods to interconnect DC buses of AC drives; Shared-bus and common-bus. Very little or no {{work has been done}} in analyzing the use of such system configurations in industrial applications. In a shared-bus configuration, complete drive units are connected through dc bus fuses to form a common bus. These schemes require individual devices for protection and control, and still may cause bus fuse failures due to poor coordination among each drive's DC bus <b>precharge</b> <b>circuits</b> consisting of different converter front ends, such as diode and SCR. During the normal motoring {{operation of}} such systems, the proper load sharing of input converters must also be ensured, not to cause any device failures or nuisance tripping by exceeding the front end converter ratings. This may also require additional hardware between positive and negative busses depending upon the precharge configurations. The common bus drive systems used in a coordinated system can also be beneficial to user by using regenerative energy of larger drives to supply the other small drives which are motoring. The reliability of such operations must be ensured by analyzing the system and properly selecting the bus fuse sizes. The other version of common bus configuration is the concept of one large converter supplying many inverters {{to reduce the number of}} supporting components. However, as the number of parallel drives increases it is difficult to select the proper device ratings by testing. Therefore, an analytical method to determine the way of connecting t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{dramatic}} {{increase in the number of}} transistors on a chip and the increasing needs for battery-powered applications, low-voltage circuit design techniques have been widely studied in recent year. However, these low supply voltage research efforts have been focused mainly on digital circuits, especially on high density memory circuits. Reported success in achieved high performance low voltage operation in analog circuits lags far behind. Recent results have been presented on CMOS low-voltage operational amplifiers, where the supply voltage has been reduced to less than 2. 5 V in which the complementary input stages were used to keep the gm constant [SI 95] [HL 85]. Recently, the floating gate MOS transistor has attracted considerable interest as a nonvolatile analog storage device and as a precision analog trim element because it has threshold voltage programming ability [YU 93] [RC 95].;The particular focus of this work is on implementing very low voltage analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit in a standard CMOS process. As a proof-of-concept vehicle, this work concentrates on the design of very low voltage operational amplifiers in standard CMOS processes. By connecting a DC reference voltage source in series with the gate of all MOS transistors, the equivalent threshold voltage of all transistors can be electrically lowered. This technique makes it possible to decrease the power supply voltage. The DC reference voltage sources are realized by using a switched capacitor charged periodically and switched between the actual circuit and a reference <b>precharge</b> <b>circuit.</b> By extracting the reference voltage source directly from the threshold voltage itself, the threshold voltage variations due to the process and temperature variations can be compensated, since large threshold variations are intolerable for very low threshold voltage applications.;In a proof-of-concept two-stage operational amplifier designed to operate with a single 5 OOmV power supply in a standard 2 [Mu] process, the tail current is kept the same as in a 3. 3 V design, thus the key performance parameters are expected to be maintained at reasonable values. The dramatic decrease of the power supply possible with this approach is paralleled with a corresponding reduction in the power dissipation. Simulation results of this 5 OOmV operational amplifier show a 7 OdB DC gain, 7. 8 MHz unity gain bandwidth and a 650 phase margin. Power dissipation is reduced by more than 90 % from that of the corresponding 3. 3 V design. Although the specific implementation is focused on the implementation of an operational amplifier with comparable performance parameters to those with larger supply voltage, the dominant applications of this technique are for designing a variety of analog and mixed-signal systems that operate at very low voltages and with low power dissipation...|$|E

Circuits studied include Domino logic, N-P Domino logic and Two-Phase Dynamic FET Logic (TPDL). The TPDL circuits have been implemented and fabricated. The dynamic circuits are evaluated and compared with typical static logic circuits for speed, power consumption and layout area. Dynamic circuits are non-ratioed logic. Therefore, the transistor sizes can be minimized to reduce the layout area and the power dissipation of the circuits. Furthermore, dynamic circuits are faster than static circuits {{because they do not}} use PFETs for evaluation, only for <b>precharging.</b> Dynamic <b>circuits</b> consume less power than the static circuits because they have no short-circuit current and a reduced leakage current (only switching current flows in the dynamic circuits).

40|$|The correct {{functioning}} of a collimation system {{is crucial to}} safely and successfully operate high-energy particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the requirements to handle high-intensity beams can be demanding, and accident scenarios must be well studied {{in order to assess}} if the collimator design is robust against possible error scenarios. One of the catastrophic, though not very probable, accident scenarios identified within the LHC is an asynchronous beam dump. In this case, one (or more) of the 15 <b>precharged</b> kicker <b>circuits</b> fires out of time with the abort gap, spraying beam pulses onto LHC machine elements before the machine protection system can fire the remaining kicker circuits and bring the beam to the dump. If a proton bunch directly hits a collimator during such an event, severe beam-induced damage such as magnet quenches and other equipment damage might result, with consequent downtime for the machine. This study investigates a number of newly defined jaw error cases, which include angular misalignment errors of the collimator jaw. A numerical finite element method approach is presented in order to precisely evaluate the thermomechanical response of tertiary collimators to beam impact. We identify the most critical and interesting cases, and show that a tilt of the jaw can actually mitigate the effect of an asynchronous dump on the collimators. Relevant collimator damage limits are taken into account, with the aim to identify optimal operational conditions for the LHC...|$|R

40|$|Hardware {{implementations}} of mathematically secure algorithms unintentionally leak side channel information, {{that can}} be used to attack the device. Such attacks, known as side channel attacks, are becoming an increasingly important aspect of designing security systems. In this thesis, power analysis attacks are discussed along with existing countermeasures. In the first part of the thesis, the theory and practice of side-channel attacks is introduced. In particular, it is shown that plain implementations of block ciphers are highly susceptible to power-analysis attacks. Dual rail <b>precharge</b> (DRP) <b>circuits</b> have already been proposed as an effective countermeasure against power analysis attacks. DRP circuits suffer from an implementation problem; balancing the routing capacitance of differential signals. In this thesis we propose a new countermeasure, path switching, to address the routing problem in DRP circuits which has very low overheads compared to existing methods. The proposed countermeasure is tested with simulations and experimentally on an FPGA board. Results from these tests show a minimum of 75 times increase in the power traces required for a first order DPA attack. Some of the existing countermeasures to address the routing problem in DRP circuits do not consider coupling capacitance between differential signals. In this thesis we propose a new method, divided backend duplication that effectively addresses balanced the routing problem of DRP circuits. The proposed countermeasure is tested with simulations and results show a minimum of 300 times increase in the power traces required for a first order DPA attack. Randomisation as a DPA countermeasure is also explored. It is found that randomising the power consumption of the cryptographic device itself has little impact on DPA. Randomising the occurrence of intermediate results, on which DPA relies on, has better effect at mitigating DPA. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, GaAs {{heterostructure}} MOSFETs are investigated as {{a potential}} technology for digital circuit design. The devices under investigation are 0. 6 μm gate length, enhancement mode, heterostructure MOSFETs, with a high-κ dielectric (Ga 2 O 3), and an InGaAs channel. Historically silicon CMOS technology has been the natural choice for digital circuits, however the realisation of GaAs MOSFET digital circuits could allow full integration of RF, optoelectronic and digital circuits on a single system-on-chip. Additionally, there are potential performance advantages in using GaAs due to it's high electron mobility. For the first time compact models of complimentary GaAs/Ga 2 O 3 MOS are developed to enable an investigation into establishing a digital design methodology for GaAs MOS. Drift-diffusion models are developed and calibrated to measured device data. These models then provide information on the necessary device parameters to build compact models of these devices. BSIM 3 v 3. 2 compact models are developed based on this to enable GaAs MOS technology to be investigated using standard circuit design tools. The compact models have been adapted {{to ensure that they}} are physically relevant for GaAs devices. This includes some necessary approximations using effective medium theory. Further adjustments, or ratio corrections, are introduced to ensure that the internal physical parameters of BSIM will be correct. The models are compared to similarly-sized silicon devices to investigate the difference in performance between GaAs and silicon MOSFETs. As expected, the GaAs NMOS devices demonstrate improvements in drive current over silicon. However, the GaAs PMOS devices do not offer this advantage due to low hole mobility. Therefore, {{as a consequence of the}} high mobility ratio in GaAs, it is important to consider alternative digital design methodologies to CMOS to optimise performance. The performance of benchmark circuits is investigated for this technology in various digital design styles including CMOS, NMOS saturated enhancement load, and NMOS <b>precharge.</b> GaAs digital <b>circuits</b> gain a signifcant advantage in using alternative design styles to CMOS due to the relatively poor performance of the PMOS devices. In using the alternative styles the number of PMOS devices used can be minimised, and it is shown that NMOS precharge offers both speed and power advantages for this technology. The particular GaAs technology investigated does not outperform silicon in terms of speed and power. However, it has allowed a methodology to be established for future device generations, where performance is anticipated to improve signifcantly...|$|R
