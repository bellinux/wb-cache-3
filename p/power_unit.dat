5|$|Fernando Alonso {{received}} a new, revised combustion engine for his car, his third of five allowed {{over the course}} of the season without receiving a grid penalty. <b>Power</b> <b>unit</b> supplier Honda stressed that they had not used any development tokens, a set of limited allowed changes to the units, but had instead only improved reliability. The team also equipped both cars with new batteries and electronics control units, set to improve the reliability of the cars as well. During the two-day testing session that took place after the previous Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Renault introduced an updated version of their <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> which was used during the test to the satisfaction of driver Kevin Magnussen, who declared that the new unit was a step forward in both power and driveability. He urged the team to pull the introduction of the <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> forward to the Monaco race, instead of the following Grand Prix in Canada as originally planned. Renault chose to do so, however, they were only able to hand out one updated unit to both their works team and Red Bull, who used them under the name TAG Heuer. The two units were eventually given to Magnussen at Renault and Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.|$|E

5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings, with an auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E
5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a hybrid system failure in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre lockup into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a five-place grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby avoiding a grid penalty, which they would have incurred if a new <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their pace in qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The thermal <b>power</b> <b>units</b> {{operational}} reliability {{is the fundamental}} guarantee of smooth operation of electricity system. According {{to the problem of}} thermal <b>power</b> <b>units</b> {{operational reliability}} evaluation, a comprehensive evaluation method is put forward based on grey fuzzy theory. Firstly, this paper establishes an evaluation index system by the analysis of factors affecting the reliability of thermal <b>power</b> <b>units.</b> And then a reliability evaluation model of thermal <b>power</b> <b>units</b> operation is built based on grey fuzzy comprehensive evaluation which combined with the grey cluster theory and the fuzzy algorithm. At last, the numerical example is shown to verify the feasibility of the grey fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method...|$|R
5000|$|Solar Powered. The {{advantage}} of some solar <b>powered</b> <b>units</b> {{is that they}} have much more power over their lifetime than battery <b>powered</b> <b>units.</b> This gives them the advantage to report their position and status much more often than battery units which need to conserve their energy to extend their life. Some wireless solar <b>powered</b> <b>units,</b> such as the RailRider can report more than 20,000 times per year and work indefinitely on solar power eliminating the need to change batteries.|$|R
5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating {{to fly the}} 767 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} {{from the back of}} the grid due to a number of {{penalties}} incurred for changing engine parts. Honda provided him with an upgraded internal combustion engine, which had been designed using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E

5|$|Nico Rosberg {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} on Friday, {{ahead of the}} two Red Bull cars of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. The session started on a very wet track, but with no more rain falling, it dried out as the practice progressed, with drivers soon switching to intermediate tyres. Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest, behind Carlos Sainz Jr.. Despite going off the track late in the session, Fernando Alonso was ninth fastest in the McLaren with the new <b>power</b> <b>unit.</b> A gearbox problem meant that Pastor Maldonado was unable {{to take to the}} track, while at Sauber, Raffaele Marciello replaced Felipe Nasr, ending the session three-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Marcus Ericsson.|$|E

5|$|Since {{he did not}} post a {{lap time}} within 107% of the fastest time during Q1, Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} race stewards to be allowed to the start the race; they granted him permission to do so. After qualifying, McLaren had to fit his car with a fifth heat motor generator unit (MGU-H) and a fifth turbo charger for the season. As this exceeded the limit of four units per <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> element, Button was later handed ten-place and five-place grid penalties. As he was already due to start {{from the back of the}} grid, the penalty was substituted with a drive-through penalty, to be served within the first three laps of the race.|$|E
5|$|When {{the top ten}} drivers took to {{the track}} for {{the third and final}} part of qualifying, Nico Rosberg was able to beat his {{teammate}} Hamilton to pole position by 0.078 seconds, securing his fifth pole in a row.

Following a mistake on his last timed lap, Kimi Räikkönen finished fifth fastest, ahead of Nico Hülkenberg. Albeit racing with an updated <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> Daniel Ricciardo qualified slower than teammate Daniil Kvyat, and a ten-place grid penalty for the change left him nineteenth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing {{session at the}} Monza circuit and concentrated on optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle, but was cleared to race having been advised to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. Michael Schumacher's car developed a malfunction and pulled off the race track, limiting Ferrari's testing time as the car's <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> was changed.|$|E
