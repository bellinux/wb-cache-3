Lieberman's demand that the bill not include a <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was met, although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.|$|E
5|$|On November 7, 2009, {{a health}} care bill {{featuring}} the <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was passed in the House. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.

5|$|Obama {{called for}} Congress to pass {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in the}} United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
25|$|Hamsher {{is known}} as a strong {{advocate}} for a public health insurance option. In June 2009, she challenged the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) to pledge to vote against any health care reform bill that lacked a <b>public</b> <b>option.</b> Some of these pledges were videotaped. The CPC released their own letter shortly thereafter signed by 60 members, although the letter was vague as to whether it applied to the conference report. Ultimately none of the CPC members honored their pledge. Hamsher {{was one of the few}} liberals who opposed the bill until the end. She co-founded a non-profit organization, <b>Public</b> <b>Option</b> Please, to continue the fight for a <b>public</b> <b>option</b> and more generally for universal health care.|$|E

25|$|A model {{similar to}} one {{proposed}} by the late Senator Ted Kennedy would bring in between 21.5 million and 67.5 million according to the group.

25|$|A CNN {{report has}} stated that the {{proposed}} <b>public</b> <b>option</b> is a 'lightning rod' in American public opinion about healthcare reform.

This may then lead to a situation where most people end up being covered by the public insurance option.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Republican arguments that the Obama administration's preferred {{health care bill}} was too long and complicated, Grayson on March 9, 2010, introduced H.R. 4789, the <b>Public</b> <b>Option</b> Act (sometimes called the Medicare You Can Buy Into Act), a four-page bill that would allow all citizens and permanent residents of the United States {{to buy into the}} public Medicare program at cost.

25|$|As Senator, he {{introduced}} and championed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and legislation {{that led to}} the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. During debate on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, Lieberman's opposition to the <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was critical for its removal from the resulting bill. Lieberman announced in January 2011 that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his term, and he did so in January 2013.|$|E
25|$|Both {{before and}} after passage in the House, {{significant}} controversy surrounded the Stupak–Pitts Amendment added to the bill to prohibit coverage of abortions – with limited exceptions – in the <b>public</b> <b>option</b> or {{in any of the}} exchange's private plans sold to customers receiving federal subsidies. In mid-November, it was reported that 40 House Democrats said they will not support a final bill containing the Amendment's provisions. Stupak has said that 15–20 Democrats will oppose adoption of the Senate bill because of objections to its abortion provisions as well as its tax on high-value health insurance plans. In March 2010, Stupak voted for the Senate language health care bill excluding the Stupak Amendment language.|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the <b>public</b> <b>option</b> in the first place. Based on Baucus's political ideology and the per capita health care spending in Montana, Silver's model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting a public insurance option even if he had received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received from the health care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.|$|E

They reported that: “Seattle congressman Jim McDermott supports it. Washington senator Patty Murray wants it. So does President Barack Obama. So does the often conservative Seattle Times editorial page. So do 72 percent of Americans, according to a recent poll. So what's going on with Washington's junior senator, Maria Cantwell? Why doesn't she want Congress to include a public option—a new government-run health-care plan that will be available to everyone and will compete with private insurance companies to bring down costs—in its health-care-reform package?” Cantwell cited her concerns with getting the bill through the United States Senate as the reason for her opposition.|$|E
25|$|The Affordable Care Act faced {{considerable}} {{challenges and}} opposition after its passage, and Republicans continually attempted {{to repeal the}} law. The law also survived two major challenges {{that went to the}} Supreme Court. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, a 5-4 majority upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, though it made state Medicaid expansion voluntary. In King v. Burwell, a 6-3 majority allowed the use of tax credits in state-operated exchanges. The October 2013 launch of HealthCare.gov, a health insurance exchange website created under the provisions of the ACA, was widely criticized, though many of the problems were fixed {{by the end of the}} year. The number of uninsured Americans dropped from 20.2% of the population in 2010 to 13.3% of the population in 2015, though Republicans continued to oppose Obamacare as an unwelcome expansion of government. Many liberals continued to push for a single-payer healthcare system or a <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> and Obama endorsed the latter proposal, as well as an expansion of health insurance tax credits, in 2016.|$|E
