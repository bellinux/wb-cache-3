40|$|Some of the {{conceptual}} {{issues associated with}} pilot <b>aiding</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed and an implementation of one component of such an <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> is described. It is essential that the format {{and content of the}} information the <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> presents to the crew be compatible with the crew's mental models of the task. It is proposed that in order to cooperate effectively, both the <b>aiding</b> <b>system</b> and the flight crew should have consistent information processing models, especially at the point of interface. A general information processing strategy, developed by Rasmussen, was selected to serve as the bridge between the human and <b>aiding</b> <b>system's</b> information processes. The development and implementation of a model-based situation assessment and response generation system for commercial transport aircraft are described. The current implementation is a prototype which concentrates on engine and control surface failure situations and consequent flight emergencies. The <b>aiding</b> <b>system,</b> termed Recovery Recommendation System (RECORS), uses a causal model of the relevant subset of the flight domain to simulate the effects of these failures and to generate appropriate responses, given the current aircraft state and the constraints of the current flight phase. Since detailed information about the aircraft state may not always be available, the model represents the domain at varying levels of abstraction and uses the less detailed abstraction levels to make inferences when exact information is not available. The structure of this model is described in detail...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of a live Automated Incident Detection (<b>AID)</b> <b>system</b> using only Floating Car Data (FCD) in one of the first large-scale FCD AID field trials. <b>AID</b> <b>systems</b> detect traffic events and alert upcoming drivers to improve traffic safety without human monitoring. These automated systems traditionally rely on traffic monitoring sensors embedded in the road. FCD allows for finer spatial granularity of traffic monitoring. However, low penetration rates of FCD probe vehicles and the data latency have historically hindered FCD AID deployment. We use a live country-wide FCD system monitoring an estimated 5. 93 % of all vehicles. An FCD <b>AID</b> <b>system</b> is presented and compared to the installed <b>AID</b> <b>system</b> (using loop sensor data) on 2 different highways in Netherlands. Our results show the FCD AID can adequately monitor changing traffic conditions and follow the AID benchmark. The presented FCD AID is integrated with the road operator systems as part of an innovation project, making this, to the best of our knowledge, the first full chain technical feasibility trial of an FCD-only <b>AID</b> <b>system.</b> Additionally, FCD allows for AID on roads without installed sensors, allowing road safety improvements at low cost...|$|R

Parameter estimates from the expenditure systems are utilized to generate Marshallian price and income elasticities for 10 non-durable consumption categories. The analysis compares the explanatory power of the alternative expenditure system specifications {{by means of the}} likelihood dominance criterion for model selection proposed by Pollak and Wales (1991), which shows that the dynamic linear approximate <b>AID</b> <b>system</b> incorporating habits is preferred to the other specifications. However, the evidence indicates that the homogeneous static linear approximate <b>AID</b> <b>system</b> is the only specification that (i) does not suffer from lack of precisely estimated parameters and (ii) yields results that are interpretable and empirically plausible. The analysis then evaluates how the linear approximate <b>AID</b> <b>system</b> incorporating habits performs out-of-sample. We also examine whether simpler expenditure system specifications are more suitable for forecasting. Based on the Diebold-Mariano test proposed by Diebold and Mariano (1995) we conclude that our preferred dynamic specification does not yield more accurate predictions than the dynamic linear approximate <b>AID</b> <b>system</b> incorporating habits without cross-price effects or the random walk model. The evidence also suggests that the focus of dynamic forecast analyses of non-durable consumption categories should be on obtaining accurate price predictions, as prices account for most of the variation in the commodities’ expenditure shares...|$|R

These measures have led to lower volumes of water discharged by those mills recirculating water, and also to increasing problems in the mills.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} effect of student <b>aid</b> <b>system</b> on {{equality}} of opportunities and graduation times in {{higher education in the}} Nordic countries based on the existing literature and empirical research. The topic is relevant and current issue especially in Finland due to recent cuts made by the government to the student <b>aid</b> <b>system</b> which have raised many critical opinions regarding these cuts. The purpose of this thesis is to make an objective evaluation on {{the effect of}} the past reforms made to student allowance and student loan in the Nordic countries in the past decades. The main observations are that loan based incentives have had the biggest positive effect on decreasing graduation times in higher education. The studies also show that there isn’t enough evidence to support the claim that students with lower income families would be more risk averse regarding taking up student loans. Also {{there seems to be no}} evidence backing the statement that increasing student allowance increases the equality of opportunities. If the goal of the policymaker is to create incentives for decreased graduation times through student <b>aid</b> <b>system,</b> then a loan based system with loan refund based incentives for students graduating on time seems to be a much better instrument comparing to increasing the proportion of student allowance. I also conclude that there are no simple answers or single truths regarding a perfect student <b>aid</b> <b>system</b> which leads to the point that the goodness of the outcome of the system is dependent on the goals of the policy makers and every student <b>aid</b> <b>system</b> is a compromise made to optimize the goals of the policy makers...|$|R
