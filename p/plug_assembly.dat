50|$|One {{other problem}} can {{happen with the}} wattage rating of the power supply. There are 2 Dell power {{supplies}} that were used for different Inspiron models which have the same <b>plug</b> <b>assembly</b> and voltage, a 65 watt supply model PA-6 and a 90 watt supply model PA-9. Some models (for example the Inspiron 1100) shipped with a PA-9. If a PA-6 (or equivalent aftermarket supply) is used in these models then the system might not boot at times. In such cases, it will light the battery light {{for a few seconds}} when the supply is plugged in. This can also happen if the power supply becomes marginal. Marginal supplies can show as supplying full voltage even if tested with a volt meter while the supply is plugged into the computer and an attempt is made to turn on the computer.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally {{opposing}} {{piston brake}} calipers {{are made in}} two halves which are then bolted together. The advantages of this method are ease and the speed of which the pieces can be made. The disadvantage {{is that they are}} less resistant to flex under load. Calipers machined from a single piece of metal are stronger, but much more expensive to make so some manufacturers such as Sumitomo cast the caliper body as one piece and then machine the piston bores externally with the holes created <b>plugged</b> after <b>assembly.</b> This type of caliper design has been used extensively by Yamaha {{on a wide range of}} models from its flagship Yamaha YZF-R1 to the more budget Yamaha FZS600 Fazer.Monobloc Brembo first used on the Ducati 1098.|$|R

In order to clarify the influence of coupling between the structure and the fluid system at the control valve, the coupling mechanism was presented, and the numerical investigations were carried out. At the same operating condition in which the pressure oscillation amplitude is greater when considering the coupling, the low-order natural frequencies of the <b>plug</b> <b>assembly</b> of the valve decrease obviously when considering the fluid-structure coupling action. The low-order natural frequencies at 25 % valve opening, 50 % valve opening, and 75 % valve opening are reduced by 11. 1 %, 7. 0 %, and 3. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of this CRADA were to assist Halliburton in analyzing a composite bridge plug {{and to determine}} why their original design was failing in the field. In Phase 1, finite element analyses were done on the original composite slip design and several alternative designs. The composite slip was the component in the bridge plug that was failing. The finite element code ABAQUS was used for these calculations and I-DEAS {{was used as the}} pre- and post-processor in the analyses. Several different designs and materials were analyzed and recommendations were made towards improving the design. In Phase 2, the objective was to develop finite element models that would accurately represent the deformations in the entire all-composite 4 - 1 / 2 ' diameter bridge <b>plug</b> <b>assembly.</b> The finite element code LS-DYNA was used and the results from this effort were intended to expand Halliburton's composite design and analysis capabilities with regard to developing future composite components for downhole tools.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundCells heal {{disruptions}} {{in their}} plasma membrane using a sophisticated, efficient, and conserved response involving {{the formation of}} a membrane <b>plug</b> and <b>assembly</b> of an actomyosin ring. Here we describe how Rho family GTPases modulate the cytoskeleton machinery during single cell wound repair in the genetically amenable Drosophila embryo model. ResultsWe find that Rho, Rac, and Cdc 42 rapidly accumulate around the wound and segregate into dynamic, partially overlapping zones. Genetic and pharmacological assays show that each GTPase makes specific contributions to the repair process. Rho 1 is necessary for myosin II activation, leading to its association with actin. Rho 1, along with Cdc 42, is necessary for actin filament formation and subsequent actomyosin ring stabilization. Rac is necessary for actin mobilization toward the wound. These GTPase contributions are subject to crosstalk among the GTPases themselves and with the cytoskeleton. We find Rho 1 GTPase uses several downstream effectors, including Diaphanous, Rok, and Pkn, simultaneously to mediate its functions. ConclusionsOur results reveal that the three Rho GTPases are necessary to control and coordinate actin and myosin dynamics during single-cell wound repair in the Drosophila embryo. Wounding triggers {{the formation of a}}rrays of Rho GTPases that act as signaling centers that modulate the cytoskeleton. In turn, coordinated crosstalk among the Rho GTPases themselves, {{as well as with the}} cytoskeleton, is required for assembly/disassembly and translocation of the actomyosin ring. The cell wound repair response is an example of how specific pathways can be activated locally in response to the cellâ€™s needs...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{decision}} to cancel the Advanced Neutron Source (ANS) Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), {{it was determined that}} a hydrogen cold source should be retrofitted into an existing beam tube of the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at ORNL> The preliminary design of this system has been completed and an approval in principal of the design has been obtained from the internal ORNL safety review committees and the US Department of Energy (DOE) safety review committee. The cold source concept is basically a closed loop forced flow supercritical hydrogen system. The supercritical approach was chosen because of its enhanced stability in the proposed high heat flux regions. Neutron and gamma physics of the moderator have been analyzed using the 3 D Monte Carlo code MCNP. A 3 D structural analysis model of the moderator vessel, vacuum tube, and beam tube was completed to evaluate stress loadings and to examine the impact of hydrogen detonations in the beam tube. A detailed ATHENA system model of the hydrogen system has been developed to simulate loop performance under normal and off-normal transient conditions. Semi-prototypic hydrogen loop tests of the system have been performed at the Arnold Engineering Design Center (AEDC) located in Tullahoma, Tennessee to verify the design and benchmark the analytical system model. A 3. 5 kW refrigerator system has been ordered and is expected to be delivered to ORNL {{by the end of this}} calendar year. The present schedule shows the assembling of the cold source loop on side during the fall of 1999 for final testing before insertion of the moderator <b>plug</b> <b>assembly</b> into the reactor beam tube during the end of the year 2000...|$|E
40|$|Utilities in the U. S. operate over 75, 000 km (47, 000 miles) of old {{cast-iron}} pipes for gas distribution. The bell-and-spigot joints {{that connect}} pipe sections together tend to leak as these pipes age. Current repair practices are costly and highly disruptive. The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple cast-iron bell and spigot joints from a single pipe entry point. The proposed system will perform repairs while the pipe remains in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and installing a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated felt across the joint. This approach will save considerable time and labor, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service to customers (which would result in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of old cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct repair operations on live mains. The development effort is divided into eleven tasks. Task 1 (Program Management) and Task 2 (Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications) were completed previously. Task 3 (Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves) has progressed to installing prototype sleeves in test cast-iron pipe segments. Efforts in the current quarter continued {{to be focused on}} Tasks 4 - 8. Highly valuable lessons were learned from field tests of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast-iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. (These field tests were conducted and reported previously.) Several design issues were identified which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter repair robots for cast-iron pipe to assure their commercial success. For Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train), previous problems with bladder design and elastomeric material expansion in the large mains were addressed. A new bladder based on a commercially available design was obtained and tested with success. Minor improvements were highlighted during patch-setting tests and are now being pursued. For Task 5 (Design and Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera), the previous field tests showed clearly that, in mains with low gas velocities, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the system's capacity to remove debris from the immediate vicinity of the bell and spigot joints. Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (the flails were found to be very effective in cleaning bell and spigot joints) falls directly to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak-free repair. Similarly, it is also deemed necessary to design an assembly to capture existing servicetap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. Task 6 (Design and Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabVIEW. However, this must now be revisited to add control routines for the coupon catcher that will be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function. Task 7 (Design and Fabricate Large Diameter Live Access System) progressed to completing the detailed design for a bolt-on entry fitting for 12 -inch diameter cast-iron pipe in the current quarter. The drilling assembly for cutting an access hole through the wall of the gas main was also designed, along with a <b>plug</b> <b>assembly</b> to allow removing all tools from the live main and setting a blind flange on the entry fitting prior to burial. These designs are described in detail in the report. Task 8 (System Integration and Laboratory Validation) continued with the development of the robot module inter-connects and of a master LabVIEW-based system display and control software...|$|E
40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} and assembly challenges emerged {{due to the}} increased demand for products variety. Increased product variety caused by product evolution, customization and changes in their manufacturing systems. Variety allows manufacturers to satisfy {{a wide range of}} customer requirements, {{but it can also be}} a major contributing factor to complexity of assembly. Complexity is generally believed to be one of the main causes of the present challenges in manufacturing systems. Complex assembly systems are costly to implement, run, control and maintain. Complexity of assembly is an important characteristic worth exploring and modeling in the early design stage. Assessing complexity of a product is essential in being able to predict the cost and time needed to implement it. There is a relationship between the complexity of assembled products and the complexity of their assembly equipment and systems. The main objective of this research is to the complexity of assembly by: (1) Assessing the complexity of assembled products, (2) Assessing the complexity of their assembly systems, and (3) Derive the relationship between products and assembly systems complexities. First, a product complexity model has been developed by incorporating the information amount, content and diversity as well as the Design for Ease of Assembly (DFA) principles for assembled products. The new product complexity model assesses the total product assembly complexity using aggregated index for individual parts complexity. The new measure accounts for the different parts 2 Ì† 7 assembly attributes as well as their number and variety. Second, a structural classification coding (SCC) scheme has been extended to measure assembly systems complexity. It considers the inherent structural complexity of typical assembly equipment. The derived assembly system 2 Ì† 7 s complexity accounts for the number, diversity and information content within each class of assembly system modules. Third, a dependency matrix which represents the interactions between parts assembly attributes and assembly system functions has been developed. It is used to predict the complexity of corresponding assembly equipment used for a certain product. A relationship between parts complexity and assembly equipment complexity has been developed using regression analysis. This research is applicable to the mechanical assembly of medium size products. An automobile piston, a domestic appliance drive, a car fan motor and a family of three-pin electric power <b>plugs</b> and their <b>assembly</b> systems were used as case studies to demonstrate the proposed approach and complexity assessment tools. The significance and importance of these research contributions is that: the developed complexity metrics can be used as decision support tools for products and systems designers to compare and rationalize various alternatives and select the design that meets the requirements while reducing potential assembly complexity and associated cost. Assessing complexity of assembly helps and guides designers in creating assembly-oriented product designs and following steps to reduce and manage sources of assembly complexity. On the other hand, reducing complexity of assembly helps lower assembly cost and time, improve productivity and quality, and increase profitability an...|$|R
