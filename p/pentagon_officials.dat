25|$|After {{repeated}} {{experiences with}} providing prepared rations to soldiers dating from before World War II, <b>Pentagon</b> <b>officials</b> ultimately realized that simply providing a nutritionally balanced meal {{in the field}} was not adequate. Service members in various geographic regions and combat situations often required different subsets of ingredients for food to be considered palatable over long periods. Moreover, catering to individual tastes and preferences would encourage service members to actually consume the whole ration and its nutrition. Most importantly, the use of specialized forces in extreme environments {{and the necessity of}} carrying increasingly heavy field loads while on foot during extended missions required significantly lighter alternatives to standard canned wet rations.|$|E

By this point the {{projected}} cost of the program had risen to over $100 million per aircraft, although this was lifetime cost over 20 years. He was informed of the relatively new work on stealth aircraft that had started in 1975, and he decided that this was a better avenue of approach than the B-1. <b>Pentagon</b> <b>officials</b> also stated that the AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) launched from the existing B-52 fleet would give the USAF equal capability of penetrating Soviet airspace. With a range of , the ALCM could be launched well outside the range of any Soviet defenses and penetrate at low altitude like a bomber (with a much lower radar cross-section due to smaller size), and in much greater numbers at a lower cost. [...] A small number of B-52s could launch hundreds of ALCMs, saturating the defense. A program to improve the B-52 and develop and deploy the ALCM would cost perhaps 20% of the price to deploy the planned 244 B-1As.|$|E

It was well known to Minh and his close supporters that Harkins had strongly opposed the coup and tried to stop it. As a result, they distrusted him as a [...] "symbol of the old order" [...] and did not [...] "look for advice" [...] from <b>Pentagon</b> <b>officials.</b> Lacking influence on the new government, Harkins fell significantly behind Lodge as the leading American in Saigon. According to Kahin, the two were never close and [...] "if prior to the ouster of Diệm they appeared to be estranged team members, thereafter they hardly seemed {{to be on the same}} team." [...] In a report to US President Lyndon Baines Johnson in December 1963, McNamara claimed that [...] "The Country Team is the second major weakness [...] It lacks leadership and is not working to a common plan...Above all Lodge has virtually no official contact with Harkins.

2500|$|Before the {{destruction}} of USA-193, <b>Pentagon</b> <b>officials</b> repeatedly denied that {{it was meant to}} bolster the U.S. missile defense program.

Galbraith contributed to the survey's unconventional conclusion about general ineffectiveness of strategic bombing in stopping the war production in Germany, which went up instead. The conclusion created a controversy, with Nitze siding with the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>officials,</b> who declared the opposite.
