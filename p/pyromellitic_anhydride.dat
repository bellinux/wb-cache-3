50|$|Aromatic polyimides are {{synthesized}} by {{the reaction}} of dianhydrides with diamines, for example, <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> with p-phenylenediamine. It can also be accomplished using diisocyanates in place of diamines. Solubility considerations sometimes suggest use of the half acid-half ester of the dianhydride, instead of the dianhydride itself. Polymerization is accomplished by a two-stage process due to the insolubility of polyimides. The first stage forms a soluble and fusible high-molecular-weight poly(amic acid) in a polar aprotic solvent such as NMP or N,N-dimethylacetamide. The poly(amic aicd) can then be processed into the desired physical form of the final plymer product (e.g., film, fiber, laminate, coating) which is insoluble and infusible.|$|E

This modification causes {{a major change}} in the water adsorption isotherm of the lyophilized protein powder. Little water is bound by the modified enzyme at water activity (a(w)) below 0. 35, but it shows increased water binding at a(w) over 0. 5. This correlates with a similar change in the a(w) dependence of the catalytic activity of the enzyme powder suspended in hexane, with a much steeper increase in activity of the modified chymotrypsin...|$|E

The buffer layer is made from an inert low-Z material (low atomic weight), a material that absorbs secondary X-rays emissions from the substrate that are generated from the substrate upon exposure to a primary X-rays source. Suitable materials for the buffer layer include polyamides and polyimide. The preferred polyimide is synthesized from <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and oxydianiline (PMDA-ODA) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} the incorporation of a new additive to asphalt cement oil (CAP). A polyol product was obtained through the oxypropylation reaction of sugarcane bagasse. This polyol was polymerised with <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> in order to obtain a polyester (BCP) to test its suitability in terms of the material properties to be applied as additives. FTIR spectra of the polymerised material (BCP) confirmed the occurrence of chemical modification due to the appearance of a new band at 1750 cm- 1, characteristic of ester groups. The TGA data showed that the BCP product had higher thermal stability than the polyol. According to the softening point and elastic recovery tests, the incorporation of 11 % and 16 % w/w BCP in conventional CAP met the specifications of regulatory standards...|$|E
40|$|A new polyimide-silver {{nanocomposite}} containing diphenyl sulfone moiety in {{the main}} chain was synthesized using a convenient ultraviolet irradiation technique. AgNO 3 {{was used as a}} source of the silver nanoparticles. Polyimide 3, as a polymer source, was synthesized by the polycondensation reaction of 4, 4 '-diamino diphenyl sulfone 1 with <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> 2 in the presence of iso-quinoline as base and m-cresol as solvent. The resulting composite film 3 a was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, Uv-vis analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that silver nanoparticles are present in polyimide matrix. This data is in good agreement with the result obtained from TEM and shows the silver nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed in the polyimide matrix. The UV-vis spectrum shows a single peak at 425 nm, arising from the surface plasmon absorption of the silver nanoparticles...|$|E
30|$|Vanadium oxide, iron {{vanadate}} or {{vanadic acid}} doped with alkali or alkaline earth metal ions are suitable catalysts for anthracene oxidation [16, 33, 34]. Industrially, the reaction {{has been carried}} out at temperatures in the range 320 – 390  °C and using catalysts consisting of V 2 O 5, K 2 SO 4 and Fe 2 O 3 on pumice; yields of 95 – 97  wt% of anthraquinone were reported [17]. A reaction scheme derived from the oxidation of anthracene using V 2 O 5 –MoO 3 –P 2 O 5 and V 2 O 5 –Fe 2 O 3 as catalysts can be found [33]. In this case, oxidation at the inner and outer rings of anthracene leads to 9, 10 -anthraquinone, 1, 4 -anthraquinone and 2, 3 -naphthalic anhydride. At high conversion, the selectivities towards these compounds decreases and production of phthalic anhydride, <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and CO 2 is favored.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new {{thermally}} stable polyimide–silver nanocomposite containing dibenzalacetone moiety in {{the main}} chain was synthesized by a convenient ultraviolet irradiation technique. A precursor such as AgNO 3 {{was used as the}} source of the silver nanoparticles. Polyimide 6 as a source of polymer was prepared by polycondensation reaction of 2, 5 -bis(4 -aminobenzylidene) cyclopentanone 4 with <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> 5 in m-cresol solution and in the presence of iso-quinoline as a base. The resulting nanocomposite film was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA), differential gravimetric analyses (DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the formation and dispersion of silver nanoparticles in polymer matrix having average size of ∼ 20  nm. Incorporation of inorganic metal silver nanoparticles has improved the thermal behavior of the nanocomposite film as compared to pure polyimide film. Also 2, 5 -bis(4 -aminobenzylidene) cyclopentanone 4 was synthesized by using a two-step reaction...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the rheological behavior study of castor oil mixed with different pyromellitic esters. The pyromellitic tetraesters used were obtained through the esterification of <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> {{with a special}} alcohol of a complex alkyl-aryl structure (2 -phenoxy-ethanol) {{in conjunction with a}} linear aliphatic alcohol with variable length (n-butanol, n-decanol). The influence of pyromellitic esters’ structure and concentration was determined, {{as well as that of}} temperature, on the rheological behavior, by setting the dependence between the shear stress τ and the shear rate γ. The analysis of dependence between τ and γ demonstrates that the studied solutions have Newtonian behavior. The evolution of samples' viscosity with temperature was characterized by Arrhenius type equations, being established the values of viscous flow activation energy, Ea. This constant can be correlated with the effect of reducing friction in the presence of additives. It was also realized a characterization of annulus fluids flow under the effect of rotational motion, calculating the values of Taylor-Reynolds number (TaRe) ...|$|E
30|$|Almost {{complete}} {{conversion of}} anthracene with high selectivity to 9, 10 -anthraquinone {{is possible and}} 9, 10 -anthraquinone of 99 % purity is industrially produced in this way [32]. Secondary and complete combustion products are also obtained is small amounts. Carbons in the 9 - and 10 -positions are the most reactive centers of attack in the anthracene molecule [6]. The attack of oxygen on these carbons results {{in the production of}} 9, 10 -anthraquinone. On the other hand, the unselective oxidation of the carbons in the 1 - to 4 -positions, i.e., carbons in the outer ring, gives ketone (1, 4 -anthraquinone) and anhydride (2, 3 -naphthalic anhydride and <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride)</b> species as by-products [33]. The production of small quantities of phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, CO and CO 2 has also been reported [16, 33, 34]. The higher selectivity of the oxidation reaction can be explained in terms of the Clar formalism [35], noting that in anthracene additional stabilization of the outermost rings can be achieved if the π-electrons on the 9, 10 -positions are more localized.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{isothermal}} ageing on two high temperature, bismaleimide composite materials, a novel CSIRO CBR 320 / 328 composite and a commercial CIBA GEIGY Matrimid&# 0174; 5292 composite, was examined at 204 and 250 &# 0176;C. Delamination {{is a major}} cause of failure in composite materials, therefore, the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness (GIC) of both materials was measured using the double cantilever beam (DCB) test. Chemical degradation of the matrix was monitored concurrently using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. Chemical changes at the core of both of these materials were found to occur concomitantly with the observed changes in interlaminar fracture toughness. FTIR analysis of both matrix materials revealed the predominant degradation mechanism to be the oxidation of the methylene group bridging two aromatic rings common to the structure of both resins, and was substantiated by the ingrowth of a broad peak centred at 1600 cm- 1. In addition to this, the <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> unit present only in the CBR 320 / 328 composites was found to be highly resistant to the effects of ageing, whereas the saturated imide, common to the cured structures of both materials, was observed to degrade. Raman spectroscopy indicated that the predominant degradation mechanism of the composites differed at the two ageing temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The N,N,N′,N″- 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetra(ethylhexanoate) pyromellitamide {{is found}} to be capable of both intermolecular {{aggregation}} and binding to small anions. It is synthesized by aminolysis of <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> with ethanolamine, followed by a reaction with hexanoyl chloride. The single-crystal X-ray structure of the pyromellitamide shows that it forms one-dimensional columnar stacks through an intermolecular hydrogen-bonding network. It also forms self-assembled gels in nonpolar solvents, presumably by a hydrogen-bonding network similar to the solid-state structure as shown by IR and XRD studies. Aggregation by intermolecular hydrogen bonding of the pyromellitamide is also observed by NMR and IR in solution. Fitting of NMR dilution data for pyromellitamide in d₆-acetone to a cooperative aggregation model gave KE = 232 M⁻¹ and positive cooperativity of aggregation (p = 0. 22). The pyromellitamide binds to a range of small anions with the binding strength decreasing in the order chloride > acetate > bromide > nitrate ≈ iodide. The data indicate that the pyromellitamide binds two anions and that it displays negative cooperativity. The intermolecular aggregation of the pyromellitamide can also be altered using small anion stimuli; anion addition to preformed self-assembled pyromellitamide gels causes their collapse. The kinetics of anion-induced gel collapse are qualitatively correlated to the binding affinities of the same anions in solution. The cooperative anion binding properties and the sensitivity of the self-assembled gels formed by pyromellitamide toward anions could be useful in the development of sensors and switching/releasing devices. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) {{combine the}} {{desirable}} processability of polymers {{with a significant}} degree of microporosity generated from the inefficient packing of their rigid and contorted structures. They are attracting attention {{for a variety of}} applications including as membrane materials for gas separations. Over the last 30 years, membranes have become an established technology for separating gases and are likely to play key role in reducing the environmental impact and costs of many industrial processes such as O 2 or N 2 enrichment from air, natural gas upgrading and hydrogen recovery from ammonia production. This thesis describes the synthesis of a series of novel PIMs, primarily PIM-polyimide structures (PIM-PI) and investigates their potential in such applications. In particular, it focuses on the design and synthesis of solution processable PIMs in order to study how structural differences affect the gas permeability. The first section describes the synthesis of a variety of PIM-PIs using large bulky diamines derived from spirobisindane (SBI) and biphenylfluorene (BPF) structures which are useful monomers for achieving high BET (Brunauer-Emmett- Teller) surface areas (> 650 m 2 g- 1). The second section describes a whole series PIs based on novel and literature based Tröger’s base (TB) diamine monomers. Most of these exhibited good solubility, excellent thermal stability and intrinsic microporosity, with apparent BET surface areas in the range 450 - 739 m 2 g- 1. Notably, a polyimide derived from Me 2 TB and <b>pyromellitic</b> <b>anhydride</b> demonstrates gas permeability data above the 2008 upper bounds for important gas pairs such as O 2 /N 2, H 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CH 4. The third section aims to enforce rigidity within the polymers further by incorporating differently substituted monomers based on rigid ethanoanthracene (EA) units. This includes the formation of a novel EA-EA based PI with an exceptionally rigid polymeric structure, possessing a BET surface area of 694 m 2 g- 1. In addition to very high permeability, this polymer demonstrates improved gas selectivity due to its enhanced performance as a molecular sieve, placing it amongst some of the highest performing polymers to date. The final section looks at other ways in which rigidity can be enforced including the formation of TB-polymers and thermally rearranged (TR) polymers and assesses their potential for future investigations...|$|E
