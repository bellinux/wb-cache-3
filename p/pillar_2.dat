40|$|Struggling {{to create}} an {{anonymous}} revolution of thought, the Freemasons were forced to endorse their ideals through indirect yet seemingly conspicuous efforts due to the controversy these principles caused among the Catholic Church and patriarchal society. Many of the beliefs of Freemasons were publicized using music as a pathway, with Wolfgang Mozart defining this form of propaganda.

By uniting the musical and textual inferences and adding historical parallels of freemasonry in The Magic Flute, I contend that the purpose of this opera indisputably promotes the ideals of freemasonry: unification of mankind through the bonds of brotherhood and equality.

Citizenship, however, is intertwined with immigration, which the Treaty also attempted to address. Policy on visas, immigration and asylum was originally placed under Pillar 3 of the EU, which dealt with Justice and Home Affairs. In 1997, however, the Amsterdam Treaty moved these policies from Pillar 3 to Pillar 1, signaling “a shift toward more supranational decision-making in this area,” as opposed to the intergovernmental method of <b>Pillars</b> <b>2</b> and 3. ...|$|R

40|$|Discussions on {{the reform}} of the “Basel I” capital ratio, or “Cooke” ratio, which dates from 1988, were {{initiated}} in the late 1990 s {{under the aegis of}} the Basel Committee. They culminated in June 2004 with the publication of a new Accord on international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards, commonly referred to as “Basel II”. The new Accord was updated in November 2005 to incorporate several technical additions. The Basel II framework is designed to permit a more risk-sensitive and more comprehensive coverage of banking risks. It consists of three complementary and mutually reinforcing “pillars”. Pillar 1 consists of the basic minimum capital requirements. <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> introduces the principle of a structured dialogue between banking institutions and supervisors. Pillar 3 is focused on transparency and market discipline. Each of these three pillars represents a major innovation, marking the transition from a prudential framework based on simple quantitative rules to a more complete set of standards which, in addition to using a more risk-sensitive quantitative approach, incorporates qualitative principles that institutions are expected to comply with. However, <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> has a unique characteristic that distinguishes it from the other two Pillars. It reaffirms and provides a rationale for the existing practice of many supervisors: conducting a quantitative and qualitative review of all risks using their own tools but also the processes for risk monitoring developed by banks themselves. These reviews may lead to various supervisory measures, including the imposition of additional capital requirements under <b>Pillar</b> <b>2.</b> The extensive consultations conducted in the past few years between supervisors and the banking industry have gradually led to the implications of Basel II being taken on board by all of the parties concerned. First of all, institutions focused on adapting their information systems to the requirements laid down in Pillar 1. For a long time, <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> was the least commented on part of the Basel reform. However, the entry into force of the new ratio will take place from the beginning of 2007 –in France as in the other countries of the European Economic Area– since the transposition of the Accord into Community law has taken the form of a new Capital requirements directive (CRD). In the run-up to this deadline, <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> has become a major topic of discussion between banks and their supervisors, and it therefore seems opportune to further clarify how the Commission bancaire will implement <b>Pillar</b> <b>2.</b> In particular, the cross-border implementation of the new framework raises many questions, to which European supervisors have responded by developing rules that are as harmonised as possible. Beyond these considerations, thought needs to be given to the fundamental purpose of <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> and to its practical implementation. The increased risk-sensitivity of capital requirements under Pillar 1 undeniably represents a major advance, but it results in increased correlation of capital requirements with the business cycle, the degree of which will be specifi c to each institution. From the perspective of micro and macro-prudential stability, the fl uctuations in the regulatory ratio that might result from this correlation must be understood and, if possible, kept in check. This article seeks to show how this objective could be achieved through a possible approach to <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> involving the putting in place of a capital cushion in addition to the regulatory minimum. ...|$|E
40|$|Under the New Basel Accord bank capital {{adequacy}} rules (Pillar 1) are substantially revised but {{the introduction of}} two new "Pillars" is, perhaps, of even greater significance. This paper focuses on <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> which expands the range of instruments available to the regulator when intervening with banks that are capital inadequate and investigates the complementarity between Pillar 1 (risk-based capital requirements) and <b>Pillar</b> <b>2.</b> In particular, the paper focuses {{on the role of}} closure rules when recapitalization is costly. In the model banks are able to manage their portfolios dynamically and their decisions on recapitalization and capital structure are determined endogenously. A feature of our approach is to consider the costs as well as the benefits of capital regulation and to accommodate the behavioral response of banks in terms of their portfolio strategy and capital structure. The paper argues that problems of {{capital adequacy}} are minor unless, in at least some states of the world, banks are able to violate the capital adequacy rules. The paper shows how the role of <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> depends on the effectiveness of capital regulation, i. e., the extent to which banks can "cheat". ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the years}} {{a number of}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms {{have led to the}} {{emergence}} of a CAP chapter specifically dedicated to rural development, also referred as <b>Pillar</b> <b>2,</b> and have resulted in a progressive switch of CAP budget from Pillar 1 (i. e. direct support to farmers, including direct payments and other instruments for market regulation) to <b>Pillar</b> <b>2.</b> Approximately 23 per cent of the CAP should be allocated to rural development measures during the period 2014 - 2020. The recent development of <b>Pillar</b> <b>2</b> calls for further research on the impact assessment of such policies. Unfortunately, the diversity of rural situations across Europe has complicated the empirical studies of the impacts of rural development and often makes any comparison between regions rather trivial. The main objective of this report is the creation of a classification of 1303 NUTS 3 regions, which reflects the heterogeneity of NUTS 3 characteristics in the EU. This classification is multidimensional. In particular, the typology is based on the following set of four criteria: Rural Character, Accessibility, Actual economic diversification and Total Gross Domestic Product per capita.
