25|$|On March 17, 2008, Apple {{released}} an updated AirPort Express Base Station with 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 radio. All other features (analog and digital optical audio out, single Ethernet <b>port,</b> <b>USB</b> port for printer sharing) remained the same. At the time, {{it was the}} least expensive ($99) device to handle both frequency bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz) in 2x2 802.11 Draft-N.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{infrared}} {{remote controls}} {{can be used}} to control PC applications. Any application that supports shortcut keys can be controlled via IR remote controls from other home devices (TV, VCR, AC). This is widely used with multimedia applications for PC based home theatre systems. For this to work, one needs a device that decodes IR remote control data signals and a PC application that communicates to this device connected to PC. Connection can be made via serial <b>port,</b> <b>USB</b> port or motherboard IrDA connector. Such devices are commercially available but can be homemade using low-cost micro controllers. LIRC (Linux IR Remote control) and WinLIRC (for Windows) are software packages developed for the purpose of controlling PC using TV remote and can be also used for homebrew remote with lesser modification.|$|E
25|$|Some modern amateur {{transceivers}} have embedded {{computers with}} firmware which is executed {{to provide the}} functions and features of the transceiver. This software must be provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment. Another type of software is that required to control a receiver (or transceiver) without a front panel provided. Examples of this are the Kenwood TS-B2000 and the Ten-Tec Pegasus; both transceivers are sold with PC software to provide the human interface for operation. Most transceivers with front control panels (and many receivers popular among shortwave listeners) have a computer interface such as a serial <b>port,</b> <b>USB</b> or Ethernet port. These ports are useful for satellite-tracking frequency control (Doppler tuning), station logging, digital operation, internet and special-needs accessibility. In many cases, the software adds improved or extra functions and features beyond that provided by the original design. For this reason, some operators purchase radio-control software for non-computerized operation even if their radio has a front control panel.|$|E

However, such devices may come with a Y-shaped cable that has two USB plugs (one for power and data, the other for only power), so as to draw power as two devices. Such a cable is non-standard, with the USB compliance specification stating that [...] "use of a 'Y' cable (a cable with two A-plugs) is prohibited on any USB peripheral", meaning that [...] "if a USB peripheral requires {{more power than}} allowed by the USB specification {{to which it is}} designed, then it must be self-powered." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{computer}} MIDI interface's {{main function}} is to match clock speeds between the MIDI device and the computer. Some computer sound cards include a standard MIDI connector, whereas others connect by any of various means that include the D-subminiature DA-15 game <b>port,</b> <b>USB,</b> FireWire, Ethernet or a proprietary connection. The increasing use of USB connectors in the 2000s {{has led to the}} availability of MIDI-to-USB data interfaces that can transfer MIDI channels to USB-equipped computers. Some MIDI keyboard controllers are equipped with USB jacks, and can be plugged into computers that run music software.|$|E
50|$|The term DSL modem is {{technically}} {{used to describe}} a modem which connects to a single computer, through an Ethernet <b>Port,</b> <b>USB</b> port, or is installed in a computer PCI slot. The more common DSL router is a standalone device that combines the function of a DSL modem and a router, and can connect multiple computers through multiple Ethernet ports or an integral wireless access point. Also called a residential gateway, a DSL router usually manages the connection and sharing of the DSL service in a home or small office network.|$|E

50|$|A {{modified}} version of the BeagleBoard called the BeagleBoard-xM started shipping on August 27, 2010. The BeagleBoard-xM measures in at 82.55 by 82.55 mm and has a faster CPU core (clocked at 1 GHz compared to the 720 MHz of the BeagleBoard), more RAM (512 MB compared to 256 MB), onboard Ethernet jack, and 4 <b>port</b> <b>USB</b> hub. The BeagleBoard-xM lacks the onboard NAND and therefore requires the OS and other data to be stored on a microSD card. The addition of the Camera port to the -xM provides a simple way of importing video via Leopard Board cameras.|$|E
5000|$|The Linux console {{provides}} {{a way for the}} kernel and other processes to output text-based messages to the user, and to receive text-based input from the user. In Linux, several devices can be used as system console: a [...] virtual terminal, serial <b>port,</b> <b>USB</b> serial port, VGA in text-mode, framebuffer. Some modern Linux-based systems have deprecated kernel based text-mode input and output, and instead show a graphical logo or progress bar while the system is booting, followed by the immediate start of a graphical user interface (e.g. the X.Org Server on desktop distributions, or SurfaceFlinger on Android).|$|E
