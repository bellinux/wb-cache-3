50|$|On 1 April 1918, {{the newly}} created RAF adopted its officer rank titles from the British Army, with Royal Flying Corps second lieutenants {{becoming}} second lieutenants in the RAF. Consideration was given to renaming second lieutenants as ensigns.

5|$|Galland {{returned}} to action on 22 August replacing Gotthard Handrick as Geschwaderkommodore of JG 26. Galland's appointment made {{no impact on}} his successes.

His 25th victim may have been from 19 Squadron which was claimed 20 kilometers south of Cambridge at 09:42. Klaus Mietusch also accounted for one for his 7th victory. Three 19 Squadron Spitfires were shot down in the morning near North Weald. <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officer</b> R.A.C Aeberhardt {{was killed in a}} crash-landing in Spitfire R6912 while Flying Officer T.J.B Coward was wounded in the foot and F.N Brinsden was unhurt.

His opponent could have been No. 602 Squadron's <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officer</b> Archibald Lyall, who was reported killed in the engagement. This made Wick the highest-scoring fighter pilot in the Luftwaffe, surpassing Mölders, whose score at the time stood at 54 victories. Returning from this mission to Cherbourg- Querqueville, Wick ordered the aircraft refueled and re-armed. Together with Erich Leie as his wingman, Wick took off at 4:10p.m. and returned to the vicinity of the Isle of Wight. Spotting a flight of Spitfires he climbed to intercept from a more favourable attack position. In a diving attack Wick shot down and killed <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officer</b> Paul A. Baillon, of No. 609 Squadron, flying Spitfire R6631.|$|E

During the war, the Flying Training Schools provided what was in effect intermediate training for pilots who had received ab initio training and flown solo at an EFTS (Elementary Flying Training School) and who had subsequently been inducted into the RAF. Pilots thus arrived at No. 5 FTS RAF Sealand as APOs (Acting <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officers)</b> and upon satisfactory completion of intermediate training became <b>Pilot</b> <b>Officers</b> (POs), and were prepared for posting to a squadron or OTU (Operational Training Unit). Kenneth Cross spent time at No. 5 FTS as an instructor in the early 1930s. From 5 August 1940, the CFI (Chief Flying Instructor) was Edward Mortlock Donaldson.
