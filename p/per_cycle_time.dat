40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{rigorous}} models for simulating {{the operation of}} multi-component batch distillation with a hypothetical start-up procedure are derived and solved by a novel analytical derivative technique. The conventional backward derivative technique which usually solves the model only from the steady-state total reflux condition is also extended to include the solution from the hypothetical start-up condition. Both techniques are shown to give identical results. Simulation and optimisation of a ternary system with slop recycle are analysed by {{using one of the}} above rigorous models and solution techniques. Nine modes of operation for handling the recycle slops are developed and a basic mode of operation for evaluating the economic efficiency is defined as the reference. The objective function chosen for the analysis is the profit <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> rather than the total product <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> The results of analysis show that the right choice of mode of operation is more significant than the right choice of the constant reflux ratio of the operation. An explicit short-cut model for estimating the instantaneous overhead composition of multi-component batch distillation is successfully derived. The performance of the short-cut model is acceptably accurate and offers some advantages of speed over other published models. The short-cut model is shown to be very powerful for solving the problem of optimal reflux profile...|$|E

With actuated signal, induction loops buried in the roadway stop-line, video, infrared or microwave detection system automatically adjusts timings relative to prevailing degree of saturation. An intersection without such detection system operates on fixed times (static).

Based on the hypotheses that peak traffic performance at standalone between optimised static and actuated signal settings are insignificant; discharge rates, delays and effective green timings for both were estimated compared and contrasted. Given that an optimised static signal assigns predetermined time irrespective of traffic demand; saturation flows were fixed at 1900 for straight, 1800 left turning and 1700 right turning vehicles per hour per lane respectively.

40|$|Objectives: To {{apply the}} {{mathematical}} techniques of optimal control theory (OCT) to a validated {{model of the}} human circulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), so as to discover improved waveforms for chest compression and decompression that maximize the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP). Methods: The human circulatory system is represented by seven difference equations that describe the pressure changes in systemic vascular compartments that are caused by chest compression. The forcing term is the intrathoracic pressure that is generated by the external chest compression, which is taken as the control variable for the system. The optimum waveform of this forcing pressure {{as a function of}} time, determined from OCT, is that which maximizes the calculated CPP between the thoracic aorta and the superior vena cava over a period of 13. 3 seconds of continuous chest compression. Results: The optimal waveform included both compression and decompression of the chest to the maxi-mum allowable extent. Compression–decompression waveforms were rectangular in shape. The frequency of optimal compression–decompression that was found by OCT was 90 per minute. The optimal duty cycle (compression duration <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time)</b> was 40 %. The CPP for the optimum control waveform was 36 mm Hg vs. 25 mm Hg for standard CPR. Conclusions: Optimal control theory suggests that both compression and decompression of the chest are needed for best hemodynamics during CPR...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a shared control design framework for improving operator efficiency and performance on hydraulic excavation tasks. The framework {{is based on}} blended shared control (BSC), a technique whereby the operator?s command input is continually augmented by an assistive controller. Designing a BSC control scheme is subdivided here into four key components. Task learning utilizes nonparametric inverse reinforcement learning to identify the underlying goal structure of a task as a sequence of subgoals directly from the demonstration data of an experienced operator. These subgoals may be distinct points in the actuator space or distributions overthe space, from which the operator draws a subgoal location during the task. The remaining three steps are executed on-line during each update of the BSC controller. In real-time, the subgoal prediction step involves utilizing the subgoal decomposition from the learning process in order to predict the current subgoal of the operator. Novel deterministic and probabilistic prediction methods are developed and evaluated for their ease of implementation and performance against manually labeled trial data. The control generation component involves computing polynomial trajectories to the predicted subgoal location or mean of the subgoal distribution, and computing a control input which tracks those trajectories. Finally, the blending law synthesizes both inputs through a weighted averaging of the human and control input, using a blending parameter which can be static or dynamic. In the latter case, mapping probabilistic quantities such as the maximum a posteriori probability or statistical entropy {{to the value of}} the dynamic blending parameter may yield a more intelligent control assistance, scaling the intervention according to the confidence of the prediction. A reduced-scale (1 / 12) fully hydraulic excavator model was instrumented for BSC experimentation, equipped with absolute position feedback of each hydraulic actuator. Experiments were conducted using a standard operator control interface and a common earthmoving task: loading a truck from a pile. Under BSC, operators experienced an 18 % improvement in mean digging efficiency, defined as mass of material moved <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> Effects of BSC vary with regard to pure cycle time, although most operators experienced a reduced mean cycle time...|$|E

Sinusoidal length changes were imposed about resting muscle length and fibres were stimulated at a selected phase during the strain cycle. The work output <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> was calculated from {{the area of the}} resulting force-position loops. The strain amplitude required for maximum work <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> had a distinct optimum at ± 5 % of resting length, which was independent of temperature. Maximum positive work loops were obtained by retarding the stimulus relative {{to the start of the}} length-change cycle by 30 ° (full cycle= 360 °). The maximum negative work output was obtained with a 210 ° stimulus phase shift. At intermediate stimulus phase shifts, work loops became complex with both positive (anticlockwise) and negative (clockwise) components. The number and timing of stimuli were adjusted, at constant strain amplitude (± 5 % of resting muscle length), to optimize net positive work output over a range of cycle frequencies. The cycle frequency required for maximum power output (work <b>per</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> <b>cycle</b> frequency) increased from around 5 - 7 Hz at 4 °C to 9 - 13 Hz at 15 °C.

The maximum power output of muscle fibres showed little seasonal variation at 4 °C and was in the range 20 - 25 Wkg~ 1.

40|$|A {{time-dependent}} capacity increase {{has often}} been observed for driven displacement piles in sand. Long-term bearing capacity increase after dissipation of excess pore water pressure {{is referred to as}} set-up. Significant increases in axial capacity have been reported where the rate of set-up varied between 15 and 75 % <b>per</b> log <b>cycle</b> of <b>time.</b> More economic foundation designs are feasible when set-up is incorporated in pile design methods. The objective of this thesis is to expand knowledge on time-dependent capacity of driven displacement piles and make way for a pile design method that incorporates time dependency of pile bearing capacity. The time dependency of virgin pile capacity has been assessed in a database study and a scaled test program. 4 scaled closed-ended steel piles were driven in a man-made sand deposit. The virgin capacity of a pile was assessed 2, 16, 31 and 70 days after installation. The 3 m long, 0. 15 m diameter piles were statically tested in compression. Strain was measured at multiple locations along the shaft during the load tests. The applied load and pile displacement were measured at the pile head. The contribution of the pile shaft and pile tip was determined from the strain distribution over the pile length at failure. A trend for capacity increase with time has been found in the database study and the test program. A capacity increase of 13 % <b>per</b> log <b>cycle</b> of <b>time</b> was found for the closed-ended piles tested. Both an increase in shaft and tip resistance was found with respect to the reference capacity determined 2 days after installation. The shaft capacity increased on average 18. 5 % <b>per</b> log <b>cycle</b> of <b>time</b> and an average increase of 9 % <b>per</b> log <b>cycle</b> of <b>time</b> has been found for the pile tip capacity. The measured capacity was compared with the calculated capacity determined by the Dutch design code. Considering the measured capacity normalized by the calculated capacity the influence of time is even stronger on the tip resistance than on the shaft resistance for the piles tested. As discussed in the report, there are some uncertainties with the interpretation of the strain distributions over the pile shafts. The accuracy of the CPT-based design method available in the Dutch design code, method Koppejan, has been assessed from the pile test results in the database. The results were compared with other design methods available. The accuracy of all methods was low. The calculated capacity exceeded the measured capacity up to a factor 3. Time-dependent capacity increase is a potential mechanism to incorporate in designs of axially loaded driven displacement piles.
