5|$|Emphasis in Alzheimer's {{research}} {{has been placed on}} diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests have been developed to attempt earlier detection. One such test involves the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for beta-amyloid or tau proteins, both total tau protein and <b>phosphorylated</b> tau181P protein concentrations.|$|E
5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when <b>phosphorylated,</b> and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|Central “substrate domain” {{containing}} multiple repeats of tyrosine residues {{embedded within}} specific conserved sequences (YxxP) (amino acids 69-350 for human EFS). This region contains 9 such binding sites, {{in contrast to}} family members BCAR1 and NEDD9 (20 and 18 motifs, respectively) and similar to CASS4 (estimated at 10 such motifs). Once <b>phosphorylated</b> by SRC or other kinases, these tyrosine motifs are bound by the SH2 domains of signaling proteins. Important binding partners for this region include Crk1/2 and Crk-L, a Crk1 paralogue.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are <b>phosphorylated</b> or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its <b>phosphorylated</b> derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E
25|$|Sld3 and Sld2 are <b>phosphorylated</b> by CDK, {{which enables}} the two replicative {{proteins}} to bind to Dpb11. Dpb11 had {{two pairs of}} BRCA1 C Terminus (BRCT) domains which are known as a phosphopeptide-binding domains. The N-terminal pair of the BRCT domains binds to <b>phosphorylated</b> Sld3, and the C-terminal pair binds to <b>phosphorylated</b> Sld2. Both of these interactions are essential for CDK-dependent activation of DNA budding in yeast.|$|E
25|$|Glucose 6-phosphate (sometimes {{called the}} Robison ester) is a glucose sugar <b>phosphorylated</b> on carbon 6. This is a {{compound}} {{that is very}} common in cells as the vast majority of glucose entering a cell will become <b>phosphorylated</b> in this way.|$|E
25|$|Tubulin is {{also known}} to be <b>phosphorylated,</b> ubiquitinated, sumoylated, and palmitoylated.|$|E
25|$|MALDI {{has been}} coupled with IMS-TOF MS to {{identify}} <b>phosphorylated</b> and non-phosphorylated peptides.|$|E
25|$|Serine 2 of SUMO-1 is <b>phosphorylated,</b> {{raising the}} concept of a 'modified modifier'.|$|E
25|$|During mitosis, lamins are <b>phosphorylated</b> by MPF, which {{drives the}} {{disassembly}} of the lamina {{and the nuclear}} envelope.|$|E
25|$|The <b>phosphorylated</b> RSMAD/coSMAD complex {{enters the}} nucleus where it binds {{transcription}} promoters/cofactors and causes the transcription of DNA.|$|E
25|$|In S. cerevisiae, {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} Cdc28 (Cdk1 {{homologue}}) is <b>phosphorylated</b> by Swe1 (Wee1 homologue) and dephosphorylated by Mih1 (Cdc25 homologue). Nim1/Cdr1 homologue in S.cerevisiae, Hsl1, together with its related kinases Gin4 and Kcc4 localize Swe1 to the bud-neck. Bud-neck associating kinases Cla4 and Cdc5 (polo kinase homologue) phosphorylate Swe1 {{at different stages}} of the cell cycle. Swe1 is also <b>phosphorylated</b> by Clb2-Cdc28 which serves as a recognition for further phosphorylation by Cdc5.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to the three-tiered classical MAPK pathways, some atypical MAP kinases {{appear to have a}} more ancient, two-tiered system. ERK3 (MAPK6) and ERK4 (MAPK4) were recently shown to be directly <b>phosphorylated</b> and thus activated by PAK kinases (related to other MAP3 kinases). In contrast to the classical MAP kinases, these atypical MAPKs require only a single residue in their activation loops to be <b>phosphorylated.</b> The details of NLK and ERK7 (MAPK15) activation remain unknown.|$|E
25|$|The mTORC1 {{signaling}} cascade {{is activated}} by <b>phosphorylated</b> AKT {{and results in}} phosphorylation of S6K1, and 4EBP1, which lead to mRNA translation.|$|E
25|$|Specific TGF-β ligands {{will result}} in the {{activation}} of either the SMAD2/3 or the SMAD1/5 R-SMADs. For instance, when activin, Nodal, or TGF-β ligand binds to the receptors, the <b>phosphorylated</b> receptor complex can activate SMAD2 and SMAD3 through phosphorylation. However, when a BMP ligand binds to the receptors, the <b>phosphorylated</b> receptor complex activates SMAD1 and SMAD5. Then, the Smad2/3 or the Smad1/5 complexes form a dimer complex with SMAD4 and become transcription factors. Though there are many R-SMADs involved in the pathway, there is only one co-SMAD, SMAD4.|$|E
25|$|When Rb {{has been}} <b>phosphorylated</b> many times, it dissociates from E2F. E2F {{is free to}} {{activate}} expression of S-phase genes. TIGAR can indirectly prevent a cell passing through the Restriction Point by keeping Rb unphosphorylated.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} CCC proteins, KCC2 is an {{integral}} membrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains and both N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The terminal cytoplasmic domains can be <b>phosphorylated</b> by kinases within the neuron for rapid regulation.|$|E
25|$|N-linked glycosylation: If {{the protein}} is {{properly}} folded, Oligosaccharyltransferase recognizes the AA sequence NXS or NXT (with the S/T residue <b>phosphorylated)</b> and adds a 14-sugar backbone (2-N-acetylglucosamine, 9-branching mannose, and 3-glucose at the end) to the side-chain nitrogen of Asn.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorylation of a hexose such as glucose often limits it to {{a number}} of {{intracellular}} metabolic processes, such as glycolysis or glycogen synthesis. This is because <b>phosphorylated</b> hexoses are charged, and thus more difficult to transport out of a cell.|$|E
25|$|MKK7 is {{involved}} in signal transduction mediating the cell responses to proinflammatory cytokines, and environmental stresses. This kinase specifically activates MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK9/JNK2, and this kinase itself is <b>phosphorylated</b> and activated by MAP kinase kinase kinases including MAP3K1/MEKK1, MAP3K2/MEKK2, MAP3K3/MEKK5, and MAP4K2/GCK.|$|E
25|$|Src {{homology}} 2 domain (SH2) : SH2 domains {{are often}} found in signal transduction proteins. SH2 domains confer binding to <b>phosphorylated</b> tyrosine (pTyr). Named after the phosphotyrosine binding domain of the src viral oncogene, which is itself a tyrosine kinase. See also: SH3 domain.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein post-translational modification including <b>phosphorylated,</b> acetylated, or glycosylated. These changes influence a transcription factor's ability to bind, directly or indirectly, to promoter DNA, to recruit RNA polymerase, or to favor elongation {{of a newly}} synthesized RNA molecule.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{proteins}} recruited to polymerase are elongation factors, thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation. There are different classes of elongation factors. Some factors {{can increase the}} overall rate of transcribing, some can help the polymerase through transient pausing sites, and some can assist the polymerase to transcribe through chromatin. One of the elongation factors, P-TEFb, is particularly important. P-TEFb phosphorylates the second residue (Ser-2) of the CTD repeats (YSPTSPS) of the bound Pol II. P-TEFb also phosphorylates and activates SPT5 and TAT-SF1. SPT5 is a universal transcription factor that helps recruit 5'-capping enzyme to Pol II with a CTD <b>phosphorylated</b> at Ser-5. TAF-SF1 recruits components of the RNA splicing machinery to the Ser-2 <b>phosphorylated</b> CTD. P-TEFb also helps suppress transient pausing of polymerase when it encounters certain sequences immediately following initiation.|$|E
25|$|There are 12 {{confirmed}} phosphorylation {{sites on}} the QSER1 protein. Eight are phosphoserines, one phosphotyrosine, and three phosphothreonines. Three of these sites {{have been shown to}} be <b>phosphorylated</b> by ATM and ATR in response in DNA damage. 123 other possible phosphorylation sites have been predicted using the ExPASy NetPhos tool.|$|E
25|$|Uptake of {{thiamine}} by {{cells of}} the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion. About 80% of intracellular thiamine is <b>phosphorylated</b> and most is bound to proteins. In some tissues, thiamine uptake and secretion appears to be mediated by a soluble thiamine transporter that is dependent on Na+ and a transcellular proton gradient.|$|E
25|$|The {{glycerol}} {{released by}} lipase action is <b>phosphorylated</b> by glycerol kinase {{in the liver}} (the only tissue in which this reaction can occur), and the resulting glycerol 3-phosphate is oxidized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The glycolytic enzyme triose phosphate isomerase converts this compound to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is oxidized via glycolysis, or converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis.|$|E
25|$|ATP is the <b>phosphorylated</b> {{version of}} {{adenosine}} diphosphate (ADP), which stores energy {{in a cell}} and powers most cellular activities. ATP is the energized form, while ADP is the (partially) depleted form. NADP+ is an electron carrier which ferries high energy electrons. In the light reactions, it gets reduced, meaning it picks up electrons, becoming NADPH.|$|E
25|$|Pellagra {{can develop}} {{according}} to several mechanisms, classically {{as a result of}} niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, which results in decreased NAD production leading to most of the pathology (since NAD and its <b>phosphorylated</b> NADP form are cofactors required in many body processes, the pathological impact of pellagra is broad and results in death if not treated).|$|E
25|$|When {{carbon dioxide}} is the substrate, {{the product of the}} {{carboxylase}} reaction is a highly unstable six-carbon <b>phosphorylated</b> intermediate known as 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate, which decays virtually instantaneously into two molecules of glycerate-3-phosphate. The extremely unstable molecule created by the initial carboxylation was unknown until 1988, when it was isolated. The 3-phosphoglycerate can be used to produce larger molecules such as glucose.|$|E
25|$|In biology, D-ribose must be <b>phosphorylated</b> by {{the cell}} {{before it can}} be used. Ribokinase catalyzes this {{reaction}} by converting D-ribose to D-ribose 5-phosphate. Once converted, D-ribose-5-phosphate is available for the manufacturing of the amino acids tryptophan and histidine, or for use in the pentose phosphate pathway. The absorption of D-ribose is 88–100% in the small intestines (up to 200mg/kg/h).|$|E
25|$|Phospho{{tyrosine}}-binding domain (PTB) : PTB domains usually bind to <b>phosphorylated</b> tyrosine residues. They {{are often}} found in signal transduction proteins. PTB-domain binding specificity is determined by residues to the amino-terminal side of the phosphotyrosine. Examples: the PTB domains of both SHC and IRS-1 bind to a NPXpY sequence. PTB-containing proteins such as SHC and IRS-1 are important for insulin responses of human cells.|$|E
25|$|Diacylglycerol and IP3 act transiently {{because both}} are rapidly metabolized. This is {{important}} as their message function should not linger after the message has been” received” by their target molecules. DAG can be <b>phosphorylated</b> to phosphatidate {{or it can}} be it can be hydrolysed to glycerol and its constituent fatty acids. IP3 is rapidly converted to into derivatives that that do not open calcium ion channels.|$|E
25|$|Geological {{findings}} in 2013 showed that reactive phosphorus species (like phosphite) were in abundance {{in the ocean}} before 3.5 Ga, and that Schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous glycerol to generate phosphite and glycerol 3-phosphate. It is hypothesized that Schreibersite-containing meteorites from the Late Heavy Bombardment could have provided early reduced phosphorus, which could react with prebiotic organic molecules to form <b>phosphorylated</b> biomolecules, like RNA.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that osteopontin and bone sialoprotein, bone matrix phosphoproteins, are highly {{efficient}} in vitro TRAP substrates, which bind to osteoclasts when <b>phosphorylated.</b> Upon partial dephosphorylation, both osteopontin and bone sialoprotein are incapable of binding to osteoclasts. From this effect, it has been hypothesized that TRAP is secreted from the ruffled border, dephosphorylates osteopontin and allows osteoclast migration, and further resorption to occur.|$|E
25|$|Thymidine monophosphate, {{the product}} of the {{reaction}} catalyzed by thymidine kinase, is in turn <b>phosphorylated</b> to thymidine diphosphate by the enzyme thymidylate kinase and further to thymidine triphosphate by the enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The triphosphate is included in a DNA molecule, a reaction catalyzed by a DNA polymerase and a complementary DNA molecule (or an RNA molecule in the case of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme present in retrovirus).|$|E
