5|$|In July 1997 the <b>Provisional</b> IRA {{called a}} ceasefire. On 10 October 1997 a <b>Provisional</b> IRA General Army Convention {{was held in}} Falcarragh, County Donegal. At the convention, <b>Provisional</b> IRA Quartermaster General Michael McKevitt—also {{a member of the}} 12-person <b>Provisional</b> IRA Executive—denounced the {{leadership}} and {{called for an end to}} the group's ceasefire and to its participation in the Northern Ireland peace process. He was backed by his partner and fellow Executive member Bernadette Sands McKevitt. The two dissidents were outmanoeuvred by the leadership and were left isolated. The convention backed the pro-ceasefire line, and on 26 October McKevitt and Sands McKevitt resigned from the Executive along with other members.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA {{initially}} took {{small amounts}} of materiel from <b>Provisional</b> IRA arms dumps {{under the control of}} McKevitt and other former <b>Provisional</b> IRA members, including the plastic explosive Semtex, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47 and AK-74 assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, detonators, and timing devices. The defection of senior <b>Provisional</b> IRA members also gave the RIRA the ability to manufacture home-made explosives and improvised mortars, including the Mark 15 mortar capable of firing a 200lb shell.|$|E
50|$|Mekeel was {{involved}} in the study and authentication of the 1895 discovery of St. Louis Postmaster <b>Provisionals,</b> which verified the plating of the <b>provisionals</b> and the authenticity of the 20 cent value. Based on his study of the <b>provisionals,</b> Mekeel wrote The History of the Postage Stamps of the St. Louis Postmaster, 1845-1847 in 1895.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Officials and the <b>Provisionals</b> {{also saw}} the Easter Lily {{as a symbol of}} remembrance for their members who died on [...] "active service". With the decline in the Official IRA, the Easter Lily became more and more {{associated}} with the <b>Provisionals.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bowling Green, Kentucky, was {{designated}} the Confederate capital of Kentucky at a convention in nearby Russellville. Due {{to the military}} situation in the state, the <b>provisional</b> government was exiled and traveled with the Army of Tennessee {{for most of its}} existence. For a short time in the autumn of 1862, the Confederate Army controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General Braxton Bragg attempted to install the <b>provisional</b> government as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General Don Carlos Buell ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove the <b>provisional</b> government from the state for the final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper and was dissolved {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Fearful {{of arrest}} as a rebel once {{he left the}} Senate, Benjamin quickly {{departed}} Washington for New Orleans. On the day of Benjamin's resignation, the <b>Provisional</b> Confederate States Congress gathered in Montgomery, Alabama, and soon chose Davis as president. Davis {{was sworn in as}} <b>provisional</b> Confederate States President on February 18, 1861. At home in New Orleans for, it would prove, the last time, Benjamin addressed a rally on Washington's Birthday, February 22, 1861. On February 25, Davis appointed Benjamin, still in New Orleans, as attorney general; the Louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by the <b>provisional</b> Congress. Davis thus became the first chief executive in North America to appoint a Jew to his Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Lovejoy {{was elected}} in 1848 to {{what would be the}} final session of the <b>Provisional</b> Legislature, which was held in late 1848 into early 1849. However, Lovejoy now {{representing}} Vancouver District north of the Columbia River resigned before the session started. In September 1848, he traveled with a group to California during the California Gold Rush, but returned aboard the brig Undine in January 1849 after six weeks in California. During the same session he resigned from, he was selected by the <b>Provisional</b> Legislature as Supreme Judge of the government on February 16, 1849, but never served and the <b>Provisional</b> government was dissolved the following month {{with the arrival of the}} territorial government.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II, the {{advancing}} Soviet Red Army pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned {{the formation of a}} <b>provisional</b> government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled <b>Provisional</b> Government of National Unity was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{formally}} on ceasefire (except for [...] "defensive actions") since 1972, the Official IRA continued some {{attacks on}} British forces up until mid-1973, killing seven British soldiers {{in what it}} termed [...] "retaliatory attacks". In addition, the OIRA's weapons were used intermittently in the ongoing feud with the <b>Provisionals.</b> This flared up into violence on several occasions, notably in October 1975. 11 republicans on either side {{were killed in the}} feud and a nine-year-old girl was shot dead by the <b>Provisionals</b> when they tried to shoot her father.|$|R

5|$|The 1st <b>Provisional</b> Marine Brigade {{varied in}} size and {{structure}} each time it was created. Headquarters and Service Company, the company comprising the headquarters staff and support personnel, was {{much smaller than the}} equivalent company in standard Marine brigades. Each iteration of the brigade was assigned <b>provisional</b> military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. This was not an uncommon practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other <b>provisional</b> Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E
5|$|The 1st <b>Provisional</b> Marine Brigade {{was first}} created in 1912 for {{occupation}} duties in Cuba. Earlier that year, the Negro Rebellion had erupted throughout Cuba among former black slaves. A 1st <b>Provisional</b> Marine Regiment of 450 men under Colonel Lincoln Karmany was assembled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 22 May. At the same time, a 2nd <b>Provisional</b> Marine Regiment of 750 men under Colonel James Mahoney assembled at Key West, Florida. The two regiments sailed for Cuba aboard the USS Prairie, with 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment, landing at Havana {{and the remainder}} of the force at Guantanamo. There they combined to form the 1st <b>Provisional</b> Marine Brigade in early June under Karmany, and the United States Marines fanned out in Oriente Province, occupying 26 towns and controlling all rail traffic in the area. The Marines protected United States sugar plantations in Siboney and El Cobre until late July when the Cuban government was able to clamp down on the revolt. At that point, the Marines pulled back to Guantanamo, disbanded the brigade and returned home.|$|E
50|$|A subcategory, Postmasters' <b>provisionals,</b> of {{particular}} importance in United States philately, comprises stamps that were issued by local postmasters in nations {{that had not yet}} begun to issue stamps for countrywide use. Between 1845, when the United States standardardized national postage rates, and 1847, when the post office issued its first stamps, postmasters' <b>provisionals</b> were introduced in eleven American cities, including New York, Providence, Rhode Island and St. Louis, Missouri. Many of these stamps (particularly from smaller cities such as Millbury, Massachusetts) are notable for their great rarity, or for their relative crudity of design.|$|R

5|$|The Spanish Crown {{sent the}} 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican <b>Provisional</b> Battalions to defend Cuba against the American invaders. The 1st Puerto Rican <b>Provisional</b> Battalion, {{composed}} of the Talavera Cavalry and Krupp artillery, was sent to Santiago de Cuba where they battled the American forces in the Battle of San Juan Hill. After the battle, the Puerto Rican Battalion suffered a total of 70% casualties which included their dead, wounded, MIA's and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The bombing {{caused a}} major outcry {{throughout}} the world, and the Irish and British governments introduced new legislation {{in an attempt}} to destroy the organisation. The RIRA also came under pressure from the <b>Provisional</b> IRA, when <b>Provisional</b> IRA members visited the homes of 60 people connected with the RIRA and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with <b>Provisional</b> IRA arms dumps. With the organisation under intense pressure, which included McKevitt and Sands-McKevitt being forced from their home after the media named McKevitt in connection with the bombing, the RIRA called a ceasefire on 8 September.|$|E
5|$|The council met on December 14 {{to appoint}} representatives to the Confederacy's unicameral <b>provisional</b> congress. Those {{appointed}} would serve {{for only two}} months, as the <b>provisional</b> congress was replaced with a permanent bicameral legislature on February 17, 1862. Kentucky was entitled to two senators and 12 representatives in the permanent Confederate Congress. The usual day for general elections being passed, Governor Johnson and the legislative council set election day for Confederate Kentucky on January 22. Voters were allowed to vote in whichever county they occupied on election day, and could cast a general ballot for all positions. In an election that saw military votes outnumber civilian ones, only four of the <b>provisional</b> legislators were elected to seats in the Confederate House of Representatives. One <b>provisional</b> legislator, Henry Burnett, {{was elected to the}} Confederate Senate.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in the split was the desire of those who became the <b>Provisionals</b> to make {{military}} action the key object of the organisation, rather than a simple rejection of leftism.|$|R
50|$|Greaves became {{associated}} with Roy Johnston, a Dublin-born {{member of the}} Irish Workers' Party who had migrated to England. They and their theories came to have an influence over 1960s Irish republicanism through Cathal Goulding and Tomás Mac Giolla, who also adhered to a Marxist perspective. During the split within the Irish republican movement in 1969, Greaves' Connolly Association supported Official Sinn Féin (later known as the Workers' Party) and the Official Irish Republican Army, rather than the <b>Provisionals.</b> This was done under the rationale of anti-sectarianism, claiming that the <b>Provisionals</b> were representative of just the Catholic nationalist community.|$|R
50|$|The final {{starting}} positions (37-42) {{are reserved}} for <b>provisionals.</b> The highest entries in championship owner points (not driver points) from the previous season {{that have not yet}} made the field are assigned grid positions 37-42.|$|R
