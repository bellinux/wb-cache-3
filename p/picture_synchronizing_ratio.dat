40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} to determine the role of large-scale turbulent structures {{in the production of}} jet noise. Axisymmetric turbulent jet flows at ambient stagnation temperature have been observed with the aid of flow visualization techniques. Jet Mach numbers at the nozzle exit ranged between 0. 1 and 0. 9, and the Reynolds number, based on nozzle exit diameter, was approximately 10 to the 6 th. Large organized turbulent structures existed as far downstream of the nozzle exit as 7 diameters. High-speed schlieren motion <b>pictures</b> <b>synchronized</b> with near-field pressure measurements of an excited jet indicated that strong instantaneous peaks in the pressure signal occurred whenever a merging process between two large-scale organized structures occurred. This pressure pulse propagated at a speed which was somewhat larger than the velocity of the jet at the nozzle exit...|$|R

5|$|A {{sound film}} is a motion <b>picture</b> with <b>synchronized</b> sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to a}} silent film. The first known public {{exhibition}} of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|R
40|$|Brief {{analysis}} of the known teaching methods {{through the use of}} computer has been given. It is shown that efficiency of new knowledge transferring can be improved by presenting educational information of as dynamic <b>pictures</b> with <b>synchronized</b> sound explanation accompanied by permanent practical work that makes it possible to consolidate the acquired knowledge in the student’s mind. A structure base of this educational information and its reproduction software algorithm have been proposed. The suggested way of individual teaching {{through the use of a}} computer consists in showing an educational information block in the form of dynamic <b>pictures</b> and <b>synchronized</b> sound accompaniment to the student according to a flexible curriculum. All the information in the educational block is divided into educational pages, each of them being a separate file with graphic, sound and program information. An educational page consists of steps. Each step is concluded with practical work evaluated by the computer. A student can start and finish studying at any page. After studying an educational information block a student gets evaluated according to the results of all steps of practical work. Such organization of the educational process makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of getting new knowledge due to high interactivity of the educational program, to organize a flexible schedule of the educational process, to evaluate a student’s work impartiall...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} {{universe}} or in some regions of supernovae, the neutrino refractive index {{is dominated by the}} neutrinos themselves. Several previous studies have found numerically that these self-interactions have the effect of coupling different neutrino modes {{in such a way as}} to synchronize the flavor oscillations which otherwise would depend on the energy of a given mode. We provide a simple explanation for this baffling phenomenon in analogy to a system of magnetic dipoles which are coupled by their self-interactions to form one large magnetic dipole which then precesses coherently in a weak external magnetic field. In this <b>picture</b> the <b>synchronized</b> neutrino oscillations are perfectly analogous to the weak-field Zeeman effect in atoms. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

50|$|Carr {{was born}} on August 12, 1886, in Poltava in the Russian Empire (now part of Ukraine). In 1887, his family emigrated to the United States. Carr entered the film {{industry}} in the 1925 film, His People, in the featured role of Chaim Barowitz. Although he may have appeared in an earlier film, 1923's Little Johnny Jones. He appeared in the featured role of Levi in the The Jazz Singer, the first <b>picture</b> with <b>synchronized</b> sound dialogue in 1927. In 1929 Carr co-wrote the story (with Mark Sandrich) for the film, The Talk of Hollywood, in which he also starred. Other notable films in which he appeared include: as a waiter in Raoul Walsh's 1939 crime drama, The Roaring Twenties, starring James Cagney, Priscilla Lane, and Humphrey Bogart; {{in the role of}} Crocker in the 1939 Western, Dodge City, starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland; as one of the doctors in the Bette Davis tour de force, Dark Victory, which also starred Bogart and George Brent; and as one of the reporters in the 1941 war classic, Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper. Carr's final screen performance was as a tourist in the 1941 comedy mystery, Passage from Hong Kong.|$|R
40|$|To {{examine whether}} {{differences}} in {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) can distinguish sub- from supra-ventilatory-threshold exercise and whether the exercise duration at supra-threshold intensity alters cardiorespiratory synchronization. Methods: Beat-to-beat RR interval, V ˙ O 2, V ˙ CO 2, V ˙ E, and blood lactate concentration of 11 healthy well-trained young subjects were collected during two exercise tests: 1) a moderate-intensity test: 15 min performed below the power at ventilatory threshold (pVT); and 2) a heavy-intensity test: above pVT until exhaustion. Fast Fourier transform, smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution, and complex demodulation were applied to RR time series. Results: 1) Moderate exercise shows a prevalence of low-frequency (LF) spectral energy compared with the high-frequency (HF) one (LF 80 10 % vs HF 20 10 %, P 0. 001), whereas the reverse is observed during heavy exercise (LF 11 8 % vs HF 89 8 %, P 0. 001). 2) During heavy exercise, the HF amplitude and the tidal volume (Vt) remained constant, whereas the breathing frequency (BF) increased (BF: 0. 70 0. 18 vs 0. 93 0. 31, P 0. 01) and mean RR decreased (342 15 vs 317 16, P 0. 01). Despite the RR series and the breathing signal remaining <b>synchronized,</b> HR/BF <b>ratio</b> decreased and stabilized at 3 RR for one breathing cycle, whatever the initial ratio.

The first known public {{exhibition}} of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923. The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid- to late 1920s. At first, the sound films incorporating synchronized dialogue—known as [...] "talking pictures", or [...] "talkies"—were exclusively shorts; the earliest feature-length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects. The first feature film originally presented as a talkie was The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927. A major hit, it was made with Vitaphone, which was at the time the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology. Sound-on-film, however, would soon become the standard for talking pictures. By the early 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's position as one of the world's most powerful cultural/commercial systems (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|R
40|$|NASA has {{identified}} deep-space optical communications links {{as an integral}} part of a unified space communication network in order to provide data rates in excess of 100 Mb/s. The distances and limited power inherent in a deep-space optical downlink necessitate the use of photon-counting detectors and a power-efficient modulation such as pulse position modulation (PPM). For the output of each photodetector, whether from a separate telescope or a portion of the detection area, a communication receiver estimates a log-likelihood ratio for each PPM slot. To realize the full effective aperture of these receivers, their outputs must be combined prior to information decoding. A channel combiner was developed to <b>synchronize</b> the log-likelihood <b>ratio</b> (LLR) sequences of multiple receivers, and then combines these into a single LLR sequence for information decoding. The channel combiner synchronizes the LLR sequences of up to three receivers and then combines these into a single LLR sequence for output. The channel combiner has three channel inputs, each of which takes as input a sequence of four-bit LLRs for each PPM slot in a codeword via a XAUI 10 Gb/s quad optical fiber interface. The cross-correlation between the channels LLR time series are calculated and used to synchronize the sequences prior to combining. The output of the channel combiner is a sequence of four-bit LLRs for each PPM slot in a codeword via a XAUI 10 Gb/s quad optical fiber interface. The unit is controlled through a 1 Gb/s Ethernet UDP/IP interface. A deep-space optical communication link has not yet been demonstrated. This ground-station channel combiner was developed to demonstrate this capability and is unique in its ability to process such a signal...|$|R

The extent of seed setting on female lines influenced by male-female <b>ratio,</b> <b>synchronized</b> flowering of male and female parents, nectar production and bee foraging, yielding ability of CMS lines, pollen production of male parents. Synchronization of flowering of parental lines {{is one of the}} major constraints in RSFH- 130 hybrid seed production. The male parent (R- 630) being early in flowering compared to female parent (CMS- 104 A) is causing problem in realizing higher seed yield in RSFH- 130 seed production plots. The experiment was laid in randomised block design with three replications. It consisted of 9 treatment combinations comprising of three main plots (locations) viz., Raichur, Malnur and Gulbarga and three sub-plots (staggered planting) viz., S 1 : 4 days late planting of pollen parent to seed parent; S 2; 5 days late planting of pollen parent to seed parent and S 3; 6 days late planting of pollen parent to seed parent treatments with seven replications in each treatment and location. The results revealed that the female parent (CMS- 104 A) is late in 50 % flowering by 5 days compared to male parental line (R- 630) in all the three locations. In order to achieve better synchronization between parental lines and also to obtain maximum seed set per cent and hybrid seed yield, male parent has to be sown late with two staggered sowings i. e., 5 th, and 6 th days after sowing of female line with a proportion of 60 : 40 respectively.
