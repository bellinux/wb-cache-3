5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front of the choir facing the nave. It {{originated}} in the north of France, probably in the mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II. The lectern is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A <b>private</b> <b>individual</b> purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{blocked the}} speech, {{saying that it}} would shock many people and would be a grave breach of {{constitutional}} principles. By modern convention, the sovereign could only act with the advice and counsel of ministers. In seeking the people's support against the government, Edward was opting to oppose binding ministerial advice and instead act as a <b>private</b> <b>individual.</b> Edward's British ministers felt that, in proposing the speech, Edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the Crown.|$|E

5|$|Matejko began {{collecting}} {{materials for the}} painting in 1874. He started painting the canvas some time in 1875 and finished it in 1878. Soon afterwards, he received a scepter from the council of Kraków in an official ceremony, in recognition of his work and his position {{as one of the}} most respected Polish artists. The painting was sold that year to Dawid Rosenblum, a <b>private</b> <b>individual</b> in Warsaw. Displayed in numerous international exhibitions, in 1902 the painting was bought from Rosenblum's heirs by the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zachęty Sztuk Pięknych) and displayed in Warsaw.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} several decades, the mass African American burial site in West Palm Beach was largely {{forgotten}} by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a <b>private</b> <b>individual</b> when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by the local media. Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of West Palm Beach, established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December2000, the city of West Palm Beach purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} after take-off, killing all five on board. The {{cause of the}} {{accident}} was the turbulence and high wind speeds around the airport. The airport was immediately closed after the incident; no public flights have taken off from the Airport after Flight 839. Private flights still use the airport on occasion. The Ministry of Transport and Communications decided on 17 January 1992 to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed since the accident. This made Værøy Airport the civilian airport in Europe to have operated the shortest time. Helikopter Service resumed helicopter flights from Hanna Bakken-jorden on 1 January 1993. Construction of a new heliport started in 1996 and Værøy Heliport opened on 15 February 1997. The old airport was in 2000 bought by a <b>private</b> <b>individual</b> who has converted the terminal building into a private dwelling and uses the control tower for a small-scale chocolate factory.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the closure}} of the chapel in the 1980s, the size of the {{congregation}} had declined and the fabric of the building was deteriorating. In 1978 the decorative plaster ceiling was replaced with a suspended ceiling of acoustic tiles, with further repairs carried out under the Manpower Services Commission. During the course of these repairs, discussions took place {{about the future of the}} building and its dwindling congregation. None of the ideas for developing the building came to fruition, and worship in the chapel ended in December 1985. Permission to demolish the building was refused because of its listed status. It was bought by a <b>private</b> <b>individual</b> in 1987, but the plan to convert it into a nightclub was declined. The building was acquired by the Bethesda Heritage Trust in 2000. After the Bethesda Heritage Trust failed to raise sufficient finance to continue worship, in 2002 it passed into the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, an organisation which aims to find community uses for the buildings in its care.|$|E

5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a <b>private</b> <b>individual</b> contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E
