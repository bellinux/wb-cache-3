40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} entails {{many challenges}} {{related to the}} management of on-demand virtual infrastructures. One of these challenges is the automated <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in cloud infrastructures. Users can request virtual machines from cloud infrastructure providers, but these machines have to be configured and managed properly {{in order to be}} useful. This paper describes an architecture that enables the automated <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in the cloud. The architecture orches-trates the different steps involved in the <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> such as the management of virtual infrastructures (creation and deletion of VMs, networks, etc) as well as the installation, configuration, monitoring and execution of software into the VMs. This architecture is extensible and able to deal with different software components and cloud providers to carry out the <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>service.</b> To fully support the automatic cloud service provisioning, a high level tool is introduced which enables a user to select and customize a predefined service from a services catalog. As a proof of concept, a prototype has been implemented. Implementation aspects and statistics results are provided to furthervalidate the proposal. I...|$|R
5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

40|$|The <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> is {{a growing}} focus of {{scholars}} {{in the fields of}} management and organization studies. Yet research in this area continues to reflect the tenets of Weberian bureaucracy with the predominant conceptualization <b>of</b> the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> as a “production system” in which customers and the organization’s resources are inputs, and services are the outputs of the organization. Accordingly, the organizing work of managers is conceived as activities that protect the “production system” from input uncertainties and external influences. What is overlooked in this perspective, however, is the dynamic tension between the organizing work of managers and the realities <b>of</b> <b>service</b> encounters. This dissertation expands the current understanding <b>of</b> the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> accommodation as an example <b>of</b> the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Based on an ethnographic study of the Front Desk and Housekeeping departments of a large hotel, this dissertation investigates how the realities of encounters between the frontline employees and the customers influence the organizing work of managers. This dissertation takes on a dramaturgical perspective <b>of</b> the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> accommodation. Building on the idea that the lives <b>of</b> <b>service</b> providers can be understood as resembling actors’ performances on a theatrical stage, this study analyzes the role of managers in (a) setting the stage for the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, (b) defining the roles <b>of</b> <b>service</b> providers, and (c) employing symbols and artifacts that give direction to the service encounters. The findings of this dissertation offer three key insights about the work of managers and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> First, while managers employ categorizations as rationalized systems of organizing, the meanings, and thus the organizing effects, of categories are related to the employees’ work. Second, managers work at an empirical interface, a point at which the organization meets the vagaries of the real world. Consequently, the work of managers in organizing the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> involves manipulating symbols, things, and people. Third, the work of managers comprises both caretaking and transforming the organization. However, caretaking or transforming actions depend on the managers’ daily encounters with the real or the abstract elements of the organization...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Social Science, Environment and Community, 2006 This thesis {{focuses on}} {{the debate over the}} private <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> water <b>services.</b> One billion people {{worldwide}} lack access to clean water, which results in millions of illnesses and deaths every year. The international financial institutions have blamed lack of access to clean water on government corruption and deficient funding. Their solution has been promoting the private <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> water <b>services</b> to increase access to clean water. Growing international social movements have been disputing the value <b>of</b> the private <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> water <b>services.</b> This thesis adds to the debates by arguing that the private <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> water <b>services</b> is a political choice, not an economic inevitability and that the private <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> water <b>services</b> does not promote the mission of the international financial institutions to decrease poverty by increasing access to clean water. The private <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> water <b>services</b> is not efficient because it is a natural monopoly and it tends to: increase water costs and service disconnections, not account for the costs from water-borne illness, concentrate investment in wealthy areas, and perpetrate corruption. The alternative solution promoted in this thesis is strong democracy based on the right to water...|$|R
25|$|Administrative costs. About 25% of U.S. {{healthcare}} costs relate to administrative costs (e.g., billing and payment, {{as opposed to}} direct <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> supplies and medicine) versus 10-15% in other countries. For example, Duke University Hospital had 900 hospital beds but 1,300 billing clerks. Assuming $3.2 trillion is spent on healthcare per year, a 10% savings would be $320 billion per year and a 15% savings would be nearly $500 billion per year. For scale, cutting administrative costs to peer country levels would represent roughly one-third to half the gap. A 2009 study from Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated $210 billion in savings from unnecessary billing and administrative costs, a figure that would be considerably higher in 2015 dollars.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Commission's 1969 report, {{known as}} the Redcliffe-Maud Report, {{proposed}} the removal {{of much of the}} then existing system of local government. The commission described the system of administering urban and rural districts separately as outdated, noting that urban areas provided employment and services for rural dwellers, and open countryside was used by town dwellers for recreation. The commission considered interdependence of areas at many levels, including travel-to-work, <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> and which local newspapers were read, before proposing a new administrative metropolitan area. The area had roughly the same northern boundary as today's Greater Manchester (though included Rossendale), but covered much more territory from Cheshire (including Macclesfield, Warrington, Alderley Edge, Northwich, Middlewich, Wilmslow and Lymm), and Derbyshire (the towns of New Mills, Whaley Bridge, Glossop and Chapel-en-le-Frith – a minority report suggested that Buxton be included). The metropolitan area was to be divided into nine metropolitan districts, based on Wigan, Bolton, Bury/Rochdale, Warrington, Manchester (including Salford and Old Trafford), Oldham, Altrincham, Stockport and Tameside. The report noted [...] "The choice even of a label of convenience for this metropolitan area is difficult". Seven years earlier, a survey prepared for the British Association intended to define the [...] "South-East Lancashire conurbation" [...] noted that [...] "Greater Manchester it is not... One of its main characteristics is the marked individuality of its towns,... all of which have an industrial and commercial history of more than local significance". The term Selnec (or SELNEC) was already in use as an abbreviation for south east Lancashire and north east Cheshire; Redcliffe-Maud took this as [...] "the most convenient term available", having modified it to south east Lancashire, north east and central Cheshire.|$|E
