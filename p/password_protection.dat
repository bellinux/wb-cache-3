30|$|Information {{systems have}} become {{the driving force of}} the airport infrastructure. Such heavy {{dependency}} of airport operations on hardware, software, data, and networks has a dual and opposing impact on airport security: while the technology has become beneficial to enhance the security of airport operations, at the same time, it poses vulnerabilities to potential cyber-attacks [35]. For example, the common use of terminal equipment (CUTE) is an IT-driven system that allows several airlines to share gates and check-in counters. However, sharing CUTE among several airlines, while increasing efficiency and lowering the cost, causes security concerns when airlines share data, protocols, procedures, and information. These concerns are related to firewalls, <b>passwords,</b> intrusion <b>protection,</b> and operational security [36]. C-FMEA methodology demonstrates the ability to address these concerns and enhance the security of information systems.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} secure {{architecture}} of a CVS-server, its implementation (i. e. mainly its configuration) and its formal analysis. Our CVS-server is uses cvsauth, that provides <b>protection</b> of <b>passwords</b> and <b>protection</b> of some internal {{data of the}} CVS repository. In contrast to other (security oriented) CVS-architectures, our approach allows the CVS-server run on an open filesystem, i. e. a filesystem where users can have direct access both by CVS-commands and by standard UNIX/POSIX commands such as mv. For our secure architecture of the CVS-server, we provide a formal specification and security analysys. The latter {{is based on a}} refinement mapping high-level security requirements on the architecture on low-level security mechanisms on the UNIX/POSIX filesystem level. The purpose of the formal analysis of the secure CVS-server architecture is twofold: First, it is the bases for the specification of mutual security properties such as non-repudiation, authentication and access control for this architecture. Second, the mapping of the architecture on standard security implementation technology is described. Thus, our approach {{can be seen as a}} method to give a formal underpinning for the usually tricky business of system administrators...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of 64 -bit microprocessors, {{it is now possible}} to combine local, secondary and remote storage into a large single address-space.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new password authentication and key agreement protocol, AMP, {{based on the}} ampli ed password idea. The intrinsic problems with password authentication are the password itself has low entropy and the password le {{is very hard to}} protect. We presentthe ampli ed password proof and the ampli ed password le for solving these problems. A party commits the high entropy information and ampli es her password with that information in the amplifed password proof. She never shows any information except that she knows it. Our ampli ed password proof idea is very similar to the zero-knowledge proof in that sense. We adds one more idea � the ampli ed password le for <b>password</b> le <b>protection.</b> Aserver stores the ampli ed veri ers in the ampli ed password le that is secure against a server le compromise and a dictionary attack. AMP mainly provides the password-veri er based authentication and the Di e-Hellman based key agreement, securely and e ciently. AMP is easy to generalize in any other cyclic groups. In spite of those plentiful properties, AMP is actually the most e cient protocol among the related protocols due to the simultaneous multiple exponentiation method. Several variants such as AMPi,AMPn,AMPn+, AMP +,AMP++, and AMPc are also proposed. Among them, AMPn is actually the basic protocol of this paper that describes the ampli ed password proof idea while AMP is the most complete protocol that adds the ampli ed password le. AMPi simply removes the ampli ed password le from AMP. Intheend,wegive a comparison to the related protocols in terms of e ciency.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore several {{contexts}} where an adversary has an upper hand over the defender by using special hardware in an attack. These include <b>password</b> processing, hard-drive <b>protection,</b> cryptocurrency mining, resource sharing, code obfuscation, etc. We suggest memory-hard computing as a generic paradigm, where every task is amalgamated with a certain procedure requiring intensive access to RAM {{both in terms of}} size and (very importantly) bandwidth, so that transferring the computation to GPU, FPGA, and even ASIC brings little or no cost reduction. Cryptographic schemes that run in this framework become egalitarian in the sense that both users and attackers are equal in the price-performance ratio conditions. Based on existing schemes like Argon 2 and the recent generalized-birthday proof-of-work, we suggest a generic framework and two new schemes: MTP, a memory-hard Proof-of-Work based on the memory-hard function with fast verification and short proofs. It can be also used for memory-hard time-lock puzzles.

Guided by general systems theory and transformational leadership theory, the focus of this exploratory multiple case study was to explore the strategies small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) leaders use to minimize the effects of information security threats on business performance. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 5 SME leaders who worked in SME firms that support oil and gas industry sector in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, had a minimum of 2 years experience in a leadership role, and had demonstrable strategies for minimizing the effects of information security threats in a SME. The thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed 10 strategies for reducing the effects of information security threats: network security, physical security, strong <b>password</b> policy, antivirus <b>protection</b> and software update, information security policy, security education training and awareness, network security monitoring and audit, intrusion detection, data backup, and people management. The findings may contribute to social change by providing SME leaders with more insight about strategies to minimize the effects of information security threats on business performance.

40|$|Despite being often {{ambivalent}} {{regarding the}} potential benefits and risks of digital media, parents begin thinking about, and finding ways to manage, the digital media use of their children when they are very young. Partly, they act out of already-established styles of parenting and family values, extending these to ICT uses at {{home as soon as}} these begin. Partly, they are already mediating the activities of their older children, and they adjust their approach to include their younger children. Partly, they are led to intervene when they see their young children respond to digital devices in ways that worry them (spending too long on one activity, staring at the screen, behaving badly when the device is taken away, etc.). However, their good intentions are often hindered by a host of everyday life practicalities. Families of different socio-economic background and education differed in their parenting styles, supporting Clark’s distinction between poorer/less educated families endorsing an ‘ethic of respectful connectedness’ and wealthier/more educated families endorsing an ‘ethic of expressive empowerment’. This was found to translate loosely – with many exceptions – into restrictive and active strategies of ICT mediation. The relationship between parenting style and parental regulation of digital devices is however mediated by parents’ own familiarity with ICT. Across all the family types, when parents had particular expertise in ICT, because of work or interests, they were more confident of managing their children’s ICT activities and more engaged in them. For all parents, but especially those who lack confidence, experience or expertise in relation to ICTs, the study revealed a need for policy and practitioner support in relation to: 	The benefits of internet use (e. g. recommended imaginative or educational sites and apps). 	The risks of internet use (e. g. commercial risks or non-appropriate age content). 	The use of technical tools to manage children’s internet use (e. g. safety settings, <b>passwords,</b> privacy <b>protection</b> and content filters). 	Communication strategies to facilitate shared activities using digital devices and parent-child discussions about preferred values and practices and how to address problems.

But as time goes by, there is a new technology known as Biometric Identification System. It uses biometric characteristics of an individual that is unique and different from everyone else and therefore can be use to authenticate the user authority access. This research is an implementation of speech recognition as medium security access control to restricted services such as phone banking system, voicemail or access to database services. First, speaker signal will go to pre-treatment process, where it will remove the background noise. Then, features from speech signal will be extracted using Me 1 Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) method. Then, using Vector Quantization, the features will be matched with the reference speech in database. The real speaker is identified by clustering the speech signal from the tested speaker to codebook of each speaker using K-means algorithm and the speaker with the lowest distortion Euclidean distances is chose as the correct speaker. The main focus of tlns research is speaker identification, which compared speech signal from unknown speaker to a database of known speaker using text-dependent utterances.
