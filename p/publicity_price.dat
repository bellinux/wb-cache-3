40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To assess {{effects of}} price, income, and health {{publicity}} on cigarette smoking by age, sex, and socioeconomic group. DESIGN [...] Econometric {{multiple regression analysis}} of data on cigarette smoking from the British general household survey. SUBJECTS [...] Random sample of adult population in Britain interviewed for biennial general household surveys 1972 - 90. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Changes in cigarette consumption and prevalence of smoking. RESULTS [...] Price elasticities of demand for cigarettes (percentage change in cigarette consumption for a 1 % change in price) were significant at - 0. 5 (95 % confidence interval - 0. 8 to - 0. 1) for men and - 0. 6 (- 0. 9 to - 0. 3) for women, were highest in socioeconomic group V (- 1. 0 for men and - 0. 9 for women), and lowest (not significantly different from zero) in socioeconomic groups I and II. The gradient in price elasticities by socioeconomic group was significant for men (F = 5. 6, P = 0. 02) and for women (F = 6. 1, P = 0. 02). Price was {{a significant factor in}} cigarette consumption by age for women in every age group and for men aged 25 - 34. Cigarette consumption by young men aged 16 - 34 increased with income. There was a significant decrease in smoking over time by women in socioeconomic groups I and II and by men in all age and social groups except socioeconomic group V attributable to health <b>publicity.</b> <b>Price</b> significantly affected smoking prevalence in socioeconomic group V (- 0. 6 for men and - 0. 5 for women) and for all women (- 0. 2). CONCLUSIONS [...] Men and women in lower socioeconomic groups are more responsive than are those in higher socioeconomic groups to changes in the price of cigarettes and less to health publicity. Women of all ages, including teenagers, appear to have been less responsive to health publicity than have men but more responsive to price. Response to health publicity decreased linearly with age. Real price increases in cigarettes could narrow differences between socioeconomic groups in smoking and the related inequalities in health, but specific measures would be necessary to ameliorate effects on the most deprived families that may include members who continue to smoke. The use of a policy to steadily increase cigarette tax is likely to help achieve the government's targets for smoking and smoking related diseases...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} price dispersion in a multi-period noisy rational expectation framework. An economy has a continuum of location each with a contin-uum of agents who trade a single asset. Each location has its own market and price. Only a fraction of locations can observe a noisy public signal about the asset traded. The model can jointly explain existence of price dispersion and its persistence through learning process. I characterize how a public signal a¤ects dynamics of price disper-sion. I 8 ̆ 5 nd {{that the impact of}} increased precision and/or publicity of a public signal on price dispersion is ambiguous: if a public signal is very precise, more precision and/or <b>publicity</b> decrease <b>price</b> dispersion, while it could go the other way if a public signal is not very precise. ...|$|R

This study focuses on consumer based perceptions of brand associations of a service brand, attitudes toward and intention to use the branded service via qualitative and quantitative methods.

Contrary to ECOs, for COSOs the parent firm's shareholders end up with free shares in the subsidiary. As the value of large share blocks {{is likely to be}} negatively affected by the emergence of new blocks after the divestiture, we hypothesize that parent firms undertaking COSOs may conduct more pre-offer publicity to attract more retail investors, keeping outside ownership diffuse and inflating aftermarket performance until the distribution of the free shares. We find empirical support for our hypotheses...|$|R

This is an exploratory study examining the differences in brand satisfaction between Malaysian Airlines (full service airlines) and Air Asia (low cost airlines) in Malaysia. 350 usable questionnaires were obtained from respondents in the two main airlines terminals in Kuala Lumpur.
