40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{an alternative}} to the ex <b>post</b> <b>pricing</b> model currently under development within ISO New Eng-land’s (ISO NE) ancillary service market. Since ISO NE’s real-time ancillary service market co-optimizes both energy and reserve products, ex <b>post</b> <b>pricing</b> is needed for both energy and reserve. A co-optimization approach for ex <b>post</b> <b>pricing</b> requires defining com-plex pricing rules and implementing heuristics to ensure consistent binding constraints with the ex ante dispatch. In order to avoid com-plexity and uncertainty of required heuristics, a new ex <b>post</b> <b>pricing</b> schema is proposed to calculate the ex post energy and reserve prices in a decoupled way while recognizing the coupling effect of energy and reserve. In the proposed approach, ex <b>post</b> energy <b>prices</b> are first computed by incorporating the ex ante marginal opportunity cost of reserve in the energy offer; the ex <b>post</b> reserve <b>prices</b> are then calculated by considering the ex post marginal opportunit...|$|R
25|$|In many areas, {{some form}} of price {{stickiness}} is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting {{in the short run}} to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and <b>posted</b> <b>prices</b> in markets deviating from perfect competition.|$|E
500|$|In February 1959, as new {{supplies}} were becoming available, the multinational oil companies (MOCs) unilaterally reduced their <b>posted</b> <b>prices</b> for Venezuelan and Middle Eastern crude oil by 10 percent. Weeks later, the Arab League's first Arab Petroleum Congress convened in Cairo, Egypt, where the influential journalist Wanda Jablonski introduced Saudi Arabia's Abdullah Tariki to Venezuela's observer Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, representing the two then-largest oil-producing nations outside the United States and the Soviet Union. Both oil ministers were {{angered by the}} price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement, calling for an [...] "Oil Consultation Commission" [...] of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans. Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against [...] "absentee landlordism" [...] of the MOCs, {{which at the time}} controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence. In August 1960, ignoring the warnings, and with the US favoring Canadian and Mexican oil for strategic reasons, the MOCs again unilaterally announced significant cuts in their <b>posted</b> <b>prices</b> for Middle Eastern crude oil.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} revenue {{performance}} of sequential <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms and some natural extensions, {{for a general}} setting where the valuations of the buyers are drawn from a correlated distribution. Sequential <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms are conceptually simple mechanisms that work by proposing a “take-it-or-leave-it” offer to each buyer. We apply sequential <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms to single-parameter multi-unit settings in which each buyer demands only one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the buyers. For standard sequential <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms, we prove that with the valuation distribution having finite support, no sequential <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanism can extract a constant fraction of the optimal expected revenue, even with unlimited supply. We extend this result {{to the case of}} a continuous valuation distribution when various standard assumptions hold simultaneously. In fact, {{it turns out that the}} best fraction of the optimal revenue that is extractable by a sequential <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanism is proportional to the ratio of the highest and lowest possible valuation. We prove that for two simple generalizations of these mechanisms, a better revenue performance can be achieved: if the sequential <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanism has for each buyer the option of either proposing an offer or asking the buyer for its valuation, then a Ω(1 / max{ 1, d}) fraction of the optimal revenue can be extracted, where d denotes the “degree of dependence” of the valuations, ranging from complete independence (d = 0) to arbitrary dependence (d = n− 1). When we generalize the sequential <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms further, such that the mechanism has the ability to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the i-th buyer that depends on the valuations of all buyers except i, we prove that a constant fraction (2 − (Formula presented) / 4 ≈ 0. 088 of the optimal revenue can be always extracted. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three chapters. It analyzes {{a market}} where firms can choose {{whether or not}} to publicly <b>post</b> their <b>prices.</b> <b>Price</b> <b>posting</b> rewards a firm by reducing search costs for customers and thus attracting more demand, at the risk of triggering more direct price competition. In the first two chapters, I use a continuous model and a discrete model to discuss possible market equilibria, respectively. In a non-cooperative and dynamic environment, I find that when the supporting information technology becomes available to all firms, a firm wants to <b>post</b> <b>prices</b> only when it has appropriate cost advantage over its competitors. A lower cost of <b>posting</b> <b>prices</b> encourages firms to <b>post</b> their <b>prices.</b> <b>Price</b> <b>posting</b> improves market efficiency unless one firm has too much cost advantage. When a more efficient entrant replaces the incumbent price-posting firm, the incumbent wants to hide its prices again. These results explain why in some markets firms or individual traders hesitate to publicly <b>post</b> their <b>prices</b> and some even impose search costs on their prices. In the third chapter, I use a laboratory experiment to show how a market evolves when firms or individual traders endogenously determine the search costs on their prices. In the experiment, human subjects play sellers and the computer calculates demands and profits, assuming consumers behave optimally. I assign costs and demand parameters to subjects and let them choose both their prices and {{whether or not to}} publicly post them. I alter the production costs, the fixed cost of <b>posting</b> <b>prices,</b> and the possibility of communication among subjects across treatments to show the effect of these factors on market structure. Experimental results show that one is more likely to <b>post</b> <b>prices</b> when he or she has lower unit cost and when the fixed cost of <b>posting</b> <b>prices</b> becomes lower. <b>Price</b> <b>posting</b> lowers effective <b>prices</b> when communication among subjects is not allowed but raises prices when subjects can communicate with each other...|$|R

40|$|Although take-it-or-leave-it pricing is {{the main}} mode of {{operation}} for many retailers, a number of retailers discreetly allow price negotiation when some haggle-prone customers ask for a bargain. At these retailers, the <b>posted</b> <b>price,</b> which itself is subject to dynamic adjustments {{in response to the}} pace of sales during the selling season, serves two important roles: (i) it is the take-it-or-leave-it price to many customers who do not bargain, and (ii) it is the price from which haggle-prone customers negotiate down. In order to effectively measure the benefit of dynamic pricing and negotiation in such a retail environment, one must take into account the interactions among inventory, dynamic pricing, and negotiation. The outcome of the negotiation (and the final price a customer pays) depends on the inventory level, the remaining selling season, the retailer’s bargaining power, and the <b>posted</b> <b>price.</b> We model the retailer’s dynamic pricing problem as a dynamic program, where the rev-enues from both negotiation and <b>posted</b> <b>pricing</b> are embedded in each period.

40|$|Though haggling {{has been}} the {{conventional}} way for auto retailers to sell cars, {{the last two decades}} have witnessed the systematic adoption of no-haggle prices by many large dealerships, including the largest used car dealership, Carmax. This paper develops a structural empirical model to estimate dealers' profits under <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> and haggling and investigate the conditions leading to the heterogenous choices of pricing policies that we observe. The model incorporates a simple class of bargaining mechanisms into the standard BLP model. With the extension, the paper is able to estimate the product-level demand system using data with only list prices and estimate the discounts achieved in haggling. The counterfactual experiments based on the estimates yield a few interesting findings. First, dealers using <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> would see their profits increase only slightly if they haggled, whereas the haggling dealers' profits would drop significantly if they switched to <b>posting</b> <b>prices.</b> Second, the market power enjoyed by the nonhaggling dealerships through vertical differentiation and carrying large number of models is a major factor contributing to the variation in the relative performance of <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> and haggling...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{experiments}} {{have been widely}} used to elicit individuals’ evaluation for various commodities and non-market goods. Common elicitation methods include auctions and <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms. Experimental auctions are theoretically incentive compatible so are assumed to give an unbiased estimate of individuals’ evaluation including willingness to pay (WTP). However, the vast majority of purchasing decisions are not made in auctions but in market settings, such as grocery stores, where consumers make yes/no decisions in response to a set price. In this research, we carefully design an experiment to compare homegrown-value WTP estimates between an auction and a <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> elicitation format. This design enables us to make both within- and between-subjects comparisons of the mean WTP and marginal effect estimates. Results from 115 adult consumers indicate that WTP estimates obtained from an auction are approximately 32 % - 39 % smaller than WTP estimates obtained from a <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanism. In addition, we compare the statistical significance and conclude that auctions require a smaller sample size than <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms in order to detect the same preference change. Nevertheless, the signs of marginal effects for different product characteristics are consistent in both mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|In {{the quest}} for market {{mechanisms}} {{that are easy to}} implement, yet close to optimal, few seem as viable as <b>posted</b> <b>pricing.</b> Despite the growing body of impressive results, the performance of most <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms however, rely crucially on price discrimination when multiple copies of a good are available. For the more general case with non-linear production costs on each good, hardly anything is known for general multi-good markets. With this in mind, we study a Bayesian setting where the seller can produce any number of copies of a good but faces convex production costs for the same, and buyers arrive sequentially. Our main contribution is a framework for non-discriminatory pricing in the presence of production costs: the framework yields <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms with O(1) -approximation factors for fractionally subadditive (XoS) buyers, logarithmic approximations for subadditive buyers, and also extends to settings where the seller is oblivious to buyer valuations.

5000|$|The {{posted price}} of oil was {{originally}} the determinant factor of the taxes that oil companies had to pay. This concept was beneficial to the oil companies {{because they were the}} ones who controlled the <b>posted</b> <b>prices.</b> Companies could increase the actual {{price of oil}} without changing the posted price, thus avoiding an increase in taxes paid to the producing country.Oil-producing countries did not realize that the companies were adjusting oil prices until the cost of oil dropped in the late 1950s and companies started reducing <b>posted</b> <b>prices</b> very frequently. [...] The main reason for the reduction in oil prices was the change in the world’s energy situation after 1957 that led to competition between energy sources. Efforts to find markets led to price cuts. Price cutting was first achieved by shaving profit margins, but soon prices were reduced to levels far lower than <b>posted</b> <b>prices</b> as companies producing oil in the Middle East started to offer crude to independent and state-owned refineries.|$|E
