2500|$|In {{search for}} help in {{expelling}} British forces from Palestine, thus removing the enforcer of the Zionist enterprise, the Grand Mufti sought alliance with the Axis Powers. The response of the British government was to banish the Mufti (where {{he spent much of}} World War II in Germany and helped form a Muslim SS division in the Balkans), curb Jewish immigration, and reinforce its police force. The Jewish leadership (Yishuv) [...] "adopted a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> (havlaga) and static defense in response to Arab attacks" [...] and criticized the British for [...] "what they regarded as Britain's retreat from the Balfour Declaration and its conciliation of Arab violence." [...] It was at this time that critics of this policy broke away from the Hagana (the self-defense organization of the Yishuv) and created the more right-wing militant Irgun, which would later be led by Menachem Begin in 1943.

2500|$|Both Israeli {{government}} {{and air force}} had by now realised that the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>restraint</b> versus the Soviets had failed. For the first time, Israel's hard-won aerial supremacy was under serious threat, {{not only on the}} west bank of the Suez Canal, but over Israeli-controlled territory as well. The Israeli Air Force therefore proposed to take the Soviets head-on, hoping to demonstrate that although it possessed no operational answer to the extensive air defence array forming on {{the west bank of the}} Suez Canal, it was nevertheless superior in the air. The opportunity to punish the Soviets would also serve to boost flagging morale following the loss of several aircraft and airmen in the previous few months, and would also prove valuable in upcoming ceasefire negotiations. IAF Chief of Staff Mordechai (Motti) Hod, backed by IDF Chief of the General Staff Haim Bar-Lev, took his case to the Israeli cabinet on July 25. Once the approval of Golda Meir's government had been received, the IAF then set about organizing a planned team ambush. Such ambushes had been carried out before, under the code name [...] "Rimon" [...] (Pomegranate), and an existing plan was now brought up to date and designated [...] "Rimon 20". Initially planned for July 29, it was later pushed back to July 30.|$|E
