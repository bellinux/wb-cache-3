40|$|Cerebral {{autosomal}} dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) {{is the most}} common hereditary subcortical vascular dementia. It is caused by mutations in NOTCH 3 gene, which encodes a large transmembrane receptor Notch 3. The key pathological finding is the accumulation of granular osmiophilic material (GOM), which contains extracellular domains of Notch 3, on degenerating vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). GOM has been considered specifically diagnostic for CADASIL, but the reports on the sensitivity <b>of</b> detecting <b>GOM</b> in patients’ skin biopsy have been contradictory. To solve this contradiction, we performed a retrospective investigation of 131 Finnish, Swedish and French CADASIL patients, who had been adequately examined for both NOTCH 3 mutation and presence <b>of</b> <b>GOM.</b> The patients were examined according to the diagnostic practice in each country. NOTCH 3 mutations were assessed by restriction enzyme analysis of specific mutations or by sequence analysis. Presence <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> was examined by electron microscopy (EM) in skin biopsies. Biopsies of 26 mutation-negative relatives from CADASIL families served as the controls. GOM was detected in all 131 mutation positive patients. Altogether our patients had 34 different pathogenic mutations which included three novel point mutations (p. Cys 67 Ser, p. Cys 251 Tyr and p. Tyr 1069 Cys) and a novel duplication (p. Glu 434 _Leu 436 dup). The detection <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> by EM in skin biopsies was a highly reliable diagnostic method: in this cohort the congruence between NOTCH 3 mutations and presence <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> was 100 %. However, due to the retrospective nature of this study, exact figure for sensitivity cannot be determined, but it would require a prospective study to exclude possible selection bias. The identification of a pathogenic NOTCH 3 mutation is an indisputable evidence for CADASIL, but demonstration <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> provides a cost-effective guide for estimating how far one should proceed with the extensive search for a new or an uncommon mutations among the presently known over 170 different NOTCH 3 gene defects. The diagnostic skin biopsy should include the border zone between deep dermis and upper subcutis, where small arterial vessels of correct size are located. Detection <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> requires technically adequate biopsies and distinction <b>of</b> true <b>GOM</b> from fallacious deposits.

40|$|Goal {{oriented}} modelling (<b>GOM)</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} prominent and widely accepted techniques in information systems research. Since the early 1990 ’s, a large number <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> approaches have been proposed aiming to a better alignment between business strategy and the behaviour of supporting systems. Different GOM approaches focus on different activities {{in the early stages}} of system development and propose a variety of strategies for reasoning about goals. A number of researchers have stressed the advantages <b>of</b> integrating different <b>GOM</b> techniques, especially in the context of modern global business environments. This is evidenced in the increasing number of publications in this area. However as each GOM language (even versions of the same language) comes with its own syntactic and semantic singularities, such integration requires a number of complicated transformations which is a major obstacle to model and tool interoperability, and prevent wider adoption by practitioners. In order to provide a unified view <b>of</b> <b>GOM,</b> one needs a common understanding <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> concepts, their semantics and deployment. To this end, this paper proposes a language independent meta-model based on the analysis <b>of</b> eight <b>GOM</b> languages. Generic concepts were identified and a robust semantic definition among these concepts was built in a unified meta-model. We claim that the unified GOM meta-model could help in a) analysing existing goal models in order to provide insights regarding different goal modelling perspectives b) identify semantic similarities / overlaps between existing GOM techniques c) provide the basis for a reference model for GOM...|$|R
40|$|Green Operations Management (GOM) is {{becoming}} an increasingly important element in the strategic agenda of many enterprises. Its main aim is to enhance the ability of an enterprise to address stakeholder environmental concerns throughout the entire product life cycle (PLC). Earlier studies have recognized GOM as a useful tool to improve competitiveness (Zhang et al., 2008; Sarkis et al., 2010) and business performance (Kassinis and Vafeas, 2006; Jacobs et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2012) Over the last few decades, the role of environmental management in achieving sustainable economic development is attracting growing global attention both theoretically and empirically. GOM is particularly important for enhancing the attractiveness of manufacturing companies of less developed countries such as Oman, to be selected {{as a partner in}} the global supply chain network of multi-national companies. However, {{there is a lack of}} integrative empirical studies to link and simultaneously examine the interrelationships between environmental drivers, practices and performance of manufacturing firms in general and within the context of less developed countries in particular. Through a review <b>of</b> the <b>GOM</b> and strategic environmental management literature, several unexplored areas were identified which are related to: a) The need for empirical studies to conceptualise various types of environmental practices as complementary to each other. Complementarity <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices refers here to the combined sum of the effects of different sets <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices being greater together than individually. b) The need for empirical studies to examine the influence of two distinct groups of stakeholders (i. e. market and non-market stakeholders) on the adoption <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices. c) The need for empirical studies to examine whether the relationship between stakeholder pressures and the adoption <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices is mediated by an organisation’s internal capabilities such as the development of environmental cross-functional collaboration (CFC). CFC is here defined as the extent of intra-organisational collaboration, interaction and integration of various core functional areas within the firm on environmentally significant issues (Auh and Menguc, 2005). d) The need for empirical studies investigating whether this mediated effect of CFC holds across firms regardless of their size, level of pollution intensity and degree of international orientation. e) The need for empirical studies examining whether environmental performance is considered as a mediator on the relationships between GOM practices and organisational savings and spending, where organisational savings and spending respectively reflect the saving advantages and increase in overall spending resulting from the adoption <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices. This research is explanatory, deductive in nature, and underpinned mainly by a quantitative research design that was supplemented by document analysis of environmental strategies and performance and some qualitative semi-structured interviews with managers of five Omani manufacturing firms. To achieve the objectives of this research, an integrated conceptual framework was developed and set of hypotheses were proposed. The analysis of the survey data collected from 138 Omani manufacturing firms was conducted using structural equation modelling. In this research, empirical support was found for most of the research hypotheses, generally revealing that pressures from both market and non-market stakeholders can influence the adoption <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices and that adoption <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices can influence organisational business benefits, spending and environmental performance. However, the relationship between the adoption <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices and organisational business benefits was found to be further mediated by the level of environmental performance. Moreover, by integrating four distinct, yet interrelated sets, of environmental practices into a second order factor/construct called ‘collective GOM competency’, this research found empirical evidence for the superiority of the second order construct in explaining the relationships between the antecedents and consequences of the adoption of environmental practices. Furthermore, the mediation effect of CFC on the relationship between stakeholder pressures and the adoption of environmental practices was empirically confirmed. This mediation effect of CFC was found to be significantly stronger only for the case of highly internationalised firms compared to their counterparts. Hence, firm characteristics are not always considered as moderators on the relationship between CFC and the adoption <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> practices. The findings of this study provide new directions for future research and new theoretical and practical insights in GOM practices in manufacturing firms. [N. B.

40|$|A box model {{incorporating}} a state-of-the-art chemical mechanism for atmospheric mercury (Hg) cycling {{was developed to}} investigate the oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) at three locations in the northeastern United States: Appledore Island (AI; marine), Thompson Farm (TF; coastal, rural), and Pack Monadnock (PM; inland, rural, elevated). The chemical mechanism in this box model included the most up-to-date Hg and halogen chemistry. As a result, the box model was able to simulate reasonably the observed diurnal cycles of gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) and chemical speciation bearing distinct differences between the three sites. In agreement with observations, simulated GOM diurnal cycles at AI and TF showed significant daytime peaks {{in the afternoon and}} nighttime minimums compared to flat GOM diurnal cycles at PM. Moreover, significant differences in the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> diurnal amplitude (AI > TF > PM) were captured in modeled results. At the coastal and inland sites, GEM oxidation was predominated by O 3 and OH, contributing 80 – 99  % <b>of</b> total <b>GOM</b> production during daytime. H 2 O 2 -initiated GEM oxidation was significant (∼  33  % <b>of</b> the total <b>GOM)</b> at the inland site during nighttime. In the marine boundary layer (MBL) atmosphere, Br and BrO became dominant GEM oxidants, with mixing ratios reaching 0. 1 and 1  pptv, respectively, and contributing ∼  70  % <b>of</b> the total <b>GOM</b> production during midday, while O 3 dominated GEM oxidation (50 – 90  % <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> production) over the remaining day when Br and BrO mixing ratios were diminished. The majority of HgBr produced from GEM+Br was oxidized by NO 2 and HO 2 to form brominated GOM species. Relative humidity and products of the CH 3 O 2 +BrO reaction possibly significantly affected the mixing ratios of Br or BrO radicals and subsequently GOM formation. Gas–particle partitioning could potentially be important in the production <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> as well as Br and BrO at the marine site...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Fast {{and precise}} {{diagnostics}} {{of the disease}} from the large group of adult leukoencephalopathy is difficult but responsible job, because {{the outcome of the}} disease is very often determined by its name. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by the mutation of Notch 3 gene on chromosome locus 19 p 13. Beside the brain arterioles being the main disease targets, extracerebral small blood vessels are affected by the pathological process. Clinically present signs are recurrent ischemic strokes and vascular dementia. CADASIL in its progressive form shows a distinctive pattern of pathological changes on MRI of endocranium. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in histopathological skin biopsies. Case reports. Two young adult patients manifested ischemic strokes of unknown etiology, cognitive deterioration, migraine and psychopathological phenomenology. MRI of endocranium pointed on CADASIL. Ultrastructural examination of skin biopsy proved the presence <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> in the basal lamina and near smooth muscle cells of arteriole dermis leading to CADASIL diagnosis. The presence <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> in histopathological preparation is 100 % specific for CADASIL. The patients were not searched for mutation in Notch 3 gene on chromosome 19, because some other leukoencephalopathy was disregarded. Conclusion. Suggestive clinical picture, distinctive finding of endocranium MRI, the presence <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> by ultrastructural examination of histopathological skin biopsies are sufficient to confirm CADASIL diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Mercury (Hg) is {{a global}} health concern due to its {{toxicity}} and ubiquitous presence in the environment. Here we review current methods for measuring the forms of Hg in the atmosphere and models used to interpret these data. There are three operationally defined forms of atmospheric Hg: gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), and particulate bound mercury (PBM). There is relative confidence in GEM measurements (collection on a gold surface), but GOM (collection on potassium chloride (KCl) -coated denuder) and PBM (collected using various methods) are less well understood. Field and laboratory investigations suggest the methods to measure GOM and PBM are impacted by analytical interferences that vary with environmental setting (e. g., ozone, relative humidity), and GOM concentrations measured by the KCl-coated denuder can be too low {{by a factor of}} 1. 6 to 12 depending on the chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>GOM.</b> The composition <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> (e. g., HgBr 2, HgCl 2, HgBrOH) varies across space and time. This has important implications for refining existing measurement methods and developing new ones, model/measurement comparisons, model development, and assessing trends. Unclear features of previously published data may now be re-examined and possibly explained, which is demonstrated through a case study. Priorities for future research include identification <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> compounds in ambient air and development of information on their chemical and physical properties and GOM and PBM calibration systems.

40|$|The {{ecosystem}} model OSMOSE-WFS {{was employed}} to evaluate natural mortality rates and fishing scenarios for Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico (<b>GOM)</b> red grouper (Epinephelus mono). OSMOSE-WFS represents major high trophic level (HIT.) groups of species of the West Florida Shelf, is forced by the biomass of plankton and benthos groups, and has a monthly tin-se step. The present application of the model uses a recently developed 'stochastic mortality algorithm' to resolve the mortality processes of HTL groups. OSMOSE-WFS predictions suggest that the natural mortality rate <b>of</b> juveniles <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> red grouper is high and essentially due to predation, while {{the bulk of the}} natural mortality of adult red grouper results from causes not represented in OSMOSE-WFS such as, presumably, red tides. These results were communicated to GOM red grouper stock assessments. Moreover, OSMOSE-WFS indicate that altering the fishing mortality <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> red grouper may have no global impact on the biomass of the major prey of red grouper, due to the high complexity and high redundancy of the modeled system. By contrast altering the fishing mortality <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> red grouper may have a large impact on the biomass of its major competitors. Increasing the fishing mortality of red grouper would increase the biomass of major competitors, due to reduced competition for food. Conversely, decreasing the fishing mortality of red grouper would diminish the biomass of major competitors, due to increased predation pressure on the juveniles of the major competitors by red grouper. The fishing scenarios that we evaluated may have slightly different impacts in the real world, due to some discrepancies between the diets of red grouper and its major competitors predicted by OSMOSE-WFS and the observed ones. Modifications in OSMOSE-WFS are suggested to reduce these discrepancies...|$|R

40|$|The highest mercury (Hg) wet {{deposition}} in the United States of America (USA) occurs along the Gulf of Mexico, {{and in the}} southern and central Mississippi River Valley. Gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM) {{is thought to be}} a major contributor due to high water solubility and reactivity. Therefore, it is critical to understand concentrations, potential for wet and dry deposition, and GOM compounds present in the air. Concentrations and dry-deposition fluxes <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> were measured and calculated for Naval Air Station Pensacola Outlying Landing Field (OLF) in Florida using data collected by a Tekran ® 2537 / 1130 / 1135, the University of Nevada Reno Reactive Mercury Active System (UNRRMAS) with cation exchange and nylon membranes, and the Aerohead samplers that use cation-exchange membranes to determine dry deposition. Relationships with Tekran ® -derived data must be interpreted with caution, since the GOM concentrations measured are biased low depending on the chemical compounds in air and interferences with water vapor and ozone. Criteria air pollutants were concurrently measured. This allowed for comparison and better understanding <b>of</b> <b>GOM.</b> In addition to other methods previously applied at OLF, use of the UNRRMAS provided a platform for determination of the chemical compounds <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> in the air. Results from nylon membranes with thermal desorption analyses indicated seven GOM compounds in this area, including HgBr 2, HgCl 2, HgO, Hg–nitrogen and sulfur compounds, and two unknown compounds. This indicates that the site is influenced by different gaseous phase reactions and sources. Using back-trajectory analysis during a high-GOM event related to high CO, but average SO 2, indicated air parcels moved from the free troposphere and across Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama at low elevation (<[*] 300  m). This event was initially characterized by HgBr 2, followed by a mixture <b>of</b> <b>GOM</b> compounds. Overall, GOM chemistry indicates oxidation reactions with local mobile source pollutants and long-range transport. In order to develop methods to measure GOM concentrations and chemistry, and model dry-deposition processes, the actual GOM compounds need to be known, as well as their corresponding physicochemical properties, such as Henry's Law constants...|$|R
