In a previous paper we emphasized the role that elastic resonant scattering through WH molecules can have in dumping <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> background <b>radiation</b> (CBR) anisotropies and raising secondary signals. Here we extend our analysis to all the evolutionary stages of a primordial cloud, starting with the linear phase, through the turnaround, and to the nonlinear collapse. We have done calculations for protoclouds in a cold dark matter (CDM) scenario and, more generally, for a set of clouds with various masses and various turnaround redshifts, in this case without referring to any particular structure formation scenario. We found that the first phase of collapse, for t/t(free-fall) = 0. 05 - 0. 2 is the best one for simultaneous detection of the first two LiH rotational lines. The observational frequency falls between 30 and 250 GHz, and the line width Delta nu/nu is between 10 (- 5) and 10 (- 4).

40|$|A {{new method}} for energy and mass {{composition}} estimation of <b>primary</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>radiation</b> based on atmospheric Cerenkov light flux in extensive air showers (EAS) analysis is proposed. The Cerenkov light flux in EAS initiated by primary protons and iron nuclei is simulated with CORSIKA 5. 62 code for Chacaltaya observation level (536 g/cm 2) {{in the energy}} range 10 TeV - 10 PeV. An adequate model, approximation of lateral distribution of Cerenkov light in showers is obtained. Using the proposed model and solution of overdetermined system of nonlinear equations based on Gauss Newton method with autoregularization, two different array detector arrangements are compared. The detector response for the detector sets is simulated. The accuracies in energy and shower axis determination are studied and the corresponding selection criteria are proposed. An approximation with nonlinear fit is obtained and the energy dependence of the proposed model function parameters is studied. The approximation of model parameters as function of the primary energy is carried out. This permits, {{taking into account the}} properties of the proposed method and model, to distinguish proton primaries from iron primaries.
