Infected horses should also be placed on <b>pyrimethamine</b> at the dose of 1.0mg/kg given once a day orally for 120 days or longer.

2500|$|A {{number of}} drugs {{interfere}} with the biosynthesis of folic acid and THF. Among them are the [...] such as trimethoprim, <b>pyrimethamine,</b> and methotrexate; the sulfonamides (competitive inhibitors of 4-aminobenzoic acid in the reactions of dihydropteroate synthetase).|$|E
2500|$|As Tay–Sachs {{disease is}} a {{deficiency}} of β-hexosaminidase A, by getting a substance that increases its activity, people affected will not be deteriorating as fast or not at all. While for infantile Tay–Sachs disease, there is no β-hexosaminidase A so then the treatment would be ineffective. However, for people affected by Late-Onset Tay–Sachs disease, they still have β-hexosaminidase A. [...] The drug <b>Pyrimethamine</b> {{has been shown to}} increase activity of β-hexosaminidase A. However, the increased levels of β-hexosaminidase A still fall far short of the desired [...] "10% of normal HEXA", above which the phenotypic symptoms begin to disappear.|$|E
50|$|Small extramacular lesions (lesions not {{threatening}} vision) may {{be observed}} without treatment. Sight-threatening lesions are treated for 4-6 weeks with triple therapy consisting of <b>pyrimethamine,</b> sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. During treatment with <b>pyrimethamine,</b> leukocyte and platelet counts should be monitored weekly. Folinic acid protects against {{the decrease in}} platelets and white blood cells induced by <b>pyrimethamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In India, {{over a dozen}} {{pharmaceutical}} companies manufacture and sell <b>pyrimethamine</b> tablets, and multiple combinations of generic <b>pyrimethamine</b> are available for a price ranging from US$0.04 to US$0.10 each (3-7 rupees).|$|E
5000|$|Resistance to <b>pyrimethamine</b> is widespread. Mutations in the malarial {{gene for}} dihydrofolate reductase may reduce its effectiveness. [...] These {{mutations}} decrease the binding affinity between <b>pyrimethamine</b> and dihydrofolate reductase via loss of hydrogen bonds and steric interactions.|$|E
5000|$|Antifolates like <b>pyrimethamine,</b> {{proguanil}} and methotrexate {{increase the}} risk of associated side effects like bone marrow toxicity, folic acid supplementation should be considered. A significant risk of megaloblastic anaemia exists with doses of <b>pyrimethamine</b> in excess of 25 mg/wk.|$|E
50|$|Folinic acid is also {{sometimes}} {{used to prevent}} toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and <b>pyrimethamine.</b> It may be prescribed {{in the treatment of}} toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists <b>pyrimethamine</b> and sulfadiazine.|$|E

50|$|Tests {{performed}} by the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom indicated {{that one of the}} five suspected drugs - Isotab - was contaminated. The report also showed that Isotab contained <b>Pyrimethamine</b> which is in fact used for the treatment of malaria. The presence of <b>pyrimethamine</b> proved to be toxic. Tests done at the Central Drugs Laboratory in Karachi also verified the presence of <b>pyrimethamine</b> used in certain combinations to treat malaria in a sample of the Isotab tablet (20 mg). The laboratory also declared a batch of Alfagril as substandard.|$|E

5000|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{gastrointestinal}} upset, severe allergic reactions, bone marrow suppression.

While occasionally used in pregnancy it is unclear if <b>pyrimethamine</b> is safe for the baby. <b>Pyrimethamine</b> is classified as a folic acid antagonist. It works by inhibiting folic acid metabolism and therefore the making of DNA.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of an}} {{academic}} extension activity, a group of year 11 students attempted to prepare the medication <b>pyrimethamine</b> (sold as Daraprim) in 2016. <b>Pyrimethamine</b> is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system, for both adults and children. [...] It is used to treat toxoplasmosis, cystoisosporiasis, and malaria (in combination with sulfadoxine). [...] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. [...] It received significant attention when its manufacturer in the United States was acquired by Turing Pharmaceuticals, and its CEO Martin Shkreli decided to increase the price from US$13.50 to US$750 a dose. [...] Partly {{in an effort to}} illustrate the absurdity of this price increase, a group of year 11 students from Grammar, supported by the University of Sydney and the Open Source Malaria consortium, have prepared <b>pyrimethamine.</b> [...] The students started with 17 g of (4-chlorophenyl)acetonitrile (which is available from Sigma-Aldrich for $36.50 per 100 g) and prepared 3.7 g of <b>pyrimethamine,</b> which is about US$110,000 at Turing's prices.|$|E
50|$|In-feed <b>pyrimethamine</b> and {{sulfadimethoxine}} {{can help}} prevent the disease. Prevention is by control of the infecting vectors but {{is often difficult to}} implement.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{uncertainty}} over the true incidence of serious adverse effects, notably the cutaneous reactions that stopped {{the use of}} sulfadoxine <b>pyrimethamine</b> as prophylaxis.|$|E
50|$|Among these, albendazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, allopurinol, mercaptopurine, mupriocin, <b>pyrimethamine,</b> ranitidine, thioguanine, {{trimethoprim}} and zidovudine {{are listed}} on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.|$|E
50|$|Other antifolate agents such as {{methotrexate}} and trimethoprim may potentiate the antifolate {{actions of}} <b>pyrimethamine,</b> leading to potential folate deficiency, anaemia, and other blood dyscrasias.|$|E
50|$|Methotrexate acts on dihydrofolate reductase, like <b>pyrimethamine</b> or trimethoprim, as an {{inhibitor}} {{and thus}} reduces {{the amount of}} tetrahydrofolate made. This may result in megaloblastic anemia.|$|E
50|$|Sulfonamides are {{contraindicated}} {{in infants}} less than 2 months old (exception when used with <b>pyrimethamine</b> in treating toxoplasmosis) as they increase unconjugated bilirubin leading to kernicterus.|$|E
50|$|If the {{parasite}} {{has not yet}} reached the fetus, spiramycin can help to prevent placental transmission. If the fetus has been infected, the pregnant woman can be treated with <b>pyrimethamine</b> and sulfadiazine, with folinic acid, after the first trimester. They are treated after the first trimester because <b>pyrimethamine</b> has an antifolate effect, and lack of folic acid can interfere with fetal brain formation and cause thrombocytopaenia. Infection in earlier gestational stages correlates with poorer fetal and neonatal outcomes, particularly when the infection is untreated.|$|E
