5|$|Loving's early {{adulthood}} involved several stints in the U.S. Army as a musician, and later regimental bandleader. A later <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> at the New England Conservatory of Music ended when Loving decided {{to rejoin the}} Army over the protests of his professors, who believed his talent as a cornetist would be wasted. After withdrawing from the conservatory, Loving was given command of the band of the 45th United States Volunteer Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's birthname was Jacob Liebmann Beer; he {{was born}} in Tasdorf (now a part of Rüdersdorf), near Berlin, then the capital of Prussia, to a Jewish family. His father was the {{enormously}} wealthy financier Judah Herz Beer (1769–1825) and his mother, Amalia (Malka) Wulff (1767–1854), to whom he was particularly devoted, also came from the moneyed elite. Their other children included the astronomer Wilhelm Beer and the poet Michael Beer. He was to adopt the surname Meyerbeer on the death of his grandfather Liebmann Meyer Wulff (1811) and the first name Giacomo during his <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> in Italy, around 1817.|$|E
5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, New Hampshire. He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E

5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E
5|$|The {{younger son}} of Henry and Margaret Wright, Edward Wright {{was born in}} the village of Garveston in Norfolk, East Anglia, and was baptised there on 8 October 1561. It is {{possible}} that he followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Thomas (died 1579) and went to school in Hardingham. The family was of modest means, and he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge, on 8 December 1576 as a sizar. Sizars were students of limited means who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> often in exchange for performing work at their colleges.|$|E
5|$|Michael Tippett {{was born}} in London in 1905, to well-to-do though {{unconventional}} parents. His father, a lawyer and businessman, was a freethinker, his mother a writer and suffragette. He received piano lessons as a child, but first showed his musical prowess while a pupil at Stamford School in Lincolnshire, between 1920 and 1922. Although the school's formal music curriculum was slight, Tippett received private piano tuition from Frances Tinkler, a noted local teacher whose most distinguished pupil had been Malcolm Sargent, himself a former pupil at Stamford. Tippett's chance purchase in a local bookshop of Stanford's book Musical Composition led to his determination to be a composer, and in April 1923 he was accepted {{as a student at}} the Royal College of Music (RCM). Here he studied composition, first under Charles Wood (who died in 1926) and later, less successfully, with Charles Kitson. He also studied conducting, first under Sargent and later under Adrian Boult. He left the RCM in December 1928, but after two years spent unsuccessfully attempting to launch his career as a composer, he returned to the college in 1930 for a further <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> principally under the professor of counterpoint, R.

25|$|Since 1998, all German {{states had}} {{introduced}} tuition fees for long-time students (Langzeitstudiengebühren) of €500 up to €900 per semester. These fees {{are required for}} students who study substantially longer than the standard <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> (Regelstudienzeit), which is a defined number of semesters for each degree program. Even after the abolition of general tuition fees, tuition fees for long-time students remain in six states.

25|$|A Protestant baptism is held to {{be valid}} by the Catholic Church if given with the {{trinitarian}} formula and {{with the intent to}} baptize. However, as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized {{due to the lack of}} apostolic succession and the disunity from Catholic Church, all other sacraments (except marriage) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid. Therefore, Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized (although they are confirmed) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} check whether {{dimensionality}} of the two-factor model {{depends on the}} students’ academic background, we tested several multiple-group models with two grouping variables, as the ‘type of general secondary school’ (0  = nonacademic track, 1  = academic track) and ‘VET-year’ as a dummy coded variable (0  = early <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies,</b> 1  = later <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies).</b> For each <b>of</b> the grouping variables, we did a model comparison between two multiple-group models. In the first model, the factor correlation was allowed to vary across groups, whereas in the second it was equal across groups. Loadings, intercepts, and residual variances of the indicators were set invariant across groups. Referring to ‘type of general secondary school’ as a grouping variable, the factor correlation for the nonacademic track group (r = . 52; SE = . 31) does not differ significantly (TRd =  3.16, p = . 075, ∆df =  1, N =  238) from the factor correlation for the academic track group (r = . 84; SE = . 06). Referring to ‘VET-year’ as a grouping variable, the factor correlations also does not differ significantly (TRd =  2.52, p = . 112, ∆df =  1, N =  271) between the early (r = . 62; SE = . 14) and the later <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> (r = . 76; SE = . 06).|$|R

25|$|Samuel Dyer {{was born}} at the Royal Greenwich Hospital, England to John Dyer and Eliza (Seager). He was the fifth of the eight Dyer children. His father was a {{secretary}} of the Royal Hospital for Seaman, and later became Chief clerk of the Admiralty in 1820. John was also an acquaintance of Robert Morrison, who was soon {{to become the first}} Protestant missionary to China, a connection that would have enormous implications in the life of his son, Samuel. Morrison and his Chinese tutor Yong Sam-tek visited the Dyer home in Greenwich during Morrison's <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> in medicine and astronomy between 1805 and 1806.|$|E
25|$|Brought {{up within}} {{a family of}} skilled {{artisans}} (his father was a draughtsman) Painlevé showed early promise across the range of elementary studies and was initially attracted by either an engineering or political career. However, he finally entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1883 to study mathematics, receiving his doctorate in 1887 following a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> at Göttingen, Germany with Felix Klein and Hermann Amandus Schwarz.

25|$|All {{three of}} the {{educational}} institutions attended by Mackworth were noted as centres of Calvinist learning. He studied at Shrewsbury School from January 1614. The school had been founded in the reign of Elizabeth I, providing a distinctly Protestant and humanist education, and numbering among its alumni Philip Sidney, as well as sons of the Protestant gentry, like Robert Corbet (died 1583). Mackworth matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge at Easter 1619 as a Fellow Commoner, a privileged position requiring considerable wealth. At the time the college was popular among some Shropshire gentry circles {{because of the presence}} of the puritan preacher John Preston, who was active throughout Mackworth's <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> leaving to become Master of Emmanuel College in 1622.|$|E
25|$|After a {{classical}} education, Giovanni studied {{law at the}} University of Palermo following a brief <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> at Livorno's naval academy. Falcone and Borsellino met again at Palermo University. While Falcone drifted away from his parents' middle-class conservative Catholicism towards Communism, Borsellino was religious and conservative; in his youth {{he had been a}} member of the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale (FUAN), a right-wing university organisation affiliated with the neo-fascist Movimento Sociale Italiano. However, neither ever joined a political party, and although the ideologies of their political movements were diametrically opposed, they shared a history of opposing the Mafia. Their different political leanings did not thwart their friendship. Falcone wanted a naval career but his father thought him too independent-minded for the armed forces, and sent him to study law.|$|E
25|$|From the start, the new {{library was}} {{intended}} to be the focus of a large-scale mixed-use development which involved {{the creation of a new}} pedestrianised piazza and the reinstatement as a through route of Jubilee Street, severed when the surrounding derelict land became a makeshift car park. (The street was laid out in the 1840s across Jubilee Field, so named when a wealthy resident's free party for the town's poor people to celebrate George III's Jubilee in 1809 brought in so many people that they spilled out of the Royal Pavilion stables and on to the adjacent field.) The name Jubilee Library was chosen to reflect this; a councillor's suggestion of Thabo Mbeki Library, in reference to the then incumbent South African President's <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> at the University of Sussex, was rejected.|$|E
