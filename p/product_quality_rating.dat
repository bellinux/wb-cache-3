40|$|Abstract A {{good or bad}} <b>product</b> <b>quality</b> <b>rating</b> {{can make}} or break an organization. However, the notion of “quality ” is often defined by an {{independent}} rating company that does not make the formula for determining the rank of a product publicly available. In order to invest wisely in product development, organizations are starting to use intelligent approaches for determining how funding for product development should be allocated. A critical step in this process is to “reverse-engineer ” a rating company’s proprietary model as closely as possible. In this work, we provide a machine learning approach for this task, which optimizes a certain rank statistic that encodes preference information specific to quality rating data. We present experiments on data from a major quality rating company, and provide new methods for evaluating the solution. In addition, we provide an approach to use the reverse-engineered model to achieve a top ranked product in a cost-effective way. ...|$|E

In 1990, the quality competent {{department and the}} National Statistical Bureau of China jointly formulated the National Industrial <b>Product</b> <b>Quality</b> Index System Overall Plan, a quality index system based on the statistics and analysis of industrial <b>product</b> <b>quality</b> information. Therein, the <b>product</b> <b>quality</b> grade <b>rate</b> reflects the <b>product</b> <b>quality</b> level, the <b>quality</b> loss <b>rate</b> reflects the <b>quality</b> economic index, and the new product output rate and the industrial product sales-output ratio reflect the quality applicability. In 1998, China's Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management was entrusted by the State Bureau of Quality Technical Supervision {{to carry out the}} research on ‘National Consumer Satisfaction Degree Evaluation Methods’. Its recent Manual of Chinese Consumer Satisfaction Degree in 2012, report includes the scores of consumer satisfaction degree for multiple commodity typesb. Furthermore, some local quality inspection departments have investigated the evaluation of macro quality, for example in 2002 Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision organized the ‘Shanghai Consumer Satisfaction Degree and Evaluation Method Research’ (Zhang et al.

This ability had resulted in commercial legume inoculant production facilities worldwide (Brockwell and Bottomley, 1995). Unfortunately, the widespread availability of legume and other related inoculants had not resulted efficiently equal at level of development of quality control standards protocols. Many countries, including Australia, the Netherlands, Rwanda, Thailand and Russia (Smith, 1992; Marufu et al., 1995) have legislated requirements for minimum populations of target organisms and contaminants per weight unit of inoculants. Canada and France have legislated on <b>product</b> <b>quality</b> by defining the number of viable Rhizobium/Bradyrhizobium required (provided) per seed, or a rate of application, for {{a full range of}} crops. The United States and United Kingdom leave the issue on <b>product</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>rates</b> of application at the manufacturer's discretion (Smith, 1992). In Argentina, Brazil and other South American countries actual regulations are insufficient to put pressure on local companies to improve the <b>quality</b> of their <b>products.</b> The lack of internationally accepted regulations for legume inoculant quality and usage parameters has led, on many occasions to inadequate inoculant performance and to the subsequent abandonment of their use. To reverse this trend, a complementary method for soybean inoculant quality control was herein proposed. We improved a selective media for the enumeration of B. japonicum from inoculated soybean seeds, established the most representative mathematical function for B. japonicum mortality on soybean seeds after inoculation and generated Recovery and Survival Factor Percentages as novel tools for inoculant quality control.|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} view {{of quality}} {{is that it}} is costly [...] higher quality requires higher units costs. A recent, renewed interest in quality has led to another point of view, namely, that producing high <b>quality</b> <b>products</b> reduces unit costs. This point of view directly challenges the traditional assumed relationship between quality and cost. If valid, the "quality is free " hypothesis has significant implications for quality management. Specifically, if producing high quality output aids in cost reduction, then firms that ignore such an effect will suboptimize on their quality levels. The work in this paper links the previously disjoint literatures of quality control and learning curves in an attempt to explain why high quality and low costs need not be inconsistent. Toward this end, we introduce the idea of a quality-based learning curve. When costs are affected by a quality-based learning curve, <b>product</b> <b>quality</b> influences the <b>rate</b> of cost reduction due to experience or learning.

Several performance measures {{commonly used in}} PBL contracts are described, and a model is presented {{that is based on}} an availability metric. This metric is calculated using the number of times a required part is not available at field maintenance sites. The metric is computed at the Functional Item Replacement (FIR) or modular level of replacements. The contractor is made responsible for maintaining an inventory of parts on the shelf at the maintenance locations. This {{is referred to as the}} Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL), which is not to exceed a negotiated maximum. Terms of the contract are not specified with regard to lead times such as logistical delays and manufacturing and restocking lags. These times are assumed to be under the contractor control as are production quantities, quality, and responsiveness. A newsvendor approach for determining optimal shelf inventory levels is first developed. An augmented model is evaluated using a simulation to determine the performance sensitivity to changes in <b>product</b> <b>quality,</b> demand <b>rates,</b> and various supply chain related lead times. Practical collateral issues such as obsolescence, reliability, and cost are also discussed.

In the lower zone of this shaft reactor, liquid iron and slag descend countercurrent to reducing gases through a packed bed of coke. The fundamental characteristics of these liquid flows are not fully understood, but influence the <b>product</b> <b>quality,</b> production <b>rate,</b> fuel use and asset life of the process, and hence the greenhouse gas emissions and competitiveness of the integrated steel industry. The present study aimed to establish the criteria for the passage of slag through the narrow pore necks that form between coke particles. To simulate the flow of slag through the pore necks, a new experimental technique was developed. This involved melting a slag pellet in a coke funnel with a channel of known diameter cut out of synthetic coke. Synthetic coke was used to minimise experimental uncertainty {{associated with the use}} of variable industrial coke and allow control of the coke mineralogy. Coke and slag were heated to 1500 °C under argon and held at temperature for 30 minutes. After cooling, the penetration of slag into, or passage of slag through the channel was determined and the interactions of the slag with coke were characterized. Variables assessed included slag composition in the CaO-SiO 2 - MgO-Al 2 O 3 system, coke mineralogy and channel diameter. For the slags and cokes studied, the minimum channel diameter that allowed slag to flow was between 4. 4 and 5. 0 mm.

40|$|Plant {{efficiency}} and profitability {{are becoming increasingly}} important and operating at the most optimal point is a necessity. The definition of proper operational bounds on output variables such as <b>product</b> <b>quality,</b> production <b>rates</b> etc., is critical for plant optimisation. The use of operational bounds that do not lie within {{the region of the}} output operational space of the plant can result in the control system attempting to operate the plant in a non attainable region. The use of operational bounds that lie within the bounds of the output operational space of the plant and if the output operational space is non convex can also result in the control system attempting to operate the plant in a non attainable region. This results in non feasible optimisation. A numerical intersection algorithm has been developed that identifies the feasible region of operation known as the desired operational space. This is accomplished by finding the intersection of the required operational space and the achievable output operational space. The algorithm was simulated and evaluated on a case study under various scenarios. These scenarios included specifying operational bounds that lie partially within the bounds of the achievable operational space and also specifying operational bounds that lie within the bounds of the operational space which was non convex. The results yielded a desired operational space with bounds that were guaranteed to lie within an attainable region on the output operational space. The desired operational space bounds were also simplified into a rectangle with high and low limits that can be readily used in control systems.

Heightened consumer interest in functional food products and advances in human nutrition have led to increased levels of interest in the development of new oat based products (Webster and Wood 2011).

Low moisture extrusion processing {{is one of the most}} widely used methods to produce ready to eat breakfast cereals; however, there has been little research carried out to determine if high moisture extrusion methods would be viable. This study evaluated the economic and technical feasibility to utilize high moisture extrusion processing to produce ready to eat oatmeal. A process economics evaluation included measuring the capital requirements to implement the system, process costing to estimate the weighted average unit cost, and net present value of high moisture extrusion production. The capital expense was significantly high. However, the unit cost is comparable to similar products in the market.
