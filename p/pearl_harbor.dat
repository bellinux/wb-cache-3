5|$|USS Mahan was {{commissioned}} {{on the east}} coast in September 1936 and served in the Atlantic area until July 1937. She sailed to the Southern California coast for fleet training before moving on to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b> At sea when the Japanese attacked <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 7 December 1941, Mahan participated in the initial post-attack efforts in search of the strike force. The ship joined Task Force 17 in February 1942, which conducted raids on several atolls in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. Late in March, she returned to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> and proceeded to the west coast for overhaul. By August 1942, Mahan was back operating out of <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Akagi {{served as}} Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's {{flagship}} {{in the attack}} on <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 7 December 1941. Nagumo's Kido Butai—composed of the carriers Akagi, Kaga, , , , and , supported by escorts—launched two waves of airstrikes on the American base at <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> in a devastating surprise attack.

5|$|Rising {{tension between}} Japan and the United States {{stretched}} back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in the Mukden Incident. Japan's continued aggression, instigating the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and invading French Indochina in 1940to which the United States and European powers responded with embargoes on iron and oil importsfurther heightened the tension. The Japanese thereafter decided {{to attack the}} Western powers in Asia, beginning with a surprise attack on the American naval base at <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b> When the Japanese struck <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 7 December 1941, Mahan was at sea with the aircraft carrier , three cruisers and four destroyers as part of Task Force 12. Lexingtons mission was to ferry Marine aircraft to reinforce Midway Island. After news {{of the attack on}} <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor,</b> the task-force commander received orders to terminate the ferry mission and to search for the Japanese strike force. Unable to locate them, the task force returned to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 12 December.|$|E
5|$|Taylor later {{commanded}} several squadrons while {{stationed in}} the United States and elsewhere, and served for 27 years of active duty. He joined the Alaska Air National Guard until 1971 {{and worked in the}} insurance industry before retiring in 1985. His <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> experience was portrayed in the 1970 film Tora!

5|$|There were no Puerto Rican military-related {{fatalities}} in the Japanese {{attack of}} <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b> However, {{there was one}} civilian Puerto Rican fatality. Daniel LaVerne was a Puerto Rican amateur boxer who was working at Pearl Harbor's Red Hill underground fuel tank construction project when the Japanese attacked <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b> He {{died as a result}} of the injuries which he received during the attack. His name is listed among the 2,338 Americans killed or mortally wounded on December 7, 1941, in the Remembrance Exhibit in the back lawn of the USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center at <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Arkansas {{participated in}} Operation Magic Carpet, the {{repatriation}} of American servicemen from the Pacific. She took around 800 men back to the United States, departing on 23 September, and reaching Seattle, Washington on 15 October. She made another three Magic Carpet trips between <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> and the continental United States to ferry more soldiers home. During the first months of 1946, Arkansas lay at San Francisco. In late April, the ship got underway for Hawaii. She reached <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 8 May, and departed <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 20 May, bound for Bikini Atoll, earmarked for use as target for atomic bomb testing in Operation Crossroads. On 1 July, Arkansas was exposed to an air burst in ABLE, but survived with extensive shock damage to her upperworks, while her hull and armored turrets were lightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|After their modernization, both ships {{participated in}} the normal {{activities}} of the fleet, including fleet problem exercises, and then joined the entire Pacific Fleet in their new base in <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor,</b> Hawaii, after {{the beginning of the}} Second World War in Europe. Two years later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese attack on <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> sank Arizona in a tremendous explosion and slightly damaged Pennsylvania, which was in dry dock at the time. Arizonas wreck was later partly salvaged and is now a war memorial.|$|E

5|$|This, {{and other}} {{successful}} hit-and-run raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed {{that they were}} still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to be drawn into an all-out battle. Yamamoto reasoned that another air attack on the main U.S. Naval base at <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, considering the increased strength of American land-based air power on the Hawaiian Islands since the December 7 attack the previous year, he judged that it was now too risky to attack <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> directly.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{began her}} service in 1936. Following shakedown, the new {{destroyer}} {{was assigned to}} the United States Battle Fleet in San Diego, California, operating along the West Coast and in the Hawaiian Islands. She participated in naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea, and was then reassigned to duty between the West Coast and Hawaii. After a goodwill tour to New Zealand, the ship returned to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b> When the Japanese attacked <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 7December 1941, Tucker was berthed at the East Loch in <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> undergoing overhaul but sustained no damage. Afterward, Tucker escorted convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. She then did escort work to American Samoa, the Fiji Islands, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|A Charlie Chan comic strip, {{drawn by}} Alfred Andriola, was {{distributed}} by the McNaught Syndicate beginning 24 October 1938. Andriola was chosen by Biggers to draw the character. Following the Japanese attack on <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor,</b> the strip was dropped in May 1942.|$|E
5|$|After the Aleutian Islands Campaign, a refit was {{undertaken}} at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. On 25 October, New Mexico returned to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> to {{practice for the}} invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On 20 November, while the invasion was under way, she shelled Makin Atoll. During the fighting on the islands the ship was tasked with guarding transports at night when they retreated from the islands, providing anti-aircraft fire for the unloading of supplies and troops, and providing screening fire for the aircraft carriers. After U.S. troops captured the Gilbert Islands on 5 December, New Mexico returned to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough {{for two or three}} weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, straddles the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{traveled}} to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> for extensive repairs, which were completed on 15 October 1942. She {{returned to the}} South Pacific on 24 October, {{just in time for}} the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and her rematch with Shōkaku and Zuikaku.|$|E
5|$|From 1941 {{through the}} end of World War II, Chew {{operated}} out of <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on patrol. She took on periodic escort duties among the Hawaiian Islands and on training duty for submarines. She made occasional trips to San Francisco and Seattle escorting convoys and screening for other Navy ships, inter-island escort, and submarine training duty.

5|$|In 1940, Maryland and {{the other}} battleships of the battle force changed their bases of {{operations}} to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b> She was present at Battleship Row along Ford Island during the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Maryland {{changed her}} base of {{operations}} to <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b> She was present at Battleship Row along Ford Island during the Japanese attack on <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor</b> on 7 December 1941. Damaged during the attack, Maryland reported to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, where she was repaired and modernized. Maryland supported the amphibious landings during the Battle of Tarawa, and thereafter participated in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Battle of Peleliu, the Philippines Campaign, and the Battle of Okinawa. Following the end of World War II Maryland participated in Operation Magic Carpet before decommissioning in 1947. She was sold for scrap in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid {{was ordered}} to relieve Rear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher as {{commander}} of Cruiser Division 6, consisting of the heavy cruisers , Minneapolis and San Francisco. This {{was part of the}} U.S. Pacific Fleet, based at <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor.</b> He did not reach his new command until after the Japanese attack on <b>Pearl</b> <b>Harbor,</b> which brought the U.S. into the war. When he reached Hawaii, Kinkaid stayed with his brother-in-law, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who was married to Kinkaid's sister Dorothy. Kinkaid accompanied Fletcher as an observer during the attempt to relieve Wake Island, and did not formally assume command of the division until 29 December 1941.|$|E
