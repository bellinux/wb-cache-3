50|$|Mendel {{discovered}} that, when {{he crossed}} purebred white flower and purple flower pea plants (the parental or <b>P</b> <b>generation),</b> {{the result was}} not a blend. Rather than being a mix of the two, the offspring (known as the F1 generation) was purple-flowered. When Mendel self-fertilized the F1 generation pea plants, he obtained a purple flower to white flower ratio in the F2 generation of 3 to 1. The results of this cross are tabulated in the Punnett square to the right.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the {{monohybrid}} cross {{is used to}} determine the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (<b>P)</b> <b>generation.</b> One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second filial (F2) generation. Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the F2 generation will have the dominant allele's phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele's phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance.|$|E

40|$|About 15 {{years ago}} it was {{proposed}} that generation of the truncated protein p 25 contributes to toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). p 25 is a calcium-dependent degradation product of p 35, the principal activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk 5). The biochemical properties of p 25 suggested that its generation would cause Cdk 5 overactivation and tau hyperphosphorylation, a prerequisite for neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation. Whilst this model was appealing as it explained NFT formation, many laboratories could not confirm the finding of increased <b>p</b> 25 <b>generation</b> in brain from AD patients. On the contrary, it emerged that p 25 levels are reduced in AD. This reduction occurs primarily {{in the early stages of}} the disease. Further, <b>p</b> 25 <b>generation</b> in the mouse hippocampus is associated with normal memory formation and p 25 overexpression enhances synaptogenesis. Therefore, it transpires that <b>p</b> 25 <b>generation</b> is a molecular memory mechanism that is impaired in early AD. I discuss the prospect that investigation of p 25 -regulated proteins will shed light into mechanisms underlying synaptic degeneration associated with memory decline in AD...|$|R
50|$|To {{explain his}} results, Mendel {{formulated}} a hypothesis {{that included the}} following: In the organism there {{is a pair of}} factors that controls the appearance of a given characteristic. (They are called genes.) The organism inherits these factors from its parents, one from each. A factor is transmitted from generation to generation as a discrete, unchanging unit. (The r factor in the F2 generation passed through the round-seeded F1 generation. In spite of this, the rr seeds in the F2 generation were no less wrinkled than those in the <b>P</b> <b>generation.)</b> When the gametes are formed, the factors separate and are distributed as units to each gamete. This statement is often called Mendel's rule of segregation. If an organism has two unlike factors (called alleles) for a characteristic, one may be expressed to the total exclusion of the other (dominant vs recessive).|$|E
40|$|A multigeneration {{study with}} four {{successive}} generations of Syrian hamsters {{was conducted to}} determine whether a single s. c. injection of different doses of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (1. 25, 2. 5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg body weight) on day 15 of pregnancy induces respiratory tract tumors not only in the treated <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> mothers and their F 1 progeny but also F 2 and F 3 generations. In this study, the <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> mothers only were given a single injection of DEN during the period of gestation. Fifty-six % of the 36 DEN-treated mothers and 52 % of their F 1 generation offspring (total, 233 animals) developed neoplasms in the respiratory tract. A single respiratory tract tumor was found in one DEN-unexposed F 1 generation control hamster as well as in one F 2 generation animal (total, 209 animals) descended from DEN-exposed <b>P</b> <b>generation.</b> Both tumors were considered to have arisen spontaneously. No respiratory tract tumors were observed in the F 3 generation (total, 160 animals) descended from DEN-exp osed <b>P</b> <b>generation.</b> Thus our results indicate that the vertical transmission of the tumorigenic effect of DEN in Syrian hamsters is limited to one generation and does not persist in the F 2 and F 3 generations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the multigenerational effects of para-nonylphenol (NP) and {{resveratrol}} (RES) on the body weight, organ weight and reproductive fitness of outbred CD- 1 mice. The data indicate that in male mice, NP had an effect on the weight of selected reproductive organs and the kidneys in the parental (<b>P)</b> <b>generation</b> males. Effects on selected reproductive organs, the liver and kidneys in the F 1 -generation males were also seen. In females, effects of NP on body weight and kidney weight were seen in the <b>P</b> <b>generation,</b> but no effects on any measured parameter were seen in the F 1 generation. RES had no effect on body weight but did have some effect on selected male and female reproductive organs in the <b>P</b> <b>generation.</b> RES altered the spleen and liver weights of P-generation males and the kidney weight of F 1 -generation males. Acrosomal integrity (using a monoclonal antibody against intra-acrosomal sperm proteins) was assessed for both generations of NP- and RES-treated mice. A significant reduction in acrosomal integrity was seen in both generations of NP-treated, but not in RES-treated, mice. Fewer offspring were observed in the second litter of the F 2 generation of mice treated with NP; no similar effect was seen in RES-treated mice. The litter sex ratio was not different from controls. Unlike RES, NP had a negative effect on spermatogenesis and sperm quality with a resultant impact on in vivo fertility. </p...|$|E

40|$|Two {{mammalian}} sphingosine kinase (SphK) isoforms, SphK 1 and SphK 2, possess identical kinase domains {{but have}} distinct kinetic properties and subcellular localizations, suggesting each has {{one or more}} specific roles in sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 <b>P)</b> <b>generation.</b> Although both kinases use sphingosine as a substrate to generate S 1 P, the mechanisms controlling SphK activation and subsequent S 1 <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> during lung injury are not fully understood. In this study, we established a murine lung injury model to investigate LPS-induced lung injury in SphK 1 knockout (SphK 1 −/−) and wild-type (WT) mice. We found that SphK 1 −/− mice were much more susceptible to LPS-induced lung injury compared with their WT counterparts, quantified by multiple parameters including cytokine induction. Intriguingly, overexpression of WT SphK 1 delivered by adenoviral vector to the lungs protected SphK 1 −/− mice from lung injury and attenuated {{the severity of the}} response to LPS. However, adenoviral overexpression of a SphK 1 kinase-dead mutant (SphKKD) in SphK 1 −/− mouse lungs further exacerbated the response to LPS as well as the extent of lung injury. WT SphK 2 adenoviral overexpression also failed to provide protection and, in fact, augmented the degree of LPS-induced lung injury. This suggested that, in vascular injury, S 1 P generated by SphK 2 activation plays a distinctly separate role compared with SphK 1 -dependent S 1 <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> and survival signaling. Microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis of SphK 1 and SphK 2 expression levels during lung injury revealed that, in WT mice, LPS treatment caused significantly enhanced SphK 1 expression (∼ 5 ×) levels within 6 h, which declined back to baseline levels by 24 h posttreatment. In contrast, expression of SphK 2 was gradually induced following LPS treatment and was elevated within 24 h. Collectively, our results for the first time demonstrate distinct functional roles of the two SphK isoforms in the regulation of LPS-induced lung injury...|$|E

40|$|Sepsis mouse models {{revealed}} thymus atrophy, characterised by decreased thymus {{weight and}} loss of thymocytes due to apoptosis. Mice suffered from lymphopenia, a lack of T cells in the periphery, which attenuates their ability to fight against recurring and secondary infections during sepsis progression. Key players in thymus atrophy are IL- 6, which is directly involved in thymus involution, and the sphingosine- 1 -phosphate − sphingosine- 1 -phosphate receptor 1 signaling, influencing thymocytes emigration. In healthy individuals a sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) gradient from lymphoid organs to the circulatory system serves as signal for mature T cell egress. In the present study we investigated, whether inhibition of S 1 <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> improves thymus involution. In sepsis, induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), S 1 P in the thymus increased, while it decreased in serum, thus disrupting the naturally occurring S 1 P gradient. As a potential source of S 1 P we identified increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the thymic cortex of septic mice. Pharmacological inhibition of the S 1 P generating sphingosine kinases, by 4 - [[4 -(4 -Chlorophenyl) - 2 -thiazolyl]amino]phenol (SK I–II), administered directly following CLP, prevented thymus atrophy. This was reflected by lymphocytosis, diminished apoptosis, decreased IL- 6 expression, and an unaltered thymus weight. In addition SK I-II-treatment preserved the S 1 P balance and prevented S 1 P-dependent internalization of the sphingosine- 1 -phosphate receptor 1. Our data suggest that inhibition of sphingosine kinase and thus, S 1 <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> during sepsis restores thymic T cell egress, which might improve septic outcome...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that a}} high-protein, carbohydrate-free diet can decrease the production of glycerol- 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) from glucose and increase glyceroneogenesis in both brown (BAT) and epididymal (EAT) adipose tissue. Here, we utilized an in-vivo approach to examine the hypothesis that there is reciprocal regulation in the G 3 P synthesis from glucose (via glycolysis) and glyceroneogenesis in BAT, EAT and liver of fasted rats and cafeteria diet-fed rats. Glyceroneogenesis played {{a prominent role in}} the generation of G 3 P in the liver (similar to 70 %) as well as in BAT and EAT (similar to 80 %) in controls rats. The cafeteria diet induced an increase in the total glyceride-glycerol synthesis and G 3 P synthesis from glucose and a decrease in glyceroneogenesis in BAT; this diet did not affect either the total glyceride-glycerol synthesis or G 3 <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> from glyceroneogenesis or glycolysis in the liver or EAT. Fasting induced an increase in total glyceride-glycerol synthesis and glyceroneogenesis and a decrease in G 3 P synthesis from glucose in the liver but did not affect either the total glyceride-glycerol synthesis or G 3 P synthesis from glyceroneogenesis in BAT and EAT, despite a reduction in glycolysis in these tissues. These data demonstrate that reciprocal changes in the G 3 <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> from glucose and from glyceroneogenesis in the rat liver and BAT occur only when the synthesis of glycerides-glycerol is increased. Further, our data suggest that this increase may be essential for the systemic recycling of fatty acids by the liver from fasted rats and for the maintenance of the thermogenic capacity of BAT from cafeteria diet-fed rats.

40|$|Monocytes play an {{important}} role in inflammation, angiogenesis, and atherosclerosis. During these processes monocytes release pre-formed proinflammatory mediators from granules, and synthesize de novo cytokines and chemokines important in the amplification of the inflammatory response. One of the most prominent triggers of inflammatory responses is the cytokine TNFα. However, the intracellular signaling cascades triggered by TNFα are not fully understood. In this study we investigated the roles of SPHK on the TNFα-triggered responses on human primary monocytes. We show that TNFα rapidly triggers S 1 <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> and activation of SPHK. Moreover, our data shows that SPHK 1 is the isoform activated by TNFα, and plays an essential role on the TNFα-triggered intracellular Ca 2 + signals, degranulation, cytokine production, and activation of NFκB, thus suggesting a pivotal role for SPHK 1 on the proinflammatory responses triggered by TNFα...|$|E

The MR is highly expressed on human macrophages, regulating endocytosis, phagocytosis, and immune responses and mediating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) phagocytosis by human macrophages, thereby limiting phagosome-lysosome (P-L) fusion. We identified human MR-associated proteins using phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated MR cytoplasmic tail peptides. We found that MR binds FcRγ-chain, which is required for MR plasma membrane localization and M. tb cell association. Additionally, we discovered that MR-mediated M. tb association triggers immediate MR tyrosine residue phosphorylation and Grb 2 recruitment, activating the Rac/Pak/Cdc- 42 signaling cascade important for M. tb uptake. MR activation subsequently recruits SHP- 1 to the M. tb-containing phagosome, where its activity limits PI(3) <b>P</b> <b>generation</b> at the phagosome and M. tb P-L fusion and promotes M. tb growth.

In this study, we have, therefore, investigated the effects of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + on Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding to membranes of the myeloid cell line HL- 60 and assayed in parallel phospholipase C activity and Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 degradation. The assays for Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding, Ins(1, 4, 5) <b>P</b> 3 <b>generation,</b> and Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 degradation were performed under identical experimental conditions. Ca 2 + significantly and reversibly decreased Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding at submicromolar concentrations. Ca 2 + stimulated Ins(1, 4, 5) <b>P</b> 3 <b>generation</b> only at concentrations above 1 microM. At 1 microM [Ca 2 +], Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding was inhibited by 46 +/- 6 %, but no Ins(1, 4, 5) <b>P</b> 3 <b>generation</b> was observed. [Mg 2 +] between 0 and 1 mM slightly stimulated, while higher concentrations inhibited, Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding. Mg 2 + did not activate phospholipase C. Neither Ca 2 + nor Mg 2 + induced relevant Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 degradation under {{the conditions of the}} binding assay. The effects of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + on Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding were conserved after solubilization of HL- 60 membranes. However, only Mg 2 +, but not Ca 2 +, inhibited Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding to the receptor that had been partially purified by heparin affinity chromatography. The Ca 2 + sensitivity of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding to the partially purified receptor could be reconstituted by addition of the flow-through of the heparin column. No Ca(2 +) -dependent Ins(1, 4, 5) <b>P</b> 3 <b>generation</b> was observed in the reconstituted system. Thus, we conclude that both Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + can inhibit Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding independently of phospholipase C activation and Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 breakdown. The Ca 2 + effect depends upon factors that can be separated biochemically from the Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 receptor. Mg 2 + acts either directly on the Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 receptor or on a closely associated target...|$|R

We report here that TNFα induces endothelial cell activation, {{as measured by}} the expression of adhesion protein E-selectin and vascular adhesion molecule- 1, through the sphingosine kinase (SKase) signaling pathway. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with TNFα resulted in a rapid SKase activation and sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 <b>P)</b> <b>generation.</b> S 1 P, but not ceramide or sphingosine, was a potent dose-dependent stimulator of adhesion protein expression. S 1 P was able to mimic the effect of TNFα on endothelial cells leading to extracellular signal-regulated kinases and NF-κB activation, whereas ceramide or sphingosine was not. Furthermore, N,N-dimethylsphingosine, an inhibitor of SKase, profoundly inhibited TNFα-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinases and NF-κB activation and adhesion protein expression. Thus we demonstrate that the SKase pathway through the generation of S 1 P is critically involved in mediating TNFα-induced endothelial cell activation.
