5|$|When Guggenheim {{closed her}} gallery in 1947 {{to move to}} Venice, artists like <b>Pollock</b> had to find new representation. The Betty Parsons Gallery, which opened the {{previous}} year, began representing <b>Pollock,</b> Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. Parsons was already representing Adolph Gottlieb, Hedda Sterne and Theodoros Stamos. It was while <b>Pollock</b> showed at Parsons' gallery that he started making his iconic drip-paintings in 1947. It was also here that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950. Rothko, who had arrived at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947, first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery.|$|E

5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for <b>Pollock,</b> Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves. She declined the offer. Over the following three years <b>Pollock,</b> Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who {{were prepared to}} show the so-called New York School (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a <b>Pollock,</b> before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain. The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson <b>Pollock</b> in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.|$|E

5|$|Linderman {{assumed the}} {{position}} of Director of the Mint and <b>Pollock</b> became Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint. In July 1873, production began on the dies needed to strike the coins.

The first trade dollars were struck during a ceremony held on July 11, 1873. Forty thousand pieces were issued in the first release, on July 14. The Carson City Mint received its first dies for the new coins on July 22, and those intended for the San Francisco Mint arrived shortly after. In total, 396,635 business strikes and 865 proof coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint {{during the first year}} of production. The Carson City and San Francisco mints struck 124,500 and 703,000 coins respectively.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} a formal semantics for <b>Pollock’s</b> [23] theory of defeasible rea-soning. As {{a notion of}} argument or argumentation has never been formalised in this theory, {{it is important that}} such a formal account be introduced to couple with the algorithmic descrip-tion of the theory. In particular, it makes <b>Pollock’s</b> theory become more comparable to other related frameworks as shown in the paper. In also enforces a well-defined semantical account for <b>Pollock’s</b> theory of defeasible reasoning based on the argumentation-theoretic approach proposed by Dung and Bondarenko et al. [1, 5]. Our formalisation thus enables further studies to the meta-theoretic properties of <b>Pollock’s</b> defeasible reasoning system...|$|R
