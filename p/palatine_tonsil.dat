2500|$|Cancers of the {{oropharynx}} primarily {{arise in}} lingual and <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsil</b> lymphoid tissue that is lined by respiratory squamous [...] mucosal epithelium, {{which may be}} invaginated within the lymphoid tissue. Therefore, the tumour first arises in hidden crypts. OPC is graded {{on the basis of}} the degree of squamous and keratin differentiation into well, moderate or poorly (high) differentiated grades. Other pathological features include the presence of finger-like invasion, perineural invasion, depth of invasion and distance of the tumour from resection margins. Phenotypic variants include basaloid squamous carcinoma, a high grade form (see Chung Fig. 35-3(C) and illustration here). They are most commonly non-keratinising. HPV+OPC also differs from HPV-OPC in being focal rather than multifocal and not being associated with pre-malignant dysplasia. HPV+OPC patients are therefore at less risk of developing other malignancies in the head and neck region, unlike other head and neck primary tumours that may have associated second neoplasms, that may occur at the same time (synchronous) or a distant time (metachronous), both within the head and neck region or more distantly. This suggests that the oncogenic alterations produced by the virus are spatially limited rather than related to a field defect.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oropharynx}} {{lies between}} the mouth (oral cavity) to the front, and the laryngopharynx below, which [...] separates {{it from the}} larynx. The upper limit of the oropharynx is marked by the soft palate, and its lower limit by the epiglottis and root of the tongue. The oropharynx communicates with the mouth, in front through {{what is known as}} the oropharyngeal isthmus, or isthmus of the fauces. The isthmus (i.e. connection) is formed above by the soft palate, below by the posterior third of the tongue, and at the sides by the palatoglossal arches. The posterior third of the tongue, or tongue base contains numerous follicles of lymphatic tissue that form the lingual tonsils. Adjacent to the tongue base, the lingual surface of the epiglottis, which curves forward, is attached to the tongue by median and lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The folds form small troughs known as the epiglottic valleculae. The lateral walls are marked by two vertical pillars on each side, the pillars of the fauces, or palatoglossal arches. More properly they are separately named the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. The anterior arch is named from the palatoglossal muscle within, running from the soft palate to the tongue [...] (glossus), while the posterior arch similarly contains the palatopharyngeal muscle running from the soft palate to the lateral pharynx. Between the arches lies a triangular space, the tonsillar fossa in which lies the <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsil,</b> another lymphoid organ.|$|E

The frequent exacerbations lead {{to the rise of}} glycemia profile, worsening of patient life quality and effectiveness of the complex therapy of the main disease. Aim of research : to assess the functional state of <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils</b> in children and teenagers with DM- 1 and chronic tonsillitis. Materials and methods. During the period 2014 - 2015 years there was carried out clinical and laboratory examination of 51 children with DM- 1 6 - 18 years old. All children were treated in endocrinological department of National child specialized hospital “Ohmatdit”. The main group of observance included 40 children with DM- 1 and CT, the control one included 11 children and teenagers with DM- 1 without ENT-pathology. All children of the main and control groups underwent cytological examination of the tonsillar crypt lacunas content. Results and discussion. The highest specific weight of the chronic diseases of lymphepithelial throat structures (CDLTS) in the main group of observation was revealed at the presence of chronic tonsillitis. In children with DM- 1 was diagnosed CT – 17 (33, 3 %), CT and nasal septum curvature– 16 (31, 3 %), CT and adenoid – 9 (17, 7 %), CT and <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils</b> hypertrophy – 5 (9, 8 %), CT and recidivous nasal bleedings – 4 (7, 8 %). According to the results of this examination in children with CDLTS and DM- 1 were separated the four cytological groups that characterize the functional state of <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils.</b> I. Good functional power of <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils.</b> II. High activity of lymphoid tissue of <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils.</b> III.

The crypts greatly increase the contact surface between environmental influences and lymphoid tissue.

This nerve {{is most likely to}} be damaged during a tonsillectomy, which leads to reduced or lost general sensation and taste sensation to the posterior third of the tongue.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A few {{patients}} with asymmetric <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils</b> have lymphoma; but most lymphomas in <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils</b> evolve with tonsillar asymmetry. Objective: To report {{the profile of}} patients and histopathological changes in patients submitted to adenotonsillectomy/tonsillectomy with disproportional <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils.</b> Method: Retrospective study based on data analysis from the Pathologic Anatomy Service Database and in the review of reports of patients submitted to adenotonsillectomy and tonsillectomy with <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils</b> asymmetry {{during the period from}} October 1999 through October 2009 at the Clinical Hospital (HC) of the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). Results: 50 patients took part, aged between 3 to 53 years old, mean age of 14. 05 years. The anatomopathological exam confirmed 48 patients (96 %) with lymphoid hyperplasia and 2 cases of lymphoma (4 %). These included men aged from 40 to 53 yeas with complaint of unilateral increase of the tonsil, one of whom had other symptoms (asthenia and weight loss). Upon physical examination: tonsils disproportion without involvement of other organs or lymph nodes. Conclusion: Our study is according to the literature as regards the fact the lymphomas are more common in men, the patient is the first one to notice the increase in volume and the asymmetry is larger than 2 degrees between <b>palatine</b> <b>tonsils</b> in cases of lymphoma. Although it is rare, even in the presence of differences, there are chances for the asymmetry to evolve to a malignant profile. The need for anatomopathological evaluation of a part must be considered along with other clinical data that suggests a malignant profile...|$|R
