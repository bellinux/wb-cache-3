50|$|There are a {{total of}} 133 {{different}} hockey plays in the film. To accomplish this, the directors turned to ReelSports Solutions, who had helped with the producers on a previous movie, The Rookie. The ReelSports team referred to coach Herb Brooks for information on practices, <b>plays,</b> <b>equipment,</b> and uniform styles. Each fight and stunt scene was choreographed to ensure the actors' safety. Players went through a six-week training camp to relearn the game in older equipment.|$|R
500|$|Because {{of their}} {{intelligence}} and trainability, California sea lions {{have been used}} by circuses and marine mammal parks to perform various tricks such as throwing and catching balls on their noses, running up ladders, or honking horns in a musical fashion. Trainers reward their animals with fish, which motivates them to perform. For ball balancing, trainers toss a ball at a sea lion so it may accidentally balance it or hold the ball on its nose, thereby gaining an understanding of what to do. A sea lion may go through a year of training before performing a behavior for the public. However, its memory allows it to perform a behavior even after three months of resting. Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to using sea lions and other marine mammals for entertainment, claiming the tricks are [...] "exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors" [...] and distract the audience from the animal's unnatural environment. Less entertainment-oriented zoos may still encourage animal play by throwing fish at animals in different directions and providing <b>play</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} ?Technical level of playgrounds and the {{injuries}} rate at these places? is to assess the overall condition of facilities and equipment located there and to analyse their safety for children using selected methods. The {{first part of the}} thesis focuses on a description of selected terms and introduction of child injuries depending on technical conditions and a state of <b>playing</b> <b>equipment,</b> then on an introduction of requirements of technical standards for design of <b>playing</b> <b>equipment</b> and appropriate safety of an impact attenuating surface and on regulations on cleanliness and hygiene of playgrounds. In the second part, I have analysed the current state of playgrounds at selected locations depending on injuries. For the field work, I had prepared forms ? a questionnaire (annex no. 1) and a check-playground report for entering the findings (annex no. 2). This form is based on standards ČSN EN 1176 and ČSN EN 1177 concerning equipment and surfaces on the playground. From acquired information, I have evaluated the safety level of playgrounds and defects and deficiencies of the equipment. The form contains 20 criteria, 15 of them are concerned with safety and accident prevention on the <b>playing</b> <b>equipment.</b> Five questions focus on cleanliness, hygiene and public awareness. Fulfillment of all 20 points is essential for evaluation - the playground is safe. Failing in any of hygienic criteria, the playground is qualified as safe under reservation. Failing to satisfy one of the 15 criteria according to the ČSN standard, the playground cannot be qualified as safe. I have analysed ten playgrounds in locations of Trhové Sviny, Ledenice and Jílovice. After the survey and forms evaluation, I found that the condition of playgrounds is not up to standards and seven playgrounds do not match the criteria. The biggest problem I found regards a surface where the impact attenuating surface is not deep enough. Technical design of <b>playing</b> <b>equipment</b> is fine, especially with the new equipment. The older ones are under reservation. Other defects are particularly in area drainage, they were found with six playgrounds. The suggested solution to these shortcomings is to use special suitable materials (special rubber and elastic mats) and sufficient depth of sand or gravel. You also need to ensure a sufficient drainage. I would also recommend that keepers should ensure the investigation in order to select the proper game equipment according to the age groups at particular playgrounds. The proposed method of removing defects should be used for the local keepers as a methodology for prevention of child injuries and thus to the reduction in the cost of subsequent treatment...|$|R
