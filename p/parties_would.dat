5|$|Blount called Hout and Petersen to {{apologize}} on September 5. Kelly {{participated in the}} calls. Hout was not suspended for his taunting, though Petersen stated that he did receive disciplinary action. Petersen accepted the apology as sincere, and expressed the wish that Blount {{would be able to}} go on playing football, and that many <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> learn from the experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 Keynes had {{the option}} to enter Parliament as an {{independent}} MP with the University of Cambridge seat. A by-election for the seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly Tory, and the master of Magdalene College had obtained agreement {{that none of the}} major <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> field a candidate if Keynes chose to stand. Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010 {{elections}} to the Crimean parliament, the Party of Regions received the largest share of votes, whilst the second-placed Communist Party of Ukraine received {{a much smaller}} share. Both of these political <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> later be targets of the Euromaidan movement. Former president of Crimea Yuriy Olexandrovich Meshkov called for a referendum on restoring the 1992 Constitution of Crimea in July 2011. As a consequence of this, a local court in Crimea deported Meshkov from Ukraine for five years.|$|E

50|$|The 4th Alberta Legislative Assembly {{lasted from}} 1917 to 1921. The {{governing}} Liberal <b>party</b> <b>would</b> change Cabinets, and see its popular support decline.

5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of the American military commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> have liked to have publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bueno's mother {{claimed to}} be the {{absolute}} owner of his recorded material as well as profits. Judge Ricardo Sangiorg of the 76th Civil Court froze all of the assets held in bank accounts and copyrighted material hosted by SADAIC and the Argentine Musician's Union, as requested by the legal group CÃºneo Libarona-Ballester, the representatives of Patricia Pacheco and her son Ramiro. Pacheco claimed that Ramiro Pacheco was the legitimate son of Bueno and requested a DNA test to verify it. The lawyers sent legal notices to Olave, her lawyer Miguel Angel Pierri and Gozalo stating that none of the assets of Bueno's estate could be used or spent until it was decided which one of the <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> inherit them.|$|E
5|$|It was {{suggested}} that she would run for senator for the Buenos Aires Province at the 2017 midterm elections, but her former minister Florencio Randazzo wanted to run for those elections as well. Refusing to run in primary elections, Kirchner asked for a shared ticket as a condition to run for senator. Randazzo did not accept the proposal. The FPV was renamed as the Citizen's Unity Party at the province and registered as a coalition of minor parties only, leaving the PJ out of it. As a result, both <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> run to the elections as unrelated parties.|$|E
50|$|Later, the {{majority}} of the United Labour <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> merge with the Socialists to form the Social Democratic <b>Party.</b> This <b>party</b> <b>would</b> then merge with those elements of the United Labour Party which had remained independent, thereby forming the Labour Party which exists today.|$|R
50|$|Katter's Australian Party, which {{received}} 4.9 percent in 2012, did not re-contest Stafford at the by-election. Clive Palmer initially said the Palmer United <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> {{run in the}} by-election, but then said it was undecided whether the <b>party</b> <b>would</b> field a candidate. A candidate was not fielded.|$|R
25|$|In December 2008, Elizabeth May {{announced}} the Green <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> support the proposed coalition from outside parliament.

5|$|The Sala das Mangas (the only room in {{the state}} apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels (illustrated below). The gallery leads to the enfilade of state rooms, {{all of which have}} been fully restored. The formal rooms of the palace consist of three large halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room (where hunting <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> assemble), which is a frescoed salon painted with trees and foliage by Pillement.|$|E
5|$|When Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, Fuchs {{decided to}} leave Kiel, where the NSDAP was {{particularly}} strong {{and he was a}} well-known KPD member. He enrolled at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. On 28 February, he took an early train to Berlin for a KPD meeting there. On the train, he read about the Reichstag fire in a newspaper. Fuchs correctly assumed that opposition <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> be blamed for the fire, and quietly removed his hammer and sickle lapel pin.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E
5000|$|The {{allocation}} of seats were done what was later dubbed, [...] "The MGR formula". Where the regional <b>party</b> <b>would</b> contest 70% of the assembly seats and the national <b>party</b> <b>would</b> be given 70% of the Lok Sabha seats.This {{would be the last}} election MGR contested, due to his death during his chief ministership.|$|R
50|$|For example, in Voterville 54% of electors {{support the}} Blue Party while 46% support the Red Party. Assuming an even {{distribution}} of support across the town, the Blue <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> win all three seats with either bloc voting or first past the post. With limited voting the Red <b>Party</b> <b>would</b> usually win one seat.|$|R
50|$|Party President Ratu Tanoa Cakobau {{announced}} on 9 February 2006 that the <b>party</b> <b>would</b> contest Fijian communal and open constituencies {{in the upcoming}} election. In another development, however, it was {{announced on}} 16 February 2006 that the <b>party</b> <b>would</b> be deregistering, in order to merge with the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) ahead of the elections.|$|R
5|$|Lenin {{was back}} in Galicia when the First World War broke out, an {{international}} situation that he had paid little attention to. The war pitted the Russian Empire against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and due to his Russian citizenship, Lenin was deemed a spy by the Austro-Hungarian authorities. In August, they arrested him and imprisoned him in Nowy Targ, although they released him once his anti-tsarist credentials were explained. To escape {{the violence of the}} eastern front, Lenin and his wife moved to neutral Switzerland, settling in Bern, although in February 1916 they moved to Zurich, which was cheaper. Lenin was angry that the German Social-Democratic Party had supported the German war effort, thereby contravening the Stuttgart resolution of the Second International that all socialist <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> oppose the international conflict. As a result, Lenin saw the Second International as defunct. In particular, he denounced German Marxist Karl Kautsky for supporting the German Social-Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Ultime grida dalla savana {{initiated}} a rivalry between Climati and Morra {{and two other}} Italian Mondo film makers, Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni. These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the Mondo genre {{in the late seventies}} and early eighties. The Castiglionis had made two previous Mondo films, Africa segreta and Africa ama, before the release of Ultime grida dalla savana. They later released three additional films: Magia nuda in 1975, Addio ultimo uomo in 1978, Africa dolce e selvaggio in 1982. Climati and Morra made two follow-up films to Ultime grida dalla savana. The first followup, Savana violenta, also known as Savage Man Savage Beast no. 2, was released in 1976. Savana violenta was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence. The last film, Dolce e selvaggio, was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes and recycled footage from Climati and Morra's two previous films. Each subsequent release by the two <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> attempt to outperform the previous films with more explicit and shocking content.|$|E
5|$|When Stanley Baldwin {{retired in}} May 1937, Chamberlain {{took his place}} as Prime Minister. His premiership was {{dominated}} by the question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive Germany, and his actions at Munich were widely popular among Britons at the time. When Hitler continued his aggression, Chamberlain pledged Britain to defend Poland's independence if the latter were attacked, an alliance that brought Britain into war when Germany attacked Poland in 1939. Chamberlain resigned the premiership on 10 May 1940 after the Allies were forced to retreat from Norway, as he believed that a government supported by all parties was essential, and the Labour and Liberal <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> not join a government headed by him. He was succeeded by Winston Churchill but remained very well-regarded in Parliament, especially among Conservatives. Before ill-health forced him to resign, he was an important member of Churchill's War Cabinet, heading it in the new premier's absence. Chamberlain died of cancer six months after leaving the premiership.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, danger listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the GalÃ¡pagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, States Parties and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in danger without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the danger list against their wishes, States <b>Parties</b> <b>would</b> have submitted a programme of corrective measures before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in Danger is perceived by some states as a black list and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on Built Heritage, University of Montreal, has been used as political tool {{to get the attention of}} States Parties. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in Danger (without actually listing the site) in a number of cases where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period is questionable and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E
5|$|The Waikato MÄori had {{withdrawn}} to fortified positions at Pikopiko and Paterangi by early 1864. While their positions were under siege, war <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> mount raids on {{small groups of}} British soldiers. On 11 February, soldiers of the 40th Regiment of Foot were bathing in the Mangapiko Stream near Paterangi and were ambushed by a raiding party. Heaphy, commanding some men of the 50th Regiment of Foot, came {{to the aid of}} the defenders and moved to cut off the MÄori line of retreat. He then overcame the MÄori reserve, before leading his men to the ambush site, to assist the British soldiers. Despite being outnumbered, the British repulsed the MÄori and began to pursue them into the bush. A soldier was wounded and Heaphy and three others went to his aid but Heaphy and one of the others were wounded and a third was killed. Unable to extricate themselves, Heaphy and the remaining fit soldier provided cover to prevent the wounded men from being axed by the MÄori. They were eventually relieved by reinforcements but the two wounded men that Heaphy and the soldier were trying to protect, died of their wounds. Despite injuries to his arm, hip and ribs, Heaphy remained in the field for much of the remainder of the day, until the ambushed party was relieved. Following the action at Paterangi, Heaphy was promoted to major; a month later, {{with the end of the}} war in the Waikato, he ceased active duty and returned to civilian life.|$|E
5|$|Savimbi, {{unwilling to}} {{personally}} sign an accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola represent UNITA in his place. Manuvakola and Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura signed the Lusaka Protocol in Lusaka, Zambia on 31 October 1994, agreeing to integrate and disarm UNITA. Both sides signed a ceasefire {{as part of}} the protocol on 20 November. Under the agreement the government and UNITA would cease fire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the Angolan national police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the Angolan Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all <b>parties</b> <b>would</b> stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries, in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on 15 November 1994 to boost support symbolically for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said {{they would be willing to}} meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. The agreement created a joint commission, consisting of officials from the Angolan government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA into the military, a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were similar to those of the Alvor Agreement that granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the collapse of the protocol.|$|E
