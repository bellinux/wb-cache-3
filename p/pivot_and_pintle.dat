50|$|A pintle is a pin or bolt, usually {{inserted}} into a gudgeon, {{which is used}} {{as part of a}} pivot or hinge. Other applications include <b>pintle</b> <b>and</b> lunette ring for towing, <b>and</b> <b>pintle</b> pins securing casters in furniture.|$|R
25|$|Six {{of the ten}} {{original}} gates, fabricated around 1920 {{and weighing}} 250 tons apiece, were removed for sandblasting and replacement of weak spots. New seals <b>and</b> <b>pintles</b> were installed.|$|R
50|$|The offset can {{no longer}} be evenly divided between the hinge <b>and</b> the <b>pintle.</b> Lay a hinge or pintle on a flat surface. Call the {{distance}} from that surface {{to the middle of the}} hinge barrel or the pintle pin the Standoff. Each will have a different standoff. The sum of the hinge <b>and</b> <b>pintle</b> standoff will equal the offset.|$|R
5000|$|Any {{surface mounted}} hinge <b>and</b> <b>pintle</b> {{can be used}} - {{assuming}} there is sufficient width to the casing to accept the pintle. The hinge has a minimal standoff, <b>and</b> the <b>pintle</b> would have the same, matching standoff. Together an offset of 1-1½" [...] will hold the shutter that same distance from the structure, and not quite parallel to the wall.|$|R

50|$|Subtract the {{thickness}} of the shutter from the offset (4"-1"=3"). Divide the remainder in half (3"/2=1½"). This value is the standoff for the hinge. (1½"). Add {{the thickness}} of the shutter to the hinge standoff (1"+1½"=2½"). This is the standoff for the pintle (2½"). Add the hinge <b>and</b> <b>pintle</b> standoffs to verify (1½"+2⅓"=4"=offset=okay).|$|R
5000|$|... 1972 model saw a {{revision}} of the rudder blade's shape, the rudder's gudgeon <b>and</b> <b>pintle,</b> a new shape daggerboard, and a switch to a Sunfish designed cockpit bailer.

5000|$|The {{clearance}} {{between the}} lunette <b>and</b> <b>pintle</b> allows for more relative motion between the trailer and tow vehicle than a ball coupling does. A disadvantage {{of that is}} the [...] "slam" [...] transmitted into the towing vehicle with each push/pull load reversal. This becomes a tradeoff between a more secure coupling and a more comfortable towing experience.|$|R
50|$|A gudgeon is a socket-like, {{cylindrical}} (i.e., female) fitting {{attached to}} one component to enable a pivoting or hinging {{connection to a}} second component. The second component carries a pintle fitting, the male counterpart to the gudgeon, enabling an interpivoting connection {{that can be easily}} separated. Designs that may use gudgeon <b>and</b> <b>pintle</b> connections include hinges, shutters and boat rudders.|$|R
50|$|No {{windows of}} {{mid to late}} 16th century are extant, {{although}} surviving details may exist obscured by later work.

50|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of the innovative thrust chamber <b>and</b> <b>pintle</b> design is credited to TRW Aerospace Engineer Dr. Peter Staudhammer. The engine could throttle between 1050 lbf kN and 10125 lbf kN but operation between 65% and 92.5% thrust was avoided to prevent excessive nozzle erosion. It weighed 394 lb, with a length of 90.5 in and diameter of 59.0 in.|$|R

5000|$|Standoff is very important. Virtually all commercially {{available}} shutter hardware {{is provided with}} matching standoff on the hinge <b>and</b> <b>pintle.</b> This assumes that {{the face of the}} shutter will lie on the same plane as the casement with the shutter in the closed position. This seldom happens in contemporary construction - incorrect hardware is installed - the homeowner hears [...] "well, you'll never close them anyway".|$|R

50|$|Three basic {{techniques}} {{are used to}} employ pivot language in MT: (1) triangulation, which focuses on phrase paralleling between source <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> (s-p) <b>and</b> between <b>pivot</b> <b>and</b> target (p-t); (2) transfer, which translates the whole sentence of the source language to a <b>pivot</b> language <b>and</b> then to the target language; and (3) synthesis, which builds a corpus of its own for system training.|$|R
50|$|Installation problem: However it happens, {{this is the}} toughie. There is an offset and {{the shutter}} does not sit flush with the casing. The shutter may sit proud on the casing as drawn, or the shutter sits within the casing with its {{thickness}} exceeding the rabbet depth - in any case the hinge <b>and</b> <b>pintle</b> will each mount at a different distance {{from the face of}} the structure.|$|R

40|$|AbstractGaussian {{elimination}} {{is among}} the most widely used tools in scientific computing. Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting requires only O(n 2) comparisons beyond the work required in Gaussian elimination with no pivoting but can, in principle, have error growth that is exponential in the matrix size n. Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting, on the other hand, cannot have exponential error growth but requires O(n 3) comparisons beyond the work required by Gaussian elimination with no pivoting. Numerical experiments suggest that Gaussian elimination with rook pivoting is between partial <b>pivoting</b> <b>and</b> complete <b>pivoting</b> in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper we prove that rook pivoting cannot have exponential error growth. We also introduce a combination of partial <b>pivoting</b> <b>and</b> rock <b>pivoting</b> which we call Gaussian elimination with partial rook <b>pivoting</b> <b>and</b> we prove the partial rook pivoting cannot have exponential error growth. We include numerical experiments showing that on a serial computer the run times for cook pivoting are almost always close to those of partial <b>pivoting</b> <b>and</b> the run times for partial rook pivoting appear to be the same as those of partial pivoting...|$|R
