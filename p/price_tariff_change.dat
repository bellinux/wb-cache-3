The first chapter shows that the transmission of international agricultural prices to local producers is asymmetric, with downward price movements being transmitted more strongly than upward price movements.

The second chapter looks at the way Peruvian firms are affected by market access conditions and it shows that it isn't only the direct tariff that firms face that plays a role but also the tariff he faces relative to the tariff that competitors from other countries face. The last chapter shows that the effect of these relative tariffs depends on the distance to the destination country, with the effect being stronger when exporting to closer countries...|$|R
40|$|The St Vincent de Paul Society, in {{conjunction}} with Alviss Consulting, has been tracking changes to residential energy tariffs and reporting on household impacts since 2010. Initially the Tariff-Tracking project only covered Victoria but has since expanded to include New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. The rationale for tracking changes to domestic energy prices has been to document price increases, analyse market developments and inform the broader community about bill impacts and potential savings to be made. In our view, {{there is still a}} limited knowledge and understanding in the community of the various energy tariffs available, how they are changing, and how <b>tariff</b> <b>changes</b> impact on households’ energy bills and energy affordability more broadly. Only by improving this awareness and understanding can we ensure that the regulatory framework (for example, in relation to price information and disclosure) is adequate, and promote a competitive retail market. Furthermore, this increased knowledge will allow for close monitoring of the impact <b>price</b> and <b>tariff</b> <b>changes</b> have on households’ bills, and the affordability of this essential service. In addition, a key aim of this project has been to document and analyse price and product developments a rising from government policies and industry innovations, including the deregulation of retail prices, ‘green policies’, smart meter rollouts and transitions towards other smart grid developments.

40|$|In 2007, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) {{formed the}} Customer Response Task Force (CRTF) to {{identify}} barriers to deploying demand response (DR) resources in wholesale markets and develop policies {{to overcome these}} barriers. One of the initiatives of this Task Force was to develop more detailed information on existing retail DR programs and dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs,</b> program rules, and utility operating practices. This report describes {{the results of a}} comprehensive survey conducted by LBNL in support of the Customer Response Task Force and discusses policy implications for integrating legacy retail DR programs and dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs</b> into wholesale markets in the SPP region. LBNL conducted a detailed survey of existing DR programs and dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs</b> administered by SPP's member utilities. Survey respondents were asked to provide information on advance notice requirements to customers, operational triggers used to call events (e. g. system emergencies, market conditions, local emergencies), use of these DR resources to meet planning reserves requirements, DR resource availability (e. g. seasonal, annual), participant incentive structures, and monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols. Nearly all of the 30 load-serving entities in SPP responded to the survey. Of this group, fourteen SPP member utilities administer 36 DR programs, five dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs,</b> and six voluntary customer response initiatives. These existing DR programs and dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs</b> have a peak demand reduction potential of 1, 552 MW. Other major findings of this study are: o About 81 percent of available DR is from interruptible rate tariffs offered to large commercial and industrial customers, while direct load control (DLC) programs account for ~;; 14 percent. o Arkansas accounts for ~;; 50 percent of the DR resources in the SPP footprint; these DR resources are primarily managed by cooperatives. o Publicly-owned cooperatives accounted for 54 percent of the existing DR resources among SPP members. For these entities, investment in DR is often driven by the need to reduce summer peak demand that is used to set demand charges for each distribution cooperative. o About 65 - 70 percent of the interruptible/curtailable tariffs and DLC programs are routinely triggered based on market conditions, not just for system emergencies. Approximately, 53 percent of the DR resources are available with less than two hours advance notice and 447 MW can be dispatched with less than thirty minutes notice. o Most legacy DR programs offered a reservation payment ($/kW) for participation; incentive payment levels ranged from $ 0. 40 to $ 8. 30 /kW-month for interruptible rate tariffs and $ 0. 30 to $ 4. 60 /kW-month for DLC programs.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} trade liberalization on plant productivity. In contrast to previous studies, we distinguish between productivity gains arising from lower tariffs on final goods relative to lower tariffs on intermediate inputs. Lower output tariffs can produce productivity gains by inducing tougher import competition whereas cheaper imported inputs can raise productivity via learning, variety, or quality effects. We use Indonesian manufacturing census data from 1991 to 2001, which includes plant-level information on imported inputs. The {{results show that the}} largest gains arise from reducing input tariffs. A 10 percentage point fall in output tariffs increases productivity by about 1 percent, whereas an equivalent fall in input tariffs leads to a 3 percent productivity gain for all firms and an 11 percent productivity gain for importing firms.

40|$|Tariffs {{and other}} policy distortions {{typically}} lower real national income relative {{to what it}} {{otherwise would have been}} for any given rate of factor accumulation. Even while lowering real income, however, policy distortions may raise an economy''s real measured growth rate and so, somewhat deceivingly, give the impression that national welfare has benefited from things like tariff protection. This would be an incorrect conclusion. This paper discusses the issue of how protection can affect the rate of growth for a small, open economy. As shown by Johnson (1970), in the presence of exogenously given factor accumulation, tariffs either raise or lower an economy''s growth rate (measured by the change in the value of output at world prices), relative to the no-distortion growth rate. We also discuss the relevance of this result for tariff uniformity, "tariff jumping" foreign direct investment, and the empirical literature on trade and growth. Finally we use a numerical simulation model of Egypt to assess whether the costs of its tax distortions have increased or declined over time.
