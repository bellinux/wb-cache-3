The first extra term is the Coriolis force, the second the centrifugal force, and the third the Euler force. These terms all have these properties: they vanish when Ω = 0; that is, they are zero for an inertial frame (which, of course, does not rotate); they take on a different magnitude and direction in every rotating frame, depending upon its particular value of Ω; they are ubiquitous in the rotating frame (affect every particle, regardless of circumstance); {{and they have no}} apparent source in identifiable <b>physical</b> <b>sources,</b> in particular, matter. Also, fictitious forces do not drop off with distance (unlike, for example, nuclear forces or electrical forces). For example, the centrifugal force that appears to emanate from the axis of rotation in a rotating frame increases with distance from the axis.|$|E

50|$|Also called 'Acoustic Analogy'. To obtain Lighthill's aeroacoustic analogy the {{governing}} Navier-Stokes equations are rearranged. The left hand {{side is a}} wave operator, which {{is applied to the}} density perturbation or pressure perturbation respectively. The right hand side is identified as the acoustic sources in a fluid flow, then. As Lighthill's analogy follows directly from the Navier-Stokes equations without simplification, all sources are present. Some of the sources are then identified as turbulent or laminar noise. The far-field sound pressure is then given in terms of a volume integral over the domain containing the sound source.

50|$|Although the {{application}} of the clay helps to make the kura fireproof, it is prone to damage both from <b>physical</b> <b>sources</b> and from rain. Some kura used tiles {{at the base of the}} external wall. These were laid either horizontally or diagonally and were fixed with plaster dabs. The joints were thick and protruding, with a rounded top, and because they reminded people of namako (sea cucumber) they became known as namako walls. Tiles were also sometimes used in horizontal courses set at an angle to the wall (especially over window openings). These were called mizukiri (meaning water cutters) and were used to throw water off the facade to increase the durability of the wall.|$|E
50|$|Perception of {{line length}} is confounded by another optical inverse problem: the further away {{a line in}} the world, the smaller the {{projected}} line will be on the retina. Different orientations of a line relative to the observer may obscure true line length as well. It is well known that straight lines are erroneously reported as longer or shorter {{as a function of the}}ir angular orientation, as is evident in Fig. 3. While no generally accepted explanations of this phenomenon have been offered previously, the empirical approach has had some success in explaining the effect as a function of the distribution of lines in natural scenes. Howe and Purves (2002) analyzed natural scene photographs to find projected lines that corresponded to straight line sources. They found that the ratios of the actual length of the lines to the projected lines on the retina, when classified by their respective orientations on the retina, almost perfectly matched subjective estimation of line length as a function of angle relative to the observer. For example, horizontal lines on the retinal image would typically have turned out to issue from relatively short <b>physical</b> <b>sources,</b> while lines at about 60 degrees relative to the observer would typically have signified longer <b>physical</b> <b>sources,</b> which explains why we tend to see the 60° line in Fig. 3 as longer than the 0° (horizontal) line. While there is no way for the visual system to know this a priori, the fact that it seems to take this knowledge for granted in its construction of length estimation percepts strongly supports the wholly empirical view of perception.|$|E

50|$|The {{will to live}} is a {{psychological}} force to fight for survival seen as an important and active process of conscious and unconscious reasoning. This occurs particularly when one’s own life is threatened by a serious injury or disease. The idea in which someone {{who is on the}} threshold of death may consciously or unconsciously try to stay alive through the belief that they have a reason or something to live for, along with giving up on the will to live. There are significant correlations between the will to live and existential, psychological, social, and <b>physical</b> <b>sources</b> of distress. The concept of the will to live can be seen as directly impacted by hope. Many, who overcome near-death experiences with no explanation, have described concepts such as the will to live as a direct component of their survival. The difference between the wish to die versus the wish to live is also a unique risk factor for suicide.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} methods {{useful for}} estimating zooplankton distributions {{in the field}} by combining acoustic scattering models and an integrated set of field data. The accuracy of existing scattering models for fluid-like and elastic-shelled animals is determined by analysis of scattering data from individual animals in a laboratory tank. Results indicate that simple two-ray scattering models are accurate and allow predictions of size or orientation of an animal {{to be made for}} certain animal orientations. A scattering model for gas-bearing zooplankton is compared with in situ multiple frequency acoustic measurements from siphonophores. Estimates of the numerical density of these animals are made using echo integration data from a scientific echo-sounder. Multiple frequency acoustic scattering data from a survey of an internal wave are analyzed to determine the contributions from biological and <b>physical</b> <b>sources.</b> Net tow data provide information about biological scatterers while temperature and salinity profiles are used with a theoretical scattering model to predict contributions from <b>physical</b> <b>sources.</b> Results indicate that scattering from <b>physical</b> <b>sources</b> is comparable to that from biological sources in certain regions and that scattering spectra may be used to distinguish these sources. Improved estimates of biomass from acoustic scattering data were made by accounting for the scattering contributions from <b>physical</b> <b>sources.</b> This is the first work to quantify the scattering contributions from biological and <b>physical</b> <b>sources</b> of scattering in a field study. by Joseph David Warren.
