30|$|Four N 1 s sub-peaks {{could be}} fitted [31] in Fig.  4 : pyridinic nitrogen, <b>pyrrolic</b> or <b>pyridone</b> nitrogen, {{oxidized}} pyridinic nitrogen, and adsorbed nitrogen. The peak with the bonding energy at 400 – 400.6  eV {{can be attributed}} to five-membered ring of pyrrole or pyridone structure (pyridone). If the peak is attributed to pyridone, it can be mutually converted with pyridinic nitrogen in specific condition. This is because both oxidized pyridinic nitrogen and pyridone nitrogen are in oxidized states, while pyridinic nitrogen is in reducing state [17].|$|R

Oxidized pyridinic nitrogen is also hard to achieve a high doping content (few further discussions on its acting mechanism were referred in the paper). Besides, the pyridinic nitrogen and <b>pyridone</b> nitrogen (or <b>pyrrolic</b> nitrogen) are easily formed on the graphene surface and also proven to be valuable electrochemical active sites. Thus, the effective regulation of pyridinic, <b>pyrrolic,</b> or <b>pyridone</b> N in graphene-like network together with a well-defined pore structure {{is very important for}} accelerating application of carbon-based materials in energy storage fields such as lithium-ion batteries [23], fuel cells [24, 25], and supercapacitors [26].|$|R

50|$|A gas {{propellant}} usually involves {{some sort of}} compressed gas.

50|$|Nutrients <b>like</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (N), {{phosphorus}} (P), {{and potassium}} (K), {{are important for}} plant growth and are essential parts of fertilizer.

50|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} device is oxygen deprivation that leads to hypoxia, asphyxia and death within minutes. Deprivation of oxygen {{in the presence of}} carbon dioxide creates panic and a sense of suffocation (the hypercapnic alarm response), and struggling even when unconscious, whereas anoxia in the presence of an inert gas, <b>like</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> helium or argon, does not.|$|R

5000|$|Molecules in a gas <b>like</b> <b>nitrogen</b> at room {{temperature}} at any instant are moving at an average speed of nearly 500 miles per hour (210 m/s), repeatedly colliding and therefore exchanging energy so that their individual speeds are always changing. Assuming an ideal-gas model, average kinetic energy increases linearly with absolute temperature, so the average speed increases as the square root of temperature.|$|R

Most {{of the commercial}} inhibitors are toxic in nature; therefore, replacement by environmentally benign inhibitors is necessary [11]. Presently, there is a trend to replace existing inhibitors such as chromates and cyanides because of their harmful effect to the nature [6].|$|R
50|$|A Schlenk flask, or Schlenk tube is a {{reaction}} vessel typically used in air-sensitive chemistry, invented by Wilhelm Schlenk. It has a side arm {{fitted with a}} PTFE or ground glass stopcock, which allows the vessel to be evacuated or filled with gases (usually inert gases <b>like</b> <b>nitrogen</b> or argon). These flasks are often connected to Schlenk lines, which allow both operations to be done easily.|$|R

Although plants cannot {{move to a new}} environment when nutrient availability is less than favorable, they can modify their development to favor root colonization of soil areas where nutrients are abundant. Therefore, plants perceive the availability of external nutrients, <b>like</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> and couple this nutrient sensing to an appropriate adaptive response.|$|R

Other gases, <b>like</b> <b>nitrogen</b> or methane, are unlikely to be present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space.

50|$|Organophosphorus {{chemistry}} is the corresponding {{science of the}} properties and reactivity of organophosphorus compounds. Phosphorus, <b>like</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> is in group 15 of the periodic table, and thus phosphorus compounds and nitrogen compounds have many similar properties. The definition of organophosphorus compounds is variable, {{which can lead to}} confusion. In industrial and environmental chemistry, an organophosphorus compound need contain only an organic substituent, but need not have a direct phosphorus-carbon (P-C) bond. Thus a large proportion of pesticides (e.g., malathion), are often included in this class of compounds.|$|R
