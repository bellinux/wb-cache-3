5|$|Rocket propellant: Solid {{fuel rocket}} <b>propellant</b> began during the 1200s during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty {{at a time}} when bows, arrows, and catapult-based {{projectile}} launchers were state of the art military technology in medieval Europe. The Song Chinese invented solid <b>propellant</b> rockets in 1232 during the military siege of Kaifeng. The rocket propellants were powered by solid gunpowder fuel.|$|E
5|$|When {{the trigger}} was pulled, the spring pushed {{the firing pin}} {{forwards}} into the bomb, which ignited the <b>propellant</b> in the bomb and launched {{it out of the}} trough and into the air. The recoil caused by the detonation of the <b>propellant</b> then blew the firing pin backwards onto the spring; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to manually re-cock.|$|E
40|$|LMP- 103 S and AFM- 315 E are {{emerging}} <b>propellants</b> {{that are less}} toxic to the environment than the <b>propellants</b> currently being used in spacecraft propulsion. Both <b>propellants</b> are a blend of liquid fuel, oxidizer and a majority percent of water. The diluted solutions enable the capability to handle and store the <b>propellants</b> with fewer requirements; for this reason, it decreases the overall cost of the <b>propellants</b> since it needs less precautions. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) awarded the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) a contract to further research green <b>propellants</b> and eventually replace Hydrazide. ...|$|R

40|$|The new and {{improved}} methods and apparatus disclosed provide effective real-time management of a spacecraft rocket engine powered by gaseous <b>propellants.</b> Real-time measurements representative of the engine performance are compared with predetermined standards to selectively control the supply of <b>propellants</b> to the engine for optimizing its performance as well as efficiently managing the consumption of <b>propellants.</b> A priority system is provided for achieving effective real-time management of the propulsion system by first regulating the <b>propellants</b> to keep the engine operating at an efficient level and thereafter regulating the consumption ratio of the <b>propellants.</b> A lower priority level is provided to balance the consumption of the <b>propellants</b> so significant quantities of unexpended <b>propellants</b> will not be left over {{at the end of}} the scheduled mission of the engine...|$|R

5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four <b>propellant</b> charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further <b>propellant</b> explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{reported}} on the L-star instability characteristics of three AP/composite <b>propellants.</b> The metal content of the <b>propellants</b> is 2, 16, and 16 %. Chuffing, bulk mode oscillations, and time-independent combustion are observed with {{all three of these}} <b>propellants.</b> The stability boundary, defined as the boundary between time-independent and unstable combustion, is found to be well defined for two of the <b>propellants</b> in agreement with recognized trends available in the literature on other <b>propellants.</b> The frequency of bulk mode oscillations is presented {{as a function of the}} chamber characteristic length.

40|$|AbstractTo {{prepare the}} porous NC-based (nitrocellulose-based) gun <b>propellants,</b> the batch foaming process of using {{supercritical}} CO 2 as the physical blowing agent is used. The solubilities of CO 2 in the single-base <b>propellants</b> and TEGDN (trimethyleneglycol dinitrate) <b>propellants</b> are {{measured by the}} gravimetric method, and SEM (scanning electron microscope) is used to observe the morphology of foamed <b>propellants.</b> The result shows that {{a large amount of}} CO 2 could be dissolved in NC-based <b>propellants.</b> The experimental results also reveal that the energetic plasticizer TEGDN exerts an important influence on the pore structure. The triaxial tensile failure mechanism for solid-state nucleation is used to explain the nucleation of NC-based <b>propellants</b> in the solid state. Since some specific foaming behaviors of NC-based <b>propellants</b> can not be explained by the failure mechanism, a solid-state nucleation mechanism which revises the triaxial tensile failure mechanism is proposed and discussed...|$|R

5|$|Xenon is the {{preferred}} <b>propellant</b> for ion propulsion of spacecraft because it has low ionization potential per atomic weight and can be stored as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. Xenon is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s. It was later employed as a <b>propellant</b> for JPL's Deep Space 1 probe, Europe's SMART-1 spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on NASA's Dawn Spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Zinc powder is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} <b>propellant</b> in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.|$|E

40|$|A {{transient}} ballistics and combustion {{model is}} derived {{to represent the}} closed vessel experiment that is widely used to characterize <b>propellants.</b> A computer program is developed to solve the time-dependent equations, and is applied to explain aspects of closed vessel behavior. In the case of nitramine <b>propellants</b> the cratering of the burning surface associated with combustion above break-point pressures augments the effective burning rate as deduced from the closed vessel experiment. Low pressure combustion is significantly affected by the ignition process and, {{in the case of}} nitramine <b>propellants,</b> by the developing and changing surface structure. Thus, burning rates deduced from the closed vessel experiment may or may not agree with those measured in the equilibrium strand burner. Series of T burner experiments are performed to compare the combustion instability characteristics of nitramine (HMX) containing <b>propellants</b> and ammonium perchlorate (AP) <b>propellants.</b> Although ash produced by more fuel rich <b>propellants</b> could have provided mechanical suppression, results from clean-burning <b>propellants</b> permit the conclusion that HMX reduces the acoustic driving...|$|R
2500|$|Improved {{military}} rifle <b>propellants</b> are tubular nitrocellulose <b>propellants</b> {{evolved from}} World War I through World War II for loading military and commercial ammunition {{and sold to}} civilians for reloading rifle ammunition for hunting and target shooting. [...] These <b>propellants</b> were DuPont modifications of United States artillery <b>propellants.</b> DuPont miniaturized the large artillery grains to form military rifle <b>propellants</b> suitable for use in small arms. These were improved {{during the first world}} war to be more efficient in rimless military cartridges replacing earlier rimmed rifle cartridges. Four-digit numbers identified experimental <b>propellants,</b> and a few successful varieties warranted extensive production by several manufacturers. Some were used almost exclusively for military contracts, or commercial ammunition production, but a few have been distributed for civilian use in handloading. Improved military rifle <b>propellants</b> are coated with dinitrotoluene (DNT) to slow initial burning and graphite to minimize static electricity during blending and loading. [...] They contain 0.6% diphenylamine as a stabilizer and 1% potassium sulfate to reduce muzzle flash.|$|R
5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin. When boiled in water, or digested in the body, this compound is readily hydrolyzed to the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine—used as a <b>propellant</b> in some rocket fuels.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 11 {{landed with}} less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts {{encountered}} a premature low fuel warning.

On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.|$|E
5|$|In the Space Shuttle {{the main}} {{oxidizer}} and fuel bleed valves were used after shutdown to dump any residual <b>propellant,</b> with residual liquid oxygen venting through {{the engine and}} residual liquid hydrogen venting through the liquid hydrogen fill and drain valves.

40|$|Both {{heating and}} solvent-spray methods {{are used to}} {{consolidate}} the standard grains of double-base oblate sphere <b>propellants</b> plasticized with triethyleneglycol dinitrate (TEGDN) (TEGDN <b>propellants)</b> to high density <b>propellants.</b> The obtained consolidated <b>propellants</b> are deterred and coated with the slow burning multi-layer coating. The maximum compaction density of deterred and coated consolidated <b>propellants</b> can reach up to 1. 39  g/cm 3. Their mechanic, deconsolidation and combustion performances are tested by the materials test machine, interrupted burning set-up and closed vessel, respectively. The static compression strength of consolidated <b>propellants</b> deterred by multi-layer coating increases significantly to 18  MPa, indicating {{that they can be}} applied in most circumstances of charge service. And the samples are easy to deconsolidate in the interrupted burning test. Furthermore, the closed bomb burning curves of the samples indicate a two-stage combustion phenomenon under the condition of certain thickness of coated multi-layers. After the outer deterred multi-layer coating of consolidated samples is finished burning, the inner consolidated <b>propellants</b> continue to burn and breakup into aggregates and grains. The high burning progressivity can be carefully obtained by the smart control of deconsolidation process and duration of consolidated <b>propellants.</b> The preliminary results of consolidated <b>propellants</b> show that a rapid deconsolidation process at higher deconsolidation pressure is presented in the dynamic vivacity curves of closed bomb test. Higher density and higher macro progressivity of consolidated <b>propellants</b> can be obtained by the techniques in this paper...|$|R

5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent <b>propellant,</b> surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent <b>propellant,</b> and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powder, based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of <b>propellant</b> with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s {{tended to be}} smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E
5|$|Though {{considered}} to be quick-firing, the <b>propellant</b> for 7-inch guns was loaded in bags, making them slower than contemporary 6-inch guns.

40|$|Foamed <b>propellants</b> {{based on}} polymer bonded nitramines show high {{conversion}} rates {{due to their}} porous structure. The properties of the material can be varied {{in a wide range}} by using different explosive fillers, energetic binders and porous structures. Foamed <b>propellants</b> with high energy content and variable burning and material characteristics can be formulated. Due to this flexibility, these <b>propellants</b> can be adjusted to manifold applications. The burning characteristics of these porous charges show specific differences compared to standard gun <b>propellants,</b> e. g. the mass conversion rates are essentially above those obtained by combustion of compact materials. In addition, the burning behavior of foamed <b>propellants</b> depending on pressure deviates from that expected by a straightforward use of Vieille's law.
