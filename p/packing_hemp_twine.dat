25|$|Hemp jewelry is {{the product}} of {{knotting}} <b>hemp</b> <b>twine</b> through the practice of macramé. Hemp jewellery includes bracelets, necklaces, anklets, rings, watches and other adornments. Some jewellery features beads made from crystals, glass, stone, wood and bones. The <b>hemp</b> <b>twine</b> varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors. There are many different stitches used to create hemp jewellery, however, the half knot and full knot stitches are most common.|$|R
50|$|Hemp jewelry uses <b>hemp</b> <b>twine</b> {{material}} {{which is}} made from the Cannabis sativa plant, otherwise known as “Common Hemp”, which is cultivated to make goods such as food, fuel, clothing and textiles, cosmetics, paints, paper, building materials, and plastics, among others. Some types of hemp jewelry include bracelets, necklaces, anklets, rings, watches, masks, purses, and other adornments. The jewelry can also make use of other materials, such as glass, wood, bones, rocks, or gems.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fish are}} first salted {{overnight}}. They are then tied in pairs using <b>hemp</b> <b>twine,</b> and left overnight to dry. Once {{they have been}} salted, tied and dried, they are hung over a triangular length of wood to smoke. This [...] "kiln stick" [...] fits between the two tied smokies, one fish on either side. The sticks are then used to hang the dried fish in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire.|$|R
5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} gunpowder formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using <b>hemp</b> <b>twine.</b> Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|R
50|$|The Type 3 has an odd {{and cheap}} appearance. It has a tear drop-like shape. The grenade {{consists}} of a thin steel cone mounted on a wooden standoff head. The explosive is cast around the cone and covered by a cloth bag made of either silk or <b>hemp</b> <b>twine.</b> The upper extremity is made of a very basic impact firing mechanism. The hemp tail attached at the top serves as a stabilizer for when the grenade is in flight, thus ensuring that the target is struck successfully. When thrown, the type 3's twine seemed to create a tail-like skirt.|$|R
50|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} black-powder formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using <b>hemp</b> <b>twine.</b> Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|R
25|$|Other {{commonly}} used materials include glass, such as fused-glass or enamel; wood, often carved or turned; shells {{and other natural}} animal substances such as bone and ivory; natural clay; polymer clay; <b>Hemp</b> and other <b>twines</b> {{have been used as}} well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel. However, any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give an English Assay office (the building which gives English jewellery its stamp of approval, the Hallmark) the right to destroy the piece, however it is very rare for the assay office to do so.|$|R
50|$|The split {{piston ring}} {{was invented by}} John Ramsbottom who {{reported}} the benefits to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1854. It soon replaced the <b>hemp</b> <b>packing</b> hitherto used in steam engines. The use of piston rings at once dramatically reduced the frictional resistance, the leakage of steam, and {{the mass of the}} piston, leading to significant increases in power and efficiency and longer maintenance intervals.|$|R
50|$|Bramah had {{designed}} a hydraulic press, but was having problems sealing both the piston and the piston rod where it fitted into the cylinder. The usual method was <b>hemp</b> <b>packing</b> but the pressures {{were too high}} for this to work. Maudslay {{came up with the}} idea of a leather cup washer, which gave a perfect seal but offered no resistance to movement when the pressure was released. The new hydraulic press worked perfectly thereafter. But Maudslay, who had made a major contribution to its success, received little credit for it.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} lunar and tidal {{influence}} on the landing of pelagic fish with drift gill nets has been studied {{for the first time}} from Bay of Bengal along the Orissa coast. The catchability of the gear was highest during the first quarter and lowest {{in the fourth quarter of}} the moon. The variation in catch rates during the four different quarters was not statistically significant. Contrary to the earlier belief, landing with gill net was not poor during the moonlit nights. The extensive use of bluish grey nylon twine matching with seawater in place of indigenous <b>hemp</b> or cotton <b>twine,</b> has largely eliminated the visibility of gear during the brighter phase of the moon. The rate of exploitation was found to be significantly higher during the nights of neap tide, compared to those of spring tide. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon has been offered...|$|R
