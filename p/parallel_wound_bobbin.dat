50|$|A bobbin is {{a spindle}} or cylinder, {{with or without}} flanges, on which wire, yarn, thread or film is <b>wound.</b> <b>Bobbins</b> are {{typically}} found in sewing machines, cameras, and within electronic equipment. In non-electrical applications the bobbin is used for tidy storage without tangles. In electrical applications a coil of wire carrying a current has important magnetic properties. As used in spinning, weaving, knitting, sewing, or lacemaking, the bobbin provides temporary or permanent storage for yarn and may be made of plastic, metal, bone or wood.|$|R
50|$|The weaving {{is done on}} pedal looms, {{with the}} wool yarn <b>wound</b> on <b>bobbins</b> and woven through cotton/wool blend threads. A 3x5 foot rug can take several weeks to produce. The largest pieces can {{take as long as}} eight months.|$|R
50|$|Bobbin lace is a lace textile made by {{braiding}} {{and twisting}} lengths of thread, which are <b>wound</b> on <b>bobbins</b> to manage them. As the work progresses, the weaving {{is held in}} place with pins set in a lace pillow, {{the placement of the}} pins usually determined by a pattern or pricking pinned on the pillow.|$|R

[...] I submitted; {{forthwith}} he began to dress my hand. He examined with a magnifying-glass the several <b>parallel</b> <b>wounds,</b> and compared them with the slip of blotting-paper, marked with Silvio's claws, which he took from his pocket-book. He put back the paper, simply remarking: ...|$|R
50|$|Once the yarn is {{the desired}} thickness, enough twist {{is added to}} make the yarn strong. In effect, this is done by {{releasing}} the passive hand. Next the yarn is <b>wound</b> onto the <b>bobbin,</b> and the process starts again.|$|R
50|$|Silk {{throwing}} is {{the industrial}} process where silk {{that has been}} reeled into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is <b>wound</b> onto <b>bobbins.</b> The yarn is now twisted together with threads, in {{a process known as}} doubling. Colloquially silk throwing can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling. Silk had to be thrown to make it strong enough to be used as organizine for the warp in a loom, or tram for weft.|$|R
25|$|A commutated {{electrically}} excited series or <b>parallel</b> <b>wound</b> motor {{is referred}} to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.|$|R
5000|$|The term first {{appears in}} 1695, {{although}} {{the design is}} much older. It was probably so called in reference to its [...] "claws", which inflict <b>parallel</b> <b>wounds.</b> There are equivalent terms in many languages, usually strictly translating, and also some analogous terms referring to a similar instrument's number of tails (cord or leather), such as the Dutch zevenstaart (seven tails), negenstaart (nine tails), the Spanish gato de nueve colas or the Italian gatto a nove code.|$|R
50|$|Each SAM {{consists}} of two coils of wire, <b>wound</b> on <b>bobbins,</b> which surround a single central, magnetically conductive pole piece or two separate pole pieces (determined by the designer) and will have one or more switching contacts or reed switches that are switched on or off by {{the movement of the}} armature. The switching contact is used to control which rank or ranks of pipes will sound when keys on a keyboard are depressed, although the actual 'rank switching' is often handled by a more complex electromagnetic or electronic relay system.|$|R
50|$|The freshly dyed {{coloured}} {{and white}} wools are weighed in predetermined proportions and then thoroughly blended by hand to exact recipes {{to obtain the}} correct hue. It is then carded between mechanical, toothed rollers which tease and mix the fibers thoroughly before it is separated into a fragile, embryonic yarn.This soft yarn then has a twist imparted to it as it is spun to give it maximum strength for weaving. The spun yarn is <b>wound</b> onto <b>bobbins</b> to provide the ingredients of weft (left-to-right threads) and warp (vertical threads) supplied to the weavers.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{processes}} {{that are used in}} manufacturing metallic fibers. The most common is the laminating process, which seals a layer of aluminum between two layers of acetate or polyester film. These fibers are then cut into lengthwise strips for yarns and <b>wound</b> onto <b>bobbins.</b> The metal can be colored and sealed in a clear film, the adhesive can be colored, or the film can be colored before laminating. There are many different variations of color and effect that can be made in metallic fibers, producing a wide range of looks.|$|R
50|$|Winders {{are used}} heavily in textile manufacturing, {{especially}} in preparation to weaving where the yarn is <b>wound</b> onto a <b>bobbin</b> and then {{used in a}} shuttle. Ball winders are another type of winder that wind the yarn up from skein form into balls. Ball winders are commonly used by knitters and occasionally spinners.|$|R
5000|$|In 1795, {{the machine}} was {{successfully}} used to make lacey fabrics. [...] Warp frames could be used with any thread, and the warps provided a fixed anchor for the transverse threads. In 1786 Flint invented the point bar which kept the threads at a fixed distance. In 1796, Dawson introduced cams to move the bars, and regulate the twist. Brown and Copstake succeeded in imitating Mechlen net. Lindley invented the bobbin in 1799, and Irving and Skelton the regulator spring. In 1802, Robert Brown of New Radford patented the first twist-frame, a knitter that could produce wide net.Whittaker's frame of 1804 had half its thread mounted on a warp beam and half <b>wound</b> on <b>bobbins</b> mounted on a carriage.|$|R
50|$|The French {{engineer}} Auguste de Méritens (1834-1898) developed magnetos further {{for this}} purpose. His innovation was {{to replace the}} rotor coils previously <b>wound</b> on individual <b>bobbins,</b> with a 'ring wound' armature. These windings were placed on a segmented iron core, similar to a Gramme ring, so as to form a single continuous hoop. This gave a more even output current, which was still more advantageous for arc lamps.|$|R
50|$|Spinning is the {{twisting}} together of drawn out strands of fibers to form yarn, {{and is a}} major part of the textile industry. The yarn is then used to create textiles, which are then used to make clothing and many other products. There are several industrial processes available to spin yarn, as well as hand spinning techniques where the fiber is drawn out, twisted, and <b>wound</b> onto a <b>bobbin.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{proteins}} have a 3-layer alpha/beta/alpha structure.The polypeptide topology of UDG {{is that of}} {{a classic}} alpha/beta protein. The structure consists primarily of a central, four-stranded, all parallel beta sheet surrounded on either side by a total of eight alpha helices and is termed a <b>parallel</b> doubly <b>wound</b> beta sheet.|$|R
50|$|In the {{continuous}} filament process, after the fiber is drawn, a size is applied. This size helps protect the fiber {{as it is}} <b>wound</b> onto a <b>bobbin.</b> The particular size applied relates to end-use. While some sizes are processing aids, others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin, if the fiber {{is to be used}} in a composite. Size is usually added at 0.5-2.0% by weight. Winding then takes place at around 1000 m/min.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{earliest}} loudspeakers, voice coils were <b>wound</b> onto paper <b>bobbins,</b> which {{was appropriate for}} modest power levels. As more powerful amplifiers became available, alloy 1145 aluminium foil was widely substituted for paper bobbins, and the voice coils survived increased power. Typical modern hi-fi loudspeaker voice coils employ materials which can withstand operating temperatures up to 150°C, or even 180°C. For professional loudspeakers, advanced thermoset composite materials are available to improve voice coil survival under severe simultaneous thermal (<300°C) and mechanical stresses.|$|R

5000|$|The fibre {{used for}} making the yarn is derived from [...] "Lashing" [...] (Cotton ball) and [...] "Kabrang" [...] (Mulberry cocoon). It is also {{extracted}} from the bark of the tree species locally known as [...] "Santhak” (Urtica sp.). The local fibre is spun into threads and then dyed using the extracts of plants, bark, leaves, and flowers. The dyed yarn is subject to sizing {{through the application of}} a rice-based starch, following by stretching {{with the help of a}} bamboo stick, and then <b>wound</b> onto the <b>bobbins</b> and pirns.|$|R
5000|$|Jumble winding or {{scramble}} winding {{is a type}} of winding of a wire randomly <b>wound</b> on a <b>bobbin.</b> In {{this type}} of winding, the wire is not wound layer by layer with insulation placed in between. In fact, it is wound full depth, and randomly until the number of turns have been reached. The only insulation throughout is the insulation on the wire and that of the bobbin. Special sectioned bobbins are used for this type of winding. Devices that use jumble-wound coils include small electric motors, and some types of choke inductors.|$|R

Under her arm she held a distaff of dark, ripe wood, just a {{straight}} stick with a clutch at the end, like a grasp of brown fingers full of a fluff of blackish, rusty fleece, held up near her shoulder. And her fingers were plucking spontaneously at the strands of wool drawn down from it. And hanging near her feet, spinning round upon a black thread, spinning busily, like a thing in a gay wind, was her shuttle, her <b>bobbin</b> <b>wound</b> fat with the coarse, blackish worsted she was making.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lockstitch}} uses two threads, {{an upper}} and a lower. Lockstitch is {{so named because}} the two threads, upper and lower, [...] "lock" [...] (entwine) together in {{the hole in the}} fabric which they pass through. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, through the take-up arm, and finally {{through the hole in the}} needle. Meanwhile the lower thread is <b>wound</b> onto a <b>bobbin,</b> which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine below the material.|$|R
50|$|The rolag is spun {{without much}} {{stretching}} of the fibers from the cylindrical configuration. This {{is done by}} allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in your hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist will concentrate in the thinnest part of the roving, thus when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to thin out. Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong. Then the yarn is <b>wound</b> onto the <b>bobbin,</b> and the process starts again.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Accelerating {{wound healing}} {{is a very}} {{important}} factor for patients to return to ordinary life. Laser seems to have positive effect on cutaneous wound healing. This study aimed to investigate the effect of red light laser 630 nm on cutaneous surgical wound in hamster and to compare outcomes such as angiogenesis, number of fibroblasts and collagen formation in intervention and control group. Materials and Methods: This experimental study carried out with collaboration of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences with Mehregan Pet Clinic in winter of 2009. Thirty suri hamsters were randomly allocated in two groups and four <b>parallel</b> <b>wounds</b> were made on their backs. The intervention group was radiated with red-light laser 630 nm. After 2, 5, 10 and 14 days, skin biopsy were obtained and number of blood vessels, fibroblast and collagen production were compared with the control group. Data were analyzed using independent sample student t test using SPSS version 10 and P value less than 0. 05 was considered significant. Result: Evaluation of wounds in experimental and control groups showed significantly increased number of vessels and fibroblasts as well as collagen production in laser radiating group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Laser therapy (630 nm) can accelerate wound healing in comparison with control group...|$|R

Ayla is swimming nude in the river beside the campsite when the earthquake starts and watches the tragedy in horror. Wandering aimlessly, alone, frightened, hungry and helpless, Ayla eventually encounters a cave lion which chases her into a narrow crack in a rock wall. Attempting to pull Ayla out, the lion gashes open Ayla's leg, leaving four deep <b>parallel</b> <b>wounds</b> on her thigh.

50|$|Each carbon {{filament}} is produced from a polymer such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), rayon, or petroleum pitch, {{known as a}} precursor. For synthetic polymers such as PAN or rayon, the precursor is first spun into filament yarns, using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer atoms {{in a way to}} enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber. Precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers. After drawing or spinning, the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non-carbon atoms (carbonization), producing the final carbon fiber. The carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities, then <b>wound</b> on to <b>bobbins.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Doubling is {{a textile}} {{industry}} term synonymous with combining. It {{can be used}} for various processes during spinning. During the carding stage, several sources of roving are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be doubled to produce warp for weaving, to make cotton for lace, crochet and knitting. [...] It is used for embroidery threads and sewing threads, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun 60s cotton are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is mercerised, gassed (AKA flamed) and <b>wound</b> onto a <b>bobbin.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Spiral yarn {{composed}} with an elastomeric filament DOW XLA, from Dow Chemical, and wool fibres outwardly wound around the elastic core presents a complex behaviour when <b>wound</b> on <b>bobbins</b> to be dyed. This article presents a basic mathematical model {{with the aim}} of evaluating radial pressure and transversal stress on bobbins at different angles of winding, different yarn tensions and yarn cross-section areas. Considering the additional complexities of the real problem, an experimental comparison of bobbin alterations under different conditions was carried out with the realisation of two experimental sets. The first experimental test bench allows the variation of winding tension, angle of winding and stroke, then experimental tests were carried out on a winding machine SAVIO varying the yarn tension value and adding a mechanical constrain to the device {{with the aim of}} reducing yarn-sliding phenomena, in particular during the thermal cycle. The fundamental parameters have been determined as the angle of wind and the yarn tension during the winding operation. Higher values of wind angle help keeping the bobbin shape. Higher values of yarn tension during winding operation allow the preservation of bobbin shape after the dyeing cycle. On the other hand, the upper limit is represented by yarn tensile strength. Moreover, it is not useful to apply a varying wind tension during the winding proces...|$|R
50|$|Silk is a {{naturally}} produced fibre obtained from {{many species of}} the silk moth. In 1700 the favoured silk was produced by a moth (Bombyx mori), that spun a cocoon to protect the larvae. The larvae fed on mulberry leaves grown in Italy. Silk fibres from the Bombyx mori silkworm have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5-10 μm wide. The silk is a protein, fibroin, that was cemented {{in place by the}} use of gum, another protein, sericin. The cocoons were harvested and placed in troughs of hot water to dissolve the gum and allowed the single thread to be wound into a skein. The skeins were placed into bales and taken to the mill for processing. Three sorts of yarn could be produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist making it easier to handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. Reeling is the industrial process where silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is <b>wound</b> onto <b>bobbins.</b> Silk throwing is the process where the thread from the bobbins is twisted again to form tram and or organzine. The yarn is twisted together into threads, in a process known as doubling. Colloquially silk throwing can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling.|$|R
