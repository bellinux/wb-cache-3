40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee. Both the {{calculation}} and allocation of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee for certain areas are analysed. The <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation, {{which is in}} accordance with the ordinance on equipping the building plots in areas of the municipal spatial plan of the Municipality of Kamnik (example 1), is presented within the thesis. The actual costs of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping which are based on the physical indicators of the ordinance on the equipping programme and the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee following the instruction for the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation (Official Gazette No. 4 / 99) are both calculated and strictly comply with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution (example 2). Activities in the areas of municipal elaborated spatial plans show different consumption of potable water, therefore, based on an assumption on potable water consumption in <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, we have calculated the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee according to estimated or actual potable water consumption (example 3). We have determined that the existing calculation and distribution of the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee method and distribution of the urban contribution (example 1) complies the least with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution. The results in the other two examples are similar, since both take into account the principle of contribution and counter - contribution, as demonstrated by the structural fractions of the distributed <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee among taxpayers. ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, two major issues surfaced. First, Waterfield favored {{a tax on}} parimutuel betting, while Clements opposed it. Second, Waterfield {{supported}} the development of electric power generation through <b>public</b> <b>utilities,</b> while Clements favored private development (which won him {{the support of the}} Kentucky Utilities company). The Clements campaign also attacked Waterfield for being deemed physically unfit for military service. Clements received a late boost when he gained the endorsement of John Y.

5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. <b>Public</b> <b>utilities</b> were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E

5|$|Alaska senator Ernest Gruening {{remained}} a staunch backer {{of the project}} from its inception to its cancellation, {{and made it a}} major personal political priority. Gruening led a coalition of Alaska lawmakers that included most of the Alaska Legislature. In the 1962 Alaska state elections, every candidate elected to the state legislature was a supporter of the project. In the years that followed, the Alaska Legislature voted several times to allocate state funding for the project. Politicians at the city level also got into the action, as the city of Anchorage and the Fairbanks <b>Public</b> <b>Utilities</b> Board each voted to contribute $10,000 to a pro-Rampart organization.

5|$|The two liberal {{governments of}} César Gaviria (1990-1994) and Ernesto Samper (1994-1998) pursued {{a policy of}} {{economic}} opening and business modernization. In the spirit of these policies, the government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in the poorest {{parts of the country}} where <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased cost recovery, and protecting the poorest through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs. The basis of this sector policy was established by Law 142 of July 1994, at the end of president César Gaviria’s term of office. With some modifications to that law in 2001, the same policy continues to be pursued to today despite several changes of governments.|$|E
