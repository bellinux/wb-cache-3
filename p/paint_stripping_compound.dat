40|$|Paint removal is {{required}} {{in a series of}} aeronautical procedures such as maintenance and repair. Today's <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes which are based on application of chemicals and abrasion are inadequate for modem aircraft structures in addition to environmental contamination, Several alternative techniques are in progress. However, the aspect of material property degradation when developing novel, alternative <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> techniques has not been properly faced up to present. The influence of two novel <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes on the mechanical properties of the substrate 2024 T 351 aluminium alloy has been investigated. The <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes included laser radiation with excimer, CO 2, TEA-CO 2 and YAG laser sources as well as plasma etching. These processes have been applied for the removal of polyurethane coating which is a typical aeronautical paint system. The results indicated no significant degradation in yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. However a significant degradation in tensile ductility and toughness is observed with the application of all <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes, the highest degradation being associated with the ultraviolet excimer laser and plasma etching. On the other hand there is a considerable extension in fatigue life, which depends on the <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> process and the applied stress amplitude. At high stress there is no appreciable effect while at low stress there is an order of magnitude life extension associated with CO 2 laser <b>paint</b> <b>stripping.</b> At moderate stresses, there is an up to sixfold life extension associated with the excimer laser processing...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} in <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> of a single-layer epoxy polyester hybrid coating from an aluminium substrate highly suitable for recycling process was reported. The feasibility of a diode laser source without any assistance of oxygen flow was checked {{and the best}} operative conditions were sought. Attention was first paid on the deposition of the polymeric film on aluminium substrates so as to perform the <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> process on coatings with the closest geometrical tolerances and dimensional accuracy. Then, a full factorial experimental design was led in order to study the influence of main process variables, that is, the interaction time, the power density, the focusing length, the absorption coefficient {{and the number of}} passes on the effectiveness of <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> expressed in terms of paint removal depth. Finally, several process maps were developed as a support in identifying the best way to lead the <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> process. Process characteristics, leading mechanisms and a simple regression linear model, easily applicable {{to a wide range of}} <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> contexts, were also discussed in detail.

40|$|<b>Paint</b> <b>stripping</b> {{from large}} steel ships and other {{metallic}} surfa ces {{is a major}} environmental safety, cost, and operational challenge in effectively and efficiently maintaining and refurbishing large structures. Environmental concerns are greatly limiting the possible options. As a result, a hybrid system composed of a waterjet with water recycling and robotic mobile manipulators with scanning bridges has become the leading form of <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> and was constructed by various manufacturers to address this need. The application of such scanning bridges is slow and their access is constrained by the complex shape of the ship hull and various features on the surface. To overcome these limitations, a robotic system that is called UltraStrip (UltraStrip Systems, Inc., Stuart, FL) is developed. This system uses magnetic wheels to attach the stripper to the structure and travel on it while performing <b>paint</b> <b>stripping.</b> To assure efficient <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> feedback data is required to control the travel speed by monitoring the paint thickness {{before and during the}} stripping process. Efforts at JPL are currently underway to develop the required feedback capability to assure effective <b>paint</b> <b>stripping.</b> Various possible sensors were considered and issues that can affect the sensitivity, reliability and applicability of the sensors are being investigated with emphasis on measuring the initial conditions of the paint.

40|$|A {{neural network}} {{approach}} {{is used to}} model a <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> process performed using a 1. 5 kW continuous diode laser source on an aluminum substrate coated with approximately 80 mu m of a hybrid epoxy-polyester resin. Two different coating colors, namely RAL 8087 (dark) and RAL 1013 (bright), are examined in order to analyze {{the influence of the}} difference in absorption of the laser energy by the surface on process. Experimental analysis was performed first in order to find the trend of <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> factor (PSF) according to leading process parameters such as laser power, scan speed, defocus length, and number of passes. A statistical approach is used to discuss the experimental data found. Two neural network models are investigated, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basic Function (RBF), with MLP being more reliable and effective in modeling experimental results. A sensitivity analysis on the MLP model is used to show the significance of all the input data employed. As a result of sensitivity analysis, a check between experimental and calculated trends for each investigated variable was performed, which revealed an appreciable fit between data displayed. Following this, a regression model to predict the trend of PSF according to laser fluence was developed. Finally, the regression model and the MLP model were compared and showed the high degree of accuracy of neural network solution in predicting the experimental results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|During the {{lifetime}} of aircraft structures, paint removal and re-application cycles are conducted to restore appearance and to enable inspection for fatigue cracks and corrosion damages. Current paint removals processes, including chemical and abrasive media blasting, yield large amounts of volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants, and generate large quantities of waste which require proper disposal/treatment. They also {{have the potential to}} mask surface cracks and decrease the effectiveness of Liquid Penetrant Inspections (LPI). This study compares current <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> methods to a novel Atmospheric Plasma (AP) system, which claims to be a more environmentally friendly method. Aluminium and steel coupons were prepared with military aircraft quality topcoat and primer paint schemes and subjected to the three aforemen-tioned <b>paint</b> <b>stripping</b> processes. The results were then characterized in terms of paint removal effectiveness, potential damages to the metallic substrates, and effect on the LPI process. Hardness and conductivity measurements as well as metallographic sectioning and microscopy, were used to characterize the stripped samples. The results indicated that AP had no negative ramifications on detecting fatigue cracks in the substrates, and did not alter the temper, mechanical properties of the aerospace alloys studied. The AP process has the potential to replace current hazardous and less environmentally friendly paint removal methods; though a full systematic qualification and evaluation process is still required for it to be considered as an accepted industrial paint removal process.

40|$|Rural {{highways}} {{are typically}} undivided, have high operating speeds, carry high traffic volumes {{and are often}} designed to minimum geometric standards. Head-on and cross-over-the-centreline crashes are of the most severe crash types that occur on rural highways. They are disproportionally represented in crashes resulting in fatalities, yet undivided rural highways provide no separation between opposing traffic lanes. One possible countermeasure to these crash types is a continuous narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strip.</b> Narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strips</b> are a relatively new and innovative road safety treatment aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of head-on and crossover-the-centreline crashes on undivided roads. This is achieved by increasing the separation between vehicles travelling in opposite directions and warning drivers that have strayed from their lane with noise and vibration inside the vehicle. Previous research suggests audio-tactile centreline-marking {{to be an effective}} countermeasure to these crash types however, the added benefit of combining audio-tactile line-marking with a narrow painted median has notbeen thoroughly evaluated. This research quantifies the safety benefit following installation of a 1. 0 m wide continuous <b>painted</b> median <b>strip</b> utilising audio-tactile line-marking on the Bruce Highway in Queensland, Australia. Data was analysed for a 56 km section of the highway before and after installation of the painted median. An Empirical Bayes statistical analysis procedure was used for evaluation due to the short period of before and after data available. This method accounts for the regression to the mean bias that is prevalent when short data collection periods are available or when sites with a higher than normal crash history are being analysed. Findings indicate significant reductions for all crash types that were analysed in this study. Head-on crashes were reduced by 75 % (SD = 7. 0 %), Run-off-road-left crashes were reduced by 59 % (SD = 14. 5 %) and Total crashes were reduced by 59 % (SD = 8. 8 %). The results of this study add to the limited body of knowledge that is published on narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strips</b> as a road safety treatment. The narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strip</b> provides significant safety benefits, by means of crash reduction, and has relatively low installation costs. These preliminary yet encouraging results give justification to the future consideration or implementation of a continuous narrow <b>painted</b> median <b>strip</b> as a road safety countermeasure. ...|$|R
