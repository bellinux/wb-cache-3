5|$|The Braves scored {{their fifth}} {{run in the}} eighth as Del Crandall hit a one-out triple and then scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Mantilla. Don Demeter <b>pinch</b> hit for Churn, the pitcher, in {{the bottom half of}} the inning but the Dodgers were put out in order. Sandy Koufax pitched the top of the ninth for the Dodgers and though he loaded the bases with three successive walks to Aaron, Torre, and DeMerit he did not allow any runs. Moon and Snider led off the bottom of the frame with successive singles. Bob Lillis <b>pinch</b> ran for Snider and Gil Hodges hit another single to load the bases. Don McMahon relieved Burdette, but allowed a fourth consecutive single to Norm Larker which scored Moon, Lillis, and advanced Hodges to third leaving the score 5–4. Warren Spahn relieved McMahon, Carl Furillo <b>pinch</b> hit for Roseboro, and Joe Pignatano <b>pinch</b> ran for Larker. Furillo tied the game, hitting a sacrifice fly which scored Hodges. Spahn allowed a single to Wills and was pulled in favor of Joey Jay. Ron Fairly grounded out as a <b>pinch</b> hitter and Gilliam flew out, leaving the game tied at five runs apiece and forcing extra innings.|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} evaluated <b>pinching</b> and spacing on Helianthus annuus in East Texas {{to determine}} their effects on growth and development. Experiment 1 was designed {{to determine the effects}} of <b>pinching</b> nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 on ‘Pro Cut Gold’ sunflowers. Results from experiment 1 showed non-pinched plants produced marketable stem lengths and flower sizes, while <b>pinched</b> plants’ stem length, stem diameter, flower diameter, and disk diameter decreased compared to the non-pinched plants. The objective for experiment 2 was to evaluate <b>pinching</b> and spacing treatments on ‘Pro Cut Gold’ sunflowers. All spacings for non-pinched plants in experiment 2 produced marketable stem lengths and flower sizes. Experiment 3 was designed to analyze the effects of <b>pinching</b> nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 on ‘Pro Cut Gold, ‘Supreme Sunbright’, ‘Vincents Choice’, ‘Sunrich Lemon’, and ‘Superior Gold’ sunflowers. All of the non-pinched plants for all five cultivars produced marketable stem lengths and flower sizes. <b>Pinching</b> responses varied by cultivar but overall stem length, stem diameter, flower diameter, and disk diameter all decreased compared to the non-pinched plants. ‘Vincents Choice’ <b>pinched</b> at the first node was the only cultivar when <b>pinched</b> to produce a marketable stem length and flower size. A successful <b>pinching</b> in East Texas is dependent on planting early into the growing season (May). Spacing did not clearly affect sunflower growth and development; therefore, increasing planting densities of non-pinched sunflowers could increase marketable stem yield compared to <b>pinching</b> sunflowers at lower planting densities...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pinching</b> (also called [...] "FIMing") {{is similar}} to topping in that it causes lower {{branches}} to grow more rapidly, but the apical meristem maintain apical dominance, which is especially useful if the plant has already been topped. <b>Pinching</b> is performed by firmly <b>pinching</b> the apical meristem(s) so as to substantially damage vascular and structural cells but without totally breaking the stem. This causes lower limbs to grow more rapidly while the <b>pinched</b> tissue heals, after which time the stem resumes apical dominance.|$|R

5|$|Collins played {{minor league}} {{baseball}} for the Joplin Miners until 1919, when he signed with the St. Louis Browns. After spending six seasons with the organization, Collins spent a one-year sojourn {{in the minor leagues}} before he was traded to the New York Yankees, where he spent the next three years and played in the famous 1927 Murderers' Row lineup. At the conclusion of the 1928 season, he was traded to the Boston Braves, with whom he played his last game on May 23, 1929.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of a rod {{embedded in}} a matrix undergoing <b>pinching</b> by interfacial-energy-driven bulk diffusion is determined near the point of <b>pinching.</b> We find a self-similar solution that gives a unique temporal power law and interfacial shape prior to <b>pinching</b> and self-similar solutions after <b>pinching.</b> The theory is compared to experiments that employ in situ four-dimensional X-ray tomographic microscopy for rods of liquid or solid <b>pinching</b> by solute diffusion in the high-diffusivity liquid phase. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory confirms that the interfacial morphology near the singularity is universal {{both before and after}} pinching; the shape holds regardless of the material system and initial condition. This also implies that the predictions of the time-dependence of the process can be used to determine the time to <b>pinching</b> {{for a wide variety of}} physical systems, and thus provide estimates of the time required for capillarity-driven break-up of microstructures from the detachment of secondary dendrite arms to polymer blends...|$|R
5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a <b>pinch</b> of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a <b>pinch</b> of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E
5|$|Walls' double {{continued}} his {{success as a}} <b>pinch</b> hitter, making him 13-for-26 with 12 runs batted in in such situations for the season. Don Larsen entered to relieve O'Dell, who had not recorded an out but had earned a blown save for his performance. Maury Wills hit a ground ball to the first baseman, who threw home {{in an attempt to}} put out Walls who slid hard into the Giants' catcher Haller. The slide, which cut Haller's arm deep enough to later require six stitches, caused him to drop the ball, leaving Walls safe on Haller's error and extending the Dodgers' lead to 7–5. John Orsino entered as the new catcher to replace the injured Haller. Wills then stole second, his 101st stolen base of the season, before the batter Gilliam saw a single pitch. Orsino's throw to try to catch Wills went past second base and into center field. Wills attempted to advance to third, but was thrown out by Willie Mays. Larsen then induced a flyball out by Gilliam and the inning was over. Between the two halves of the sixth the two teams had scored a combined 11 runs and used six pitchers, three <b>pinch</b> hitters, two defensive replacements, and a <b>pinch</b> runner.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>pinch</b> hitter, Caballero {{came through}} with hits in clutch situations, notably against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 30. Behind 6–3 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the Phillies sent Caballero {{to the plate}} to <b>pinch</b> hit {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. He led off the inning with a single, scoring the first run of a seesaw come-from-behind rally that ended with a 9–8 Phillies victory, closer Jim Konstanty's 13th of the season. Caballero {{displayed}} his running skills again in September, replacing Goliat in the ninth inning of another game against the Cardinals, and scoring a late-inning run in place of Lopata against the Cincinnati Reds several days later to tie a close game that the Phillies eventually lost in 18 innings. On September 26, Caballero scored another crucial run against the Boston Braves when he pinch-ran for outfielder Dick Sisler. Waiting on third base after advancing from first on a Del Ennis single to center field, Jones hit a high ground ball to Boston shortstop Sibby Sisti, who booted the ball and allowed Caballero to score the game-tying run; the Phillies won, 8–7.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we show that}} all of the Eschenburg spaces of {{positive}} curvature have their <b>pinching</b> bounded above by 137 in a one parameter family of positively curved metrics. Since the Aloff-Wallach spaces are the homogeneous Eschenburg spaces and since Püttmann has calculated the <b>pinching</b> of W 1, 1 =SU 3 /S 11, 1 in the U(2) biinvariant metric to be exactly 137 this upper bound is sharp. It is also shown that the only Eschenburg space with <b>pinching</b> exactly 137 is W 1, 1. In addition, using a Cheeger construction, we enlarge the known metrics of positive curvature on the Eschenburg spaces to a simple explicit four parameter family. ^ In order to calculate exact <b>pinching</b> constants, we designed a self-checking numerical algorithm for computing extreme sectional curvatures which applies to any Riemannian manifold.
