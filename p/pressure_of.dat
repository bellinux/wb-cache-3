At a depth of 3,000meters, the barometric <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Patricia set {{multiple}} {{records for}} maximum strength, rate of intensification, {{and rate of}} weakening throughout its relatively short existence. With maximum sustained winds of 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere. In terms of central pressure, {{it is also the}} second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, just shy of Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). Patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone, surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. The magnitude of Patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00–06:00UTC October22–23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85mph (140km/h) to 205mph (335km/h), a record increase of 120mph (195km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95mbar (hPa; 2.81inHg).
