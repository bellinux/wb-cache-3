5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} major life stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>environment</b> or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E

2500|$|Otolith and {{vertebrae}} {{studies have}} proved useful {{in determining the}} age and thus growth patterns of the species, with other methods including scale and fin ray sectioning having lesser value. The species otoliths {{have been the subject}} of detailed X-ray diffraction studies, which have indicated biomineralisation of the otoliths occurs predominantly in the aragonite phase. Females grow faster than males, reaching 266.5mm after their first year of life, 364.4 after their second, 370.9mm after the third and 546.7 after their fifth. A female of 676.6mm was 9 years old. Males reach 252.4mm in their first year, 336.2mm in their second, 363.8 in the third and 510.3 in their fifth. A male of 554mm was eight years old. The oldest studied individual was a 934-mm individual of unspecified sex, which was 17 years old. The larvae are pelagic and are found over continental shelf waters and occasionally in the oceanic zone proximal to the continental slope. They are present all year round in the Gulf of Mexico, with a peak in abundance during the summer months due to spawning peaks. While the young juveniles live in the exposed <b>pelagic</b> <b>environment,</b> they use a behaviour called 'piloting' to [...] swim in very close proximity to both larger animals and floating objects, such as sargassum mats, buoys and even boats. By the time juveniles make their way to shore, they may have been dispersed large distances from their initial spawning grounds and may face the challenge of migration to warmer climates during winter if they are to survive as outlined previously. Juveniles use estuaries and seagrass beds as their main nursery habitats.|$|E

40|$|Fish {{aggregation}} {{is important}} in terms of biology, fisheries, and measurement, quantitative analyses of gregarious movement behaviors remain relatively rare (Turchin 1989).

50|$|After {{the eggs}} {{have been laid}} by the female flounder, larvae take four to five days to hatch when reared in {{controlled}} conditions, at 15 °C, in the laboratory. The embryo has a small yolk which feeds the larva as it drifts with the tide from a <b>pelagic</b> <b>environment,</b> towards the shallow and sheltered mud/sand flats along the coastline. Because the yolk cannot sustain the larva for very long, adult flounder try to breed {{in areas that are}} as close to the coastline as possible, whilst maintaining the right conditions for spawning. This reduces {{the amount of time that}} the larva spends feeding itself when drifting with the tides and ensures that the maximum number of offspring reach the inshore waters.|$|E
50|$|Carolowilhelmina geognostica is an extinct arthrodire placoderm {{fish that}} lived in the Late Eifelian epoch (of Middle Devonian) of Spain. In life, C. geognostica was a long-snouted pelagic fish, superficially similar to the Australian Rolfosteus, from Gogo Formation and the European Oxyosteus of the Kellwasser facies of Bad Wildungen, Germany. As with Rolfosteus, Carolowilhelmina possessed a long tubular rostral plate, with small postnasal plates and low inferognathal plates. According to Mark-Kurik & Carls (2002), this placoderm may have lived in an <b>pelagic</b> <b>environment</b> with lush, {{floating}} algae and epiplankton. It is currently known only from an incomplete cranium that is about 40 cm long. The fossil material is housed in the Palaeontological Museum of the University of Zaragoza, Spain (Museo Paleontológico de la Universidad de Zaragoza).|$|E
50|$|Only about 2% {{of known}} marine species inhabit the <b>pelagic</b> <b>environment.</b> This {{means that they}} live in the water column as opposed to the benthic organisms that live in or on the sea floor. Deep-sea organisms {{generally}} inhabit bathypelagic (1000-4000m deep) and abyssopelagic (4000-6000m deep) zones. However, characteristics of deep-sea organisms, such as bioluminescence {{can be seen in the}} mesopelagic (200-1000m deep) zone as well. The mesopelagic zone is the disphotic zone, meaning light there is minimal but still measurable. The oxygen minimum layer exists somewhere between a depth of 700m and 1000m deep depending on the place in the ocean. This area is also where nutrients are most abundant. The bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones are aphotic, meaning that no light penetrates this area of the ocean. These zones make up about 75% of the inhabitable ocean space.|$|E
5000|$|It {{might seem}} that the {{prominent}} stripes {{on the back of}} mackerels are there to provide camouflage against broken backgrounds. That is not the case, because mackerel live in midwater <b>pelagic</b> <b>environments</b> which have no background. [...] However, fish have an optokinetic reflex in their visual systems which can be sensitive to moving stripes. In order for fish to school efficiently, they need feedback mechanisms that help them align themselves with adjacent fish, and match their speed. The stripes on neighbouring fish provide [...] "schooling marks" [...] which signal changes in relative position.|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that viruses can control bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) in marine <b>pelagic</b> <b>environments.</b> In the Bay of Villefranche, Northwestern Mediterranean, three experiments were conducted on different months to determine bacterial and viral variables in seawater cultures. In December, phosphorus (P) addition enhanced bacterial growth 6 – 9 -fold with concomitant increase in viral production (4 – 15 -fold), but little enhancement of bacterial respiration (BR). In other months, P enrichment increased BR 2 – 6 -fold and viral production 2 – 5 -fold, but did not increase in bacterial abundance (Aug, Feb) or growth (Feb). BGE depended on the fraction of bacterial production destroyed by viruses (shunting efficiency, v; i. e., when v was low, nutrient enrichment enhanced BGE, whereas when v was high, nutrient enrichment mainly led to low BGE). Viral production and bacterial production and respiration in the Western North Pacific and other data from the literature showed that BGE was negatively correlated with shunting efficiency. Predictions from a carbon flow model {{were consistent with the}} above results showing that decreased BGE over a broad range of values (from 0. 7 to 0. 001) could be largely explained by viral-induced conversion of bacterial biomass to dissolved organic carbon.

50|$|Due to {{the poor}} level of {{photosynthetic}} light reaching deep-sea environments, most fish need to rely on organic matter sinking from higher levels, or, in rare cases, hydrothermal vents for nutrients. This makes the deep-sea much poorer in productivity than shallower regions. Also, animals in the <b>pelagic</b> <b>environment</b> are sparse and food doesn’t come along frequently. Because of this, organisms need adaptations {{that allow them to}} survive. Some have long feelers to help them locate prey or attract mates in the pitch black of the deep ocean. The deep-sea angler fish in particular has a long fishing-rod-like adaptation protruding from its face, on the end of which is a bioluminescent piece of skin that wriggles like a worm to lure its prey. Some must consume other fish that are the same size or larger than them and they need adaptations to help digest them efficiently. Great sharp teeth, hinged jaws, disproportionately large mouths, and expandable bodies {{are a few of the}} characteristics that deep-sea fishes have for this purpose. The gulper eel is one example of an organism that displays these characteristics.|$|E
