5|$|Still {{separated}} from Carmela, Tony is living at his parents' house. Carmela, now the sole authority {{figure in the}} home, becomes frustrated as her rules lead A.J. to resent her; eventually she allows him {{to live with his}} father. She has a brief relationship with Robert Wegler, A.J.'s guidance counselor; he breaks it off abruptly when he suspects that she is manipulating him to improve A.J.'s grades. Tony and Carmela reconcile; Tony <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more loyal and agrees to pay for a piece of real estate Carmela wishes to develop.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects. The theory <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space {{in addition to the}} usual three. In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|After the 1903 {{destruction}} of the original wooden bridge at Belvidere, plans to construct another bridge started immediately. After the storm, the substructure of the crossing had survived the strong storm. The bridge corporation set a completion date, August 17, 1904, which was {{the day that the}} Farmer's Picnic was held in Belvidere. However, the contractor of which they hired to reconstruct the bridge, the New Jersey Bridge Company of Manasquan, New Jersey, believed that the new bridge would need new abutments and piers to be completed by that time, instead of using the old wooden bridge's piers. The three piers from the wooden bridge were used, and would require them to be heightened to be above any high flood waters. On June 3, 1904, the bridge construction began on a barge in the river, with <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> complete by the set date of August 17. On August 17, the bridge was not complete, but usable, that when the Farmer's Picnic (the predecessor to the Warren County Fair, occurred, people were allowed to cross a majority of the bridge. The picnic itself was a complete success, attracting over 15,000 people, most of which walked the bridge.|$|E
5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E

25|$|In 1882 an American {{businessman}} {{spread the}} tabular {{form of the}} twelve promises throughout the world, in 238 languages. In 1890 Cardinal Adolph Perraud deplored this circulation of the promises in tabular form, which he said were different from the words {{and the meaning of}} the expressions used by Saint Margaret Mary, and wanted the <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> published in their original words.|$|E
25|$|Antonina, in remorse, {{tells the}} emperor that her {{testimony}} against Belisarius was false. Irene approaches {{with news of}} the victory and informs Antonina that Alamiro is her son, {{and that it was}} the slave, not Belisarius, who had planned his death. Meanwhile, the blind Belisarius has led the Byzantine army and defeated the Alanni, who had threatened Byzantium, but an arrow has mortally wounded him. He is carried in dying, and the sorrowing emperor <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a father to Alamiro and Irene.|$|E

In the end, one of these children, Ellie Waters, saves Earth from the godlike Marduk entity, preventing the Apocalypse and reordering reality as if the Marduk crisis had never happened (though Ellie alone apparently retains her memories of these events). The Surfer resumes his interstellar wanderings, but <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready to aid his adopted homeworld should Earth ever need him.|$|E

25|$|The Deccan plateau is {{very rich}} in {{minerals}} and precious stones. The plateau’s mineral wealth led many lowland rulers, {{including those of}} the Mauryan (4th–2nd century BCE) and Gupta (4th–6th century CE) dynasties, to fight over it. Major minerals found here include coal, iron ore, asbestos, chromite, mica, and kyanite. Since March 2011, large deposits of uranium have been discovered in the Tummalapalle belt and in the Bhima basin at Gogi in Karnataka. The Tummalapalle belt uranium reserve <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the top 20uranium reserve discoveries of the world.|$|E
25|$|A single-wicket {{match was}} {{played on the}} New Ground, Godalming, between Julius Caesar, a lad of 16 years of age, of the Godalming Cricket Club, and Mr C Coomber, of Eashing. Caesar went in first and {{obtained}} five which, with one wide, made six. Coomber fetched three runs which, with three wides, made six. Caesar for his second innings got 49, and wides three, making a total with the first of 58. Coomber followed and, after 35 balls were delivered, obtained no run and scored only one wide, leaving Caesar the winner by 51. The lad <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{as noted in the}} game of cricket as his ancient namesake was in the art of war.

25|$|The station's forebuildings {{were opened}} to {{passengers}} without any formal ceremony on 17 January 1904, although {{next day the}} Evening News reported that the platforms were still {{in a state of}} chaos and these were not expected to be ready for another nine months. However it did consider that ‘the result <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the provision for Nottingham {{of one of the most}} commodious and most convenient passenger stations in the country’. The day began with the closure of the booking offices in the old station after the last tickets were issued for the 5:25am London train and the new booking offices were opened in time to issue tickets for the 6:25am Erewash Valley train. No attempt was made to exclude the public from the building and many took the opportunity to view the new station buildings. The Evening News commented on the public’s admiration of the style and elegance of the station approaches and booking hall and went on to describe the day’s events.|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of Crime and Punishment {{published}} in the January and February issues of The Russian Messenger met with public success. Although the remaining parts of the novel had still to be written, an anonymous reviewer wrote that [...] "the novel <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the most}} important works of the author of The House of the Dead". In his memoirs, the conservative belletrist Nikolay Strakhov recalled that in Russia Crime and Punishment was the literary sensation of 1866.|$|E
500|$|Family matters {{also made}} Priestley's time in America difficult. His {{youngest}} son Harry died on December 11, 1795, probably of malaria. Mary Priestley died on September 17, 1796; {{she was already}} ill and never fully recovered after the shock of her son's death. On September 19 of that year Joseph wrote: [...] "This day I bury my wife....she had taken much thought in planning the new house and {{now that it is}} far advanced and <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> everything she wished, she is removed to another." [...] After dinner on Monday 14 April 1800, various members of Priestley's household fell ill, with symptoms of food poisoning, which prompted the Reading Advertiser to falsely accuse Priestley's son William, of trying to poison them with arsenic.|$|E

5000|$|Consideration is {{executory}} when a <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> {{do something}} {{in the future is}} given in exchange for another <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done in the future. Consideration is executed when a promise is actually executed, in exchange for another <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed in the future. Consideration is past when a promise has been given or executed before and independently of the other promise. For example, I <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> take you to lunch, and then when we got there I said [...] "you must pay, because I have given you the benefit of my company". This is past consideration and therefore NO consideration.|$|R
500|$|Described as Andrew Schwab's opus {{the record}} <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fresh {{take on the}} P86 sound. Schwab said, [...] "On this record I was really {{able to take the}} reins of the {{creative}} process in a direction I was passionate about. I was able to write songs that pushed me to grow as an artist. It was also insanely fun to have so many of my friends involved in the process and {{at this point in the}} game that is what its about. I am really looking forward to people hearing this album." [...] With concert goers noting the new energy of the songs and new band members Scott Davis on drums, Dustinn Lowry on guitar and Mikee [...] "Norman" [...] Williams on bass it seems P86 has benefited from a back to basics reinvention.|$|E

Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter found it promising because [...] "it is reminiscent of better-of-the-sexes charm". USA Todays Robert Bianco said, [...] "what Abrams brings to Fringe is a director's eye for plot and pace, a fan's love of sci-fi excitement, and a story-teller's gift for investing absurd events with real emotions and relatable characters." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN gave the pilot 7.6 out of 10, calling it [...] "a lackluster pilot that <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a pretty good series". Tim Goodman of San Francisco Chronicle remarked that despite [...] "some flaws in it—mostly from a clash of tones—it still overdelivers on creativity, creepiness, fine acting and burgeoning character development". Chicago Sun-Times Misha Davenport called it an [...] "update of The X-Files {{with the addition of}} terrorism and the office of Homeland Security.|$|E
