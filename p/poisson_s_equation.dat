40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigations into flow boiling heat transfer in an asymmetrically heated vertical minichannel of 1. 7 mm depth. The heated element for FC- 72 flowing in the minichannel was an alloy plate 0. 45 mm thick, microstructured on one side, in direct contact with the flowing fluid. The computational part of the study contains approximate steady state solutions of the heat transfer problems described by <b>Poisson.</b> <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> and the energy equation for the heated plate and the fluid, respectively. For both equations, the boundary conditions were specified on the basis of experimental data. Temperature of the outer plate surface, measured by infrared thermography, and heat losses to ambient air were included in the calculations. For the energy equation we assumed parabolic profile of fluid velocity and the equality of temperatures and heat fluxes at the interface between the heated surface and the fluid. The void fraction was taken from a single-phase flow model. Two-dimensional temperature distributions were obtained by the Trefftz method and, due to the Robin condition at the interface between them, it was possible to calculate the heat transfer coefficient. Its values were compared to those obtained by other correlations known from literature...|$|E

Owing to the nonlinearity of MOND 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Poisson</b> <b>equation,</b> beyond tidal effects, the internal dynamics of clusters {{is affected by}} the external field in which they are immersed. For the studied clusters, particle accelerations are much lower than the critical acceleration a of MOND, but the motion of stars is neither dominated by internal accelerations (a a) nor external accelerations (a a). We use the N-body code N-MODY in our analysis, which is a particle-mesh-based code with a numerical MOND potential solver developed by Ciotti et al. (2006, ApJ, 640, 741) to derive the line-of-sight velocity dispersion by adding the external field effect. We show that Newtonian dynamics predicts a low-velocity dispersion for each cluster, while in modified Newtonian dynamics the velocity dispersion is much higher. We calculate the minimum number of measured stars necessary to distinguish between Newtonian gravity and MOND with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We also show that for most clusters it is necessary to measure the velocities of between 30 to 80 stars to distinguish between both cases. Therefore the observational measurement of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of these clusters will provide a test for MOND...|$|R

40|$|In 1958, Preucil {{suggested}} an equation to calculate ink trap based on measurements of a printed sheet with a densitometer. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> {{was based on}} the additivity rule and the proportional rule. However, these rules do not hold in all cases. Several alternative equations have been suggested. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of three ink trap equations using densitometry by means of comparing the calculated values to those measured by the gravimetric method. An attempt is also made to estimate the value of maximum printable density, Dm, in Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The theoretical basis of each equation is briefly introduced. The causes attributing to the failure of additivity and proportionality are discussed as well. Also reviewed are several methods for measuring ink trap, such as colorimetric, spectrophotometric, and magnetic methods, and factors involved in the efficiency of ink trapping. In the experiment, two newsprint and one coated paper were printed with cyan, magenta, and yellow ink in a simulated wet-on-wet condition on the IGT printability tester. Each ink had a specific tack. The second-down inks were transferred on the first ink layers with low, medium, and high thickness. The percent ink trapping on printed strips were then calculated by both the densitometric methods and the gravimetric method. The factors causing poor trapping and back-trap in the experiment are discussed. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> was found to correspond better with gravimetric trap values than Brunner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> However, both under estimated ink trap in the majority of the tested conditions. As the ink trap measured gravimetrically increased, the discrepancy of ink trap calculated by Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> increased. This applied to Brunner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> as well, but not obviously to Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> proved to reduce the differences between gravimetric ink trap and densitometric ink trap significantly. A Dm value of 1. 59 for newsprint A, 1. 99 for newsprint B, and 2. 5 for coated paper resulted in the greatest accuracy over the conditions tested. When the Dm value approaches infinity, Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> becomes the equivalent of Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The experiment suggests that a range of Dm values between 1. 5 and 2. 5 was suitable for the tested conditions. For future research, a larger selection of various types of papers and inks are needed to specify a Dm value for general conditions. It might also be useful to specify a theoretical maximum printable density for general conditions, with which the maximum printable density of a given paper can be compared. Thus, the reproduction quality of the paper can be predicted before the printing is conducted. Since the effects of back-trap and ink contamination influence the accuracy of Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> in this experiment, studies for compensating this inaccuracy are suggested...|$|R

Recent experimental data suggests that the non-linearity is not only caused by matrix cracking but also by matrix plasticity due to shear stresses. To capture the effects of those two mechanisms, a model combining a plasticity formulation with continuum damage has been developed to simulate the non-linear response of laminates under plane stress states. The model is {{used to compare the}} predicted behavior of various laminate lay-ups to experimental data from the literature by looking at the degradation of axial modulus and <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> ratio of the laminates.

40|$|Spray-on foam {{insulation}} {{is applied to}} the exterior of the Space Shuttle s External Tank to limit propellant boil-off and to prevent ice formation. The Space Shuttle foams are rigid closed-cell polyurethane foams. The two foams used most extensively on the Space Shuttle External Tank are BX- 265 and NCFI 24 - 124. Since the catastrophic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, numerous studies have been conducted to mitigate the likelihood and the severity of foam shedding during the Shuttle s ascent to space. Due to the foaming and rising process, the foam microstructures are elongated in the rise direction. As a result, these two foams exhibit a non-isotropic mechanical behavior. In this paper, a detailed microstructural characterization of the two foams is presented. The key features of the foam cells are summarized and the average cell dimensions in the two foams are compared. Experimental studies to measure the room temperature mechanical response of the two foams in the two principal material directions (parallel to the rise and perpendicular to the rise) are also reported. The measured elastic modulus, proportional limit stress, ultimate tensile stress and the <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> ratios for the two foams are compared. The generalized elongated Kelvin foam model previously developed by the authors is reviewed and the equations which result from this model are presented. The resulting equations show that the ratio of the elastic modulus in the rise direction to that in the perpendicular-to-rise direction as well as the ratio of the strengths in the two material directions is only a function of the microstructural dimensions. Using the measured microstructural dimensions and the measured stiffness ratio, the foam tensile strength ratio and <b>Poisson</b> <b>s</b> ratios are predicted for both foams.

Stability and superconvergence error results are proved for the method, which are then confirmed through numerical results.

40|$|A full-wave {{approach}} has been developed to study the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation in stratified media with nonuniform boundaries and varying electromagnetic parameters (Bahar, 1972 a, b). By expanding the electromagnetic field vectors E and H using the generalized Fourier Transforms and imposing the exact boundary conditions at the irregular boundary, Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> are converted into the generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> for the forward and backward traveling wave amplitudes. The generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> have been solved for the radiation fields scattered from rough surfaces using iterative approaches for the single scatter and the double-scatter. ^ A numerical method is developed in this dissertation to solve the generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> for the diffuse scattered radiation fields from one-dimensional rough surfaces. The full-wave numerical solution includes both single scatter and all the higher-order multiple scatters. Using this approach, the coupled generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> are first combined into a single integro-differential equation for the forward and backward wave amplitudes on applying the analytical properties of the basis functions and the scattering coefficients. Then, the primary (unperturbed) field components are subtracted from the total fields. The rapidly varying phase components of the wave amplitudes are factored out. The singularities in the scattering coefficients are removed through integration by parts. Thus, the integro-differential equation is converted into an integral equation for the diffuse scattered wave magnitudes which depend on the wave vector variable only. Finally, the continuous wave vector variables are discretized and the integral equation is converted into a matrix equation (moment method). The wave magnitudes are determined by solving the matrix equation. The far field vectors at a remote observation point are obtained from the field transformation using the steepest descent approach. ^ The full-wave numerical solution for the diffuse scattered radiation fields is applied to both deterministic rough surfaces with known profile and random rough surfaces with known statistics. The Monte-Carlo technique is used to simulate random rough surfaces. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} diffuse scattered radiation fields can be approximated using the single scatter iterative solutions when the maximum rough surface slope is less than 35 degrees. ...|$|R
