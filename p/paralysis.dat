5|$|The {{likelihood}} of developing paralytic polio increases with age, {{as does the}} extent of <b>paralysis.</b> In children, nonparalytic meningitis {{is the most likely}} consequence of CNS involvement, and <b>paralysis</b> occurs in only one in 1000 cases. In adults, <b>paralysis</b> occurs in one in 75 cases. In children under five years of age, <b>paralysis</b> of one leg is most common; in adults, extensive <b>paralysis</b> of the chest and abdomen also affecting all four limbs—quadriplegia—is more likely. <b>Paralysis</b> rates also vary depending on the serotype of the infecting poliovirus; the highest rates of <b>paralysis</b> (one in 200) are associated with poliovirus type 1, the lowest rates (one in 2,000) are associated with type 2.|$|E
5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} <b>paralysis</b> was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic <b>paralysis.</b> The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic <b>paralysis</b> was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to <b>paralysis</b> of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in <b>paralysis</b> can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following <b>paralysis</b> but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and <b>paralysis.</b> Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid <b>paralysis,</b> starting with ptosis and <b>paralysis</b> of voluntary muscles. <b>Paralysis</b> of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Complications of {{spinal cord}} {{injuries}} include pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, neurogenic shock, and <b>paralysis</b> below the injury site.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, <b>paralysis</b> will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute <b>paralysis</b> and residual <b>paralysis</b> is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg <b>paralysis,</b> loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in <b>paralysis</b> can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following <b>paralysis</b> but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|TPP is {{distinguished}} from {{other forms of}} periodic <b>paralysis</b> (especially hypokalemic periodic <b>paralysis)</b> with thyroid function tests on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in thyrotoxicosis the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland. Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular <b>paralysis</b> with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular <b>paralysis</b> as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and <b>paralysis</b> of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to <b>paralysis</b> of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Botulism, {{acquired}} by eating infected fish, {{can lead to}} <b>paralysis</b> and drowning. Aspergillosis is another cause of emaciation and death. Outbreaks sometimes lead to thousands of deaths.|$|E
5|$|Bowling {{also studied}} genetic {{conditions}} in other horse breeds, including hyperkalemic periodic <b>paralysis</b> (HYPP) in the American Quarter Horse. In 1996, her research {{found that the}} origin of this genetically dominant disorder traced to a single stallion, later identified publicly as Impressive.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to <b>paralysis</b> of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to <b>paralysis</b> {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 an English doctor, James Parkinson, {{published}} his essay reporting six cases of <b>paralysis</b> agitans. An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, <b>paralysis</b> and diminished muscle strength, {{and the way}} that the disease progresses over time. Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|In June 1835, Friedrich {{suffered}} {{his first}} stroke, which {{left him with}} minor limb <b>paralysis</b> and greatly reduced his ability to paint. As a result, {{he was unable to}} work in oil; instead he was limited to watercolour, sepia and reworking older compositions.|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, {{he is an}} amateur painter and a {{practitioner}} of Ashtanga yoga. From a young age to his early forties, Daniels suffered from sleep <b>paralysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In season two of British drama Downton Abbey, Lavinia Swire dies of the Spanish flu in April 1919, {{after her}} fiancé Matthew Crawley recovers from {{injuries}} and temporary <b>paralysis</b> from the Great War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1825, White was en route {{to serve on the}} court of Loudoun County and stayed the night at a tavern along the Shenandoah River. He was {{discovered}} by the proprietor the following morning suffering with <b>paralysis.</b> White remained stricken with <b>paralysis</b> for several weeks and returned to his home in Winchester on a litter. His position as judge of the tenth judicial district was assumed by two judges: William Brockinbough and John Scott. White remained paralyzed for the remainder of his life. On July 1, 1825, White gave power of attorney to his son, John Baker White, for the management of his affairs. White later died at his residence in Winchester on March 9, 1831.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{poliomyelitis}} result in only temporary <b>paralysis.</b> Nerve impulses {{return to the}} formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six to eight months. The neurophysiological processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost. <b>Paralysis</b> remaining after one year {{is likely to be}} permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause <b>paralysis</b> leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular <b>paralysis</b> and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{poliomyelitis}} may be clinically suspected {{in individuals}} experiencing acute onset of flaccid <b>paralysis</b> {{in one or}} more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian <b>paralysis</b> tick, are also {{intrinsically}} venomous {{and can cause}} tick <b>paralysis.</b> Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E
5|$|The {{juice or}} liquid {{extracts}} are smeared {{on the head}} of the arrow, and inflicts the target <b>paralysis,</b> convulsions and/or cardiac arrest, virtually on strike due to the speed in which the extracts can affect a victim.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have survived the {{infectious}} disease poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis (often simply called polio) is an acute viral infection that involves the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the central nervous system. Poliovirus is acquired by faecal-oral or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, infection was common, with epidemics during the summer and autumn of temperate countries. An eradication programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are asymptomatic; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in acute flaccid <b>paralysis.</b> The extent of <b>paralysis</b> varies from part of a limb to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. The latter was often treated with an iron lung until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to post-polio syndrome. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and <b>paralysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ticks are parasitic, {{and some}} {{transmit}} micro-organisms and parasites {{that can cause}} diseases in humans, while the saliva of a few species can directly cause tick <b>paralysis</b> {{if they are not}} removed within a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of the hypokalemia, {{followed}} by correction of the hyperthyroidism, leads to complete {{resolution of the}} attacks. It occurs predominantly in males of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent. TPP {{is one of several}} conditions that can cause periodic <b>paralysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee <b>paralysis</b> virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E
5|$|At Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy grows {{jealous of}} Tyrion after his {{favorite}} prostitute Ros taunts {{him with the}} judgment that Tyrion is a better lover and from a richer family. Meanwhile, Bran is depressed over his <b>paralysis</b> {{and the fact that}} his mother left him while he was in a coma. To cheer him up, Maester Luwin decides to teach Bran the Dothraki art of horseback archery.|$|E
5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on {{what part of the}} dog's back is affected; they can include <b>paralysis</b> with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. <b>Paralysis</b> generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia, a {{deficiency}} of potassium in the plasma, {{can be fatal}} if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea), and increased renal loss (diuresis). Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory <b>paralysis,</b> alkalosis, and cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
5|$|Images of trench warfare became iconic {{symbols of}} human {{suffering}} and endurance. The post-war world had many veterans who were maimed or damaged by shell shock. In 1921 1,187,450 men were in receipt of pensions for war disabilities, with a fifth of these having suffered serious loss of limbs or eyesight, <b>paralysis</b> or lunacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1820, Isaac Shelby was {{stricken}} with <b>paralysis</b> {{in his right}} arm and leg. He died of a stroke on July 18, 1826, {{at his home in}} Lincoln County. He was buried on the grounds of his estate, Traveller's Rest. The state erected a monument over his grave in 1827. In 1952 the Shelby family cemetery was given to the state government and became the Isaac Shelby Cemetery State Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{at the age}} of 20, he {{was sent}} to the frontline, where he took {{photographs}} of life in the trenches with a lightweight camera (a Goerz Tenax). Most of these photographs were destroyed during the violence of the Hungarian Revolution of 1919. Wounded in 1915 by a bullet, Kertész suffered temporary <b>paralysis</b> of his left arm.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, a young Davis had {{appeared}} as a National Foundation for Infantile <b>Paralysis</b> volunteer in a memorable short subject shown in movie theaters to raise donations for the crusade against polio. The Crippler featured a sinister figure spreading over playgrounds and farms, laughing over its victims, until finally dispelled by the volunteer. It was very effective in raising contributions.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these physiological processes, the body possesses a number of compensatory mechanisms to maintain function {{in the presence of}} residual <b>paralysis.</b> These include the use of weaker muscles at a higher than usual intensity relative to the muscle's maximal capacity, enhancing athletic development of previously little-used muscles, and using ligaments for stability, which enables greater mobility.|$|E
