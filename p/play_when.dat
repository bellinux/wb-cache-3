5|$|After missing four games, Croyle {{returned}} to start against the Tennessee Titans in Week 7. He was injured on Kansas City's 14th <b>play</b> <b>when</b> he was sandwiched between two rushing defenders while throwing a pass {{early in the}} second quarter. He limped off the field. He slammed his helmet to the turf once he reached the sideline, then hobbled down a tunnel. After the game, Chiefs head coach Herman Edwards announced that Croyle would miss the remainder of the 2008 season.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the bout, the {{contestant}} {{with the}} higher score wins and either retains the Money Chair or replaces its current occupant. If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker question is asked; the contestant who locks in the correct answer first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in <b>play</b> <b>when</b> the clock runs out, it is completed under the normal rules.|$|E

5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, {{he would}} first compose on a {{synthesizer}} before working with programmers {{to get it}} in the game. His personal pieces <b>play</b> <b>when</b> the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it {{was not included in the}} game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E

5|$|Nash's {{football}} career {{continued to}} soar as several Victorian Football League clubs sought to recruit Laurie and Robert Junior. South Melbourne, partly through its connection to Roy Cazaly and partly through its offer to Nash of an unprecedented £3 per match, accommodation {{and a job}} in a sports store, eventually won the battle for the Nash brothers' signatures for the 1933 VFL season. Such was the interest in Melbourne in where Nash would <b>play,</b> <b>when</b> South Melbourne committee member Joe Scanlan travelled to Tasmania to sign Nash, he was smuggled aboard the steamer to avoid media attention.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, {{in a joint}} {{press conference}} on the Big Ten Network, Glenn Robinson III and Nik Stauskas {{announced}} that they were declaring themselves eligible for the 2014 NBA draft. On April 25, Mitch McGary declared for the draft. He was facing a season-long NCAA suspension after testing positive for marijuana after the Wolverines' NCAA tournament win over Tennessee, a game for which he dressed but {{was not able to}} <b>play.</b> <b>When</b> all three players were drafted, it marked the first time Michigan had at least three draft picks since the 1990 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|Puccini saw Sardou's <b>play</b> <b>when</b> it was touring Italy in 1889 and, {{after some}} vacillation, {{obtained}} {{the rights to}} turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered {{at a time of}} unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.|$|E

5|$|Rugby {{has played}} {{a big part in}} the life of the school, despite only supplanting {{football}} as the school's primary sport in 1921. All boys are encouraged to <b>play</b> <b>when</b> they enter Lower Grammar but are not required to play throughout their time at the school. Stonyhurst has a successful rugby season, with games well supported by pupils, staff and parents. Sporting rivalry is particularly prominent against fellow Catholic independent schools Ampleforth College and Mount St Mary's College and Sedbergh School in Cumbria. The Stonyhurst Sevens take place annually, attracting large crowds and teams from all over the country.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at <b>play</b> <b>when</b> a person develops atherosclerosis. In {{addition to the}} classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in people with FH. Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E
5|$|The Queen {{is one of}} the Overtakers, villains of The Kingdom Keepers novel series. She was {{introduced}} in 2011 in the fourth book of the saga, Power Play, alongside Cruella De Vil. Like Maleficent, she is very powerful and is able to cast almost any spell with a flick of her finger; she can also transform herself and other characters. In Power <b>Play,</b> <b>when</b> Maleficent and Chernabog are captured by the Keepers, the Queen becomes the new leader of the Overtakers.|$|E

5|$|The {{third period}} began with Alexei Zhamnov {{notching}} the Flyers' fifth {{goal of the}} game to make it 5–2. Shortly thereafter, the game started to become more heated; Zhamnov and Daniel Alfredsson were assessed coincidental minors for roughing nine minutes into the period, and three minutes later Bryan Smolinski and Mark Greig were similarly penalized. Simpson returned to the box soon after, for slashing Michal Handzus, but Philadelphia's power <b>play</b> <b>when</b> cut short when they received a penalty for having too many men on the ice.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, {{with the}} Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself {{swinging}} the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home that sent the ball {{completely out of the}} Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, {{and by the end of}} the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth <b>play</b> <b>when</b> the Yankees were on the road.|$|E
5|$|During auditions for {{the school}} play, a romantic tension builds between Sunny and Zeke and {{they are asked to}} play the lead roles. Sunny quits the <b>play</b> <b>when</b> she realises that she has to kiss Zeke. Sunny then finds out that Zeke is 'Lost Boy', but she forgives him. When she sees Donna Freedman practising the kissing scene with Zeke, Sunny becomes upset. Sunny and Zeke almost share a kiss one night when they are alone. However, they are {{interrupted}} by Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Due to rewrites of the play, Sunny's new character has to kiss Zeke too and Sunny grows uncomfortable again. During drama camp, Sunny and Zeke are locked in a cupboard during a game of truth or dare. They almost kiss again, but are interrupted when the door is opened. Karl realises that Sunny and Zeke like each other and he tries to keep them apart. However, they eventually start a relationship.|$|E

5|$|During its brief history, the AAFC, {{who would}} merge into the NFL for the 1950 season, used an {{identical}} playoff format to the NFL from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 (its last year), the AAFC would merge its two conferences {{when one of}} its teams folded, and use a four-team playoff system. In 1948, the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity came into <b>play</b> <b>when</b> the San Francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12–2 record; {{they were in the}} same conference as the 14–0 Cleveland Browns, who would go on to win the Western Conference and then the AAFC's championship game against the 7–7 Buffalo Bills (AAFC).|$|E
5|$|During the voyages, Volsius reappears in {{the guise}} of Georges's heroes: Otto Lidenbrock {{at the center of the}} earth, Captain Nemo on a journey on the Nautilus to Atlantis, and Michel Ardan on a cannon-propelled trip to a distant planet, Altor. Ox and Volsius are in {{constant}} conflict throughout, with the former urging Georges toward hubris and the latter seeking to protect Georges from the influence. Ox appears to have won at the climax of the <b>play,</b> <b>when</b> Georges—attempting to work for the benefit of Altor, where overconsumption has deprived the planet of soil and other natural resources—leads a massive technological project to save the planet from burning by redirecting its water channels. The project backfires, and the planet explodes.|$|E
5|$|Each half of {{the pitch}} is then divided again by a line, {{referred}} to as the 23metre line or 25yard line, positioned 22.90m from each back line. Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags {{at the side of the}} pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23metre region of the pitch. Since 2015, the 23metre line has also been used for the attacking team to resume <b>play</b> <b>when</b> it has gone over the back line (this replaced long corners).|$|E
