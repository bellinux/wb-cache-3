40|$|The Malaysian {{government}} has established {{various types of}} funds to cater the needs of small and medium industry (SMI). These funds are made available to entrepreneur through participating financial institutions such as commercial banks and development financial in institutions. Thc success of commercial banks in their roles, among others depends on certain characteristics {{of the people that}} are actually dealing with the funds. This article highlights the perceptions of commercial bank officers on several aspects of both <b>ordinary</b> <b>loans</b> and loans given from the government funds. Opinions sought from these officers include factors relating to the administration of the funds, the profitability of the funds, the contribution of the funds to job promotion, and the tendency of the loan under the funds becoming problematic loans. Divergence of opinions between branch managers and credit oficers, as well as between officers in town/metropolitan areas and rural areas, are investigated. Findings from this study would be useful to various parties, especially the government and financial institutions, in making the financial assistance programme for small and medium scale entreprises a successful endeavour...|$|R

In a letter to American journalist and blogger Jim Romenesko, Johnston wrote, [...] "In covering the proposed $700 billion bailout of Wall Street don't repeat the failed lapdog practices that so damaged our reputations in the rush to war in Iraq and the adoption of the Patriot Act. Don't assume that Congress must act instantly, as so many news stories state as if it was an immutable fact. Don't assume there is a case just because officials say there is." [...] Johnston has been cited favorably by Glenn Greenwald as well as other bailout critics. On September 26, 2008, Johnston said: [...] "If you look around, you'll notice that banks are still making <b>ordinary</b> <b>loans</b> to <b>ordinary</b> businesses.

Heat transfer characteristics are addressed through thermal stratification and heat generation/absorption. Formulation {{is arranged for}} mixed convection.

Moreover, temperature is found to decrease for larger values of Prandtl number and heat absorption parameter. Comparative analysis for limiting study is performed and excellent agreement is found...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} I {{introduce}} a powerful analytical method to analyze states of non-equilibrium polariton Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). It is {{shown that the}} condensate wave functions carrying dark solitons and half-dark solitons can be {{expressed in terms of}} the natural parameters of the non-equilibrium system, i. e. the growth and decay rates and the interaction parameters. The derivation is based on a non-conservative Lagrangian formalism, which <b>provides</b> <b>ordinary</b> differential equations for the parameters of the dark soliton solutions in their dynamic environment. Explicit expressions for the stationary solution are stated, which significantly differ from those observed in atomic BEC. Subsequently the method is extended to spinor condensates, which yields ordinary differential equations for the parameters of half-dark solitons. Finally a stationary case with explicit expressions for half-dark solitons is presented as well. Comment: submitte...|$|R
40|$|Between January 1995 and December 2000, 112 {{children}} with a closed displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus without vascular deficit, were managed by elevated, straight-arm traction for a mean of 22 days. The final outcome was assessed using clinical (flexion-extension arc, carrying angle and residual rotational deformity) and radiographic (metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle and humerocapitellar angle) criteria. Excellent results were achieved in 71 (63 %) patients, 33 (29 %) had good results, 5 (4. 4 %) fair, and 3 (2. 6 %) poor. All patients with fair or poor outcomes were older than ten years of age. Elevated, straight-arm traction is safe and effective in children younger than ten years.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Soviet {{cartography}} shared {{several important}} characteristics with the Russian cartography {{from which it}} emerged. Geographical expeditions were extremely important for filling out the contents of both Russian and Soviet state topographic maps. Cartography had been centralized in many ways in Russian times, but the centralization became absolute under the Soviet system. At the same time cartography came under centralized {{control of the government}} in the State Cartographic Service, and the publication and use of large-scale maps were subject to governmental restrictions. The 1 : 100, 000 map of the USSR was compiled in 1954, and was not designed to <b>provide</b> <b>ordinary</b> consumers with topographic information. Any maps for ordinary users, their scales notwithstanding, were based on the 1 : 2, 500, 000 map of the country. In the 1970 s, the map was deliberately impaired by a cartographic projection that resulted in random distortions of the map’s contents...|$|R

40|$|Combustion {{oscillations}} {{are receiving}} renewed research interest due to increasing application of lean premix (LPM) combustion to gas turbines. A simple, nonlinear model for premixed combustion is described; {{it was developed}} to explain experimental results and to provide guidance for developing active control schemes based on nonlinear concepts. The model {{can be used to}} quickly examine instability trends associated with changes in equivalence ratio, mass flow rate, geometry, ambient conditions, etc. The model represents the relevant processes occurring in a fuel nozzle and combustor analogous to current LPM turbine combustors.
