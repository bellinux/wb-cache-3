40|$|Mutants of Anacystis nidulans {{tolerant}} to {{high levels}} of Co, Ni,Cu, Zn and Cd were obtained by repeated subculturing at strongly inhibitory levels of metal. For instance, the level of Zn at which- 1 strong inhibition occurred was raised from 1. 45 to 16. 5 mg 1 (^- 1) Zn after 75 subcultures. Isolates resistant to 5. 0 mg 1 (^- 1) Zn and 12. 0 mg 1 (^- 1) Zn maintained their resistance for at least 72 cell generations in the absence of Zn, though there was subsequently an increased lag during the first subculture back to high Zn levels. This and <b>plating</b> <b>experiment</b> sindicate that the strains are mutants. Assays of cross-resistance of each of the five types of mutant were made to the other four metals. Inmost cases changes in cross-resistance were only slight, with about equal numbers of examples of increased and decreased resistance. Examples of marked changes were increased Co-resistance of a Cd-tolerant strain and decreased Cd-resistance of a Ni-tolerant strain. The environmental factors influencing toxicity were investigated for Cu, Zn and Cd. Increases in Ca, Mn, Fe and P reduced Zn toxicity to both wild-type and Zn-tolerant strains, but the two differed in their response to pH. Effects on morphology were evident at high metal levels with all strains. In most cases increased levels of metal {{led to the formation of}} filaments, but with Cu subspherical structures sometimes made up most of the- 1 population. Uptake from media enriched 0. 1 and 1. 0 mg 1 (^- 1) Zn was similar in both wild-type and Zn-tl 2. 0, whether judged by total Zn accumulated or by that remaining after EDTA washes. Isolates from high Zn sites were found in general to tolerate considerably higher levels of Zn than laboratory research strains(presumably isolated from environments not enriched with Zn).

H 577 P SO 2015 Chanxx, 205 pages :illustrationsBackground: The use of {{cosmetic}} {{contact lenses}} (CCL) {{has become increasingly}} popular especially in Asian countries such as Korea, Taiwan,Singapore and China. The public can easily purchase CCL online, at cabinet stores, flea markets, department stores, and accessories stores. CCL not prescribed and dispensed from optometric practices are just commodities to the salespersons who have no proper training in contact lens care and handling. Lack of training {{poses a threat to}} wearers who are not provided with any eye examination, aftercare services, or advice on proper lens usage and care. The quality of these CCL is also an issue as {{there is a lack of}} information on the manufacturer, the pigments used, manufacturing process, and the colour printing process. With huge demand for CCL in the market and lack of regulations of the sale of CCL, there is a need to review the safety of CCL. To date, research on CCL is scarce. This is probably due to the relatively low popularity of CCL, particularly in Caucasian countries. It was not until recent years that CCL regained attention due to increasing popularity in Asian countries and reports of microbial keratitis cases related to CCL. There was therefore a need to investigate the characteristics of CCL, particularly surface pigment CCL, and their implications on safe CCL wear. Objectives: The objectives of this PhD study were to: 1. develop a method to determine the location and permanency of pigments on CCL 2. investigate the effect of surface pigments of CCL on microbial adherence 3. investigate cytotoxic effect of surface pigment of CCL on porcine corneal epithelial cells using the new porcine eye model(PEM) 4. investigate the effect of surface pigments of CCL on protein deposition Methods: Experiment 1 : The permanency of pigments of five brands of CCL was tested using a cotton bud rub-off test. Each lens was removed from its blister pack and placed on the cleaned surface of an electronic scale to allow monitoring of the force applied when each lens was rubbed to ensure consistency of force applied (applied force between 110 230 g) for all lenses. Any pigment coming off the lens surface was determined by examining the tip of the cotton bud for pigment transfer after every rub. The procedures were repeated on both front and back surface. Experiment 2 : Fifteen brands of new CCL (five lenses of each brand) were challenged with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027. Three brands of lenses and their clear counterparts were also challenged with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Serratia marcescens ATCC 13880. Lenses were incubated in bacterial suspension immediately after they were removed from the blister packs or storage vials. After 24 hours,the lenses were removed aseptically and rinsed gently with phosphate buffered saline to remove loosely attached micro-organisms and the viable organisms adhered to the lenses were enumerated using an automated colony counter after <b>plating.</b> <b>Experiment</b> 3 : In order to test the cytotoxic effects of CCL in an ex vivo model,improvements were needed to the existing porcine eye model. These modifications were required because the current model only allows two porcine eyes set up each time and there was no strict control of the surrounding temperature or humidity. A total of 57 porcine eyes were used and they were mounted on four test PEM with blinking and lacrimation simulation. The nictitating membrane of the porcine eyes was held by a movable arm connecting to a motor to simulate blinking. An infusion wing was set right above the cornea so that Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) could be applied to the superior limbal region regularly to simulate lacrimation. Viability of the corneal epithelial cells was assessed with 0. 4 % trypan blue solutions three hours after the commencement of the experiment. Two controls were set up: control A was to assess cell viability immediately without any treatment and control B was to assess cell viability on PEM without blinking and lacrimation simulation after three hours. Back surface pigment CCL and the clear contact lens clear counterparts were pre-soaked in different multipurpose solutions (MPS) and hydrogen peroxide system for 24 hours. The CCL were then placed on the porcine eyes on PEM with blinking and lacrimation simulation. Cell viability was assessed after three hours of experiment using Annexin V-FITC/ 7 -AAD kit. Experiment 4 : Ten young adults aged 18 - 35 years old were recruited. Subjects were required to wear the contact lenses (two brands of CCL and one clear contact lenses of the same lens material) for eight to ten hours. At the end of a day's wear, the subjects returned to the clinic and the contact lenses were removed and collected for protein quantification. Results: Experiment 1 : Only one brand of CCLs was found to have no pigment coming off after repeated rubs with a wetted cotton bud. The other CCL all had pigment transferred to the cotton bud after two rubs (Range: 1 - 7). Experiment 2 :Surface pigment CCL showed significantly higher amounts of microbial colonization than their clear counterparts for all bacterial species tested (p 0. 402). Experiment 3 : No significant difference was found in the number of dead cells between the four test PEMs in both central (p= 0. 53) and peripheral cornea (p= 0. 19). There were significantly more dead cells (central and periphery) in the test PEMs compared to control A (p 0. 05). The number of early necrotic,late necrotic and apoptotic cells between CCL and clear contact lenses in all tested solutions were also not significantly different (p> 0. 05). Experiment 4 : The results showed no significant differences in protein deposition between sandwich CCL (Median: 583 [Range: 362 - 980]) or surface pigment CCL (Median: 600 [Range: 483 - 892]) and clear contact lens (Median: 639 [Range: 347 - 731]). Conclusions:The rub-off test provided an indirect and simple method to determine the pigment location of CCL. Our study showed that CCL with pigments printed on the surface resulted in significantly higher bacterial adhesion. However,using the improved PEM showed that the cytotoxic effects of leachates from surface pigments CCL were not significantly different compared to those of clear contact lenses after three hours of exposure. Protein deposition on CCL, either sandwiched or surface pigments, after one day of lens wear, was also not different from those on clear contact lenses worn by the same subject.

Using this technique we compare data from parallel plate measurements, where effects of pressure and temperature are negligible, to those from pressure driven flows where they are not. The shear stress for all techniques agrees within experimental error at low shear rates. At higher shear rates the slit and capillary measurements diverge from the parallel plate measurements highlighting the effect of pressure and temperature on viscosity. Also, breakdown of the Cox-Merz rule at slightly higher shear rates is apparent when comparing dynamic and steady shear data from the parallel <b>plate</b> <b>experiments.</b> Since the complex viscosity diverges {{in the same manner}} as the viscosity derived from pressure driven flow it seems as if agreement of the complex viscosity with the viscosity derived from pressure driven flow is fortuitous. With the capillary geometry, there is no sign of slip effects at low stress levels probably due to experimental limitations while the torsional rheometer shows slip at all shear stresses. There is no critical stress for the onset of slip but there is a critical stress where slip increases dramatically. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} primarily {{studies the}} effect of air on vibration of structures. Theoretical solutions based on various physics are derived and compared with experimental results to determine how air modifies the vibrational behavior of structures. This work may help in determining the characteristics of structural vibrations – from acoustic behavior to earthquake response - in practical buildings. The work consists of several primary components: derivation of theories that predict {{the effect of}} air on structural vibrations and vice-versa, design of experiments, and determination {{of the importance of}} air in structural vibrations and the applicability of different physics under various vibrational frequencies. Two types of physics - acoustic theory and fluid dynamics theory - are applied to derive solutions for damping ratios of air. Experiments such as an unbaffled <b>plate</b> <b>experiment,</b> a pendulum experiment and a baffled <b>plate</b> <b>experiment</b> are designed and conducted to observe the damping effect of air. Experimental results illustrate the applicability of the theories. Finite element analysis is performed to provide a computational basis with which to compare the observed vibrational frequencies. The main question in this research is whether air has a great effect on structural vibrations. The results show that air has a damping effect on vibrating buildings that can be important under certain conditions. The results also reveal that when calculating the damping effects due to air, different physics should be applied under different vibrational conditions. A dimensionless factor is derived to determine under which regimes acoustic theory is applicable, and under which regimes fluid dynamics theory is applicable.

40|$|This {{study is}} a start to {{investigate}} the relationship between micro climate, i. e. the climate at the wood surface, and the wood moisture content. The micro climate {{is affected by the}} construction design; if water gets trapped in joints and stays on wood surfaces, the time during which water is absorbed by the wood increases. To be able to measure moisture content profiles and investigate the relationship between joint design and moisture content, methods for moisture content determination, duration of surface moisture and presence of water in gaps were developed. The moisture content was determined by measuring the electrical conductance between two electrodes inserted in the wood. Unlike the electrodes commonly used for this purpose these electrodes were both small and fastened with electrical conductive adhesive so that the contact between the electrode and the wood remained. The relationship between electrical conductance and moisture content is affected by several wood and experimental variables and calibration experiments were therefore performed. Since the study concerns wood outdoors, the relationship was determined mainly for high moisture contents. Specimens were conditioned to different relative humidity (RH) levels using two different methods. Between 64 % and 95 % RH, saturated salt solutions were used and for high RH levels (98 - 100 %), specimens were conditioned using the pressure plate method. The relationship between conductance and moisture content was obtained for moisture contents between 18 % and 180 %.
