In extreme cases, battery chemicals may spray violently from the casing and cause injury. Overcharging - that is, attempting to charge a battery beyond its electrical capacity - {{can also lead to}} a battery explosion, in addition to leakage or irreversible damage.

As it is known that aluminum can be dissolved by alkaline liquids, but not that which is mildly acidic, an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) fingerprint analysis of the electrolyte of the faulty capacitors was made, which detected dissolved aluminum in the electrolyte.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change in}} Norway {{is thought to}} result in {{increased}} precipitation {{as well as more}} extreme precipitation events. As a result of this, the frequency of rainfall-induced landslides and debris flows are estimated to increase {{in many parts of the}} country. This paper examines the setting for a large landslide that occured on August 13 th, 2013 in Almåskroken, Midtre Gauldal municipality in Norway. Through field observations, analysis of hydrological data and digital terrain analysis, release mechanisms for the landslide are determined and the overall slope stability of the study area is discussed. Results from the study indicate that a highly local, intense precipitation event led to the triggering of the landslide, by excess pore water pressures occuring in relation to a convex terrain feature. Findings further indicate that local factors such as soil layering, logging roads and convex terrain features lead to a susceptibility for pore <b>pressure</b> <b>build-ups,</b> and consequently a reduction of slope stability during extreme precipitation events...|$|R
40|$|The present paper proposes an {{automatic}} procedure in a GIS {{environment for the}} analysis and prediction of large-scale landslides due to rainfall events. It runs, for each unit cell, an hydrological balance based on the Curve Number method, CN (Soil Conservation Service 1972 and 1975), computing the evolution of groundwater {{as a result of}} precipitation and then checks the overcoming, or not, of limit equilibrium conditions of the land in the domain of interest. The mathematical model was implemented in the free and open source GIS GRASS. For any sequence of consecutive days of rain, according to the conditions of humidity prior to the time-history under study, the hydro-geotechnical model allows (1) the determination of the oscillations of the phreatic table, (2) the part of saturated soil and (3) the slope stability analysis, by taking into proper account the pore <b>pressures</b> <b>build-up.</b> The results of the procedure are returned in raster format, allowing an easy and intuitive interpretation of the land mass sensitivity to meteoric actions. This procedure was applied on an extensive kinematic phenomenon surrounding the city of Santo Stefano d'Aveto (Liguria, Italy). The realized maps of landslide susceptibility are in excellent agreement with what is evident on site...|$|R

A tall water fountain, the Jet d'Eau, was ejected by the device whenever it was activated. This happened typically at end of work when the factories switched off the machines one at the time, so that the pressure in the system was hard to control and the supply of pressurized water was difficult {{to adapt to the}} real demand.

Adenosine is thought to {{play a critical role in}} this and many people have proposed that the <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> is partially due to adenosine accumulation. However, some researchers have shown that accumulation alone does not explain this phenomenon completely. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle in the body, which has been shown to continue even in the absence of environmental cues. This is caused by projections from the SCN to the brain stem.|$|E

40|$|The {{well-known}} {{capacity of}} concrete to withstand high temperature and fire is {{put to the}} test by the most recent, high- and ultra high-performance cementitious composites, since their more closed pore structure favours <b>pressure</b> <b>build-ups</b> in the pores filled with water, turning to vapour at high temperature. The ensuing spalling phenomena can be prevented by adding polymeric fibres to the mix, while material toughness can be improved – at any temperature – by adding metallic fibres. However, concrete mechanical behaviour depends on the thermal field, which is strictly related to the type of fire and to the thermal properties of the material. Hence, special concretes for special structural applications should be thoroughly characterised at high temperature and after cooling, to evaluate their thermal and mechanical properties. These properties are recalled {{in the first part of}} this paper, with reference to thermal diffusivity, compressive and tensile strength, elastic modulus and fracture energy. Furthermore, to maximise the benefits coming from the use of better materials, a parallel rethinking of some aspects of structural analysis is needed. With regard to this point, in the second part of the paper some suggestions and proposals are formulated with reference to the analysis of reinforced concrete sections subjected to combined bending and axial force, and some considerations are made on two rather underrated aspects of the analysis: the role of the thermal self-stresses and the increasing slenderness of fire-exposed columns...|$|R

However, HHP also influences enzymatic reactions of food.

25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The <b>pressure</b> <b>build-up</b> {{in front of the}} piston head pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E

40|$|The San Andreas Fault zone {{in central}} California {{accommodates}} tectonic strain by stable slip and microseismic activity. We study microstructural controls {{of strength and}} deformation in the fault using core samples provided by the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) including gouge corresponding to presently active shearing intervals in the main borehole. The methods of study include high-resolution optical and electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence mapping, X-ray powder diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, white light interferometry, and image processing. The fault zone at the SAFOD site consists of a strongly deformed and foliated core zone that includes 2 - 3 m thick active shear zones, surrounded by less deformed rocks. Results suggest deformation and foliation of the core zone outside the active shear zones by alternating cataclasis and pressure solution mechanisms. The active shear zones, considered zones of large-scale shear localization, appear {{to be associated with}} an abundance of weak phases including smectite clays, serpentinite alteration products, and amorphous material. We suggest that deformation along the active shear zones is by a granular-type flow mechanism that involves frictional sliding of microlithons along phyllosilicate-rich Riedel shear surfaces as well as stress-driven diffusive mass transfer. The microstructural data may be interpreted to suggest that deformation in the active shear zones is strongly displacement-weakening. The fault creeps because the velocity strengthening weak gouge in the active shear zones is being sheared without strong restrengthening mechanisms such as cementation or fracture sealing. Possible mechanisms for the observed microseismicity in the creeping segment of the SAF include local high fluid <b>pressure</b> <b>build-ups,</b> hard asperity development by fracture-and-seal cycles, and stress build-up due to slip zone undulations...|$|R

Four fly ashes, originating from different countries were investigated. The alkalinity and reactivity of the fly ashes were determined in a pH-stat equipment. Pure fly ash removed SO 2 in both the spray dryer and in the baghouse. An increase of humidity divided the fly ashes into two groups. The high calcium fly ash gave a considerably higher SO 2 removal than the medium and low calcium fly ashes which showed similar SO 2 removals.

40|$|To {{visualize}} {{the behavior of}} erupting magma in volcanic conduits, we performed shock tube experiments on the ductile–brittle response of a viscoelastic medium to diffusion-driven bubble expansion. A sample of shear-thinning magma analogue is saturated by gas Ar under high pressure. On rapid decompression, Ar supersaturation causes bubbles to nucleate, grow, and coalesce in the sample, forcing it to expand, flow, and fracture. Experimental variables include saturation pressure and duration, and shape and lubrication of the flow path. Bubble growth in the experiments controls both flow and fracturing, and is consistent with physical models of magma vesiculation. Two types of fractures are observed: i) sharp fractures along the uppermost rim of the sample, and ii) fractures pervasively diffused throughout the sample. Rim fractures open when shear stress accumulates and strain rate is highest at {{the margin of the}} flow (a process already inferred from observations and models to occur in magma). Pervasive fractures originate when wall-friction retards expansion of the sample, causing <b>pressure</b> to <b>build-up</b> in the bubbles. When bubble pressure overcomes wall-friction and the tensile strength of the porous sample, fractures open with a range of morphologies. Both types of fracture open normally to flow direction, and both may heal as the flow proceeds. These experiments also illustrate how the development of pervasive fractures allows exsolving gas to escape from the sample before the generation of a permeable network via other processes, e. g., bubble coalescence. This is an observation that potentially impact the degassing of magma and the transition between explosive and effusive eruptions...|$|R
