40|$|Can a multi-factorial {{assessment}} and interventional <b>programme</b> <b>decrease</b> inpatient falls in an elderly care ward? Rebecca SJ Gibson, April Heaney, Karen Hull Each year approximately 282, 000 inpatient falls {{are reported to}} the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA). A significant number result in death, or moderate to severe injury. (1) Research shows that falls may be reduced by 18 to 31 % through multi-factorial assessments and interventions. (4) If a fall cannot be prevented, the patient should receive a prompt and effective response to achieve the best possible recovery and avoidance of further falls. Using 'Plan-Do-Study-Act ' learning cycles, our aims were to decrease the inpatient falls rate in an Elderly Care ward by 20 % and to improve post-fall care. A baseline audit reviewed incident report forms to establish the number of falls per 1000 patient bed days for one calendar year; the baseline falls rate was 14. 70 falls per 1000 bed days between November 2010 and October 2011. A care plan to highlight at-risk patients and allow adaptation of care, a 'walking-stick ' incentive poster to encourage nursing staff, and post-fall guidelines, were introduced. Feedback sessions with ward staff and a re-audit were organised subsequent to each intervention. Completion of the care plan was monitored to improve compliance. A re-audit at one year was conducted to assess impact. Feedback was positive regarding the interventions. Monthly monitoring of care plans achieved a compliance rate of 89 % and highlighted up t...|$|E
40|$|M. A. (Psychology) Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the {{influence}} of anxiety on a sample of provincial youth track- and field athletes and to develop a mental skills programme to help decrease their pre-competition and competition anxiety during sport performance. A purposive sample of 83 athletes ranging from 13 – 19 years of age (mean age = 16. 00 years; sd = 1. 90) were included in the study. A quasi-experimental design was followed, with 55 athletes assigned to the experimental group and participated in a mental skills training programme over a period of six months. The control group consisted of 28 athletes, did not receive information or any education on the same mental skills training programme and were asked to continue with their regular training programme. All the participants were asked to complete the Sport Competition Anxiety Test (SCAT), as well as the Mental Skills Inventory (MSI). The results indicated that youth athletes have a high level of anxiety when competing in track- and field events. It was also found that they have a moderate level of mental skills, leaving much room for improvement of their mental skills. The high negative correlation found between mental skills and anxiety in the sample, supported the premise of the study that an increase in the mental skills of the athletes might decrease their anxiety significantly. The results of the study indicated that the mental skills training programme, which include relaxation skills, emotional control and self-talk management improved the mental skills and decreased the anxiety levels of the experimental group significantly. The change in anxiety levels did not occur in the control group. The results indicated that the mental skills training <b>programme</b> <b>decrease</b> the anxiety of the experimental group significantly...|$|E

The {{objective of}} this systematic review was to assess how single-modality evidence-based care prin-ciples, regarding postoperative analgesia and postopera-tive nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis, combine to achieve this. Methods A systematic review of randomised controlled trials was performed. Relevant trials compared postop-erative epidural analgesia/parenteral opioid analgesia/ paracetamol/non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and postoperative antiemetics. The effect on recovery was evaluated in terms of length of hospital stay, pain intensity, duration of gastrointestinal dysfunc-tion and incidence of PONV. Results Twenty-three trials were included. Epidural anaesthesia failed to reduce length of stay or the inci-dence of PONV when compared to controls. Pain inten-sity and time to fi rst bowel movement were reduced (p< 0. 05). Paracetamol did not {{reduce the incidence of}} PONV. NSAIDs reduced postoperative opioid consump-tion and the incidence of PONV (p< 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1992, {{voters in}} Massachusetts (United States) {{approved}} Question 1, a state ballot initiative, which raised the state excise tax {{to provide funds}} for tobacco education. OBJECTIVE: To examine Question 1 expenditures for tobacco-specific programmes in the 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 fiscal years. DESIGN: This study examined trends in Question 1 expenditures. Data were collected from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for the 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 fiscal years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The amount of spending on tobacco-specific programmes. RESULTS: Excluding the 1994 fiscal year because the state allocated 18 months of new revenues, from the 1995 fiscal year to the projected 1997 fiscal year, the state will have spent 22 % of Question 1 funds for tobacco- specific programmes. Question 1 expenditures for tobacco-specific programmes have declined by 15 %, whereas Question 1 expenditures for the other <b>programmes</b> <b>decreased</b> only 0. 4 %. CONCLUSIONS: The legislature has established a trend that has produced real reductions in Question 1 funding for tobacco education, which appears contrary to {{the mandate of the}} voters when they enacted Question 1 in 1992. These reductions undermine the effectiveness of tobacco-specific programmes that {{are an integral part of}} the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Programme.

40|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{has been}} suggested {{as a method of}} conserving many threatened vertebrates, and is increasingly being proposed as a valuable conservation strategy for invertebrates. Potential genetic problems associated with ex situ conservation are widely recognized. but a further issue has received less attention: the possibility that populations will undergo adaptation to the captive environment, rendering them less well adapted to survival in the wild. We investigated six traits related to dispersal and reproduction in a culture of the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae (L.), that had been captive for c. 100 - 150 generations, and in recently wild stock reared simultaneously in a common environment. Individuals in the captive culture were heavier, with smaller wings and lower wing aspect ratios. Females from the captive culture laid many more eggs in cage experiments, and had higher ovary mass at the time of peak egg production. These differences are consistent with adaptation to captive conditions. Over time, similar evolutionary changes may affect invertebrates reared in ex situ conservation <b>programmes,</b> <b>decreasing</b> the likelihood that these species can be re-established in the wild. Although the timescale over which most vertebrates are likely to adapt to captivity is longer, and the traits involved will be different, invertebrates like P. brassicae may also provide a model of potential problems in long-term ex situ conservation programmes for both invertebrates and vertebrates. We suggest that measures to reduce or slow adaptation to captivity should be introduced alongside measures to reduce deleterious genetic effects in captive populations...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of two training programmes of 6 weeks combining strength and balance exercises in different proportions. One training programme [n= 10; 71. 4 (6. 3) years] consisted mainly of strength exercises (ST) and the other programme [n= 8; 71. 4 (6. 4) years] included a majority of balance exercises (BT). Maximal strength of lower leg muscles and centre of pressure (CoP) steadiness during upright stance in various sensory conditions were measured before and after training. The input-output relation of motor evoked potential (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation and H reflex was also assessed in soleus during upright standing. The maximal strength of the ankle plantar flexor muscles increased after training programmes (p< 0. 001) with a trend for greater gain in ST (+ 35. 7 %) compared with BT (+ 20. 8 %, p= 0. 055). The gain in strength {{was positively correlated with}} the increase in voluntary activation (p< 0. 001). Both training <b>programmes</b> <b>decreased</b> maximal amplitude and mean fluctuations of CoP displacements recorded in the backward-forward direction when standing on a foam mat (p< 0. 05) but not on a rigid surface. The electromyographic activity of the ankle plantar flexor muscles during upright standing decreased (p< 0. 05) after training but not for the tibialis anterior. Results obtained for H reflex and MEP input-output relations suggest an increased efficacy of Ia afferents to activate low-threshold motor neurones and a decrease in corticospinal excitability after training. This study indicates that short-term training combining strength and balance exercises increases maximal strength and induces change in the neural control of lower leg muscles during upright standing.

What the effect of endurance training on UCP 3 is, is still  controversial. Endurance-trained athletes are characterized by lower levels of UCP 3, but longitudinal studies in rodents reported no effect of endurance training on muscular UCP 3 levels. Here, we examined {{the effect of a}} 2 -week training programme on skeletal muscle UCP 3 protein content in untrained human subjects, and hypothesized that UCP 3 will be reduced after the training programme. Methods : Nine untrained men [age: 23. 3 ± 3. 2 years; BMI: 22. 6 ± 2. 6 kg m - 2; maximal power output (W max) : 3. 8 ± 0. 6 W kg - 1 body weight] trained for 2 weeks.

40|$|Currently, the {{predominant}} onchocerciasis control strategy in Africa is annual mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. However, {{there is a}} consensus among the global health community, supported by mathematical modelling, that onchocerciasis in Africa will not be eliminated within proposed time frameworks in all endemic foci with only annual MDA, and novel and alternative strategies are urgently needed. Furthermore, use of MDA with ivermectin is already compromised in large areas of central Africa co-endemic with Loa loa, and there are areas where suboptimal or atypical responses to ivermectin have been documented. An onchocerciasis vaccine would be highly advantageous in these areas. We used a previously developed onchocerciasis transmission model (EPIONCHO) to investigate the impact of vaccination in areas where loiasis and onchocerciasis are co-endemic and ivermectin is contraindicated. We also explore the potential influence of a vaccination programme on infection resurgence in areas where local elimination has been successfully achieved. Based on the age range included in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), the vaccine was assumed to target 1 to 5 year olds. Our modelling {{results indicate that the}} deployment of an onchocerciasis vaccine would have a beneficial impact in onchocerciasis-loiasis co-endemic areas, markedly reducing microfilarial load in the young (under 20 yr) age groups. An onchocerciasis prophylactic vaccine would reduce the onchocerciasis disease burden in populations where ivermectin cannot be administered safely. Moreover, a vaccine could substantially decrease the chance of re-emergence of Onchocerca volvulus infection in areas where it is deemed that MDA with ivermectin can be stopped. Therefore, a vaccine would protect the substantial investments made by present and past onchocerciasis control <b>programmes,</b> <b>decreasing</b> the chance of disease recrudescence and offering an important additional tool to mitigate the potentially devastating impact of emerging ivermectin resistance...|$|R
40|$|This report {{offers a}} {{comparative}} policy study on adult learning {{within the scope}} of complementary research conducted by Beblavý et al. (2013) on how people upgrade their skills during their adult lifetimes. To achieve our objectives, we identified regulatory policies and financial support in 11 countries for two main categories of learning: formal higher education and employer-based training. Drawing upon the results of the country reports carried out by our partners in the MoPAct project, we found that in none of the countries examined is there an ‘older student’ policy. In most cases grants and financial support are awarded only up until a certain age. In all of the countries studied, standard undergraduate and post-graduate studies are available for part-time students. The distribution of full-time students and part-time students in tertiary education varies from one country to another as well as from one age group to another. The participation in full-time tertiary education <b>programmes</b> <b>decreases</b> with the age of students. In Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and the UK, there are no mandatory policies to ensure employer-based training. However, in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, employer-based training is more clearly regulated and the employers might have obligations to provide training for their staff. Taking into consideration Beblavý et al. (2013), we observe that comparative differences across countries can be related to policy differences only in some cases. The policy framework seems to impact more the employer-based training than the educational attainment (upgrade of ISCED level). In Denmark, the Netherlands, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic and Poland, we find a perfect match between policy outcomes and the results of Beblavý et al. (2013) related to employer-based training.
