5|$|Immigration {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants {{were considered to be}} a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration <b>program</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E
5|$|John Alan Coey {{was born}} in Columbus, Ohio, on 12 November 1950 to George and Phyllis Coey, both devout Christians.

5|$|The AW101 {{was being}} {{acquired}} by the United States Marine Corps under the VXX <b>program</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> replacement for the Presidential Marine One helicopters.

However, in 2009 the VH-71 procurement was abruptly terminated following the withdrawal of funding. In 2010, Boeing considered an AW101 submission in the restarted VXX program.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{proved that}} the fault lay {{in the construction of}} the bomb's tail; breaking up on impact, a 'safed' bomb would have its arming wire removed, rendering it 'unsafe' and detonating the weapon. Modifications were made to solve the problem, but the damage had been done; the safety issues, increased maintenance costs compared to conventional bombs, the fact that the bomb's guidance system required clear-day use only, rendering the bombers vulnerable to enemy fighters, and required that the weapon be released at a prime altitude for the aircraft to be in danger from enemy flak. These combined with the weapon's poor reliability – only six of twenty-eight bombs dropped successfully destroyed their targets – to result in the production order being canceled by the USAF; following this, the Tarzon <b>program</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole was terminated in August 1951.|$|E
5|$|Having been conscripted {{into the}} Confederate Ghost <b>program</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child {{due to her}} psychic potential, Kerrigan is {{described}} in the manual for StarCraft as never having been given the chance for a normal life. Her rigorous training {{and the use of}} neural implants to control her mental abilities leave her withdrawn and introverted. Despite this, Kerrigan exhibits qualities of courage and daring, and is an effective tactician. She is also described as a moral character, exemplified in her opposition to Arcturus Mengsk using the Zerg against the Confederacy. However, after her transformation by the Zerg, Kerrigan is freed from her inhibitions—as well as her neural conditioning—and indulges her darker traits (though Heart of the Swarm implies that at least part of her villainy was due to the influence of a fallen Xel'naga named Amon). Her attitude, combined with her natural intelligence, makes her extremely calculating and manipulative. A hint of her former moral sensitivity is to be noted when {{towards the end of the}} Zerg campaign of Brood War, she states how she feels weary of slaughter for the first time since her transformation. Kerrigan has also become far more physically aggressive, relishing close quarters combat so much that at one point in the novel Queen of Blades, she begins absent-mindedly licking the blood of her victims from her fingers.|$|E

5|$|Recruitment centers were {{established}} by the American Hospital Association in all 1,125 participating nursing schools. Using recruiting booths, volunteers disseminated information about the opportunities offered by the Corps to potential candidates. State and local nursing councils, and many other organizations, associations, and volunteers aided the recruitment effort. 65,521 nursing students—521 more than projected—registered for the program {{in the fiscal year}} 1943, the first year of enrollment. In the 1944 enrollment period, 61,471 registered, exceeding the estimate by 1,471. In the 1945 enrollment period, 3,000 students were admitted to what would be the final class of the <b>program.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of the non-discriminatory provision, by 1945, over 3,000 African Americans, 40 Native Americans, and 400 Japanese Americans had enrolled in the Corps.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{sought to}} use the MirageIII {{replacement}} <b>program</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to increase the capabilities of Australia's manufacturing industry. Accordingly, {{it was decided to}} build the aircraft in Australia, though it was recognised that this would lead to higher costs than if the fighters were purchased directly from the United States. While the first two RAAF Hornets were built in the United States, the remainder were assembled at the Government Aircraft Factories plant at Avalon Airport in Victoria, and their engines were produced by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne. Another twelve Australian companies were involved in other stages of the project. These firms were sub-contracted to McDonnell Douglas and the other major US companies that produced components for the F/A-18, and had to comply with the requirements of the FMS program. The Australian Government hoped that Singapore and New Zealand would purchase Australian-built Hornets, but this did not eventuate. The Canadian Government expressed interest in purchasing 25 Australian-built F/A-18As in 1988 in order to increase its force of these aircraft after they had ceased to be manufactured in the United States, but this did not lead to any sales.|$|E
5|$|While at {{high school}} in Fayetteville, Skip played for the school's {{football}} team at the quarterback position, bringing moderate success to the <b>program.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> high school junior, he visited Notre Dame and met with head football coach Gerry Faust and head basketball coach Digger Phelps. In his final year of high school, Skip was denied admission to Notre Dame due to average grades and his failure to learn a foreign language. Coaches Faust and Phelps encouraged Skip to enroll at nearby Holy Cross College, located adjacent to the university in Notre Dame, Indiana. After two years of study at Holy Cross, Skip had improved his grades and transferred to Notre Dame. After his first year, Skip {{decided he wanted to}} speak with Coach Faust about walking on to the football team during his senior year. The discussions were cut short, however, as after the 1985 season, Coach Faust resigned. Replacing Faust was Skip's father, Lou, who eagerly accepted his son as a walk-on. Skip began spring practice before the 1986 season as a quarterback, but quickly changed to flanker due to his lack of throwing ability. As a flanker, he earned 54yards on three receptions at the Blue-Gold intra-squad game in the spring of 1986. During the fall of 1986, Skip played in all 11 games on special teams. He never caught a pass, but rushed once for one yard.|$|E
