These methods often use a linear regression model {{defined in terms of}} auxiliary variables whose values are assumed known for all <b>population</b> units. <b>Information</b> on <b>networks</b> represents another form of auxiliary information that might increase the precision of these estimators, particularly if {{it is reasonable to assume}} that networked population units have similar values of the survey variable. Linear models that use networks as a source of auxiliary information include autocorrelation, disturbance and contextual models. In this paper we focus on social networks, and investigate how much of the population structure of the network needs to be known for estimation methods based on these models to be useful. In particular, we use simulation to compare the performance of the best linear unbiased predictor under a model that ignores the network with model-based estimators that incorporate <b>network</b> <b>information.</b> Our results show that incorporating <b>network</b> <b>information</b> via a contextual model seems to be the most appropriate approach.
