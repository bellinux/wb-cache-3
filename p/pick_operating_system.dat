50|$|The <b>Pick</b> <b>{{operating}}</b> <b>system</b> {{was another}} operating system {{available on a}} wide variety of hardware brands. Commercially released in 1973 its core was a BASIC-like language called Data/BASIC and a SQL-style database manipulation language called ENGLISH. Licensed to a large variety of manufacturers and vendors, by the early 1980s observers saw the <b>Pick</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> as a strong competitor to Unix.|$|E

40|$|An {{order picking}} system that {{requires}} pickers {{to move in}} a clockwise direction around a picking line with fixed locations is considered. The problem {{is divided into three}} tiers. The tier in which orders must be sequenced is addressed. Eight tour construction heuristics are developed and implemented for an order <b>picking</b> <b>system</b> <b>operating</b> in unidirectional <b>picking</b> lines. Two classes of tour construction heuristics the tour construction starting position () and the tour construction ending position () are developed to sequence orders in a picking line. All algorithms are tested and compared using real life data sets. The best solution quality was obtained by a heuristic with adaptations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Virtualization enables {{installation}} and running of multiple virtual machines {{on the same}} computer <b>system.</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>system</b> that communicates directly with hardware {{is known as the}} host <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> whereas virtual <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> have all the features of a real <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> but they run inside the host <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> A virtual machine is separated from the computer hardware resources and it runs on the emulated hardware. Performance of the virtual <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> running on the same computer system hardware depends on the performance of the host <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper we study how different host <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> influence virtual machine performance. Windows XP®, Windows Vista ™ and Windows 7 ™ are used as host <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> using Windows Vista as a virtual <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> Performance measurement of the virtual <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> is done in the same controlled conditions for all three host <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> using benchmark applications. Performance measurement results show that the virtual <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> has the best performance when Windows 7 is used as the host <b>operating</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, Solaris Zones {{supports}} multiple guest <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> running {{under the}} same <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> such as Solaris 10. Guest <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> can use the same kernel level with the same <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> version, or can be a separate copy of the <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> with a different kernel version using Solaris Kernel Zones. Solaris native Zones also requires that the host <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> is a version of Solaris; other <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> from other manufacturers are not supported. However, Solaris Branded Zones {{would need to be}} used to have other <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> as zones.|$|R

50|$|An {{embedded}} <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> is an <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> for {{embedded computer}} <b>systems.</b> These <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> {{are designed to}} be compact, efficient at resource usage, and reliable, forsaking many functions that non-embedded computer <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> provide, and which may not be used by the specialized applications they run.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture that allows multiple isolated commodity <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> to run concurrently on a microkernel-based <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> without restricting the CPU architecture of guest <b>operating</b> <b>systems.</b> There are several systems that can execute multiple guest <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> {{by using a}} virtual machine monitor or a microkernel-based <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> Almost all of them, however, require that the CPU architecture of a guest <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> and a host <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> are identical and the guest <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> needs to be modified. Our architecture {{does not require the}} both of them and the prototype system that we have developed achieved the execution of multiple guest <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> such as Linux and FreeBSD compiled for several CPU architecture without the modification of them. Since it involved decreasing the performance of a guest <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> we propose several techniques to improve the performance in this paper. Future embedded system will become more complex, so our approach offers a new way to reuse existing applications and <b>operating</b> <b>systems.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|OpenBSD {{claims to}} be the only <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> that is fully secure by default. This, however, does not mean it's {{inherently}} the most secure <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> because that depends on the definition of an <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> There are many <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> that are not capable of networking with other systems. Thus, considering the amount of network-based security compromises today, one can argue such an <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> is more secure. OpenBSD is a network <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} difference between most embedded <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> and desktop <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> {{is that the}} application, including the <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> is usually statically linked together into a single executable image. Unlike a desktop <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> the embedded <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> does not load and execute applications. [...] This means {{that the system is}} only able to run a single application.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, CMC {{merged with}} Microdata Corporation, a California-based {{computer}} company, whose 1973-released Reality operating and database environment product CMC was also distributing.

CMC Leasing Limited (the official trading name) then {{changed its name to}} Microdata UK limited, aka MUK. The company then started UK manufacture of the Reality range of computer systems in its manufacturing factory in Maxted Road, Hemel Hempstead.

50|$|Based {{around a}} {{relational}} database, Dynix was originally written in Pick/BASIC, and {{run on the}} <b>PICK</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> In 1990, it was ported to VMark's uniVerse BASIC programming language, and run on Unix-based servers, with uniVerse acting as a PICK emulation layer between the software and the operating system. In the late 1990s, Dynix was once again re-ported, this time for Windows NT-based servers; again, uniVerse acted as a Pick emulator between the software and the operating system.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, NCR {{introduced}} the System 3000, a seven-level family of computers based on Intel's 386 and 486 CPUs.

While most libraries purchased {{the same type of}} servers as Dynix was using, there were installations done on platforms such as DEC and MIPS, Sequent, Sequoia (which used a very expensive native PICK), HP's Unix servers, etc. The Dynix corp. could do software-only installs to any compliant Unix because of uniVerse's scalability and adaptability.|$|E
