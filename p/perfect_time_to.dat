25|$|Law {{decided that}} the November party conference was the <b>perfect</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{announce}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Referendum Pledge, and that Lord Lansdowne should do it, because he had been leader in the House of Lords when the pledge was made and because of his relatively low profile during the original tariff reform dispute. When the conference opened the British political world was febrile; on 12 November the opposition had narrowly defeated the government on an amendment to the Home Rule Bill, and the next evening, amidst hysterical shouting from the opposition, Asquith attempted to introduce a motion reversing the previous vote. As the MPs filed {{out at the end of}} the day Winston Churchill began taunting the opposition, and in his anger Ronald McNeil hurled a copy of Standing Orders of the House at Churchill, hitting him on the head. Law refused to condemn the events, and it seems apparent that while he had played no part in organising them they had been planned by the party Whips. As party leader, he was most likely aware of the plans even if he did not actively participate.|$|E

Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan each scored in the shootout to win it for the Rangers Two days later, the Rangers hosted the Philadelphia Flyers. Ryan Callahan scored a pair of goals in the first period, and Rick Nash scored two in the third to lead the Rangers to a 4–2 victory. On March 7, the Rangers played the Islanders in Nassau Coliseum. Nash scored a late goal to prevent a 1–0 loss, and the game went to overtime. Rangers connected on the power play and Marian Gaborik found the <b>perfect</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{get out of his}} scoring slump. The next day, Rangers lost 3–2 to the Ottawa Senators at home. On March 10, the Rangers topped the Capitals 4–1 in Washington. On March 12, Derek Stepan scored his first NHL short-handed goal against Buffalo, but the Rangers lost 3–1. Two days later, the Rangers were defeated 3–1 in Winnipeg, and two days after that, they were shutout 3–0 in Pittsburgh. On March 18, Rangers ended their three-game slump by beating the Carolina Hurricanes 2–1 in a shootout. The next day, the Rangers traveled to New Jersey. Michael Del Zotto gave the Rangers a 1–0 lead, but the Devils were quick to tie it. Carl Hagelin gave them a 2–1 lead, but again the Devils tied it.

[...] Chambers explained of his decision to leave: [...] "I was worried about telling the bosses, but I wrote a long letter to the producers explaining my decision and they were incredibly nice about it.

At the Karapoti Classic, she only just fended off Jill Westenra. For the UCI World Cup race, Lynch was in top form and came sixth, well within her aim of a top 10 finish, and just days away from her 40th birthday. After that, she won the remaining rounds of the national championship races in which she started.

There are a few things that became a major concern associated with Delayed Cord Clamping, one of which is the increase in blood volume due to an increase in the number of erythrocytes which led to occurrence of neonatal polycythemia which later can lead to various complications. Polycythemia in neonates is a situation where the value of venous blood hematokrit over 65 % (0. 65) or the amount of hemoglobin more than 22 gr/Dl.

500|$|Co-writer Frank Spotnitz {{described}} the episode as a [...] "fortunate accident". Late {{in the fourth}} season of the show Gillian Anderson left the show for a week to film her part in the film The Mighty. The producers, knowing {{that they would have}} to write an episode without Dana Scully, decided it was not fair to have David Duchovny carry the same workload as in a normal episode considering her absence. As such, a story was devised in which his involvement would be light. This resulted in the decision to write, for the second year in a row, an episode focused on Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). Howard Gordon, having written the previous Skinner-centric episode, [...] "Avatar", joined Spotnitz and the two wrote the episode over a weekend while another Gordon-written episode, [...] "Synchrony", was in production. The writers felt that this was the <b>perfect</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bring in Skinner's deal with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) to cure Scully's cancer, made in the episode [...] "Memento Mori". Frank Spotnitz said of Skinner's deal, [...] "The hard thing for Skinner was that we had to keep him in the middle. We had him tell Mulder not to bargain with The Smoking Man in order to save Scully's life. And then he himself struck a Faustian bargain with the Cigarette Smoking Man and was in his debt for some kind." ...|$|E
500|$|Paige {{transferred}} to the New York production of Sunset Boulevard to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've come home at last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was just the most <b>perfect</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was the most terrible feeling.... I'd felt I'd lost something so very important to me.
