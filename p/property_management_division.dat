40|$|Many {{initiatives}} {{executed by}} local authority {{to ensure their}} service will improve continuously. Those initiatives were involving various actions implemented by local authority including setup the <b>property</b> <b>management</b> <b>division</b> in each organisations. Local authority <b>property</b> <b>management</b> <b>division</b> (LAPMD) is a divison that usually been given the responsibility to manage local authority properties. Nevertheless, the roles that have been played by these divisions are not uniformed for they have diversified objectives and functions and also different from each other. This situation occurs from a condition where these departments were first established {{to have their own}} benefits thus leaving behind the needs for a uniform organisational foundation. Therefore, this non unified condition has led to various negative effects particularly to local authority organisations themselves hence showing that their practice in managing property is still at an unsatisfactory level. On the other hand, this research is carried out to help achieve four main objectives among which are to identify the needs for establishing the LAPMD, to identify the motive in determining the objectives of LAPMD, to identify the main functions of LAPMD and to develop frameworks in deploying each main function. This research has been done in four levels of execution which are literature review, pilot study, survey study and benchmarking study. Data gathered from this research has been analysed through qualitative and quantitative approaches which includes Alpha Cronbach analysis, Mann-Whitney analysis, Kruskal-Wallis analysis, frequency analysis, min analysis, correlation analysis and content analysis. The research findings have identified seven factors that can be considered as the needs for the establishment of LAPMD. Their service motives can be concluded as the most important for LAPMD objectives. On the other hand, tenancy management function and maintenance management function have been identified as two main functions of LAPMD. Furthermore, this research has developed a framework for the tenancy management function with 16 working steps and also a framework for maintenance management function with 18 working steps. All working steps have been categorised under four basic management processes among which are planning, organising, executing and controlling...|$|E
40|$|Enterprise {{knowledge}} portals offer, {{among other}} characteristics, a centralized access point for information {{as well as}} a wide range of tools and content for individual knowledge workers to personalize to suit their daily tasks. Such tasks often include the collection, aggregation, and analysis of data/information as well as collaborative work among workers to solve problems and make decisions. Leveraging on a quantitative–qualitative research approach including the use of a prior research instrument developed for the elicitation of requirements for collaboration tools, this paper seeks to identify the primary and secondary functions of a knowledge portal for knowledge workers in the <b>property</b> <b>management</b> <b>division</b> of a housing organization in Hong Kong. Although portals are often treated as a kind of stand-alone enterprise knowledge management systems, proper planning and deployment of a portal with appropriate functionalities and a widely agreed content classification scheme can also help to enhance the navigation and presentation of knowledge assets in a knowledge-leveraged organization. In particular, the introduction of a federated search engine can save considerable time in conducting (multiple) searches; selective Web 2. 0 tools can help to foster collaborative work as well as help knowledge workers to reduce time spent on search but keep pace with nominated topics on a timely basis. Drawing on the existing literature as well as the authors' experience in working with many other organizations to deploy portals and relevant tools in the Asia Pacific, the initial recommendations are further consolidated to form a two-phase deployment with the aim of enhancing the probability of success for the knowledge journey in the housing organization.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} {{the manner in which}} the knowledge management (KM) concept can be implemented in <b>property</b> <b>management</b> companies in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach – The KM strategies for <b>property</b> <b>management</b> companies were designed and then tested among the <b>property</b> <b>management</b> companies in Malaysia. Sixteen companies were involved in this research to provide empirical results of the KM concept implementation in <b>property</b> <b>management</b> organisations. Findings – The research findings suggest that the KM concept is becoming increasingly important and that the <b>property</b> <b>management</b> companies are practising some of the relevant activities. The findings also integrate the concept of KM and <b>property</b> <b>management</b> activities. Research limitations/implications – The research is based only on 16 companies registered under the Board of Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents, Malaysia, which governs <b>property</b> <b>management</b> activities in Malaysia. Originality/value – This paper proposes to <b>property</b> <b>management</b> players to put into practice the KM concept within their organisations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - To re-examine {{the role}} of <b>property</b> <b>management</b> from an {{institutional}} economics perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The role of <b>property</b> <b>management</b> is explored by asking why <b>property</b> <b>management</b> has emerged from the first principle. Then, an analytical framework for <b>property</b> <b>management</b> is put forward. Different dimensions of institutional arrangements, ranging from open access to communal private property or solely owned private property, {{are discussed in the}} real estate property context. Findings - The paper shows that a unique feature of <b>property</b> <b>management</b> is its role in excluding outsiders and resolving internal conflicts among the stakeholders of communal private property. Research implications/limitations - This approach opens up a new research agenda for <b>property</b> <b>management.</b> The adoption of different institutional arrangements in <b>property</b> <b>management</b> can be explained by further studies. Practical implications - The efficiency of different institutional arrangements for the governance of communal private property is situation-specific. An endogenous assumption of institutional regime <b>property</b> <b>management</b> practice greatly expands the flexibility of management. Originality/value - This paper is the first to apply an analytical framework for interpreting the institutional arrangements in <b>property</b> <b>management.</b> © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – It {{has been}} said that people's {{expectation}} towards their living space has been increased. They have a higher requirement not only for the facilities it provides, but also for the quality of <b>property</b> <b>management</b> services. <b>Property</b> <b>management</b> is now {{regarded as one of the}} important considerations of buyers in purchasing a property. This research paper aims to investigate the significance of the quality of <b>property</b> <b>management</b> to <b>property</b> buyers. Design/methodology/approach – ISO 9001 Certification and HKMA Quality Award (HKMAQA) are used as the measurement of the quality of <b>property</b> <b>management.</b> The paper used a hedonic price model to determine whether there is a relationship between <b>property</b> <b>management</b> and <b>property</b> price and the inference of <b>property</b> <b>management</b> on <b>property</b> price if there is such relationship. Seven private residential estates in Ma On Shan with similar locational characteristics were selected in the research. Findings – The empirical results show that <b>property</b> <b>management</b> has a significant and positive relationship with property prices. People are willing to pay 4. 92 percent and 2. 84 percent more on properties managed by a <b>property</b> <b>management</b> company that is ISO 9001 ‐certified and HKMAQA winner respectively. Research limitations/implications – The implications of the results imply that well‐recognized <b>property</b> <b>management</b> increases the value of a property and attracts second‐hand property buyers, and quality <b>property</b> <b>management</b> adds value to properties and hence increases the property price. Originality/value – The research has contributed an indication of the amount a household would be willing to pay on quality <b>property</b> <b>management</b> services as a reference for investors, users, developers and <b>property</b> <b>management</b> services providers.
