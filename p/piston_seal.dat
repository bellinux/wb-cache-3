50|$|The HW (Hermann Weihrauch) 35 was {{the first}} air rifle with Weihrauchs famous Rekord 2-stage {{adjustable}} trigger and used a conventional piston and spring assembly.

30|$|Furthermore, no basic {{differentiation}} {{of the energy}} balance is made between a displacement and working piston because that has only a constructive meaning. The appearing leaky mass flow about the <b>piston</b> <b>seals</b> (which can be predicted mathematically only inexactly) is extremely low at a displacement compressor due to the lower pressure differences, and the effects for the process can be neglected.|$|R
5000|$|The {{parts of}} the {{hydraulic}} cylinder that are distorted ( [...] piston rod, rod seal, <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> and/ or head of rod), need to be either repaired or completely replaced with new parts. The seals can be repacked {{with the help of}} a hydraulic cylinder seal kit. These kits will have seals and suitable o-rings.

5000|$|Designers have {{a number}} of {{problems}} to overcome in designing axial piston pumps. One is managing to be able to manufacture a pump with the fine tolerances necessary for efficient operation. The mating faces between the rotary piston-cylinder assembly and the stationary pump body have to be almost a perfect seal while the rotary part turns at perhaps 3000 rpm. The pistons are usually less than half an inch (13 mm) in diameter with similar stroke lengths. Keeping the wall to <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> tight means that very small clearances are involved and that materials have to be closely matched for similar coefficient of expansion.|$|E
50|$|Piston seals were a {{perennial}} problem at this time. Those for large stationary engines, working at low pressures, were sealed {{by a variety}} of methods including leather cup washers, pools of standing water and even a poultice of cow dung. As working pressures increased, which had been an essential part of turning the steam engine into the steam locomotive, demands on the <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> increased further. Pistons were now mostly sealed by having oakum rope wrapped around them in a groove, often smeared with tallow. Keeping the rope seal moist, thus swollen, was recognised as an important factor in achieving a good seal. As the steam spring cylinders were in {{the lower part of the}} boiler, below the water line, it was expected that they would seal well. Despite this, they continued to give trouble with leakage and were eventually removed and replaced with iron or steel leaf springs. Wood in 1831 illustrates one of the Killingworth locomotives, now fitted with metal leaf springs and also coupling rods.|$|E

The seal gets “hung up” at one point on its diameter (against the cylinder wall) and slides and rolls at the same time.

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2010 The U. S Environmental Protection Agency‘s (EPA) National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) is in {{the process}} of {{improving}} hydraulic hybrid technology, with specific application in improving the fuel economy of delivery trucks for the United Parcel Service (UPS). The hydraulic hybrids utilize a high and low pressure accumulator system with a pump and motor to store and transfer energy to the vehicle. A problem that the EPA is facing is the permeation of nitrogen gas from the high pressure accumulator into the hydraulic fluid. This gas eventually can build up and cause damage to various components of the hydraulic system due to cavitations.

40|$|The {{design of}} the gas seals used in {{centrifugal}} compressors and axial turbines requires to consider not only their aptitude to reduce leakage, but also their contribution to the overall dynamics of the machine. Honeycomb and hole pattern annular seals are often employed in compressors for the end balance <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> or as the central balance <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> in a back-to-back arrangement. In contrast to labyrinth seals, they show a beneficial damping effect. In order to obtain an effective tool for predicting the leakage and the dynamic response of honeycomb seals, a bulk flow model has been devised in the past and, implemented in numerical codes, it is presently used in the design process. This kind of codes, however, require simplifying assumptions: in particular, one reference code available to the authors adopts the hypothesis of isothermal process. As the required level of confidence in seal design is increasing, an experimental validation and possibly some refinement are needed. In this work, the bulk flow model was reviewed and the sensitivity to different hypotheses was explored. New experimental data from a high pressure test rig were compared {{with the results of}} simulations...|$|E

Reciprocating piston compressors are commonly available as either oil-lubricated or non-lubricated; for high pressure (350 - 700 bar), non-lubricated compressors are preferred to avoid oil contamination of the Hydrogen. Expert know-how on <b>piston</b> <b>sealing</b> and packing rings can ensure that reciprocating compressors outperform the competing technologies in terms of MTBO (Mean Time Between Overhaul).|$|R

To reveal tribological behaviour of reciprocating seals {{it is necessary to}} analyse the relationships of seal design, tribological features and the main operating characteristics. For environmental protection leakage control has great importance. Leakage calculation of reciprocating high pressure hydraulic seals is based on the sealing pressure distribution profiles, i. e. diagrams which are playing an important role in research and {{development of}} piston and <b>piston</b> rod <b>seals</b> too.

50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, when the brake pedal is pressed, a pushrod exerts {{force on the}} piston(s) in the master cylinder, causing fluid from the brake fluid reservoir to flow into a pressure chamber through a compensating port.

50|$|BAM is commercially {{available}} {{and is being}} studied for potential applications. For example, <b>pistons,</b> <b>seals</b> and blades on pumps could be coated with BAM or BAM + TiB2 to reduce friction between parts and to increase wear resistance. The reduction in friction would reduce energy use. BAM could also be coated onto cutting tools. The reduced friction would lessen the force necessary to cut an object, extend tool life, and possibly allow increased cutting speeds.

40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 20 This paper {{discusses}} the rotordynamic instability problems experienced with two separate centrifugal compressors. While {{the root causes}} of the instabilities are very different, the analysis methodology of reconciling the rotordynamic model with measured vibration data was the same. The first problem occurred with a propylene compressor in a Gulf Coast chemical plant that had experienced high journal bearing temperatures for several years. A modified bearing was installed to alleviate the temperature problem; however, a large subsynchronous vibration appeared after the new bearings were installed. A lateral stability analysis shows that the compressor with the modified bearings was very stable with the aerodynamic destabilizing effect predicted by the Alford and/or Wachel equation. A comparison analysis was made of the stability predicted with the original bearings (which were stable) as well as the modified bearings (which were not). This allowed the user to determine the magnitude of the destabilizing forces present in the compressor and design a new bearing that was both stable and would operate at an acceptable temperature. The new bearing was installed and the compressor has operated without the subsynchronous vibration for {{the past year and a}} half. The second problem occurred with a very similar ethylene compressor in a Midwest ethylene plant. The compressor had operated for over two years after an overhaul with low vibration. Then a subsynchronous vibration appeared that was very erratic, but was slowly increasing in amplitude over time. To solve the problem, a rotordynamic analysis was performed that suggested that replacing the bearing would solve the stability problem However, comparison between the measure field vibration and the rotordynamic model did not agree on all points. A more indepth look at the compressor revealed that the increase in subsynchronous vibration was tracking very closely with the balance line differential pressure. This fact, along with the characteristics of the balance <b>piston</b> <b>seal,</b> suggested that a bearing change alone may not completely address the problem A new balance <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> was designed to reduce its destabilizing effects on the rotor. The compressor was inspected during the next scheduled downtime to determine the cause of the high vibration and install the new balance <b>piston</b> <b>seal</b> and bearings. Examination of the internals revealed a large seal rub in the compressor, but at the dry gas seals, not the balance piston. The rub was addressed and the subsynchronous vibration was eliminated. While the exact source of the destabilizing force was not correctly ?guessed? before disassembly, the indepth rotordynamic analysis did reveal that there was a large destabilizing force in the compressor, and a bearing change alone would not eliminate the vibration. The compressor has been operating without the subsynchronous problem for the past year since the modification...|$|E
