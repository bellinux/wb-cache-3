40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux {{disease has}} been very often in {{children}} {{and one of its}} most critical complications is the <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> disease. The diagnosis of <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> is obtained based on the endoscopic changes and the histologic features. The pressure reduction of the lower esophageal sphincter is one of the elements of the esophagitis pathogenesis. The pressure is related with the length of the esophageal abdominal segment, which can be measured by ultrasonography. The research presented in this paper aims to relate ultrasonographic measurements of esophageal abdominal segment length with endoscopic changes and with esophageal biopsy obtained from children with gastroesophagel reflux disease. We submitted 16 children with gastroesophagel reflux disease, between 10 and 156 months old (median 63. 5 months old), to endoscopy and to esophageal biopsy. We verified the following results from endoscopy and biopsy: six of the 16 patients had endoscopic <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> and, in five of these (six patients), the same diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Ten of the 16 patients had normal endoscopy, but the biopsy of four of these 10 patients showed histologic changes compatible with esophagitis. We observed no relationship between endoscopy and biopsy, when all degrees of histologic change were used to diagnose esophagitis. However, we found high relationship when the mild histologic changes were considered as only a consequence of the reflux. We verified the following results from ultrasonography: five of the six patients with endoscopic <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> and all patients with esophagitis determined by biopsy (excluding those with mild histologic changes) had reduced esophageal abdominal segment length. In conclusion, we have found relationship between endoscopic changes and histologic features in the diagnosis of esophagitis and correlation between the reduced esophageal abdominal segment length and the presence of esophagitis...|$|E

40|$|Context - The {{surgical}} treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease is indicated {{in patients with}} a chronic condition when proton pump inhibitors therapy is ineffective or when symptoms are persistently recurrent. Fundoplication failure occurrence has been detected in some patients and highlights a needing of monitoring esophageal post-surgical condition since that clinical symptoms are not sensitive enough for indicating fundoplication failure. Aims - To identify the frequency of a disrupted wrap in the postoperative period and to evaluate esophageal complications related with gastroesophageal reflux recurrence in children and adolescents. Methods - The study was cross-sectional, prospective and descriptive, including 45 patients (16 months- 16. 9 years) who had undergone Nissen fundoplication in a school hospital. Twenty six patients (57. 8 %) were neurologically impaired. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed {{in order to determine}} fundoplication integrity, endoscopic and histopathological esophageal condition.

AimThe aim {{of the study was}} to determine the prevalence of significant endoscopic lesions in Egyptian patients presenting with dyspepsia in relation to age. Materials and methodsThis was a retrospective study. Data on patients presenting with dyspepsia and scheduled for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy between January 2000 and January 2013 were collected. ResultsOne thousand four hundred patients with dyspepsia (31 % of all endoscopies) were assessed by UGI endoscopy. Fifty-one percent were male. The mean age was 43 ± 15 years. Four hundred and fifty patients (32 %) had a history of smoking, 388 (32 %) were taking aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 22 (2 %) were consuming alcohol. Endoscopy revealed normal findings or miscellaneous irrelevant findings in 913 patients (65 %). Significant endoscopic findings were diagnosed in 487 (35 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To obtain {{biochemical}} {{evidence that}} Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the precursor of most adenocarcinomas (Adc) of the esophagus and cardia. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Based on morphologic data, BE was previously proposed as the precursor of most Adc of the esophagus. This hypothesis would receive strong support if biochemical evidence {{were found to}} demonstrate a pattern common to BE and Adc of the esophagus and cardia. METHODS: We studied the presence of intestinal-type proteins sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and crypt Cell Antigen (CCAg) in BE, Barrett's Adc, and esophageal-cardial Adc without BE. In each case specimens were collected from normal esophagus, stomach, tumor, and BE mucosa when present. To study related conditions, five specimens of <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> and of squamous cell carcinoma were also analyzed. An indirect immunofluorescence technique was employed and sections were analyzed with laser confocal microscopy imaging. RESULTS: Most Barrett's mucosa specimens stained positively for SI (93 %) and CCAg (89 %). These proteins were detected in BE independently {{of the type of}} metaplasia, the coexistence of dysplasia, or the presence of associated Adc. SI and CCAg were present in 25 (96 %) and 24 (92 %) of the cases of Adc respectively. No statistical difference was detected in SI and CCAg expression between Adc samples with and without BE, between BE and Adc samples with or without BE, and between tumors located in the esophagus versus the cardia. No staining for these proteins was detected in stomach or esophageal mucosa, in submucosal glands of the esophagus, in <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> or squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: These data show that BE and Adc of the esophagus and cardia have a similar phenotype and support the hypothesis that most of these tumors probably originate from preexisting BE...|$|E

40|$|One hundred sixty-five {{patients}} with reflux <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> {{have been treated}} by Nissen fundoplication. When compared {{with a group of}} 104 patients reported five years ago, the incidence of persistent or recurrent esophagitis remains approximately the same (10 % versus 8 %). This is consistent with the assumption that the Nissen procedure when initially successful tends to remain so and that late recurrence appears to be uncommon. The unpleasant postoperative sequela which we have termed the "gas-bloat syndrome" was noted in 1971 to be present in the early postoperative period in approximately one-half the patients. Late follow-up, however, averaging four years indicates a marked reduction in this disorder with either absence or clinical insignificance in 87 % of patients. Nonetheless, moderate symptoms persist in 11 % and severe symptoms requiring active treatment in 2 %. Manometric study of the lower esophageal sphincter indicates nearly a three-fold increase in resting pressure following Nissen fundoplication (p less than. 001). It is hoped that manometric study will provide a more reliable prognostic measure of sphincter restoration than the measurement of pH across the gastroesophageal junction...|$|E

To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} flexible esophagoscopy and chromoendoscopy with Lugol’s solution in the detection of early esophageal carcinomas (second primary carcinomas) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck (HNSCC). Methods. All patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC underwent office-based Lugol's chromoendoscopy. After flexible esophagoscopy with white light, 3. 0 % Lugol's iodine solution was sprayed over the entire esophageal mucosa. Areas with less-intense staining (LVLs) were evaluated and biopsies taken. Results. 132 patients with HNSCC were enrolled in this study. The most frequent primary tumors were oropharyngeal (49 / 132), tumors of the oral cavity (36 / 132), and larynx (35 / 132). The majority of subjects (107 / 132 patients, 81. 1 %) had advanced HNSCC carcinomas (stages III and IV). Multiple LVLs were discovered in 24 subjects (18. 2 %) and no LVLs in 108 (81. 8 %) subjects.

Until recently, medical treatment with a proton pumpinhibitor or an H 2 blocker has been the treatment of choice for patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) because of the difficulty in accomplishing curative resection of gastrinomas, which are often metastatic and multiple.

40|$|Between 1964 and 1984, 430 {{patients}} with complex reflux problems were managed by a modified Collis gastroplasty and partial fundoplication.

The addition of gastroplasty in this second group obviates the risk of even minimal tension on the repair. Follow-up is complete in 382 patients (90 %), and extends 1 - 20 years.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Paraesophageal hernias {{represent}} {{advanced degrees}} of sliding hiatus hernia with intrathoracic {{displacement of the}} intraesophageal junction. Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs in most cases, resulting in acquired short esophagus, which should influence the type of repair selected. Methods: Between 1960 and 1996, 94 patients with massive, incarcerated paraesophageal hiatus hernia were operated on at the Toronto General Hospital. The mean age was 64 years (39 to 85 years), with a female to male ratio of 1. 8 : 1. Organoaxial volvulus was present in 50 % of cases. Clinical presentation in these patients included postprandial pain in 56 %, dysphagia in 48 %, chronic iron deficiency anemia in 38 %, and aspiration in 29 %. Symptomatic reflux, either present or remote, was recorded in 83 % of cases. All patients underwent endoscopy by the operating surgeon. In 91 of 94 patients, the esophagogastric junction {{was found to be}} above the diaphragmatic hiatus, denoting a sliding type of hiatus hernia. Gross, endoscopic <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> was observed in 36 % of patients: ulcerative esophagitis in 22 % and <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> with stricture in 14 %. A complete preoperative esophageal motility study was obtained for 41 patients. The lower sphincter was hypotensive in 21 patients (51 %), and the amplitude of peristalsis in the distal esophagus was diminished in 24 patients (59 %). These abnormalities are both features of significant gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 13 recent, consecutive patients with paraesophageal hernia, the distance between the upper and lower esophageal sphincters was measured during manometry. The average distance was 15. 4  ± 2. 33 cm (11 to 20 cm), which is consistent with acquired short esophagus. The normal distance is 20. 4 cm ± 1. 9 (p < 0. 0001). Results: All 94 patients were treated surgically: 97 % had a transthoracic repair with fundoplication. A gastroplasty was added in 75 cases (80 %) because of clearly defined or presumed short esophagus. There were two operative deaths, and two patients were never followed up. Among the 90 available patients, the mean follow-up was 94 months; median follow-up was 72 months. Seventy-two patients (80 %) are free of symptoms (excellent result); 13 (13 %) have inconsequential symptoms requiring no therapy (good result); and three patients (4 %) are improved but have symptoms requiring medical therapy or interval dilatation (fair result). Two patients had poor results because of recurrent hernia and severe reflux. Both were successfully treated by reoperation with the addition of gastroplasty because of acquired shortening, which was not recognized at the first operation. Conclusions: Most of these 94 patients had symptoms or endoscopic, manometric, and operative findings that were consistent with a sliding hiatus hernia. There was a high incidence of endoscopic reflux esophagitis and of acquired short esophagus. True paraesophageal hernia, with the esophagogastric junction in a normal abdominal location, appears rare. Our observations were supported by measurements obtained at preoperative endoscopy and manometry, and by findings at the time of surgical repair. These observations support the choice of a transthoracic approach for repair in most patients. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 115 : 53 - 62...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: esophageal {{stenosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious problems in patients with <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis.</b> It may require esophageal resection and replacement, if no other treatment is effective. Patients and methods: we report a successfully managed case of persistent esophageal stricture. The patient was a 10 -year-old boy suffering from gastroesophageal reflux since birth. He has an esophageal peptic stricture which was treated with multiple dilatation at another hospital (about 24 times). The boy joined our Unit for gastroesophageal reflux and severe esophageal stricture confirmed with contrast X-ray. He could only eat liquid foods and had a growth retardation. He underwent endoscopy which shows severe esophagitis with mucosal bleeding. He also had a severe anemia, for which he underwent blood transfusion. We decided to submit the boy to Toupet laparoscopic fundoplication, endoscopic intraluminal dilatation with balloon and diathermic needle and therapy with PPI (protonic pump inhibitors) and corticostheroids. The little patient needed 7 endoscopic dilatations. Results: one month after the last dilatation he has grown, can eat all kind of foods, his blood count is normal and X-ray and endoscopy both show resolution of the stenosis and esophagitis. Conclusions: we report this case because we think that it’s a complex and interesting case. This patient was a candidate for esophageal replacement. We managed to save his native esophagus, treating gastroesophageal reflux and peptic stenosis with surgery and endoscopic dilatations, and reducing fibrosis and scarring with corticosteroid therapy. We thus think that this therapeutic procedure can be an optimal choice to contemplate before considering native esophagus replacement...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT – Context- Whether Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} is a protective or {{predisposing factor for}} the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease remains controversial. The most virulent strains, such as those expressing the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), and the site of gastric colonization have been correlated with the prevention or development of esophagitis. Aim- To determine the incidence of erosive esophagitis following eradication of H. pylori in patients with peptic ulcer disease and to evaluate the association of erosive esophagitis with virulent strains of H. pylori and the site of gastric colonization. Methods- Triple therapy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin was administered to 159 patients with peptic ulcer disease. Endoscopy, histopathology, urease and carbon- 14 urea breath tests were performed prior to treatment, at 3 months and 1 year following treatment. Genotyping of H. pylori strains using polymerase chain reaction was performed separately on samples from the corpus and antrum. Results- One year after treatment, 148 successfully treated patients were reevaluated. Twenty-eight patients (19 %) had erosive esophagitis, classified as Los Angeles grade A in 24 and B in 4. The samples taken from the corpus were CagA-positive in 18 patients (64 %), while the samples taken from the antrum were CagA-positive in 21 patients (75 %). Conclusions- The incidence of erosive <b>esophagitis</b> in <b>peptic</b> ulcer patients who had their H. pylori eradicated was 19 %. No correlation was found between the gastric site colonized by H. pylori or strains expressing CagA and the prevention or development of erosive esophagitis in patients with peptic ulcer disease, 1 year after infection eradication.

40|$|Epidemiological data {{indicate}} that emotional stress and depression might influence the development of gastrointestianl dis-orders and cancers, but {{the relationship between the}} two is still unclear. The aim was to investigate the effect of stress/depres-sion on the prevalence of digestive diseases. In addition, we tried to identify whether stress and depression are risk factors for these diseases. Methods A total of 23 698 subjects who underwent a medical check-up including upper and lower endoscopy were enrolled. By review-ing the subject’s self-reporting questionnaire and endoscopic findings, we investigated the digestive diseases, including func-tional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), reflux <b>esophagitis,</b> <b>peptic</b> ulcer disease, and adenoma and carcinoma of the stomach and colon. Stress and depression scores were measured by the Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument and Beck’s Depression Inventory, respectively (Korean version). Results Stress and depression were related to FD, IBS, and reflux esophagitis. Depression was also linked to peptic ulcer disease and adenoma/carcinoma of the colon and stomach. Multivariate analysis revealed that stress and depression were independent ris...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Older {{individuals}} {{represent a}} substantial proportion of international travelers. Because of physiological {{changes and the}} increased probability of underlying medical conditions, older travelers might be at higher risk {{for at least some}} travel-associated diseases. METHODS: With the aim of describing the epidemiology of travel-associated diseases in older adults, medical data were prospectively collected on ill international travelers presenting to GeoSentinel sites from 1997 to 2009. Seven thousand thirty-four patients aged 60 years and over were identified as older travelers and were compared to 56, 042 patients aged 18 - 45 years, who were used as the young adult reference population. RESULTS: The proportionate morbidity of several etiological diagnoses was higher in older ill travelers compared to younger ill, including notably lower respiratory tract infections, high-altitude pulmonary edema, phlebitis and pulmonary embolism, arthropod bites, severe malaria, rickettsiosis, gastritis, <b>peptic</b> ulcers, <b>esophagitis</b> and gastroesophageal reflux disease, trauma and injuries, urinary tract infections, heart disease, and death. In contrast, acute diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infections, flu and flu-like illnesses, malaria, dengue, genital infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and schistosomiasis proportionate morbidities were lower among the older group. CONCLUSION: Older ill travelers are more likely to suffer from certain life-threatening diseases and would benefit from reinforcement of specific preventive measures including use of anti-thrombosis compression stockings and sufficient hydration and exercises during long-distance flights, hand hygiene, use of disposable handkerchiefs, consideration of face-masks in crowded conditions, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, progressive acclimatization to altitude, consideration of acetazolamide, and use of repellents and mosquito nets. Antibiotics for the presumptive treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections may be considered, as well as antacid medications. At-risk patients should be referred to a specialist for medical evaluation before departing, and optimal control of co-morbidities such as cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases should be achieved, particularly for high-altitude travel...|$|R
30|$|Results 18 {{patients}} {{were enrolled in}} the study and 17 completed the study (median [IQR 25 – 75], age: 60 yo [54 – 65], SAPSII: 69 [61 – 75], time to ROSC: 20  min [14 – 30], shockable rhythm 53 %). Time to reach the TT was 15  h [10 – 17], with a mean cooling rate to reach TT of 0.26  °C/h [0.19 – 0.36]. The average time spend in the 32 – 34  °C-target range was 26  h [21 – 28]. All patients reached the 32 – 34  °C-target range (3 patients did not reach 33  °C). The temperature deviation out of the 33  °C-TT during the maintenance phase was 0.1  °C [0.03 – 0.20]. Five patients (36 %) presented an episode of minor deviation (0.5 °– 1  °C), and one patient (6 %) a deviation > 1  °C versus the TT. Rewarming time was 16  h [12 – 20] and the mean rewarming rate was 0.20  °C/h [0.18 – 0.22]. Average time between introduction and removed of the ECD was 50  h (42 – 56). Among the 16 esogastroduodenoscopy performed, 9 (56 %) were strictly normal. Endoscopy showed minor gastric injuries in 6 patients (38 %). Within these patients, 3 (19 %) also presented minor esophageal injuries. Esogastric injuries characteristics were mostly similar to usual orogastric probe injuries. One patient (6 %) experienced a serious ulcerous esophagitis mimicking a <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis,</b> not firmly related to the ECD. No patients necessitated hemostatic local procedure and no significant gastrointestinal bleeding was observed. Eight patients (47 %) were alive at D 90, including 5 patients (29 %) with a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1. This compares favorably to outcomes from previous studies.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study was to {{estimate}} the rate of clinical and endoscopic relapse after initial treatment of erosive <b>peptic</b> <b>esophagitis</b> in children and adolescents. Methods: A total of 24 patients (2. 1 - 16. 4 years old, mean standard deviation [SD] 9. 9 +/- 3. 1; male:female 3) with healed endoscopic erosive esophagitis and without gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - predisposing conditions were followed up for 4 to 32. 9 months (mean 20. 8 +/- 10. 6 years). Structured clinical evaluation was performed every other week during the initial treatment and maintenance, and every 3 months after that. Whenever a clinical relapse happened, a new endoscopic evaluation was performed. Severity and frequency were scored on 10 -point and 6 -point semiquantitative scales, respectively. Results: At baseline, epigastric pain was the most reported symptom (70. 8 %), with intensity scored as > 5 in 88. 3 % of patients, and median frequency of 3 (weekly; daily in 5, 20. 8 %). Clinical relapse was detected in 20 of 24 (83. 3 %) patients after a median period of 14. 65 months (95 % confidence interval [CI] 6. 7 - 25. 7 months). Endoscopic relapse was observed in 9 of 20 (45 %) patients after a median of 25. 7 months. the dose of lansoprazole needed to heal the esophagitis was not significantly associated with the risk for clinical relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 74, 0. 94, 7. 72, P = 0. 06), whereas the body mass index (BMI) was directly associated with endoscopic relapse (HR 1. 3, 1, 1. 69, P = 0. 05). Conclusions: Children with healed erosive esophagitis have up to 83 % clinical relapse and of the 83 %, 45 % had endoscopic relapse. Correlation of endoscopic relapse with clinical symptom is poor. Higher grades of esophagitis and higher BMI are risk factors for endoscopic relapse.

40|$|Background: An {{international}} {{group of experts}} evaluated and revised recommendations for ambulatory reflux monitoring for the diagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Methods: Literature search was focused on indications and technical recommendations for GERD testing and phenotypes definitions. Statements were proposed and discussed during several structured meetings. Key Results: Reflux testing should be performed after cessation of acid suppressive medication in patients with a low likelihood of GERD. In this setting, testing can be either catheter-based or wireless pH-monitoring or pH-impedance monitoring. In patients with a high probability of GERD (esophagitis grade C and D, histology proven Barrett's mucosa > 1 cm, peptic stricture, previous positive pH monitoring) and persistent symptoms, pH-impedance monitoring should be performed on treatment. Recommendations are provided for data acquisition and analysis. Esophageal acid exposure is considered as pathological if acid exposure time (AET) is greater than 6 % on pH testing. Number of reflux episodes and baseline impedance are exploratory metrics that may complement AET. Positive symptom reflux association is defined as symptom index (SI) > 50 % or symptom association probability (SAP) > 95 %. A positive symptom-reflux association {{in the absence of}} pathological AET defines hypersensitivity to reflux. Conclusions and Inferences: The consensus group determined that grade C or D <b>esophagitis,</b> <b>peptic</b> stricture, histology proven Barrett's mucosa > 1 cm, and esophageal acid exposure greater > 6 % are sufficient to define pathological GERD. Further testing should be considered when none of these criteria are fulfille...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: In pediatrics, {{endoscopic}} examination {{has become a}} common procedure for evaluation of gastrointestinal presentations. However, there are limited data on pediatric endoscopy in Korea. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the current status and clinical impacts of {{endoscopic examination}} in children and adolescents. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of outpatients who visited the tertiary hospital. Patients under 18 years of age who underwent endoscopy were included. Endoscopic findings were classified as specific and normal based on gross findings. Specific endoscopic findings were reflux <b>esophagitis,</b> <b>peptic</b> ulcers, and Mallory-Weiss tear. Other findings included acute gastritis classified according to the updated Sydney system. Results: In 722 of 330, 350 patients (0. 2 %), endoscopic examination (554 esophagogastroduodenoscopies [EGDs], 121 colonos-copies, 47 sigmoidoscopies) was performed between January 2008 and January 2013. In EGD, abdominal pain was the most frequent presentation (64. 1 %). The most common diagnosis was gastritis (53. 2 %), followed by reflux esophagitis. The frequency of peptic ulcer disease was 12. 8 %. Frequent symptoms leading to colonoscopic examination were abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia. In colonoscopy, a negative result was more likely in children younger than 7 years old. After the procedure, the diagnostic yield of EGD and colonoscopy was 88. 1 % and 45. 8 %, respectively, and the rate of change in management was 67. 1 %. Conclusions: In pediatrics, endoscopic examination was useful for the choice of therapeutic strategy and it would be a standar...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundVarious {{types of}} {{gastro-intestinal}} complications {{have already been}} reported after atrial fibrillation (AF) radiofrequency ablation. The objective of this prospective study {{was to assess the}} incidence of esogastric injuries after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with the cryoballoon catheter (Arctic Front, Cryocath, Quebec, Canada). MethodsBetween December 2007 and April 2009, 25 patients (15 males, mean age 55 years old) with symptomatic, drug refractory, paroxysmal (n= 24) or persistent (n= 1) AF underwent circumferential antral PVI using a cryoballoon catheter. Post-procedural upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy was systematically performed on the following day. ResultsAll procedures were performed in patients using a double lumen 23 or 28 mm cryoballoon catheter, with a mean maximal temperature of – 45. 5 ± 19. 7 °C. Out of the 100 veins treated by the cryoballoon technique, 93 were completely isolated (93 %). The number of balloon applications per vein was 2. 2 ± 0. 7 and the mean procedure time was 158. 5 ± 28. 7 minutes. Endoscopy found gastroparesia in 4 patients (16 %, 2 gastric bezoar and 2 severe gastric stasis) which were considered as likely related to the ablation and due to vagal injury. All patients were asymptomatic. In 13 cases (52 %), endoscopic abnormalities were considered as fortuitous (<b>peptic</b> gastritis and <b>esophagitis,</b> n= 8; gastric ulcer, n= 1; hiatal hernia, n= 5; esophageal lipoma, n= 1). In one case, the endoscopy revealed a Mallory Weiss syndrome, presumably connected to pre-operative trans-esophageal echocardiography. Esograstric endoscopy was normal in only 8 cases (32 %). ConclusionCryoballoon catheter ablation for AF is associated with an unusual high incidence of gastroparesia (16 %) which could be related to procedural periesophageal vagal nerve damage...|$|R
