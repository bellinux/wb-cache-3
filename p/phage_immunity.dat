40|$|IEM 101, a Vibrio cholerae O 1 El Tor Ogawa strain {{naturally}} {{deficient in}} CTXΦ, was previously selected as a live cholera vaccine candidate. To {{make a better}} and safer vaccine that can induce protective immunity against both the bacteria and cholera toxin (CT), a new vaccine candidate, IEM 108, was constructed by introducing a ctxB gene and an El Tor-derived rstR gene into IEM 101. The ctxB gene codes for the protective antigen CTB subunit, and the rstR gene mediates <b>phage</b> <b>immunity.</b> The stable expression of the two genes was managed by a chromosome-plasmid lethal balanced system based on the housekeeping gene thyA. Immunization studies indicate that IEM 108 generates good immune responses against both the bacteria and CT. After a single-dose intraintestinal vaccination with 109 CFU of IEM 108, both anti-CTB immunoglobulin G and vibriocidal antibodies were detected in the immunized-rabbit sera. However, only vibriocidal antibodies are detected in rabbits immunized with IEM 101. In addition, IEM 108 but not IEM 101 conferred full protection against the challenges of four wild-type toxigenic strains of V. cholerae O 1 and 4 μg of CT protein in a rabbit model. By introducing the rstR gene, the frequency of conjugative transfer of a recombinant El Tor-derived RS 2 suicidal plasmid to IEM 108 was decreased 100 -fold compared to that for IEM 101. This indicated that the El Tor-derived rstR cloned in IEM 108 was fully functional and could effectively inhibit the El Tor-derived CTXΦ from infecting IEM 108. Our results demonstrate that IEM 108 is an efficient and safe live oral cholera vaccine candidate that induces antibacterial and antitoxic immunity and CTXΦ <b>phage</b> <b>immunity...</b>|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper is}} dealing with the {{bacteriological}} characteristics of phage-resistant strain which produces in culture of phytopathogenic Xanthomonas oryzae, the causal agent of rice plants. According to the literatures by many investigators, these phage-resistant strains (11 /r, K 7 /r) isolated from their parent strains (11, K 7) used in this experiment are considered to be the resulting products derived from spontaneous mutation. These phage-resistant strains are characterized by the loss of susceptibility against the phages OP_ 1 and OP_ 1 h in vitro. Comparative studies on these strains revealed the facts that there are no apparent differences in the morphological and physiological characteristics between parent strains and their phage-resistant strains, while apparent differences are in response to phages and rice plants. Immunity of phage-resistant strains to phage infection appears to be a stable and permanent characteristic which does not change after successive culture on slant of potato dextrose agar and after successive inoculation to rice plants. These phage-resistant strains, however, show less virulence to rice plants than that of parent ones. These phage-resistant strains possess the ability to produce the new phages which differ from the known virulent phages OP_ 1, OP_ 1 h, and OP_ 2. The new phages obtained from three-day culture of phage-resistant strains in potato semisynthetic liquid medium are considered to be temperate phages after the results that they show smaller plaque forms than those of the known <b>phages,</b> <b>immunity</b> of parent strains to temperate phages, and the stable characteristics even after the two-times serial colony isolations of parent strains. In conclusion, then, it appears that such phage-producing strains are the lysogenic strains. イネ白葉枯病菌のファージ耐性変異菌株は,その外部形態および糖の分解能などでは,原菌株との明瞭な差異を見出すことはできないが,ファージに対する反応やイネに対する病原性で,明瞭な相違が認められる. これらファージ耐性変異菌株のファージ耐性は,寄主への再通過や培地で数代の継代培養を行なつても,その性質は全く変らない安定した性質のようである. イネに対する病原性は,原菌株に比して小さく減衰の傾向を示している. ファージ耐性変異には,ファージの放出性を伴なう場合があるようである. この放出されたファージは,溶菌斑の形状や,母菌株に対して非溶菌的であること,および母菌株の数回の単個分離によつてもその性質は全く変らないなどの実験結果から,temperate phageと思われ,このファージ耐性変異菌株は溶原株であろうと考察した...|$|R

Both genetic and physiological studies demonstrate that this new mutation, N 21 - 1, is similar to N mutations of phage [lambda]. As {{in the case of}} the N gene of [lambda] (Ni[lambda]), the N 21 - 1 mutation maps immediately to the left of the cI gene and has a pleiotropic effect on the expression of phage functions. Although these studies strongly suggest that phage 21 has an N function, they do not definitely locate the N 21 - 1 mutation within the N 21 structural gene. Reported here are studies demonstrating that N 21 acts in trans, similar to N[lambda], to stimulate the expression of phage functions.

Phage-resistant transconjugants were constructed in the desired host by conjugal transfer of lactose-fermenting ability (Lac+, pTR 1040) and phage resistance (Hsp+, pTR 2030) from S. lactis TEK 1. S. lactis and S. cremoris transconjugants harboring pTR 2030 were resistant to all small isometric-headed phages examined. In contrast, prolate- and large isometric-headed phages were either not inhibited in the pTR 2030 transconjugants or exhibited a reduction in plaque size without {{a reduction in the}} efficiency of plaquing. Small isometric-headed phages subject to pTR 2030 induced inhibition shared no significant DNA homology with pTR 2030, suggesting that <b>phage</b> <b>immunity</b> genes are not harbored on the plasmid or responsible for resistance.

However, coliphage experimentally introduced by ingestion persist only transiently if at all in the gut of humans and other animals. This study attempted to identify the barriers to long term establishment of exogenous coliphage in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of laboratory mice. Intestinal contents were screened for the presence of coliphage and host bacteria, and strains of E. coli bacteria from different segments of the GI tract were tested for susceptibility to six common laboratory coliphages. Results Contrary to expectations, coliphage were not evident in the GI tracts of laboratory mice, although they were occasionally detected in feces. Commensal flora showed extreme variability within groups of mice despite identical handling and diet. Less than 20 % of 48 mice tested carried E. coli in their gut, and of 22 commensal E. coli strains isolated and tested, 59 % were completely resistant to infection by lambda, M 13, P 1, T 4, T 7, and PhiX 174 coliphage. Lysogeny could not be demonstrated in the commensal strains as mitomycin C failed to induce detectable <b>phage.</b> Pre-existing <b>immunity</b> to <b>phages</b> was not evident as sera and fecal washes did not contain significant antibody titers to six laboratory phage types.

40|$|The {{cholera toxin}} genes of Vibrio cholerae are encoded by CTXΦ, a {{lysogenic}} bacteriophage. Infection with this phage plays a determinant role in toxigenicity conversion {{and the emergence}} of new clones of pathogenic V. cholerae. Multiple phage alleles, defined by sequence types of the repressor gene rstR, have been found, showing the divergence of phage genomes. Pre-CTXΦ, which is characterized by the absence of toxin genes, is predicted to be the precursor of CTXΦ. We have found a new pre-CTXΦ prophage genome (named pre-CTXZJΦ for its novel rstR allele) in nontoxigenic V. cholerae O 1 isolates that were obtained during surveillance of the estuary water of the Zhujiang River. A novel hybrid genome of the helper phage RS 1 was identified in an environmental strain carrying pre-CTXZJΦ in this study. The chromosomal integration and genomic arrangement of pre-CTXZJΦ and RS 1 was determined. The RS 2 of pre-CTXZJΦ was shown to have a function in replication, but it seems to have lost its ability to integrate. The RstR of pre-CTXZJΦ exerted the highest repression of its own rstA promoter compared to other RstRs, suggesting rstR-specific <b>phage</b> superinfection <b>immunity</b> and potential co-infection with other pre-CTXΦ/CTXΦ alleles. The environmental strain carrying pre-CTXZJΦ could still be infected by CTXETΦ, the most common phage allele in the strains of the seventh cholera pandemic, suggesting that this nontoxigenic clone could potentially undergo toxigenicity conversion by CTXΦ infection and become a new toxigenic clone despite already containing the pre-CTXΦ prophage...|$|R

In this study, we demonstrated that the presence of just the DMS 3 protospacer and the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) on the P. aeruginosa genome is necessary and sufficient for this CRISPR-dependent loss of these group behaviors, with no requirement of additional DMS 3 sequences. We also demonstrated that the interaction of the CRISPR system with the DMS 3 protospacer induces expression of SOS-regulated phage-related genes, including the well-characterized pyocin operon, through the activity of the nuclease Cas 3 and subsequent RecA activation. Fur-thermore, our data suggest that expression of the phage-related genes results in bacterial cell death on a surface due to the inabil-ity of the CRISPR-engaged strain to downregulate phage-related gene expression, while these phage-related genes have minimal impact on growth and viability under planktonic conditions. Deletion of the phage-related genes restores biofilm formation and swarmingmotility while still maintaining a functional CRISPR/Cas system, demonstrating that the loss of these group behaviors is an indirect effect of CRISPR self-targeting...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{induction}} of λc 857 - 434 hy and λc 857 - 80 hy tandem dilysogens {{results in}} replication {{not only of}} the λ, which is induced, but also of the other phage. Nevertheless, the latter remains under immunity control, since: (a) a superinfecting <b>phage</b> of that <b>immunity</b> fails to replicate; (b) the genes under direct immunity control are not expressed. Replication of the non-induced phage takes place only if it is adjacent to the λ, and only if the λ itself is able to replicate: however, this replication does not require that the replicative enzymes are interchangeable between λ and the other phage. Clearly, one deals here with passive replication of a phage, {{as a part of a}} λ-driven replicon. Function Int frequently excises the whole tandem of prophages, presumably as a double length circle. Replication from this structure, followed by the action of function Ter, accounts for our results as well as for those of Whitfleld & Appleyard (1958). The situation described here is in many respects similar to that analyzed by Gottesman & Yarmolinsky (1968). In their case, however, passive replication takes place in situ because int- mutations in the prophages prevent early excision, and particles of only one immunity are found in the yield. © 1970.

Here, we report a customized recombinant leptospirosis multiepitope protein (r-LMP) that can specifically detect the immunoglobulin class of anti-leptospirosis antibodies in patient sera.

These elements {{have been}} implicated in pathogenesis, serotype conversion and <b>phage</b> <b>immunity.</b> The e 14 element is a defective lambdoid prophage element present at 25 min in the E. coli K- 12 genome. This prophage encodes important functional genes such as lit (T 4 exclusion), mcrA (modified cytosine restriction activity) and pin (recombinase). Results Bioinformatic analysis of the e 14 prophage sequence shows the modular nature of the e 14 element which shares {{a large part of}} its sequence with the Shigella flexneri phage SfV. Based on this similarity, the regulatory region including the repressor and Cro proteins and their binding sites were identified. The protein product of b 1149 was found to be a fusion of a replication protein and a terminase. The genes b 1143, b 1151 and b 1152 were identified as putative pseudogenes. A number of duplications of the stfE tail fibre gene of the e 14 are seen in plasmid p 15 B. A protein based comparative approach using the COG database as a starting point helped detect lambdoid prophage like elements in a representative set of completely sequenced genomes. Conclusions The e 14 element was characterized for the function of its encoded genes, the regulatory regions, replication origin and homology with other phage and bacterial sequences. Comparative analysis at nucleotide and protein levels suggest that a number of important phage related functions are missing in the e 14 genome including parts of the early left operon, early right operon and late operon. The loss of these genes is the result of at least three major deletions that have occurred on e 14 since its integration.

As a basic study it may provide tools for developing phage resistant starters and offer regulatory elements and factors for biotechnological applications.

All LL-H host range mutants carried a single point mutation at the 3 ' end of a minor tail protein encoding gene g 71. The genomic location of g 71 is congruent with the other verified anti-receptor genes found in the λ supergroup.

A Gp 71 homolog of phage JCL 1032 showed 62 % identity to LL-H Gp 71 within the last 300 amino acids at the C-terminus. Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage receptors were investigated by the purification of different cell surface structures. Certain Lb. delbrueckii phages from homology groups a and c including LL-H, LL-H host range mutants and JCL 1032, were specifically inactivated by the LTAs. In structural analyses LTAs showed differences in the degree of α-glucosyl and ᴅ-alanyl substitution. α-glucose is necessary for LL-H adsorption. A high level of ᴅ-alanine esters in LTA backbones inhibited Lb. delbrueckii phage inactivation in general. Lysogenization of strain ATCC 15808 with the temperate phage JCL 1032 revealed a rarely described coexistence of phage adsorption resistance and <b>phage</b> <b>immunity,</b> which could not be explained by lysogenic conversion. In this case the role of spontaneously induced JCL 1032 may be significant. The LL-H early gene region was localized between the dysfunctional lysogeny module and the terminase encoding genes. The function of five ORFs could be connected to phage DNA replication and/or homologous recombination. Transcription of LL-H genes could be divided into two, possibly three, phases in which large gene clusters were sequentially transcribed. The intensity of the late transcripts exceeded the intensity of the early transcripts by several times. Two candidate genes for transcription regulators were found. One of the two candidates is the first ORF in the LL-H early gene region...|$|E
40|$|Cooperative binding of {{specific}} DNA-binding proteins to DNA plays {{a crucial role}} in gene regulation. To understand the molecular basis of cooperative protein-DNA interactions and their role in gene regulation, the lambdoid phage HK 022 was used as a model system to study cooperative binding of HK 022 CI repressor to DNA. HK 022 CI repressor binds to two adjacent operators {{with a high degree of}} cooperativity. In this work, a combination of genetics and biochemistry was used to study cooperative binding of HK 022 CI regressor by analyzing the effects of changing either the DNA binding sites or the protein on cooperativity. In the first part of this dissertation, the effect of changing the spacing between the two adjacent operators (O(R) 1 and O(R) 2) on cooperativity and on the conformation of the complex was examined. The highest cooperativity was observed with wild type spacing of 9 bp, implying that the wild type spacing confers the most favorable cooperative interaction. Considerable cooperativity was retained for most spacing variants, but was abolished when the operators lay on opposite faces of the DNA helix. Almost all spacing variants conferred changes in the conformation of the DNA-protein complex. The major conclusions from this study are that: (1) the protein-DNA complex is flexible enough to allow some cooperativity in most spacing variants; (2) a protein-DNA complex involving the same specific binding sites and the same protein molecules can adopt many different conformations, depending on the spacing between the binding sites. In the second part of this investigation, a genetic screen was developed to isolate HK 022 repressor mutants which are defective in cooperative binding to adjacent operators, but are normal in binding to a single operator, so as to identify the amino acids in CI responsible for the cooperative interactions. Five mutants (IL 153, RS 225, RG 225, FS 233, and +QK) were isolated from this screen. The cooperativity parameter o for these mutant proteins (except IL 153) was determined by in vitro DNase I footprinting assay. The results indicated that +QK was a relatively strong mutant, with a reduction of about 20 fold in o; the others were weaker, reducing o about 4 to 5 fold. Two double mutant combinations (+QK-RS 225 and +QK-RG 225) conferred greater cooperativity defects than the single mutants. One double mutant (RS 225 -IL 153) restored nearly wild type cooperativity indicating that those two single mutations suppress each other perhaps by a lock-and-key mechanism. The cooperativity mutants were used to demonstrate the importance of cooperativity for HK 022 <b>phage</b> <b>immunity</b> and the lysis-lysogeny decision...|$|E
40|$|Shiga toxins 1 (Stx 1) and 2 (Stx 2) are encoded by toxin-converting bacteriophages of Stx-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), {{and so far}} two Stx 1 - and one Stx 2 -converting phages {{have been}} {{isolated}} from two STEC strains (A. D. O’Brien, J. W. Newlands, S. F. Miller, R. K. Holmes, H. W. Smith, and S. B. Formal, Science 226 : 694 – 696, 1984). In this study, we isolated two Stx 2 -converting phages, designated Stx 2 Φ-I and Stx 2 Φ-II, from two clinical strains of STEC associated with the outbreaks in Japan in 1996 and found that Stx 2 Φ-I resembled 933 W, the previously reported Stx 2 -converting phage, in its infective properties for E. coli K- 12 strain C 600 while Stx 2 Φ-II was distinct from them. The sizes of the plaques of Stx 2 Φ-I and Stx 2 Φ-II in C 600 were different; the former was larger than the latter. The restriction maps of Stx 2 Φ-I and Stx 2 Φ-II were not identical; rather, Stx 2 Φ-II DNA was approximately 3 kb larger than Stx 2 Φ-I DNA. Furthermore, Stx 2 Φ-I and Stx 2 Φ-II showed different <b>phage</b> <b>immunity,</b> with Stx 2 Φ-I and 933 W belonging to the same group. Infection of C 600 by Stx 2 Φ-I or 933 W was affected by environmental osmolarity differently from that by Stx 2 Φ-II. When C 600 was grown under conditions of high osmolarity, the infectivity of Stx 2 Φ-I and 933 W was greatly decreased {{compared with that of}} Stx 2 Φ-II. Examination of the plating efficiency of the three phages for the defined mutations in C 600 revealed that the efficiency of Stx 2 Φ-I and 933 W for the fadL mutant decreased to less than 10 − 7 compared with that for C 600 whereas the efficiency of Stx 2 Φ-II decreased to 0. 1 % of that for C 600. In contrast, while the plating efficiency of Stx 2 Φ-II for the lamB mutant decreased to a low level (0. 05 % of that for C 600), the efficiencies of Stx 2 Φ-I and 933 W were not changed. This was confirmed by the phage neutralization experiments with isolated outer membrane fractions from C 600, fadL mutant, or lamB mutant or the purified His 6 -tagged FadL and LamB proteins. Based on the data, we concluded that FadL acts as the receptor for Stx 2 Φ-I and Stx 2 Φ-II whereas LamB acts as the receptor only for Stx 2 Φ-II...|$|E
