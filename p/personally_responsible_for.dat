5|$|In June 1457 he was <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{intervening}} {{in the activities}} of Bishop Pecock, a virulent anti-Lollard. However, his virulence led to suspicions of heresy, which resulted in Beaumont's instigation of a formal examination into the bishop's sermons and writings; Peckock agreed to recant and abjured his heresy in November 1457, resigning his bishopric a year later.|$|E
5|$|In 1202 Pope Innocent, {{persuaded that}} Harald was not <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{the abuse of}} Bishop John, wrote to Bishop Bjarni to order him to ensure that Harald's man Lumberd, who was blamed for the deeds, was {{suitably}} punished. With this, the story of Harald's turbulent life reaches its close. He {{died of natural causes}} in 1206 after a long and eventful reign of 65 years, aged about 72.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, Musharraf was arrested, {{days after}} being bailed on other charges, for being <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{ordering}} the siege. It came {{two weeks after}} a case was filed over his responsibility.

5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Hungarian Jews {{had already}} {{stopped by the}} time of the leak. Following publication in mid-June of parts of the Vrba-Wetzler report, describing the use of gas chambers inside Auschwitz, the Jewish Agency in Geneva had cabled London asking that Hungarian ministers be held <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the killings. The cable was intercepted and passed to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy, who ordered an end to the deportations on 7 July.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of secession, Stone found himself in Washington writing his report on Sonora. After a dinner with his former commander Winfield Scott, Stone was requested to be Inspector General of the District of Columbia Militia at the rank of colonel as of January 1, 1861, and was thus reputed {{to be the first}} volunteer officer mustered into the Union Army before the Civil War. In this role, he secured the capital for the arrival of President-elect Abraham Lincoln, and was <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> security at the new president's inaugural.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{writes that}} several appeals {{were made to}} Horthy, {{including}} by the Swiss government, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gustaf V of Sweden and, on 25 June, Pope Pius XII, possibly after Martilotti passed on the report. On 26 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva sent a telegram to England calling on the Allies to hold members of the Hungarian government <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the killings. The cable was intercepted by the Hungarian government and shown to Prime Minister Döme Sztójay, who passed it to Horthy. Horthy ordered {{an end to the}} deportations on 7 July and they stopped two days later.|$|E

5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it had to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the {{campaign}} out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Warren was <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{the safety}} {{aspects of the}} Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico. There was {{considerable}} concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours. Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren could get some rest. Fortunately, no problems arose with the test.|$|E
5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for the content of the film.|$|E

His General Chemicals Division at Widnes {{was involved in}} chemical separation of uranium products, which he considered a patriotic duty. Baxter was <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the research and development that was the basis for the design of the Springfields uranium hexafluoride plant, and {{was a member of the}} committee that oversaw the construction of the chemical separation plant to extract plutonium. Much to Baxter's disappointment, ICI management did not see nuclear energy as being part of its core mission, and disengaged from it. He also became dismayed at political and economic developments in the United Kingdom after the Conservatives lost office in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Henry's reign saw {{significant}} legal changes, {{particularly in}} England and Normandy. By {{the middle of}} the 12th century, England had many different ecclesiastical and civil law courts, with overlapping jurisdictions resulting from the interaction of diverse legal traditions. Henry greatly expanded the role of royal justice in England, producing a more coherent legal system, summarised {{at the end of his}} reign in the treatise of Glanvill, an early legal handbook. Despite these reforms it is uncertain if Henry had a grand vision for his new legal system and the reforms seem to have proceeded in a steady, pragmatic fashion. Indeed, in most cases he was probably not <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> creating the new processes, but he was greatly interested in the law, seeing the delivery of justice as one of the key tasks for a king and carefully appointing good administrators to conduct the reforms.|$|E
25|$|An anecdote, {{often cited}} by Lehi apologists {{in defense of}} Moyne's assassination, but {{dismissed}} by Bruce Hoffman as a canard, holds that Moyne was <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the deaths of a million Hungarian Jews.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} mentioned document or decree {{referring to}} the Royal Guards of Poland {{dates back to the}} reign of King John II Casimir. In 1650, the newly established regiment under the command of foreign mercenaries and military commanders was entirely incorporated into the regular, main forces of the Crown over which the monarch or ruler was <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> and accountable <b>for.</b> The guards served at the royal courts of Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki (reigned as Michael I), John III Sobieski, Augustus II the Strong, Augustus III and the last king of Poland Stanisław II Augustus.

There were times when the position appeared hopeless, but on each occasion it was restored by his coolness and determination.

50|$|A {{collaborative}} {{system is}} designed to support multiple users modifying different sections of the plan at once; for example, updating the areas they <b>personally</b> are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> such that those estimates get integrated into the overall plan. Web-based tools, including extranets, generally fall into this category, but have the limitation that they can only be used when the user has live Internet access. To address this limitation, some software tools using client-server architecture provide a rich client that runs on users' desktop computer and replicates project and task information to other project team members through a central server when users connect periodically to the network. Some tools allow team members to check out their schedules (and others' as read only) to work on them while not on the network. When reconnecting to the database, all changes are synchronized with the other schedules.|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{constitutive}} {{role played by the}} emotion of guilt, or the capacity of experiencing such emotions, in our moral life. The deeply personal nature of moral guilt (or remorse) leads to the problem of ethical solipsism: it seems that guilt can in the end concern only me, not anyone else, in a morally profound sense. Echoing Dostoevsky, the truly ethical thinker ought to acknowledge that everyone is guilty in front of the entire mankind, “and I more than anyone else”. This problematic feature of our moral perspectives on the world is examined through comments on a number of authors, including Kant, Wittgenstein, Levinas, Gaita, and Todorov. While we do need to avoid solipsism, there is a “truth” hidden in it: morality is something that we are individually and <b>personally</b> deeply <b>responsible</b> <b>for...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to teaching the complete mortality of mankind, Unamended Christadelphians also teach {{that because of}} Adam and Eve's disobedience in the Garden of Eden, mankind is inherently sinful and separated from God from birth. Through breaking God's law they created a breach in their relationship with God, and were destined to die. The very nature of mankind was no longer “very good” (Genesis 1), but became unclean in God's sight. Humans inherit this fallen nature from their progenitors, Adam and Eve. By birth, mankind is separated from God. Unamended Christadelphians believe that because Adam and Eve ceased to be very good, their children could not be born very good, or of a nature that is acceptable to God. This understanding is used to explain infant deaths. No person is held <b>personally</b> <b>responsible</b> or guilty <b>for</b> Adam's transgression ...|$|R
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, <b>personally,</b> was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|R
