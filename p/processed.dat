40|$|Abstract. Businesses {{document}} their operational <b>processes</b> as <b>process</b> models. The {{common practice}} is to represent <b>process</b> models as directed graphs.

5|$|The {{precursors}} for systemin and AtPEP1 are both <b>processed</b> to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor.

The precursors to HypSys are <b>processed</b> into more than one active peptide. In tobacco, it is <b>processed</b> into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described.

5|$|Traditionally, most sulfide ores {{have been}} <b>processed</b> using pyrometallurgical {{techniques}} {{to produce a}} matte for further refining.

The nickel matte is further <b>processed</b> with the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of cobalt and nickel. Then, solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel, with the final nickel content greater than 99%.|$|E

30|$|In our case, the Gini {{coefficient}} {{measures the}} concentration of the periodic <b>process</b> demand on <b>process</b> variants and the master <b>process</b> resulting from a <b>process</b> variant profile. The Gini coefficient therefore directly depends on the assignment of <b>process</b> contexts to the master <b>process</b> and context-specific <b>process</b> variants. The more <b>process</b> contexts are served by the master <b>process,</b> the more demand concentrates on it. For complete standardization, the <b>process</b> demand concentrates on the master <b>process</b> entirely, and the corresponding Gini coefficient is G = 1 (if the master <b>process</b> fits all relevant <b>process</b> contexts). The more <b>process</b> demand concentrates on the master <b>process,</b> the stronger are the experience curve effects and, consequently, the more the <b>process</b> costs lower over time. Using the Gini coefficient is appealing because BPS can be easily measured as {{the concentration of}} the <b>process</b> demand on the master <b>process.</b> Moreover, each <b>process</b> variant profile leads to a distinct value of the (cost-weighted) Gini coefficient.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} process-aware information systems (PAISs) {{has resulted in}} large <b>process</b> model collections. To support users having di‚Üµerent perspectives on complex <b>processes</b> and related data, a PAIS should enable personalized <b>process</b> views, i. e., personalized abstractions of <b>process</b> models. Despite the abstraction achieved through views of the graphical <b>process</b> models, many end users still struggle with understanding these graphical models and their details. For selected user groups, therefore, a PAIS should provide verbalized <b>process</b> descriptions describing {{their role in the}} <b>process.</b> Existing PAISs neither provide mechanisms for managing <b>process</b> views nor verbalized <b>process</b> descriptions. While <b>process</b> views have been used as visual abstractions for large <b>process</b> models, so far no work exists on how to provide both personalized and verbalized <b>process</b> descriptions based on respective views. Hence, this paper presents an approach for creating personalized and verbalized <b>process</b> descriptions based on <b>process</b> views. Furthermore, textual changes of such a personalized and verbalized <b>process</b> descriptions are correctly mapped to corresponding updates of the underlying <b>process</b> model. In this context, all other views and <b>process</b> descriptions related to this <b>process</b> model are migrated to the new version of the <b>process</b> model as well. Overall, our approach enables end users to understand and evolve large <b>process</b> models based on personalized and verbalized <b>process</b> descriptions.

30|$|In the literature, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} whether the master <b>process</b> fits all or only a subset of the relevant <b>process</b> contexts. Some authors refer to the unification of <b>process</b> variants against the master <b>process</b> when defining BPS (M√ºnstermann et al. 2010), an argumentation that implicitly makes the case for the master <b>process</b> being applicable to all contexts.
