5|$|In 2012, a study {{examining}} truthiness {{was carried}} out by PhD student Eryn Newman of Victoria University of Wellington. The experiments showed that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to believe that a claim is true regardless of evidence when a decorative photograph appears alongside it.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, {{women are more likely}} than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E

50|$|More independently, Witkin wrote a Journal of Abnormal Psychology {{review of}} {{relationships}} between Field Dependency/Psychological Differentiation and types of psychopathology.

5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites {{as well as the}} intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E

25|$|Some {{studies have}} found that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to raise volumes to unsafe levels while {{performing}} strenuous exercise. A Finnish study recommended that exercisers should set their headphone volumes to half of their normal loudness and only use them for half an hour.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.|$|E

50|$|In another example, a {{study of}} the {{portrayal}} of race, ethnicity, and nationality in televised sporting events by journalist Derrick Jackson in 1989 showed that black <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely than white <b>people</b> to <b>be</b> described in demeaning intellectual terms.|$|R
25|$|The {{most recent}} poll by Pew Research Center {{published}} in May 2017 suggests that 16% of Belarusian {{are in favor}} of same-sex marriage, while 81% oppose the idea, which was significantly higher than in Ukraine (9%), Russia (5%) and Moldova (5%). Younger <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely than their elders to favor legal gay marriage (22% vs. 14%).|$|E
25|$|Over 100 {{microorganisms}} {{can cause}} CAP, with most cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Certain groups of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to CAP-causing pathogens; for example, infants, adults with chronic conditions (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), senior citizens, alcoholics {{and others with}} compromised immune systems {{are more likely to}} develop CAP from Haemophilus influenzae or Pneumocystis carinii.

25|$|Overall, {{intensity}} of aphasia treatment {{is an area}} that requires more research. Current research suggests that intense treatment is effective, but <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to drop-out of high intensity treatments. Most importantly, {{intensity of}} treatment should be determined on a case by case basis and should depend upon recency of stroke and the patient’s stamina, tolerance for therapy, motivation, overall health status, and treatment goals.|$|E

25|$|Transformative {{products}} are exciting, but robo-pets {{are even more}} exciting. We were interested in making the technology very visible, but also playing with translucency and transparency, soft boundaries. The irony of the digital age is that, as technology gets more invisible, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> interested {{in being able to}} see it again, as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} by the following example. Assume that an opinion poll is conducted by calling random telephone numbers. Unemployed <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be home and answer the phone than employed people are. Therefore, unemployed respondents {{are likely to be}} over-represented in the sample. The probability distribution of employed versus unemployed respondents in a sample of n respondents can be described as a noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
25|$|People {{respond to}} what is present – Despite knowing that the media merely provide a {{symbolic}} version of the world, people still tend to {{respond to what}} the media appears to be {{as if it were}} real and immediately present. For the most part, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> concerned with the interpretation of cues or messages they receive, rather than trying to determine the original intention of the message's creators.|$|E
50|$|The film {{attempts}} {{to explore the}} connection between missionary activity and global capitalism by using low-tech audio devices to speak to communities that face economic crisis. The missionaries targeted these communities that were in crisis because they found that displaced and desperate <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> receptive to evangelical recordings. Also because these <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> interested in the audio recordings because they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> comfortable with listening to their native language. It seems to provide an interesting view on mass-evangelization as the filmmaker shows the viewer that by placing a concentrated emphasis on these native people and using a recording of their own language {{as a way of}} connection to Christianity; to make them feel comfortable in learning a new way of thinking about the world.|$|R

Cialdini cites the {{marketing}} of Tupperware in what might now be called viral marketing. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to buy if they liked the person selling it to them. Some of the many biases favoring <b>more</b> attractive <b>people</b> <b>are</b> discussed. See physical attractiveness stereotype.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} {{concentrated on the}} occurrence of canine aggressive behavior in Lanškrounsko. Data about aggression was obtained by completing questionnaires. Aggressive behavior towards dogs and <b>people</b> <b>was</b> observed. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> frequently bitten by dogs than dogs. Victims <b>were</b> <b>more</b> frequently bitten by male dogs than female dogs. The study summarized information about canine aggression and its possible solution...|$|R
25|$|Example: We visit every {{household}} {{in a given}} street, and interview {{the first person to}} answer the door. In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to answer the door (e.g. an unemployed person who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it's not practical to calculate these probabilities.|$|E
25|$|Increase identifiability: Studies {{of social}} loafing suggest {{that people are}} less {{productive}} when they are working with others, but social facilitation {{studies have shown that}} <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> productive when others are present (at least with an easy task). If individuals within a group know one another, feel that their productivity or inputs are not identifiable, then social loafing is likely to occur. Alternatively, if individuals are anonymous and therefore unidentifiable, then social loafing may also be likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between Europeans and New Englanders {{manifests itself in}} particular in the expression of feelings and emotions, which are very sensitive for the former: love {{is more important than}} money. Moreover, American <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> straitlaced and they have closer links with tradition. The most important thing in life for those living in the 'New World' is, ironically, respecting old traditions and accepting the rules of a good morality. Mr Wentworth is profoundly surprised and fascinated by Eugenia's marriage experience as well as Robert Acton's; in the Americans' eyes, Eugenia is a perplexing woman.|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examined the}} relationship between distinctiveness and self-schematicity. Experiment I revealed that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> self-schematic in domains of strong performance when they felt distinct from family and peers in those domains. Experiments 2 and 3 extended this finding into the arena of stereotypes by demonstrating that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> self-schematic in domains of strong performance when their performance was counterstereotypic rather than stereotypic. In particular, African Americans and women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> schematic for intelligence than Caucasians and men if they performed well academically, whereas Caucasians-especially men-were more likely than African Americans to be schematic for athletics if they performed well athletically. These results suggest that counterstereotypic behavior plays a uniquely powerful {{role in the development of}} the self-concept...|$|R

50|$|In 1989 {{the heights}} {{of male and female}} {{corporate}} managers and non-managers were measured in two studies with about 200 subjects.
