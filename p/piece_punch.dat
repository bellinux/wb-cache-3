[...] The critics were divided {{on the merits of}} the <b>piece.</b> <b>Punch,</b> habitually hostile to Gilbert, commented, [...] "'Limited' it is, in more senses than one." [...] The Standard, by contrast, said, [...] "Mr. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan are here at their very best … The wit, humour and satire of the book have not been surpassed in any of the author's previous operas, the composer's fascinating vein of melody flows as freshly as ever, and the orchestration is full of characteristically happy fancies … A more complete success has never been achieved in comic opera, even at the Savoy." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette also praised Sullivan's contribution, but disparaged Gilbert's: in its view the music [...] "has not its equal in the whole Sullivan and Gilbert series", but the book had [...] "not merely a sense of cheapness but the sense of weariness even to exhaustion." [...] The Era commented that Gilbert's [...] "wit was as sparkling and his satire as keen as ever," [...] and thought the council scene [...] "screamingly funny". The Observer judged that Gilbert had lost none of his merits, and that [...] "wit abounds" [...] and [...] "is as spontaneous as ever: not forced or vulgarised, and his rhymes are always faultless." ...|$|E
40|$|Extrusion is a {{metal forming}} process, In this process the {{material}} is pushed or drawn through a die of desired cross-section to create long object of a fixed cross-section area, extrusion may be continuous (producing infinitely long material) or semi continuous (producing many pieces).

Anon-linear converging cosine dies profiles are used for square to square extrusion process. Extrusion through mathematically contoured die plays a critical role in improvement of surface finish of extruded product. The cosine die profile designed using CATIA, Solidworks and MATLAB was used to find out the coordinate of the cosine die profile and solid model was generated using CATIA the STL files of extrusion dies generated by solid work and CATIA.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} ranges of {{applications}} for stamped parts in the electrical and electronics industry (e. g. switch cabinet cladding and transformer plates) {{as well as in}} the automotive industry (e. g. stamp, bent and drawn components), flexible sheet metal forming has become a more important process. The inner and outer contours as well as the forming operations needed to reinforce metal sheets can be carried out by punching machines without re-clamping the metal sheet. In contrast, the potential of conventional punching machines is now exhausted in terms of the material spectrum that can be processed, the tool life and the quality of the machined product. Particularly in view of the machining quality of the sheared edges, the achievable clear-cut surface rates are limited due to the limited plasticity of the sheet materials. When cracks form between the grain boundaries of the sheet material during the conventional shearing process, the cutting edge is divided into a c lear-cut surface zone (approx. 30 % of the plate thickness when shearing stainless steel plates: 1. 4301) and a shearing zone with crack formation. This shearing zone can not be used as a functional surface. The shearing process is divided into the four phases (DIN 8588) "warping", "clear-cutting", "fracture" and "ejection of the <b>piece</b> <b>punched</b> out"...|$|R

5000|$|This {{process is}} based on the 1950s patent for hydramolding by Fred Leuthesser, Jr. and John Fox of the Schaible Company of Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States. It was {{originally}} used in producing kitchen spouts. This was done because in addition to the strengthening of the metal, hydromolding also produced less [...] "grainy" [...] parts, allowing for easier metal finishing.In sheet hydroforming (SHF) there are bladder forming (where there is a bladder that contains the liquid; no liquid contacts the sheet) and hydroforming where the fluid contacts the sheet (no bladder). Bladder forming is sometimes called flexforming. Flexforming is mostly used for low volume productions, as in the aerospace field.Forming with the fluid in direct contact with the part can be done either with a male solid punch (this version is sometimes called hydro-mechanical deep drawing) or with a female solid die.In hydro-mechanical deep drawing, a work piece is placed on a draw ring (blank holder) over a male punch then a hydraulic chamber surrounds the work piece and a relatively low initial pressure seats the work <b>piece</b> against the <b>punch.</b> The punch then is raised into the hydraulic chamber and pressure is increased to as high as 100 MPa (15000 psi) which forms the part around the punch. Then the pressure is released and punch retracted, hydraulic chamber lifted, and the process is complete.|$|R

40|$|Sensory Responsive Objects' were {{a series}} of works {{designed}} by Philippa Brock, Samuel Plant Dempsey and Priti Veja This collaboration brought together three researchers who had not previously worked together on textiles, but who all share an interest in smart materials. The collaboration has been as much {{about the process of}} the collaboration as it was the outcomes. Many ideas were discussed during the initial phases of the project, and the designers were particularly interested in exploring sensory experiences on the London underground – haptic, visual and sound for woven jacquard design. The designers discussed how these specific senses (haptic, visual and sound) respond and interact to sensory signal data on the London underground. Using the idea of contrasts for visual aids, tactility of moquette seat fabrics and platform blisters, and sounds of announcements, these ideas were further progressed into the design ideation phase using ludic methodology for design thinking. The designers collected a range of small analogue and digital toys/ objects, reactive materials and electronic components, that would help inform design thinking via hacking, making and linking key sensory themes of haptic, visual and sound. Some of the key objects that worked towards the final outcomes included: −	Digibirds – digital toy birds that respond by singing and moving when sensing sound −	Analog music machine – sound response to a punch card data when wound through analog music machine (reading a punch card relating back to jacquard data) −	Stereo earphones – digital music earphones −	Bike light – reflective and flashing mode bicycle safety light −	Tactile materials and yarns – materials including rubber, paper, mohair, plastics, monofilaments, vibration motors, reflective yarn, phosphorescent yarn, wire, chenille, polyester, UV-reactive −	E-textile materials – conductive yarn and sensory output components (LEDs, buzzers, pressure sensors, actuated soft circuits) Although multiple ideas were inspired by the ‘hacking and making’ session, only specific ones were taken through for jacquard design. The final jacquard designs were reflective QR code, multi-haptic graphic jacquard, giant speaker, digibird graphic e-textile tracks, mind the gap music/braille code. Each jacquard outcome is explained as follows: •	Reflective QR code (Sensory response: SIGHT) Visual contrasts to aid clarity and visibility are vital on Transport for London designs. This jacquard outcome grew from how visual contrasts could be transformed as data, and led to the idea of QR codes (digital data as a visual response). The graphics of QR codes are usually a black and white code, read by a digital reader much like a serial barcode. The contrast between the dark and light space is what enables the code to be encrypted to a weblink. Generating a QR code for the @WeavingFutures twitter handle resulted in the visual graphic. Pattern manipulation in some of the idle code areas enabled swirl pattern aesthetics. The QR code was woven in reflective yarn and phosphorescent yarn to give multiple visual contrasts effects depending on the lighting condition viewed in, while still working as an active code. •	Multi-haptic graphic jacquard (Sensory response: HAPTIC & SIGHT) A photograph of the iconic ‘mind the gap’ text between the train and platform, enabled the designers to think about the multiple details integrated in this one image i. e. text, yellow boundary lines, paving indentations. Every detail served a purpose, thus the jacquard translation could also respond via multiple tactile materials (e. g. mohair - furry, polyester -smooth/shiny, matt chenille - soft/moquette like, yellow - reflective) while still keeping the ‘mind the gap’ text in a single woven design. •	Giant speaker (Sensory response: SOUND & SIGHT) This sample was a reaction to all the sound data on the London underground. When hacking the digibird and earphones, small speakers play an integral part of these functions. One of the physical qualities required for a speaker are coils of copper around a magnetic field. This could be translated as a literal spiral graphic and specifically designed structures, which would enable the piece to operate as a speaker. A giant coil was woven and requires connection to active sound source and magnetic field. In addition, this piece is also woven with a UV-reactive yarn to change visually when exposed to UV light. •	Digibird graphic e-textile tracks (Sensory response: SIGHT, SOUND & HAPTIC) The digibirds were integral to inspire many trails of thought during the residency. The dissected digibirds enabled the designers to study the internal ‘guts’ and understand the methods of connections and actuation. The visual photograph of the step-by-step dissection was used as the graphic for the jacquard design, with multiple tactile yarns. Disguised amongst the aesthetic design, multiple conductive yarn tracks were woven in to act as a fabric electronic breadboard. The piece is able to connect to a circuit of multiple electronic outputs to emulate to multiple outputs of the digibirds. •	Mind the gap music code (Sensory response: SIGHT & HAPTIC) The wind up analog music machine inspired this <b>piece.</b> The <b>punch</b> card system that operates the music machine requires holes to be punched in a specific sequence to play notes/ tunes. The visual aesthetic of the punched music card resembled that of braille, leading the designers to research and analyse the configuration of the braille alphabet. The 2 x 3 dot configuration that can make any braille letter could be reconfigured as a linear 1 x 6; hence, each braille alphabet letter could be translated as a punch card music machine sound/ note. Using this method, phrases from the London underground were translated as complete tunes, including ‘mind the gap’. The visual aesthetic of this translated braille to music machine notes were woven as a jacquard design in this piece. The braille-music note hybrid coded dots were woven in structures that enabled raised surfaces, relating back to the original haptic of braille...|$|R
