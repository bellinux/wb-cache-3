40|$|In this <b>paper</b> <b>we</b> <b>address</b> <b>some</b> {{fundamental}} issues {{pertaining to the}} dynamic reconstruction of a chaotic process, given an observable time series of the process.

Introduction In this <b>paper</b> <b>we</b> <b>address</b> <b>some</b> {{fundamental issues}} pertaining to the dynamic reconstruction of a chaotic process. The primary motivation of dynamic reconstruction is to make physical sense from an experimental time series without knowledge of the underlying physics of the problem.

In an earlier <b>paper,</b> <b>we</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>some</b> of these debates by proposing a {{foundational}} concept of urbanization and urban form {{as a way of}} identifying a common language for urban research.

We then use this preliminary material as background to a critique of three currently influential versions of urban analysis, namely, postcolonial urban theory, assemblage theoretic approaches, and planetary urbanism. We evaluate each of these versions in turn and find them seriously wanting as statements about urban realities. We criticize (a) postcolonial urban theory for its particularism and its insistence on the provincialization of knowledge, (b) assemblage theoretic approaches for their indeterminacy and eclecticism, and (c) planetary urbanism for its radical devaluation of the forces of agglomeration and nodality in urban-economic geography...|$|R

Although {{there are a}} number of silhouette extraction algorithms proposed in the literature, most approaches work efficiently only in constrained environments where the background is relatively simple and static. In a previous <b>paper,</b> <b>we</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>some</b> of the challenges in silhouette extraction and human tracking in a real-world unconstrained environment where the background is complex and dynamic. We extracted features from image regions, accumulated the feature information over time, fused high-level knowledge with low-level features, and built a time-varying background model. A problem with our system is that by adapting the background model, objects moved by a human are difficult to handle. In order to reinsert them into the background, we run the risk of cutting off part of the human silhouette, such as in a quick arm movement. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>we</b> develop a fuzzy logic inference system to detach the silhouette of a moving object from the human body.

40|$|Geostatistical {{methods are}} {{increasingly}} used in low-resource settings where disease registries are either non-existent or geographically incomplete. In this thesis, which {{is comprised of}} four <b>papers,</b> <b>we</b> <b>address</b> <b>some</b> of the common issues that arise from analysing disease prevalence data. In the first <b>paper</b> <b>we</b> consider the problem of combining data from multiple spatially referenced surveys so as to account for two main sources of variation: temporal variation, when surveys are repeated over time; data-quality variation, e. g. between randomised and non-randomised surveys. We then propose a multivariate binomial geostatistical model for the combined analysis of data from multiple surveys. We also show an application to malaria prevalence data from three surveys conducted in two consecutive years in Chikwawa District, Malawi, one of which used a more economical convenience sampling strategy. In the second <b>paper,</b> <b>we</b> analyse river-blindness prevalence data from a survey conducted in 20 African countries enrolled in the African Programme of Onchocerciasis Control (APOC). The main challenge of this analysis is computational, as a binomial geostatistical model has to be fitted to more than 14, 000 village locations and predictions carried out on about 10 millions locations across Africa. To make the computation feasible and efficient, we then develop a low rank approximation based on a convolution-kernel representation which avoids matrix inversion. The third paper is a tutorial {{on the use of}} a new R package, namely “PrevMap”, which provides functions for both likelihood-based and Bayesian analysis of spatially referenced prevalence data. In the fourth <b>paper,</b> <b>we</b> present some extensions of the standard geostatistical model for spatio-temporal analysis of prevalence data and modelling of spatially structured zero-inflation. We then describe three applications that have arisen through our collaborations with researchers and public health programmers in African countries...|$|R
