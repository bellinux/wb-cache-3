5|$|The Parliament of Canada is the {{legislative}} {{body of the}} Government of Canada. The Parliament is composed of the House of Commons (lower house), the Senate (upper house), and the Sovereign, represented by the Governor General. Most major legislation originates from the House, {{as it is the}} only body that is directly elected. A new parliament begins after an election of the House of Commons and can sit for up to five years. The number of seats in parliament has varied as new provinces joined the country and as <b>population</b> <b>distribution</b> between the provinces changed; there are currently 338 MPs and 105 Senators (when there are no vacancies).|$|E
5|$|Watson {{argued that}} the economy {{established}} by Arab and other Muslim traders across the Old World enabled the diffusion of many crops and farming techniques across the Islamic world, {{as well as the}} adaptation of crops and techniques from and to regions outside it. Crops from Africa, such as sorghum, from China, such as citrus fruits, and from India, such as mango, rice, cotton and sugar cane, were distributed throughout Islamic lands, which, in his opinion, had not previously grown these plants. He listed eighteen such crops. He further {{argued that the}}se introductions, along with an increased mechanization of agriculture and irrigation, led to major changes in economy, <b>population</b> <b>distribution,</b> vegetation cover, agricultural production and income, population, urban growth, distribution of the labour force, industries linked to agriculture, cooking, diet and clothing in the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven <b>population</b> <b>distribution</b> between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E

40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{estimating}} test score distributions that may improve on using tIe observed frequencies (OBFs) as estimates of a <b>population</b> test score <b>distribution</b> are considered: the kernel method (KM); the polynomial method (PM); and the four-parameter beta binomial method (FPBBM). The assumption each method makes about the smoothness {{of the true}} distribution and computational details of the methods;Are described. The methods are compared in a simulation study in which 500 samples of size 500, 1, 000, 2, 000, and 5, 000 are taken from three <b>population</b> <b>distributions.</b> For each of the 6, 000 samples (3 <b>population</b> <b>distributions</b> by 4 sample sizes by 500 samples), the variable kernel, fixed kernel, FPBBM, and PM estimates of the true distribution are computed.

30|$|All in all, {{cohesion}} {{indicators of}} accessibility {{are very sensitive}} for local population levels. This is again emphasized {{when looking at the}} results from historical data. Those data show much more profound impacts on cohesion indicators, which is no doubt caused by the substantial network improvements observed between 1970 and 2012 and the relatively small changes in inequality of <b>population</b> <b>distributions.</b> All in all, the historical data show a remarkable decline in accessibility disparities that are in many cases even augmented by changes in <b>population</b> <b>distributions</b> over time. Thus, from the historical trends and the modelled results we extract that investments in the road network may have a considerable impact on disparities in accessibility levels, and that land-use development policies may be used to restrict the potentially unwanted effects of <b>population</b> <b>distributions</b> on those disparities.|$|R

25|$|The general {{trend of}} rapid {{population}} increase was tempered by regional variations. For instance, {{the population in}} the countryside around Kale Gowa appears to have declined after around 1500 as the centralization of Gowa under the Karaeng Gowa's court drew rural inhabitants into the political centers of Kale Gowa and Makassar. Occasional shifts {{in the course of the}} Jeneberang also affected <b>population</b> <b>distribution,</b> while warfare under Tumapaqrisiq Kallonna reduced the populations of specific areas such as the upper Talloq River. Nevertheless, archaeologist F. David Bulbeck variably estimates that the population of Makassar and its environs tripled or even grew as much as tenfold between the 14th and 17th centuries.|$|E

25|$|In general, if {{the nature}} of the <b>population</b> <b>distribution</b> is known a priori, it is {{possible}} to test if the number of outliers deviate significantly from what can be expected: for a given cutoff (so samples fall beyond the cutoff with probability p) of a given distribution, the number of outliers will follow a binomial distribution with parameter p, which can generally be well-approximated by the Poisson distribution with λ = pn. Thus if one takes a normal distribution with cutoff 3 standard deviations from the mean, p is approximately 0.3%, and thus for 1000 trials one can approximate the number of samples whose deviation exceeds 3 sigmas by a Poisson distribution with λ = 3.|$|E
