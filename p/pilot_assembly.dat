40|$|Electric {{machines}} (e-machines) {{will form}} a fundamental {{part of the}} powertrain of the future. Automotive manufacturers are keen to develop emachine manufacturing and assembly knowledge in-house. An on-going project, which aims to deliver an e-machine <b>pilot</b> <b>assembly</b> line, is being supported {{by a set of}} virtual engineering tools developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick. Although digital models are a useful design aid providing visualization and simulation, the opportunity being exploited in this research paper is to have a common model throughout the lifecycle of both the manufacturing system and the product. The vision is to have a digital twin that is consistent with the real system and not just used in the early design and deployment phases. This concept, commonly referred to as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), is key to realizing efficient system reconfigurability to support alternative product volumes and mixes. These tools produce modular digital models that can be rapidly modified preventing the simulation, test, and modification processes forming a bottleneck to the development lifecycles. In addition, they add value at more mature phases when, for example, a high volume line based on the pilot is created as the same models can be reused and modified as required. This research paper therefore demonstrates how the application of the virtual engineering tools support the development of a CPS using an e-machine assembly station as a case study. The main contribution of the work is to further validate the CPS philosophy by extending the concept into practical applications in pilot production systems with prototype products...|$|E

To support all phases of an agile modular manufacturing machine life cycle with CAE and Virtual Manufacturing tools, {{a number of different}} engineering applications (e. g. specialist software based tools) are typically used for design, simulation, analysis, programming, control and monitoring of a machine. These applications mainly exist today as small applications islands where each of them manages their own data.

40|$|Pressure suits allow {{pilots and}} astronauts {{to survive in}} extreme environments {{at the edge of}} Earth’s {{atmosphere}} and in the vacuum of space. One obstacle that pilots and astronauts face is that gas-pressurized suits stiffen when pressurized and greatly limit user mobility. As a result, a critical need exists to quantify and improve the mobility characteristics of pressure suits. A historical survey and critique of pressure-suit testing methodologies is first presented, followed by the results of recent pressure suit testing conducted at the MIT Man-Vehicle Laboratory (MVL). MVL researchers, in cooperation with the David Clark Company (Worcester, MA), used an anthropometrically-realistic robotic space suit tester to quantify pressure suit mobility characteristics of the S 1034 <b>Pilot</b> Protective <b>Assembly</b> (PPA), a pressure suit worn by U- 2 pilots.

50|$|David Clark {{worked closely}} with the {{laboratory}} of Earl Wood at the Mayo Clinic when developing the early G-suit. The goal was to prevent blackout during high-G forces experienced during dive bombing maneuvers. With the physiologic principles of blackout during high G-forces worked out by Wood and colleagues, the g-activated single pressure suit utilizing air bladders, first released in 1943 with improvements to follow in 1944, provided, what was considered to be a significant advantage for the allied forces. Of key importance was Wood and colleague's recognition that gravitationally induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) was due to relative loss of arterial pressure pushing blood to the head rather than a loss of venous return. Since 1946, DCC's continuous pressure suit research and development efforts, sponsored largely by the Department of Defense to support its USAF high-altitude aircraft (Lockheed U-2 and SR-71) programs, resulted in the late 1980s development of a new generation pressure suit. The result was the S1034 <b>Pilot's</b> Protective <b>Assembly</b> (PPA). The S1034 PPA has since become the USAF and DoD standard pressure suit and served as the basis for NASA's S1035 Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES). This was adopted for the Space Shuttle program, replacing DCC's (partial pressure) S1032 Launch Entry Suit (LES). Both the S1034 PPA and S1035 ACES continue to be used by the USAF and NASA.|$|R
40|$|Pilot {{operated}} valves (POVs) {{are used}} to control the flow of hypergolic propellants monomethylhydrazine (fuel) and nitrogen tetroxide (oxidizer) to the Shuttle orbiter Primary Reaction Control Subsystem (PRCS) thrusters. The POV incorporates a two-stage design: a solenoid-actuated pilot stage, which in turn controls a pressure-actuated main stage. Isolation of propellant supply from the thruster chamber is accomplished {{in part by a}} captive polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) pilot seal retained inside a Custom 455. 1 stainless steel cavity. Extrusion of the pilot seal restricts the flow of fuel around the pilot poppet, thus impeding or preventing the main valve stage from opening. It can also prevent the main stage from staying open with adequate force margin, particularly if there is gas in the main stage actuation cavity. During thruster operation on-orbit, fuel valve pilot seal extrusion is commonly indicated by low or erratic chamber pressure or failure of the thruster to fire upon command (Fail-Off). During ground turnaround, pilot seal extrusion is commonly indicated by slow gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) main valve opening times (greater than 38 ms) or slow water main valve opening response times (greater than 33 ms). Poppet lift tests and visual inspection can also detect pilot seal extrusion during ground servicing; however, direct metrology on the <b>pilot</b> seat <b>assembly</b> provides the most quantitative and accurate means of identifying extrusion.

5000|$|Ludington and Griswold {{had formed}} Ludington-Griswold, Inc. in Saybrook, Connecticut, where a new {{building}} was erected for their research. They had left employment from the Gould Aeronautical Division after the Navy picked up the contract for the LNE-1 glider and production begun. Pratt-Read had won a contract from Materiel Division, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, to manufacture the Army Air Forces Waco CG-4A combat glider. The Ludington-Griswold company shifted their development work to improvements to the CG-4A. Roger Griswold developed a more aerodynamic nose section to replace the boxy and poorly protected cockpit section of the CG-4A with his own design known as the [...] "Griswold Nose." [...] This was fitted to a Pratt-Read glider and flown to Wright Field for evaluation and testing. The nose section {{was found to be}} more aerodynamic, used a tow rope attachment centered {{at the front of the}} nose (unlike the top of the nose attachment found on the CG-4A), and incorporate better protection for the pilots. Wright Field felt that adding the Griswold Nose to the present CG-4A glider would slow down production at a time when glider production was a priority. However, Materiel Division asked Ludington-Griswold to produce a simplified version of the <b>pilot</b> protection <b>assembly</b> and produce it as a bolt on kit to the front of the CG-4A nose section. This led to the development, testing, and production of the [...] "Ludington-Griswold Crash Protection Device" [...] which was manufactured in time to be installed on a number of the CG-4A gliders used in the Normandy D-Day invasion. Subsequent overseas gliders were also fitted with the device which many glider pilots credited in saving injuries and lives.|$|R

The challenge in a sugarcane genome sequencing project is the size (10 Gb) and complexity of its genome structure that is highly polyploid and aneuploid (2 n= ca 110 to 120) with {{a complete set of}} homo(eo) logous genes predicted to range from 10 to 12 copies (alleles). A initial strategy is to capture much of the gene-rich recombinationally-active euchromatin. The Sugarcane Genome Sequencing Initiative (SUGESI) was envisaged to join efforts to produce a reference sequence of one sugarcane cultivar using a combination of approaches, including BAC sequencing and whole genome shot-gun approaches. Cultivar R 570 was chosen since it is the most intensively characterized to date. We expect that around 4 - 5 thousand BAC sequences can cover the monoploid euchromatic genome of this cultivar. BAC selection is underway using overgo and EST hybridization data. A next step is to sequence cultivars of interest to breeding programs. Under the shot-gun approach gene rich regions are being targeted for genotypes that are parents of mapping populations.

40|$|Drilling with casing and liner are {{unconventional}} drilling methods {{developed to}} reduce both the non-productive {{time spent on}} drilling operations and drilling time in general. A casing or liner string is used as the drillstring, {{and the number of}} operations is therefore reduced from two to one as drilling and casing of the wellbore are performed in one operation. Even though there are many benefits with this drilling method, there are also some drawbacks and operational considerations. Statoil and Baker Hughes have developed a rotary steerable liner drilling system, called the Steerable Drilling Liner (SDL). Two offshore test wells have been drilled with this system, and Statoil is now planning to utilize it on more wells in the North Sea. The Oseberg field is a candidate field for liner drilling due to stability problems in the Draupne and Ness formations. Two wells on the Oseberg field have therefore been chosen as the candidate wells for this thesis. The case histories of the test wells show that the limitation may be the low flow rate circulated through the liner, which may cause cuttings accumulation on top of the liner where the flow area suddenly expands. A flow diverter is therefore developed to have more flexibility in the choice of flow rate above the liner. The flow diverter and other solutions to improve the hole cleaning have been evaluated in this thesis. The high annular circulating pressure is another issue with the liner drilling technique. Many of the factors which improve hole cleaning also increase the annular pressure. The ECD must also be taken into consideration when optimizing the hole cleaning of the candidate wells. The simulations of hole cleaning and annular circulating pressure for the SDL system have been performed in WellPlan. The recommended flow rate for hole cleaning in the sections above the liner is at least 500 lpm higher than the maximum possible flow rate through the liner. By circulating this recommended rate through the liner, the equivalent circulating density increases. The circulating pressure exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation for the 7 ” SDL system. It is therefore not an alternative to come up with solutions to be able to circulate with a higher flow rate through the SDL system. A flow diverter above the liner is the best solution to increase the flow rate in the critical part of the well. With the flow diverter above the liner, the flow rate can be increased to the minimum required rate for hole cleaning {{and at the same time}} keep the equivalent circulating density at an acceptable level. The increased flow rate above the flow diverter will have minimal effect on the annular circulating pressure below the previous casing shoe. The simulations also showed that this minimum rate can be significantly reduced by changing the drilling fluid parameters. If the flow rate is kept constant, the bed height of cuttings can be reduced by optimizing the fluid parameters. Optimization of the drilling fluid is also important to make sure the cleaning in the annulus outside the liner is good. The required rate could be reduced further by increasing the rotation of the string and increasing the size of the drillpipe above the liner, and these solutions have been evaluated. Future work should include the development of a simulation program that can include all the downhole tools and components required for the Steerable Drilling Liner system, including two flow split components. The simulation program should also be able to handle the combination of a <b>pilot</b> bottom hole <b>assembly</b> and an underreamer to ream the hole to full size, and then calculate the correct amount of cuttings in the annulus. The drilling fluids should also be optimized to improve the hole cleaning in liner drilling operations further. </p...|$|R
