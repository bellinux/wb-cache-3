General Bougrain, commanding the 2nd DLM, signalled enemy infiltrations and attacks by armoured cars over the Mehaigne river at Moha and Wanze, just north of Huy, attacks which threatened to cut off the large Belgian garrison in Huy. Bougrain diverted his tank reserves to try to retrieve the situation. At 15:00 a French reconnaissance aircraft reported large concentrations of German armour south-east of Crehen.

40|$|A {{building}} {{in which the}} center of stiffness (CR) is not coincident with center of mass (CM) along only one horizontal <b>plan</b> <b>axis</b> {{is defined as a}} one-way asymmetric building. Further, if such building is constructed with supplemental damping, e. g. viscous dampers in the braces, it becomes a non-proportionally or non-classically damped system. Its damping matrix can not be diagonalized from the mode shapes of the undamped system. Not counting the time-consuming direct integration of the equation of motion for the original multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system, the conventional seismic analysis of the noted structures can be categorized into two types. One is based on the use of complex mode shapes and the other one on neglecting the off-diagonal elements of the transformed damping matrix. The shortcomings of the two approaches are that they are either too complicated for practicing engineers or result in unacceptable errors. An approximate method is proposed for the seismic analysis of this kind of structure. The proposed method is a modal analysis method that uses two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) modal equations. Since the proposed 2 DOF modal equations inherit the non-proportional damping property of the original MDOF system, the modal translation and rotation are not proportional even in an elastic state. Three numerical examples, which include two one-story and one three-story prototype buildings, are worked out in this research. The results are compared with those obtained by the direct integration of the equations of motion for the original MDOF system and the typical simplified modal analysis by neglecting the off-diagonal elements in the transformed damping matrix. These examples illustrate that the use of the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of the analytical results, without significantly increasing the computational efforts...|$|R

40|$|Background Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) {{can act as}} an {{intraoperative}} ruler in high tibial osteotomy (HTO) {{to visualize}} continuously the leg during surgery. Questions The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the accuracy of CAS with respect to preoperative planning and postoper-ative deviation from the <b>planned</b> leg <b>axis</b> in HTO. In addition, the influence of surgeon experience as well as operation time and perioperative complications are analyzed. Methods A prospective multicenter study case series with follow-up at 6 weeks was performed in six centers. Medial open-wedge HTO with Tomofix was done using com-puter assisted navigation technique with the Brainlab VV Osteotomy 1. 0 module. Results Fifty-one patients with medial gonarthritis were treated with navigated HTO. The follow-up rate was 98 %. The majority of HTO–CAS patients fell within the tolerated limit of ± 3 for leg axis deviation, however, seven patients were reported with deviations outside of this range: three patients had deviations of[3 – 4. 5 and four patients[4. 5, respectively. Eight intraoperative complications were doc-umented, partially resulting from technical problems asso-ciated with the navigation system. During the 6 -week follow-up period, three postoperative complications were experienced, all not associated with navigation technology. Conclusions In about 85 % of cases, a perfect result in terms of deviation of the <b>planned</b> mechanical leg <b>axis</b> could be achieved.

40|$|AbstractThe anterior–posterior axis is a {{key feature}} of the bilaterian body <b>plan.</b> Although <b>axis</b> {{specification}} during embryogenesis has been studied extensively, virtually nothing is known about how this axis can be established post-embryonically, as occurs in budding animals. We investigated bud formation in the acoel Convolutriloba retrogemma, which reproduces by a remarkable process involving the formation of animals with linked but completely opposite body axes. Reverse axes are established anew during each round of budding and manifestations of the bud's new axis develop gradually, with regionalization of axial patterning genes (Hox and otx) {{and the establishment of}} organized musculature occurring secondarily, after bud initiation. A swath of tissue at the parent–bud boundary has no regenerative potential and appears devoid of inherent axial polarity. GSK- 3 inhibitor trials suggest that Wnt/β-catenin or Hedgehog signalling may mediate the establishment of this unpolarized zone. Formation of unpolarized tissue may provide a buffer between opposing polarity cues and be a general mechanism by which budding animals establish and maintain linked body axes. In addition to elucidating the developmental basis of budding in a bilaterian, this study provides insight into convergence in animal budding mechanisms, redeployment of embryonic gene expression during budding, and Hox gene evolution...|$|R
