5|$|The film {{which at}} the {{beginning}} {{was scheduled to be}} released on Eid, 8 August 2013 was pushed back to 15 August 2013, to avoid clashing with Rohit Shetty's directorial venture, Chennai Express starring Shah Rukh Khan. The decision was made by Jitendra on Shah Rukh Khan's request after a meeting was held between the producers of the respective films so as to <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> each of the films ample opportunity of earning-well at the box office without diminishing each other's profits.|$|E
5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, {{progress is}} being made to <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable the remainder of the project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|Connected {{protected}} areas {{are important for}} the conservation of slow lorises because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the awareness of their legal protection. Sanctuaries and rescue facilities are available to <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown too old to reproduce, although the pygmy slow loris is doing well at some facilities, such as the San Diego Zoo.|$|E
5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} {{to a new}} level with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.|$|E

5|$|Mother rodents <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, {{and indirect}} parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} barrier {{was to be}} backed up by air-dropped and hand-emplaced acoustic and seismic sensors that would <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> warning and location of enemy movements. A scientific group was established to find or develop the technology for what was initially titled Practice Nine. On 17 June 1967 {{the title of the}} program was altered to Illinois City and on 15 July to Dyemarker, the electronic barrier portion of which was designated Muscle Shoals. In June 1968 it was renamed for the last time, becoming Operation Igloo White.|$|E
5|$|The polyptych was {{commissioned}} to <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> comfort and {{warning to the}} dying. It was intended to remind them of their faith, and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed {{within sight of the}} altarpiece for those too ill to walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only two patients per bed, luxurious at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.|$|E

5|$|The story began {{serialisation}} in the Belgium's Tintin magazine from 30 March 1950, in the French language. It {{then began}} serialisation {{over the border}} in France, in that country's edition of the magazine, from 11 May 1950. During this time, there were changes to how Hergé conducted his work; on 6 April 1950, he established Studios Hergé as a public company. The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in Céroux-Mousty his and Germaine's main abode. The Studios would <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work. He hired Bob de Moor as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultrasound}} equipment must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> color and Doppler imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of ultrasound. The use of Doppler measurements which trace the echoes of the generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The overlay of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Black cattle are the {{traditional}} breed of Wales. These hardy cows with horns and shaggy coats {{are able to}} thrive on poor quality pasture and moorland {{and can be used}} to <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> milk and beef. Large numbers were raised in Wales and herded on foot to be fattened in England for selling in English markets. On Welsh farms they were used to pull ploughs and sometimes wagons during the nineteenth century, and were the prized possessions by which a man's wealth could be estimated. Nowadays, many have been crossed with Charolais, Limousin or Hereford bulls but pure bred herds can still be found {{in many parts of the}} uplands.|$|E

5|$|General Eisenhower had {{reviewed}} the airborne role in Operation Husky, and {{had concluded that}} large-scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, had similar misgivings: once an airborne supporter, he had been greatly disappointed by their performance in North Africa and, more recently, Sicily. However, other high-ranking officers believed otherwise, notably the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, George Marshall. He persuaded Eisenhower {{to set up a}} review board and to withhold judgement on the effectiveness of divisional-sized airborne forces until a large-scale maneuver could be tried in December. When Swing returned to the United States to resume command of the 11th Airborne Division in mid-September 1943, he had an additional role. McNair ordered him to form a committeethe Swing Board–composed of U.S. Army Air Forces, parachute and glider infantry, and artillery officers to arrange a large-scale maneuver that would effectively decide the fate of the divisional-sized airborne force. As the 11th Airborne Division was in reserve in the United States, and had not yet been earmarked for overseas shipment, the Swing Board chose it as the test formation; it would be opposed by a composite combat team from the 17th Airborne Division with a battalion from the 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment temporarily attached. The maneuver would also <b>provide</b> <b>both</b> divisions with further airborne training, as had occurred several months previously in a large-scale maneuver undertaken by the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions.|$|E
