5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural <b>productivity</b> <b>and</b> net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up {{a significant percentage of}} the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a multi-sector {{general equilibrium model}} with IO linkages, sector-specific <b>productivities</b> <b>and</b> tax rates. Using tools from network theory, we investigate how the IO structure interacts with <b>productivities</b> <b>and</b> taxes in the determination of aggregate income. We show that aggregate income is a simple function {{of the first and}} second moments of the distribution of the IO multipliers, sectoral <b>productivities</b> <b>and</b> sectoral tax rates. We then estimate the parameters of the model to fit their joint empirical distribution. Poor countries have more extreme distributions of IO multipliers than rich economies: there are a few high-multiplier sectors, while most sectors have very low multipliers; by contrast, rich countries have more sectors with intermediate multipliers. Moreover, the correlations of these with <b>productivities</b> <b>and</b> tax rates are positive in poor countries, while being negative in rich ones. The estimated model predicts cross-country income differences extremely well, also out-of-sample. Finally, we perform a number of counterfactuals and compute optimal tax rates...|$|R

He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: <b>productivity</b> <b>and</b> compositionality.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the <b>productivity</b> <b>and</b> diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump.

Furthermore, knowledge of how these microbial communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased <b>productivity</b> <b>and</b> improved working environments.|$|E
