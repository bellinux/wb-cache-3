40|$|Nitrate, a major {{nitrogen}} {{source for}} most plants, {{is not only}} a nutrient but also a signaling molecule. However, there are contrasting responses to nitrate between different higher plants. In the model legume Medicago truncatula, nitrate has an inhibitory effect on the <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> in post-germination phase. A quantitative genetic study has shown that a nitrate transporter is localized at the peak of a QTL involved in the <b>primary</b> root <b>growth.</b> Functional characterization of the transporter, named MtNRT 1. 3 and renamed MtNPF 6. 8, showed that it encodes a dual affinity nitrate transporter. MtNPF 6. 8 is likely to participate in the nitrate influx in the plant. After obtaining three knockdown lines by RNA interference, experiments using K 15 NO 3 showed that this transporter is effect involved in nitrate influx related to the inducible low affinity transport system (iLATS). However, mutation in MtNPF 6. 8 does not any effect on nitrogen metabolism. In addition, studies on the <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> have confirmed the involvement of the transporter on phenotypic trait. In wild-type plants, cortical cell size decreased after nitrate treatment, showing that <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> was due to this reduced cell elongation. The possibility that ABA also plays a role in mediating this nitrate dependent response is heavily favored. All these results, reinforced by a study of mutants expressing this transporter in A. thaliana, indicate that MtNPF 6. 8 is a nitrate sensor for Medicago in the post-germination phase, independently of its nitrate transport activity...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen is an {{essential}} soil nutrient for plants, and lack of nitrogen commonly limits plant growth. Soil nitrogen is typically available to plants in two inorganic forms: nitrate and ammonium. To better understand how nitrate and ammonium differentially affect plant metabolism and development, we performed transcriptional profiling of the shoots of ammonium-supplied and nitrate-supplied Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Seven genes encoding class III glutaredoxins {{were found to be}} strongly and specifically induced by nitrate. RNA silencing of four of these glutaredoxin genes (AtGRXS 3 / 4 / 5 / 8) resulted in plants with increased primary root length (~ 25 % longer than wild-type) and decreased sensitivity to nitrate-mediated inhibition of <b>primary</b> root <b>growth.</b> Increased <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> is also a well-characterized phenotype of many cytokinin-deficient plant lines. We determined that nitrate induction of glutaredoxin gene expression was dependent upon cytokinin signaling and that cytokinins could activate glutaredoxin gene expression independent of plant nitrate status. In addition, crosses between "long-root" cytokinin-deficient plants and "long-root" glutaredoxin-silenced plants generated hybrids that displayed no further increase in primary root length (i. e. epistasis). Collectively, these findings suggest that AtGRXS 3 / 4 / 5 / 8 operate downstream of cytokinins in a signal transduction pathway that negatively regulates plant <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> in response to nitrate. This pathway could allow Arabidopsis to actively discriminate between different nitrogen sources in the soil, with the preferred nitrogen source, nitrate, acting to suppress <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> (vertical dimension) in concert with its well-characterized stimulatory effect on lateral root growth (horizontal dimension) ...|$|R

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> inhibition and increased lateral root formation have been reported to occur in response to P limitation. To gain knowledge of the genetic mechanisms that regulate root architectural responses to P availability, we designed a screen for identifying Arabidopsis mutants that fail to arrest <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> when grown under low P conditions. Eleven low phosphorus insensitive (lpi) mutants that define at least four different complementation groups involved in <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> responses to P availability were identified.

We show that dabigatran treatment did not affect <b>primary</b> tumor <b>growth,</b> whereas it significantly increased tumor dissemination throughout the peritoneal cavity.

We assessed the role of relative growth rate (RGR), life form, seed and fruit mass as potential constraints of plant phenology. In a comparison of traits of 22 Mediterranean woody plant species, the duration of the primary shoot growing period decreased from climbers to shrubs and to trees. A hypothesised negative association between RGR and <b>primary</b> shoot <b>growth</b> duration did not emerge in our species set. The mechanism underlying phenological differences between plant life forms might relate to differences in the proportion of respiring to photosynthetic tissues, which decreases from climbers to trees. It is suggested that the degree of shoot preformation within the bud correlates with <b>primary</b> shoot <b>growth</b> duration, but not with RGR. Development of big fruits and seeds competes for carbon with vegetative growth. Indeed, species with bigger seeds and fruits exhibited shorter primary shoot growing periods, which tended to overlap with flower bud formation and flowering periods. We suggest that duration of <b>primary</b> shoot <b>growth</b> allow to short out the species between two extreme growth strategies: The conservative one would be characterised by a concentration of the <b>primary</b> shoot <b>growth</b> into a short period, free of frosts and droughts, and by a diversion of part of the current resources to assure next year's growth.

40|$|Alkamides {{belong to}} a class of small lipid signals of wide {{distribution}} in plants, which are structurally related to the bacterial quorum-sensing signals N-acyl-l-homoserine lactones. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings display a number of root developmental responses to alkamides, including <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> inhibition and greater formation of lateral roots. To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms by which these compounds alter plant development, we performed a mutant screen for identifying Arabidopsis mutants that fail to inhibit <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> when grown under {{a high concentration of}} N-isobutyl decanamide. A recessive N-isobutyl decanamide-resistant mutant (decanamide resistant root [drr 1]) was isolated because of its continued <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> and reduced lateral root formation in response to this alkamide. Detailed characterization of lateral root primordia development in the wild type and drr 1 mutants revealed that DRR 1 is required at an early stage of pericycle cell activation to form lateral root primordia in response to both N-isobutyl decanamide and N-decanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, a highly active bacterial quorum-sensing signal. Exogenously supplied auxin similarly inhibited <b>primary</b> root <b>growth</b> and promoted lateral root formation in wild-type and drr 1 seedlings, suggesting that alkamides and auxin act by different mechanisms to alter root system architecture. When grown both in vitro and in soil, drr 1 mutants showed dramatically increased longevity and reduced hormone- and age-dependent senescence, which were related to reduced lateral root formation when exposed to stimulatory concentrations of jasmonic acid. Taken together, our results provide genetic evidence indicating that alkamides and N-acyl-l-homoserine lactones can be perceived by plants to modulate root architecture and senescence-related processes possibly by interacting with jasmonic acid signaling...|$|R

Loss and gain of function experiments in transgenic mouse models of breast cancer and of insulinoma in vivo and in breast cancer cells in vitro indicate that Lhx 2 plays {{a critical role in}} <b>primary</b> tumor <b>growth</b> and metastasis.
