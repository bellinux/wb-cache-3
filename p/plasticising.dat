40|$|Introduction : Containers for {{the storage}} of {{platelets}} are made using polyvinyl chloride <b>plasticised</b> with di, (2 -ethyl hexyl) phthalate, n-butyryl, tri (n-hexyl) citrate and tri (2 -ethyl hexyl) mellitate or using special poly olefins without plasticiser. Of these, the first two have disadvantages such as plasticiser leaching and impairment of platelet function. Polyolefin bags cannot be HF welded or steam sterilized. Mellitate <b>plasticised</b> bags can store platelets well for five days {{but they are not}} completely phthalate free. Research and Development: We have developed a new generation of containers made of PVC <b>plasticised</b> with the non DEHP, non aromatic plasticiser, 1, 2 - Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, diisononyl ester (Hexamoll DINCH) which can store platelets without loss of function for at least six days. Observation: The present studies show that DINCH <b>plasticised</b> PVC bags (TPL- 167) are well suited for {{the storage of}} platelet concentrates for more than five days. Conclusion: The present studies show that the PVC <b>plasticised</b> with the non phthalate, non aromatic, non toxic plasticiser DINCH is a viable alternative to other existing containers for the storage of platelets for more than five days...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Glycerol <b>plasticised</b> {{wheat gluten}} shows {{advantages}} for non-food {{applications such as}} biodegradable package films and bioplastics because of their abundant resources, low cost, good biodegradability and suitable mechanical and oxygen barrier properties. The intention {{of this study was}} to evaluate to the equibiaxial stress relaxation of 400 g kg(- 1) glycerol <b>plasticised</b> gluten at different biaxial strains at room temperature for a better understanding of the processibility. RESULTS: The <b>plasticised</b> gluten shows significant stress relaxation and the spectra span over six decades of time at biaxial strains from 0. 03 to 1. 51. Plotting the instantaneous modulus against strain reveals strain softening and strain hardening at strains below and above 0. 25, respectively. The relaxation modulus as a function of time can be fitted to the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts equation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that stress relaxation of <b>plasticised</b> gluten is highly dependent on strain level and biaxial deformation accelerates the network relaxation by widening the distribution of relaxation times.

In this study the <b>plasticising</b> behaviour of an ethylene/vinyl acetate/carbon monoxide terpolymer (Elvaloy® from Du Pont) was investigated. Blends of PVC, Elvaloy 742 and Di-octyl phthalate (DOP) were processed on a twin-roll mill and compression moulded into plaques. These materials were characterised in terms of their hardness, Tg, clarity, mechanical properties and plasticiser migration behaviour. The ratios of PVC/DOP/Elvaloy investigated were determined by experimental design.

It was confirmed that Elvaloy 742 is compatible with PVC and has a <b>plasticising</b> effect: this was demonstrated both in terms of a reduction in Shore A hardness and a reduction in Tg.

40|$|Abstract:Within {{the scope}} of the paper, three {{different}} process technologies for manufacturing polymer micro-elements are comparatively analyzed. First the different methods of ultrasonic <b>plasticising</b> and direct injection, expansion-injection-moulding and injection moulding in thermally low conductive mould materials are briefly introduced and their processing characteristics are explained. A comparison and a benchmark of these three technologies are made using an identical micro-mould and the same polymer. In order to verify their suitability for the production of polymer micro-elements, downscaled Campus tensile bars were produced (scale 1 : 16) and tested regarding their mechanical properties on polypropylene. Furthermore the morphology was investigated. It turns out that all methods can be utilized to produce polymer micro-elements. Only the components manufactured by the ultrasonic <b>plasticising</b> and direct injection show significantly lower mechanical properties in comparison to the other two methods. This is due among other things ascribable to the detected lower degree of crystallinity...|$|E

Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) was used to characterise the heparinised surface in order to correlate the surface properties with the blood response.

40|$|In this research, the <b>plasticising</b> {{mechanism}} of sodium gluconate (SG) retarder in cement paste containing a superplasticiser {{has been investigated}} in order to clarify {{the performance of the}} admixture combination in concrete. From adsorption and zeta-potential measurements, it is found that a lower viscosity occurs owing to (a) the electrostatic repulsion and (b) a lower particle volume fraction. Moreover, the gluconate anion is expected to enhance the formation of a homogenous polymer network on the cement grain surface, which explains the viscosity stabilisation time. In situ investigations of hydration using environmental scanning electron microscopy showed that SG induced modifications of the ettringite crystal morphology by reducing the amount and size of the ettringite needles. From pore solution analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectra, a mineral similar to syngenite is detected. These morphological changes lower the shear resistance and the paste viscosity. A thorough understanding of the <b>plasticising</b> mechanism will lead eventually to a more predictable concrete flow behaviour, which is particularly useful for concrete practitioners facing concerns related to combined use of admixtures...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{hydrated}} lime improves the workability and water retention of Portland cement (PC) mortars. PC-lime mixes can be reworked without increasing entrained air thus not undermining durability. In addition, lime lowers strength and stiffness making PC mortars more deformable. However, the use of hydrated lime in PC composites has largely decreased due {{to the use of}} plasticisers. These enhance workability and lower cement content reducing heat of hydration. As they are water reducers, they are expected to decrease permeability, minimise shrinkage, enhance ultimate strength and accelerate early-strength gain; leading to stronger, durable composites. Despite these advantages, plasticisers have drawbacks related to wastage and environmental protection. This paper studies the properties of PC-lime mortars and their <b>plasticised</b> equivalents. It concludes that lime raises mortar water demand however, this does not reduce strength but on the contrary, mortars of low lime content (lime amounting 1 / 4 th the cement), have superior flexural and compressive strengths than their <b>plasticised</b> equivalents. The use of lime delivered PC mortars with excellent workability and surface finish and lack of segregation and bleeding. It is concluded that, when lime amounts 1 / 4 th the cement, the mortars are stronger (in tension and compression, at both early and mature age) and gain strength at a faster rate than <b>plasticised</b> mixes. However, when lime equals the cement content, strengths are lower than those of <b>plasticised</b> mixes. It was als...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{method of}} {{porosity}} analysis by water absorption {{has been carried}} out by the storage of the specimens in pure water, but it does not exclude the potential <b>plasticising</b> effect of the water generating unreal values of porosity. Objective: The present study evaluated the reliability of this method of porosity analysis in polymethylmethacrylate denture base resins by the determination of the most satisfactory solution for storage (S), where the <b>plasticising</b> effect was excluded. Materials and methods: Two specimen shapes (rectangular and maxillary denture base) and two denture base resins, water bath-polymerised (Classico) and microwave-polymerised (Acron MC) were used. Saturated anhydrous calcium chloride solutions (25 %, 50 %, 75 %) and distilled water were used for specimen storage. Sorption isotherms were used to determine S. Porosity factor (PF) and diffusion coefficient (D) were calculated within S and for the groups stored in distilled water. anova and Tukey tests were performed to identify significant differences in PF results and Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn multiple comparison post hoc test, for D results (alpha = 0. 05). Results: For Acron MC denture base shape, FP results were 0. 24 % (S 50 %) and 1. 37 % (distilled water); for rectangular shape FP was 0. 35 % (S 75 %) and 0. 19 % (distilled water). For Classico denture base shape, FP results were 0. 54 % (S 75 %) and 1. 21 % (distilled water); for rectangular shape FP was 0. 7 % (S 50 %) and 1. 32 % (distilled water). FP results were similar in S and distilled water only for Acron MC rectangular shape (p > 0. 05). D results in distilled water were statistically higher than S for all groups. Conclusions: The results of the study suggest that an adequate solution for storing specimens must be used to measure porosity by water absorption, based on excluding the <b>plasticising</b> effect.
