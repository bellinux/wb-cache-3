5|$|The {{cumulation}} of {{all these}} events led Washington to request Congress to establish a standing navy. After a contentious debate, Congress passed the Naval Armament Act on March 27, 1794, authorizing construction of six frigates (to be built by Joshua Humphreys). These ships were the first ships of what eventually became the present-day United States Navy. Soon afterward, Congress also authorized funds to obtain a treaty with Algiers and to ransom Americans held captive (199 were alive at that time, including a few survivors from the Maria and the Dauphin). Ratified in September 1795, the final cost of the return of those held captive and peace with Algiers was $642,000, plus $21,000 in annual tribute. The president was unhappy with the arrangement, but realized the U.S. {{had little choice but}} to agree to it. Treaties were also concluded with Tripoli, in 1796, and Tunis in 1797, each carrying with it an annual U.S. tribute <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> for protection from attack. The new Navy would not be deployed until after Washington left office; the first two frigates completed were: United States, launched May 10, 1797; and Constitution, launched October 21, 1797.|$|E
25|$|Gould's {{campaign}} was ultimately successful and Congress canceled the subsidy. Owed {{a million dollars}} by Pacific Mail, Roach was now in financial difficulty himself as nervous creditors began calling for immediate settlement of their debts. Roach bluffed {{his way out of}} the crisis by declaring his readiness to settle any debt within three days of receiving a detailed statement. But he now had to decide whether to foreclose on Pacific Mail in order to secure at least some of his investment in the ships, or to renegotiate the payment plan. He chose the latter, accepting Pacific Mail's old ships for their scrap value as part payment, and reducing its monthly <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> from $75,000 to $35,000. Roach was embittered by the affair, but ironically, his handling of the crisis increased his reputation as a businessman able to deal with adverse circumstances.|$|E

50|$|In an {{assigned}} case, {{the defendant}} or property/casualty {{company does not}} wish to retain the long-term periodic <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> on its books. Accordingly, the defendant or property/casualty insurer transfers the obligation, through a legal device called a qualified assignment, to a third party. The third party, called an assignment company, will require the defendant or property/casualty company to pay it an amount sufficient to enable it to buy an annuity that will fund its newly accepted periodic <b>payment</b> <b>obligation.</b> If the claimant consents to the transfer of the periodic <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> (either in the settlement agreement or, failing that, in a special form of qualified assignment known as a qualified assignment and release), the defendant and/or its property/casualty company has no further liability to make the periodic payments. This method of substituting the obligor is desirable for defendants or property/casualty companies that do not want to retain the periodic <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> on their books. A qualified assignment is also advantageous for the claimant as it will not have to rely on the continued credit of the defendant or property/casualty company as a general creditor. Typically, an assignment company is an affiliate of the life insurance company from which the annuity is purchased.|$|E
5000|$|Accordingly, the Court held, {{following}} {{the decision of}} the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Enron Australia v TXU Electricity 2003 NSWSC 1169, that the underlying debt remains in existing even though the <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> is inoperable. Accordingly, if the provisions preventing the operation of the <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> fall away, the [...] "payment obligation will spring up under a pre-existing trade once the relevant condition is satisfied, and in that sense it might be said (with only approximate accuracy) that the <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> is 'suspended' while the condition remains unfulfilled." [...] It {{is important to note that}} these issues only arose in the first two appeals because the parties elected not to utilise the automatic early termination (AET) provisions in the Master Agreement. Accordingly, early termination could only by election, and that left the non-Defaulting Parties free to withhold making that election and crystallising their payment obligations. However the underlying analysis would be relevant to issues raised in the second two appeals.|$|E

5000|$|The typical {{structured}} settlement arises and {{is structured}} as follows: An injured party (the claimant) {{comes to a}} negotiated settlement of a tort suit with the defendant (or its insurance carrier) pursuant to a settlement agreement that provides as consideration, {{in exchange for the}} claimant's securing the dismissal of the lawsuit, an agreement by the defendant (or, more commonly, its insurer) to make a series of periodic payments. The defendant, or the property/casualty insurance company, generally assigns its periodic <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> to a third party by way of a qualified assignment ("assigned case"). The qualified assignment company receives money from the defendant or property/casualty insurer, and in turn purchases a [...] "qualified funding asset" [...] to finance the assigned periodic <b>payment</b> <b>obligation.</b> Pursuant to IRC 130(d) a [...] "qualified funding asset" [...] may be an annuity or an obligation of the United States government.|$|E

50|$|A bond is {{considered}} investment grade or IG if its credit rating is BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor's or Baa3 or higher by Moody's.

50|$|In {{the event}} of a bank failure, {{adherence}} to the rules for the operation of SIPS should prevent a domino effect whereby <b>payment</b> <b>obligations</b> of the failing bank are effected against the solvent banks.

50|$|One of {{the primary}} peculiarities of the {{documentary}} credit is that the <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> is independent from the underlying contract of sale or any other contract in the transaction. The bankâ€™s obligation {{is defined by the}} terms of the LC alone, and the contract of sale is not considered. The defenses available to the buyer arising out of the sale contract do not concern the bank and in no way affect its liability. Article 4(a) of the UCP600 states this principle clearly.|$|E
50|$|In November 2010 the UK {{government}} released spending figures {{showing that}} the current total <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> for PFI contracts in the UK is Â£267 billion.

50|$|Damages on {{the account}} of {{personal}} physical injury, physical sickness and workers compensation are income tax free due to exclusions provided in IRC section 104. The structured settlement tax rules enacted by Congress lay down a bright line path for a structured settlement. Once the plaintiff and defense have settled the tort claim in exchange for periodic payments {{to be made by}} the defendant (or the defendant's insurer), the full amount of the periodic payments constitutes tax-free damages to the victim. The defendant, or its insurer, may assign its periodic <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> to a qualified assignment company (typically a single purpose affiliate of a life insurer) that funds its assumed obligation with an annuity purchased from its affiliated life insurer. The rules also permit the assignee to fund its periodic <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> under the structured settlement via U.S. Treasury obligations. However, this U.S. Treasury obligation approach is used much less frequently because of lower returns and the relative inflexibility of payment schedules available under Treasury obligations. In this way, with a qualified assignment, there is a legal novation, the defendant or insurer can close its books on the liability, and the claimant can receive the long-term financial security of an annuity (or annuities) issued by one or more financially strong life insurance companies.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the usual settlement service, the In/Out Swap process [...] is done before the settlement windows to reduce the <b>payment</b> <b>obligations</b> to CLS and to mitigate liquidity pressures.

40|$|Payment systems play a {{key role}} in the {{financial}} infrastructure of all modern economies. Participants of payment systems need access to intraday liquidity to fulfill their <b>payment</b> <b>obligations.</b> They do that either using their own funds, which are costly, or recycling incoming payment. In order to rely on incoming payments, banks could delay the settlement of their own <b>payment</b> <b>obligations.</b> From the regulators' point of view it is important to know to what degree participants rely on the payments they receive from others. In Mexico, this is among the first studies that analyze from this perspective the intraday liquidity management of the Real Time Settlement Payment System, SPEI. We examine a data set of transactions from April 7 to May 7, 2010 in order to get insights of the participants' behavior regarding the delay of sending payment orders...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{provision}} {{governs the}} reduction of payments where market share is lost by an OPM to NPMs. This decrease is styled by the MSA as the [...] "Non-Participating Manufacturer Adjustment" [...] (the [...] "NPM Adjustment") and reduces required payments {{if there are any}} losses of market share experienced by the OPMs as a result of [...] "disadvantages" [...] arising out of the MSA. One of the contemplated [...] "disadvantages" [...] is price competition from NPMs. Because the NPM Adjustment trebles the decrease in <b>payment</b> <b>obligations</b> when an OPM loses more than 2% due to a [...] "disadvantage," [...] the loss of revenue to the Settling States from an NPM Adjustment is potentially substantial. If the OPM's market share loss exceeds 16â…”%, the decrease in <b>payment</b> <b>obligations</b> is somewhat less than the treble reduction for losses between 2% and 16â…”%.|$|R
50|$|The OPMs' overall annual <b>payment</b> <b>obligation</b> is {{specified}} in the MSA: The nationwide base payments begin at $ 4.5 billion for the year 2000 and gradually increase to $9 billion in the year 2018 and each year thereafter. This obligation is allocated among the OPMs {{in accordance with their}} relative market shares. Annual payments to the Settling States are to be adjusted according to changes in the overall volume of cigarette sales. A significant reduction in sales will therefore lead to a reduction in payments and state revenue.|$|E
