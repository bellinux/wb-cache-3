5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics.

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the <b>purview</b> of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E

40|$|Which factors {{influence}} the topics addressed by candidates in political debates? This study investigates {{the question of}} how the level of elective office influences the content of political debates by employing computer content analysis to investigate the issue emphasis of political campaign debates. Paul Peterson’s (1995, The price of federalism. Washington, DC: CQ Press) theory of functional federalism recognizes that political offices at different levels of government have discrete <b>purviews,</b> so that senators are more likely to emphasize national issues than governors. This study confirms the prediction of functional federalism in non-presidential debates and then extends it by demonstrating that presidential campaign messages emphasize federal issues even more than Senate (or gubernatorial) discourse. Most political communication research has focused on presidential campaigns...|$|R
40|$|This book {{offers a}} passionate but {{systematically}} sustained defence of an aesthetic engagement with world politics. It argues that aesthetic sources can offer alternative insight: {{a type of}} reflective understanding that emerges not from applying the analytical skills that {{are central to the}} social sciences, but from cultivating a more open-ended level of creativity and sensibility about the political. We then might be able to appreciate what we otherwise cannot even see: perspectives or people excluded from prevailing <b>purviews,</b> for instance, or the emotional nature and consequences of political events. Drawing on detailed case studies that range from Stalinist Russia to Cold War Germany and from global terrorism to contemporary Korea, the author compellingly demonstrates how images, sounds and the poetic imagination can help us understand - and perhaps even shape - some of the most difficult political challenges...|$|R
30|$|Given the {{exponential}} growth of POCUS {{and descriptions of}} new exams, techniques, and indications, this document should {{not be viewed as}} a comprehensive summary of POCUS. Further, while we realize there is overlap between emergency medicine and other disciplines, such as critical care medicine, the <b>purviews</b> are different and the focus of this document is the pediatric emergency medicine provider. We recognize that a methodological limitation of this document is the absence of global representation among its authors, as well as a validated consensus process. Moreover, we acknowledge that many leaders in the field of POCUS, and particularly pediatric emergency POCUS are not included in our author group. Since this {{is the first step in}} an iterative process, we strongly hope that future versions of this document will draw more extensively on the expertise of pediatric emergency physicians worldwide. We hope that this document will provide a framework for both ongoing practice and serve as a springboard for continuing efforts in training and research.|$|R
5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive.

5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway {{over most of}} the capital, and the City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the <b>purview</b> of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force.

40|$|Understood as {{a search}} for "the {{abstract}} principles embodied in music {{and the sounds of}} which it consists,"l music theory casts a wide net: it calls for a comparative sample and insists on a systematic methodology. As "the scholarly study of music, wherever it is found historically or geographically," musicology casts an even wider net. In practice, however, it has not been possible to transcend historical and geographical boundaries. (How often have you read an article on contemporary rock in JAMS or on Asian music in 19 th-Century Music?) Obviously, any attempt to explore the juncture between music theory and music history-my particular brief from the editors of Current Musicology will not get very far on definitions alone. Are not disciplinary boundaries convenient tags sanctioned by a certain distribution of economic, political, and intellectual power? Better, then, to focus on what some theorists and some historians do than to dwell abstractly on the <b>purviews</b> of music theory and music history. Agawu asks these questions and more as he explains the relationship between musicology and music theory...|$|R
40|$|Amputated {{from the}} term cybernetics, the prefix cyber- vaguely {{indicates}} that a thing is in some way digital or computer-mediated. The term cybercities is used broadly to indicate that cities have become a different order of thing {{by virtue of the}} insertion of digital communications networks and other computer technology into the urban fabric. In this paper I endeavor to contribute to a reclaiming of the cyber- prefix to propose a more appropriate and useful interpretation of the mediated city more akin to the ethos of cybernetic theory. I put forward a model of an urban cycle by which a city is instantiated and sustained. This cycle is divided into four phases [...] design, build, inhabit, and reflect [...] which also correspond to the <b>purviews</b> of different groups of professional or grassroots urban actors in conventional urban contexts. Using the above-mentioned urban cycle as a mapping convention, I visualize the ways in which these ideas work on and in the urban cycle and identify a subset that represent a transgression of ingrained divisions and blockages in the urban cycle, hinting at potential future developments of the mediated city.

40|$|As an {{organized}} subarea of academic communication scholarship, {{the study of}} visual communication is relatively new. For instance, at this writing, visual communication has not yet attained regular division status in either the International Communication Association or the National Communication Association. However, interest in visual issues appears to be growing among communication scholars, and the two books under review {{are part of a}} rapidly expanding literature (e. g., Barnard, 2001; Emmison 2 ̆ 6 Smith, 2000; Evans 2 ̆ 6 Hall, 1999; Helfand, 2001; Howells, 2002; Mirzoeff, 1999; Prosser, 1998; Rose, 2001; Thomas, 2000). As it seeks to differentiate itself from other scholarly areas with similar <b>purviews</b> (such as mass communication or cultural studies), the study of visual communication is increasingly confronted with two major issues. First, on a theoretical level, visually oriented scholars need to develop a sharper understanding of the distinctions among the major modes of communication (image, word, music, body display, etc.) and a clearer appreciation of the specific role that each plays in social processes. Second, on the research front, {{there is a need for}} more sophisticated ways of exploring visual meanings and investigating viewers 2 ̆ 7 responses to images. Taken together, the two books reviewed here touch upon both of these features of visual scholarship and make productive contributions with respect to each of them...|$|R
5|$|On 17 June 1936, all {{police forces}} {{throughout}} Germany were united under the <b>purview</b> of Himmler and the SS. Himmler and Heydrich thus became {{two of the}} most powerful men in the country's administration. Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; regular uniformed police). In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. This further increased the collective authority of the SS.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the <b>purview</b> of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Brady bill loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers of firearms require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under <b>purview</b> of the National Firearms Act.

The dreams and desires of the city dwellers is something unregistered in the <b>purviews</b> of maps, plans, elevations and statistical analysis. Perhaps it is registered through the commotion of the crowds, slipping through the streets. The “come and go” may behold {{the key to the}} vitality of the city. The Ethiopian District of Johannesburg is a small yet bustling fragment of the city. Informal and uncontrolled trade is a reality that cannot be stifled. The journey of arrival, waiting and departure not only of people, but of objects, contribute to the cacophony of stubborn urbanity and the mental life of the city. Spontaneity, risk and wilderness in the city are symptoms of freedom and rebellion within the Ethiopian district that act against the bound and rational layer of systems, control and planning. A thriving cosmopolis – Johannesburg can be identified to possess the cultural capacity that supports the potential of rich urban interventions in an already existing setting of trade – formal and informal, legal and illegal, that extends beyond the physicality of city planning {{and architecture}}. The city of Johannesburg is a network of cultures, a system, which {{is in a state of}} continual becoming. It is a place which enshrines physical and cultural pluralism as well as the anxiety of difference as indispensable qualities of urbanis...|$|R

Dorothy Wang argues {{that there is a}} bias against Asian-American writers because of their race. Wang states that the: [...] "marginalization of Asian American poetry is, arguably, a synecdochic reflection of the larger state of poetry in a capitalist society - poets tend not to write best sellers and poetry has no use-value - yet the erasure of poetry within literary <b>purviews</b> bespeaks a more profound and troubling fundamental misapprehension within American literary (and racial) ideologies: the (mis)reading, even if mostly unconscious, of the category of 'Asian American poetry' as oxymoronic, a contradiction in terms, one that pits the sociopolitical (read: racial) against the aesthetic (the formal, the [...] "purely" [...] literary) in a false binary." [...] The lack of attention to race in poetry can cause Asian American's contribution to the poetic world to become almost nonexistent. Asian American literature has been taught in English departments across the country only for the past few decades and much of it has third-class status. Many American minority poets were not recognized for their poetry. For example, the 2008 PMLA [...] "The New Lyric Studies" [...] and in the"Poetry and Society" [...] were two awards where minority poets were not acknowledged for their poems.|$|R
40|$|Disputes {{between those}} holding differing {{political}} views are ubiquitous and deep-seated, {{and they often}} follow common, recognizable lines. The supporters of tradition and stability, {{sometimes referred to as}} conservatives, do battle with the supporters of innovation and reform, sometimes referred to as liberals. Understanding the correlates of those distinct political orientations is probably a prerequisite for managing political disputes, which are a source of social conflict that can lead to frustration and even bloodshed. A rapidly growing body of empirical evidence documents a multitude of ways in which liberals and conservatives differ from each other in <b>purviews</b> of life with little direct connection to politics, from tastes in art to desire for closure and from disgust sensitivity to the tendency to pursue new information, but the central theme of the differences is a matter of debate. In this article, we argue that one organizing element of the many differences between liberals and conservatives is the nature of their physiological and psychological responses to features of the environment that are negative. Compared with liberals, conservatives tend to register greater physiological responses to such stimuli and also to devote more psychological resources to them. Operating from this point of departure, we suggest approaches for refining understanding of the broad relationship between political views and response to the negative. We conclude with a discussion of normative implications, stressing that identifying differences across ideological groups is not tantamount to declaring one ideology superior to another...|$|R
