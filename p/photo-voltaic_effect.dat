For bi-layers, no such effect was present, suggesting strong size effect in light-matter interaction. The <b>photo-voltaic</b> <b>effect</b> was observed to highly direction dependent in the film plane, {{which suggests that the}} oblique deposition configuration {{plays a key role in}} developing the rectifying potential gradient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of any large area and transfer free MoS 2 photo device with performance comparable to their exfoliated counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{model of}} a p-n {{junction}} {{in the area of}} the grain boundaries in polycrystalline p-n structures is proposed. Shown mechanism of formation of impurity thermal-voltaic and impurity thermal-photovoltaic effects in IGB. A concept of creating highly effective comparatively inexpensive solar energy converters will be justified by the results we obtained during the study of the ITPV and ITV effects. Proposed theoretical model and experimentally obtained results can be useful in study of poly-Si n+-p structures, for example during external treatment. They allow explaining why in certain temperature ranges, an additional local heating, or applied potential, or a local illumination of pre-heated surface of poly-Si n+-p structure containing deep level impurities, can dramatically change the flow of current. In other words, such external treatment become trigger mechanism for discharge of charges accumulated in IGB due to impurity related thermal voltaic or thermal and <b>photo-voltaic</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

The <b>photo-voltaic</b> <b>effect</b> observable {{in a wide}} range of the spectrum (0. 4 - 2 µm) is explained by different signs of the photo EMF created by the separation of photocarriers in the energy barrier and from the levels of intrinsic defects as well as deep impurities of oxygen in the quasineutral base. A mechanism of photosensitivity of thin base structures with Schottky-Mott’s barrier under photovoltaic conditions is offered...|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{we present}} {{evidence}} of photo-voltaic effects in mono and bi-layer ultra-high vacuum magnetron sputtered large area MoS 2 specimens in absence of intentionally fabricated p-n junction or Schottky type contact. The photo-responsivity and extrinsic quantum efficiency were {{estimated to be}} 0.08 A/W and 0.17 respectively. We also present evidence of potential gradient in oblique deposition of ultrathin semiconducting films and propose that this gradient is instrumental in generating the <b>photo-voltaic</b> <b>effect</b> in ohmic contacts. While most of the MoS 2 opto-electronics literature is based on photo-transistors fabricated on exfoliated flakes, the extremely simple design (no need for rectifying junctions) involving large area physical vapour deposited 2 D MoS 2 presented in this study can significantly impact technology development in this area.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper has}} dealt with the {{probability}} of oyster shell desiccant cooling system driven by renewable energy of <b>photo-voltaic</b> <b>effect.</b> For this, fundamental experiments {{have been carried out}} focusing on the observation of dehumidifying effect of oyster shell and peltier elements used for air conditioning system. From this study, it is found that oyster shell has sufficient probability for using as a desiccant in air-conditioning system. Moreover, the heat releasing device(peltier element) can be used with direct current from PV cells so the system can be operated with high efficiency. As a result, the absolute humidity in a test chamber was reasonably controlled by oyster shell and peltier elements. Also the photo-voltaic energy from sun was enough for running power of this system...|$|E

Properties of the spin-voltaic effect can be used to perform all-electrical measurements of spin relaxation time and injected spin polarization, as well as to design devices with large magnetoresistance and spin-controlled amplification.

30|$|To {{explain the}} {{anomalous}} observation of <b>photo-voltaic</b> <b>effect,</b> we closely examine the giant photovoltaic (voltages many {{times larger than}} the potential drop across the energy gap) effects in thin semiconducting films. The early literature [23] indicates occurrence of this intriguing phenomenon in many materials, however the inconsistency in experimental results has contributed to the lack of understanding and technological relevance. Nevertheless, a consistent observation is that an electro-motive potential gradient (the end closer to the source shows negative polarity) is seen in semiconducting thin films when the insulating substrate is inclined with respect to the incident deposition flux. This is exactly same as our deposition configuration as shown in Figure  1 a. Interestingly, this specific condition is impossible to achieve in the conventional techniques (exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition). It is hypothesized that the oblique deposition creates nanoscale p-n junctions due to stacking fault, domain boundaries (Figure  1 b suggests turbostratic structure of the films) or the Dember effect [23].|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaic cells {{composed}} of thin mesoporous polyaniline films sandwiched between an indium-tin oxide anode and aluminium cathode have been fabricated. The cells show {{an increase in}} the photo-generated open-circuit voltage (V oc) from 0. 2 V to 0. 6 V and stable-in-time V oc generation following the addition of water containing highly hydrated ions, e. g. tap water. We explain the waterpromoted <b>photo-voltaic</b> <b>effect</b> by the polarity of the water environment. Theoretical calculations show that increasing the solvent polarity increases the energy of the electronic transition related to the measured V oc. The stable-in-time V oc generation could be explained by the increase in the lifetime of the excitons as well as by their more efficient dissociation in the interpenetrating network of polyaniline and water. The penetration of water into the mesoporous polyaniline films is promoted by the presence of highly hydrated ions. © 2012 Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences...|$|E
30|$|A {{counter-argument}} {{could be}} {{that even though the}} I-V profile is linear and no rectifying junction was intentionally fabricated in the devices, there could be Schottky barriers due to the work function of the Ti electrode [24] or through the localized doping of the MoS 2 (similar to graphene induced doping [25]). If this were the case, the effect would be the same for all of the four electrodes and there would not be any anisotropic behaviour observed. At the same time, if the fundamental mechanism indeed involves the oblique deposition of the MoS 2, we would observe large potential between the ends closest and farthest to the deposition source and minimal potential in the perpendicular direction. To corroborate this hypothesis, we measured the open circuit voltage due to illumination by simply changing the electrical terminals in our van der Pauw structure. It is expected {{that the end of the}} specimen closest to the deposition source will have negative while the farthest end will have positive polarity. The two other ends that are equidistant to the deposition source should have the same potential and thus will not show any <b>photo-voltaic</b> <b>effect.</b> Or in other words, the observed photovoltaic effects should be highly anisotropic. As shown in Figure  2 c and d, this is indeed the case. This evidence corroborates our hypothesis since the MoS 2 layers are not expected to show in-plane electrical anisotropy of such large magnitude. The literature contains evidence of thermal anisotropy in 2 D MoS 2 [26], where the degree of anisotropy is around 0.8.|$|E
