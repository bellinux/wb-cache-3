2500|$|The elected {{government}} of Kentucky being decidedly Union, {{a group of}} Southern sympathizers began formulating a plan to create a Confederate shadow government for the Commonwealth. Following a preliminary meeting on October 29, 1861, delegates from 68 of Kentucky's 110 counties met at the Clark House in Russellville on November 18. The convention passed an ordinance of secession, adopted a new state seal, and elected Scott County native George W. Johnson as governor. Bowling Green, now occupied by General Johnston himself, was designated as the state capital, though the delegates provided that the government could meet anywhere deemed appropriate by the <b>provisional</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>council</b> and governor. Being unable to flesh out a complete constitution and system of laws, the delegates voted that [...] "the Constitution and laws of Kentucky, not inconsistent with the acts of this Convention, {{and the establishment of}} this Government, and the laws which may be enacted by the Governor and Council, shall be the laws of this state." [...] Though President Davis had some reservation about the circumvention of the elected General Assembly in forming the Confederate government, Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861. Kentucky was represented by the central star on the Confederate battle flag.|$|E
