40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} work integrated learning (WIL) {{is the development}} of <b>professional</b> <b>competence,</b> the ability of students to perform in the work place. Alignment theory therefore suggests that the assessment of WIL should include an assessment of students’ demonstration of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in the workplace. The assessment of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL is, however, problematic. It may be impractical for the academic supervisor to directly assess <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> if there is a large number of students in external placements. If evidence of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> is provided by the student, the student’s ability to articulate his or her own capabilities will interfere with the validity of the assessment. If evidence of professional competency is provided by the supervisor then the assessment is heavily dependent on the individual supervisor and may be unreliable. This paper will examine the literature relating to the assessment of <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL. The paper will be informed by the author’s experience in coordinating a WIL subject in an undergraduate law course. It will recommend that a mix of evidence provided by the student, the workplace supervisor and the academic supervisor should be used to assess <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL...|$|R

The purposes of this research were to investigate; first, what are Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; second, what is Teacher work-autonomy of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; third, what relationships can be found between teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> and Teacher Work-Autonomy and of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; fourth, is there any difference in Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> based on gender, school location, classroom teacher/subject teacher, grade level or teaching experiences; and, fifth, is there any difference in Teacher Work-Autonomy based on gender, school location, classroom teacher/subject teacher, grade level or teaching experiences. The thesis presents a quantitative research study carried in Aceh, Indonesia in 2016. The research data were collected through questionnaires. Seventy teachers participated in providing information for this research work. The participants completed two questionnaires on teachers work-autonomy and teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Friedman s teacher work-autonomy construct measured teacher perceived autonomy, while Niemi s teachers <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> construct measured teacher perceived <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Research results indicate that most teachers of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa in Aceh occupied moderate degree of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> {{and most of the}} teachers attained a moderate degree of work-autonomy. This study results also claim that there was a moderate and positive correlation between teacher work-autonomy and teachers <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> The direction of correlation was positive and there was evidence found of correlation between Teacher work-autonomy and Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> The results indicate that when level of teacher autonomy increase, the level of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> escalated, and lower level of teacher autonomy is associated with lower level of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Supplying teacher with high level of work autonomy is one obvious way to upsurge teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> As degree of autonomy increased, degree of competences increased. On the opposite, when the score of autonomy decreased the score of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> is decreased. Teacher autonomy was associated with teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Research results also indicate that a degree to which teachers perceived work-autonomy and a degree to which teachers perceived <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> were diverse based on gender, classroom/subject teacher, experience, level of school and location of school, even though the differentiations were not statistically significant. This research suggests that one way to increase teachers levels of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> is by enhancing teachers degrees of autonomy in the schools.
