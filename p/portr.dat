As for the period covered, and that is from the earliest beginnings, the book is a rich store of information. It was published in chanters in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 4 and has now, after considerable revision by the author, been brought out by the Botanical Survey of India, preceded by an Introduction by Father H.

40|$|Segmentation is a best {{method to}} divide the {{required}} region from the medical images. This research is based on segmentation of medical images (MRI, CT scans) based on the previous method known as pre-operative and post-recurrence tumor registration (<b>PORTR)</b> and proposed method biography based neural clustering (BBNC) with genetic processing for tumor segmentation. By using the new technique the extracted part can be view in 3 D model and also can get the actual segmented tumor region. This new method will be helpful for diagnostics to find the tumor area as well as pixel difference in segmented part to define the tumor area accurately. While in the previous approach all the parameters have been used likewise, in which the registration method is used to transform the different sets of data into one coordinate system for segmentation of medical images. Registration basically is used to improve the signals to reduce the noise from the images. These techniques are better to find the tumor area from the MRI and CT scans, but after comparing them better results have been obtained in proposed technique. The proposed technique (BBNC) reduces the extracted region again into required and actual region of tumor with accuracy of area, time and pixel difference...|$|E

(1913 - 1981) On 21 October, 1981, Dr. Selwyn L. Everist, past {{director of the}} Queensland Herbarium, died in hospital in Brisbane, {{after a period of}} intermittent ill health. He commenced work at the Herbarium in 1930 and graduated from Queensland University with a B. Sc. in 1936. Following the retirement of Mr. W. D. Francis in 1954, he became Government Botanist, a position which was later changed to Director, Botany Branch and the Queensland Herbarium, Department of Primary Industries. He retired in 1976 (see Flora Malesiana Bulletin 30, 2745 - 2746). He was awarded an honorary Ph. D. on the basis of written work. Dr. Everist will be best remembered for his work in the field of economic botany. He published numerous articles on weeds and poisonous plants and his book Poisonous Plants of Australia will remain the definitive text in its field for many decades. He received a copy of the second edition of his book just one day before he died. The considerable addition of material following the first edition is testimony to his activity in ’retirement’. He was a good herbarium administrator, though he most enjoyed working in the field. He was always willing to provide assistance to herbarium botanists throughout Australia and overseas and he was very supportive of the Flora Malesiana project. — R. W. Johnson...|$|E
40|$|In October 1981, the Sijthoff-Noordhoff firm which {{published}} the Flora Malesiana {{was taken over}} by Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Box 566, The Hague, The Netherlands*. Publication is continued in the same form, but the transition caused some delay in the schedule. Flora Malesiana Series ii (Pteridophyta) Volume 1 Part 5 thus was issued on 1 March 1982. The posted price is Dfl. 170 abroad (in the Netherlands, Value Added Tax is to be paid). This price includes the binding of this volume, which is now completed. This Part 5, containing pages (1) —(20) and 331 - 599, gives the Dedication and the revision of the Thelypteridaceae, both by R. E. Holttum. The Dedication, p. (6) -(20), incl. <b>portr.,</b> is to Carl Christensen. Rather than biographical — many such references give F. A. Stafleu & R. S. Cowan, Taxonomic Literature, 2 nd ed. (1976) 501 — it is a history of pteridology in a nutshell, with notes on strengths and weaknesses of various authors, exemplified in Gleicheniaceae, Grammitidaceae, Lomariopsis/ Stenochlaena, and Pleocnemia. ”We now have reached the stage at which most Malesian species can be allocated to definite natural groups which may have generic rank; most genera can also be associated in groups which appear to be natural; but it is often not yet clear how groups of genera are inter-related. ” The Thelypteridaceae itself {{was one of the most}} difficult groups the author could chose. It here contains 440 species in 22 genera, with many new taxa and transfers, particularly from Dryopteris, a key genus to which Christensen devoted a monumental study.
