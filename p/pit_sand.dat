5000|$|A sandpit (Commonwealth countries) or sandbox (US/Canada) is a low, wide {{container}} or {{shallow depression}} filled with soft (beach) sand {{in which children}} can play. Sharp sand (as used in the building industry) is not suitable. Many homeowners with children build sandpits in their backyards because, unlike much playground equipment, they can be easily and cheaply constructed. A [...] "sandpit" [...] may also denote an open <b>pit</b> <b>sand</b> mine.|$|E

This will be observed if, in the first place, the architect does not demand things which cannot be found or made ready without great expense. For example: it is not everywhere that there is plenty of pit-sand, rubble, fir, clear fir, and marble...

40|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>pits</b> are a {{valuable}} habitat which can hold many sand living species including several endangered ones. As many sand habitats with exposed sand are declining, <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> have a {{potential as a}} substitute habitat. This {{study was conducted to}} see what effect the area of a <b>sand</b> <b>pit</b> has on species number and composition of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Also, the effects of other environmental variables were tested, for example the proportion open sand, vegetation cover, sun exposure and tree cover. The study was conducted in the county of Uppsala in 2008 and included 13 <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> with areas between 200 and 180, 000 m 2. Pitfall traps were used as sampling method. The study showed that the area of the <b>sand</b> <b>pit</b> affected the number of sand living species, which increased with an increasing area. The medium sized <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> (~ 5, 000 m 2) had the highest number of sand living species, while the largest sites (~ 100, 000 m 2) had slightly less species probably because the large sites had a more homogeneous habitat. In smaller <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> the proportion of sand living species was lower which indicate an edge effect. The species composition was quite similar between most sites irrespective to its area. However, some of the small <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> had a deviating composition due to the edge effect. Still, this suggest that a wide range of areas of the <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> seems not important to preserve to include all sand living ground beetle species, even if some variation always is preferable. The species composition is however influenced by proportion open sand. Based on this study, the recommendation is that <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> preserved should have an area of more than 2, 500 m 2. A recommendation of an optimum area cannot be given as large sites with a heterogeneous habitat might be as species rich as medium sized ones. However, as smaller areas are more cost efficient to preserve the main focus is recommended to be on medium sized <b>sand</b> <b>pits...</b>|$|R

40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} building materials used in the world. It is prepared by mixing cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate and water in suitable proportions. From earlier days onwards river sand is used as fine aggregate. Nowadays, M-sand, <b>pit</b> <b>sand</b> etc. are also used. Since <b>pit</b> <b>sand</b> is available only at certain regions and due to the scarcity of river sand and M-sand, it has become necessary to find an alternative material, as fine aggregate. The alternative material selected here is sand from Weathered Crystalline Rock. And this type of rock is abundantly available at low cost in tropical areas. This paper discusses the use of Weathered Crystalline Sand as fine aggregate in concrete. A comparison of properties like fineness, specific gravity, bulking of sand, bulk density, compressive strength of mortar cubes and compressive strength of concrete cubes using different fine aggregates is also conducted...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{development}} {{is one of}} the main objectives of developed and developing nations worldwide. Development comes with growth of urban areas. Urban growth is achieved through sand and gravel mining for construction of modern, attractive and durable structures. The study examined positive and negative environmental impacts of the continuous removal of river sand, <b>pit</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel from sampled rivers and open areas surrounding Gaborone developing Central Business District, malls and private properties in city. Quantitative and qualitative research designs that is questionnaire survey, oral interviews, field observation and measurements were used to collect data from selected sampled points. Metsimotlhabe and Ditlhakane rivers were selected because they are nearer to Gaborone and most river sand is mined from these rivers. More points were sampled from open areas in Kumakwane, Kopong and Bela Bela farms where <b>pit</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel are mined. Convenience and purposive sampling methods were used to pick questionnaire survey respondents (175) from Kumakwane and Metsimotlhabe villages where people affected lives. Findings of the study highlighted that river sand was mined most from rivers near Gaborone compared to <b>pit</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel because of its multi uses. Mining is important for economic development, to construct durable, modern structures, employment creation and revenue collection but removal of river sand leads to deepening and widening of rivers. Artificial rivulets are formed as resource is extracted uncontrollably. <b>Pit</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel are extracted from open areas creating uncovered deep pits, which caused of accidents to children and livestock. Erosion and environmental degradation occur due to continuous mining. Miners dispose waste on open areas and riverbeds causing land pollution. Dust and noise pollution from tipper trucks ferrying sand and gravel are a cause of concern to villagers as the trucks move even at night, disturbing sleep. Solutions to uncontrolled mining include 24 hour security and regular raids on illegal miners. The author recommends that heavy penalties should be imposed to curb illegal mining. High level decision making forum involving all stakeholders is necessary to discuss problems of illegal mining and how to limit negative impacts. Department of Mines need to develop an Environmental Management Plan and a close monitoring program nationwide. Environmental SciencesM. Sc. (Environmental Management...|$|E

It was experimentally established that the shrinkage rate of soft rocks decreases sharply and attenuates at the effective pressure of 30 to 35 MPa, which leads to stabilization of their filtration-capacitive and deformation behavior. The research of rocks, which are returned during drilling in the form of sand and cuttings, opens opportunities for using the obtained data for interpretation of production well logging and calculation of hydrocarbon reserves...|$|E

40|$|In 2009, Clarke {{undertook}} a residency at LOKAAL 01, Antwerp entitled ‘Cannon Happy’ where he researched {{the role of}} humour in contemporary protest marches. His findings led him {{to focus on the}} function of latex character masks that are frequently worn by protesters worldwide. During the residency he created 35, six-sheet posters that contained images of squashed and scanned masks collected during his stay. These ideas were then developed further in Heads of State, a solo show that extended his research into the context of painting and sculpture by making singular works using experimental reprographic and casting techniques. Every acquired mask was turned inside out, casted with plaster on to a scaffold pole and painted with industrial paint. When discussed in a lecture at London Metropolitan University Clarke insisted this was not sculpture, but instead a reprographic process that was located within an alternative printmaking practice referencing political propaganda. Clarke proposed to continue to develop this work for the Whitechapel Gallery’s ‘London Open 2012 ’. The resulting new installation of ‘Heads of State’ consisted of 30 busts installed in the main gallery. Clarke was invited by the Whitechapel to lead two educational workshops in relation to work in the exhibition, in the first, a ton of play <b>pit</b> <b>sand</b> was brought into the gallery and the artist encouraged children to cast found objects in sand. For the second, Clarke instructed teenagers on how to research political figures and facilitated the creation of a political puppet show. He used his installation to help participants discover legacies of leading political figures...|$|E
