5000|$|Pterostylis littoralis, {{commonly}} known as the coastal leafy greenhood, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to South Australia. Flowering plants have up to five <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> flowers with darker green stripes and brownish tips. The flowers have a narrow, <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> labellum. Non-flowering <b>plants</b> have a rosette of leaves on a short, thin stalk but flowering plants lack the rosette, instead having four or five stem leaves.|$|R
40|$|The <b>green</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> (Apolygus lucorum Meyer-Dür) {{is a key}} pest of Bt cotton in China. Along with {{biological}} control, {{chemical control}} {{is one of the}} most important strategies in A. lucorum Integrated Pest Management (IPM). The goal of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of eight conventional insecticides to A. lucorum and to assess the susceptibility of two generalist predators Chrysopa sinica (Jieder) and Propylaea japonica (Thunbery) to insecticides that are commonly used in A. lucorum management. Via glass-vial and leaf-dip bioassay, toxicity tests with selected insecticides at two different life-stages of A. lucorum indicated significant differences between the LD 50 or LC 50 values for these compounds within different insecticidal classes. Phenylpyrazole fipronil had the highest toxicity to 4 th-instar nymphs and adults of A. lucorum, whereas neonicotinoid imidacloprid had the lowest toxicity among the insecticides. Females were more tolerant to insecticides than were males, as shown by the higher LD 50 values for females. Furthermore, laboratory tests showed that endosulfan had the highest selectivity to C. sinica and P. japonica: the selective toxicity ratios (STRs) were superior to other tested insecticides, particularly imidacloprid, and were 5. 396 and 4. 749 -fold higher than baseline STRs, respectively. From this study, we conclude that fipronil can potentially be used to efficiently control A. lucorum. An alternative control agent worth consideration is endosulfan, owing to its relative safety to non-targeted natural enemies...|$|R

40|$|Seedlings {{of barley}} (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Abyssinian) were grown at {{constant}} temperature and light intensity and the properties {{and structure of}} chloroplasts in the primary leaf were examined. Seventeen growth temperatures ranging from 2 to 37 C were employed. Three major effects of the growth temperature were seen. (a) At very low and high growth temperatures chloroplast biogenesis was inhibited. This occurred in plants grown at temperatures above 32 C while growth at 2 C resulted in a mixed population of <b>pale</b> yellow, <b>pale</b> <b>green,</b> and <b>green</b> <b>plants.</b> (b) Chloroplasts were produced at all other temperatures tested but growth temperatures within a few degrees of those inhibitory to chloroplast development resulted in chloroplasts with abnormal properties and structure. Chloroplasts in the <b>green</b> <b>plants</b> grown at 2 and 5 C showed a number of structural peculiarities, including a characteristic crimping of granal thylakoids. Photoreductive activity, measured using ferricyanide as the Hill oxidant {{in the presence of}} gramicidin D, was high, but this activity in chloroplasts isolated from plants grown at 2 C showed thermal inactivation at temperatures 5 degrees lower than was the case with plants grown at higher temperatures. High growth temperatures (30 to 32 C) yielded chloroplasts with reduced photoreductive activity and a tendency toward the formation of large grana and disorientation of the lamellar systems with respect to one another. Chloroplasts of the most affected plants (grown at 32 C) frequently contained a very large elongated granum, with narrow intrathylakoid spaces. (c) Photoreductive activity was not constant at intermediate growth temperatures but steadily declined with decreasing growth temperatures between 27 and 11 C. Some alterations in chloroplast structure were also observed...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} adult {{diapause}} {{in the western}} tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug,</b> Lygus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae), have highlighted the need to identify a reliable external marker for the internal changes that differentiate a normal animal from one that is overwintering. To test the efficacy of a color based discrimination system, L. hesperus of both genders were reared from eggs through day 10 of adulthood under a 10 hour photophase at a constant temperature. They were separated into three color groups (yellow, <b>pale</b> <b>green,</b> dark green), then dissected for diapause categorization based on internal development. Most yellow individuals were in diapause, dark green individuals were not, and <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> ones were mixed. A group of 25 assessors, naïve with regard to L. hesperus development, {{were then asked to}} use a simplified color criteria (yellow = diapause, green = non-diapause) to estimate the status of a mixture of diapausing and non-diapausing adults of both genders aged two to seven days post-eclosion. After dissection to verify diapause status, assessor accuracy was found to be ineffective for assessing adults of both sexes younger than four days because color differences, which increased with age, were subtle or non-existent at this stage.
