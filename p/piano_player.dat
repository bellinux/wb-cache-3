25|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{featured in the}} 1991 feature film The Five Heartbeats, which follows {{the lives of the}} fictional singing group of the same name. In the scene the song is featured in, the group is about to perform in a Battle of the Bands when the announcer, a cousin of another musician in the competition, tells them backstage that a new house rule demands they use a <b>piano</b> <b>player</b> hired by the owners of the building. The members of the group have not practiced with the <b>piano</b> <b>player,</b> and quickly realize this will harm their performance. The announcer then goads the audience into booing and throwing objects at the Heartbeats as they perform. Duck, tired of his music being altered, throws the <b>piano</b> <b>player</b> off the stage and plays in his own style. The crowd soon applauds as The Heartbeats perform together and the group wins the contest.|$|E
40|$|Harmonization is {{a crucial}} task in piano music creation. However, it is a tedious task for novice <b>piano</b> <b>players.</b> This is because <b>piano</b> <b>players</b> need {{to keep track of}} the {{extensive}} set of western music rules and concepts, and also need years of training and practice to harmonize a melody accurately. This research addresses the problems of harmonization and proposes an interactive learning tool, "ChordATune", that facilitates <b>piano</b> <b>players,</b> song writers and music students to experiment with harmonization concepts to create harmonies effectively incorporating emotions, genre, beat and tempo...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the success}} of The 400 Blows, Truffaut {{featured}} disjunctive editing and seemingly random voice-overs in his next film Shoot the <b>Piano</b> <b>Player</b> (1960) starring Charles Aznavour. Truffaut has stated {{that in the middle}} of filming, he realized that he hated gangsters. But since gangsters were a main part of the story, he toned up the comical aspect of the characters and made the movie more attuned to his liking. Even though Shoot the <b>Piano</b> <b>Player</b> was much appreciated by critics, it performed poorly at the box office. While the film focused on two of the French New Wave's favorite elements, American film noir and themselves, Truffaut never again experimented as heavily.|$|E

25|$|Although {{members of}} the jazz {{community}} initially felt that a Jewish <b>piano</b> <b>player</b> and a white novelist could not adequately convey the plight of blacks in a 1930s Charleston ghetto, jazz musicians warmed up more to the opera after twenty years, and more jazz-based recordings of it began to appear. Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald recorded an album in 1957 in which they sang and scatted Gershwin's tunes. The next year, Miles Davis recorded what some consider a seminal interpretation of the opera arranged for big band.|$|E

25|$|When Tams-Witmark {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Charlie Brown, the orchestration was rewritten from the original version. In the original Broadway production, the complete orchestration contained a piano, bass, guitar, percussion, five woodwind parts, two trumpets, horn, trombone, and strings. The <b>piano</b> <b>player</b> can also be doubled on celeste, toy piano, and melodica; the first woodwind plays flute and piccolo; {{the second is the}} second flute part; the third and fourth are the first and second clarinet parts respectively; the fifth on bass clarinet and tenor sax.

40|$|The mental {{representation}} and {{processes involved in}} complex mental arithmetic, {{and the effect of}} music training on mathematical processing are still unclear in the literature. There were two experiments in this thesis. In experiment 1, we investigated how complex mental arithmetic involving double-digit numbers are represented and processed mentally with a dual-task paradigm. Furthermore, to better understand how the processing pattern due to music training can potentially enhance one’s mathematical processing, we recruited a group of <b>piano</b> <b>players</b> and examined their differences compared with novices in experiment 2. In the first experiment, it was found that participants in general engaged more visuospatial processing in both double-digit addition and multiplication. There was a shift in processing pattern in multiplication, where the reliance on verbal processing in single-digit multiplication has been shifted to visuospatial processing in double-digit multiplication. Participants may use visuospatial processing to hold the intermediate solutions visually and to approximate numerosity. In the second experiment, it was found that <b>piano</b> <b>players</b> performed better in calculation tasks (especially in addition) under full attention. The superior performance among <b>piano</b> <b>players</b> may be related to their processing pattern as revealed by the dual task condition. Specifically, unlike novices, who employed more visuospatial than verbal processing to carry out complex arithmetic, <b>piano</b> <b>players</b> did not show such strong preference. The ability to not rely on a particular kind of processing may allow <b>piano</b> <b>players</b> to have greater flexibility in engaging either verbal or visuospatial processing in doing complex arithmetic. This is consistent with previous studies showing musicians having more bilateral connectivity compared to novices. This suggests that the effect of music training can be transferred to mathematical processing. published_or_final_versionPsychologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

25|$|When Charlie Brown {{was brought}} back to Broadway in 1999, the {{orchestration}} was deeply revised, containing a five-piece orchestra which consists of a piano, bass, percussion, a woodwind player, and a violinist. The <b>piano</b> <b>player</b> can double on keyboard synthesizer and kazoo; the bass player doubles on electric and acoustic bass, tenor recorder, and kazoo (in the original Broadway pit the bass player also doubled on acoustic and electric guitar); the woodwind part doubles on piccolo, flute, clarinet, soprano and alto sax, soprano recorder, and kazoo; the violin part also doubles on viola, alto recorder, kazoo, and tambourine. This version is also available through Tams-Witmark.|$|E
