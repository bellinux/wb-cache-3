40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} end-user directed access control to services in Internet service centres that, beside the classical Internet services (e. g., e-mail), offer a multitude of new services (e. g., on-line conferencing and auctioning) over the Internet. The model {{is based on the}} concept of closed user groups. The main idea is that at creation time each service instance and its components are assigned to a user group previously formed by a subset of the end-users, and access control is performed for access attempts through checking the group assignment of the accessed resource against the group memberships of the authenticated accessing end-user. Access control is directed c fl 1999 IFIP. Published in the Proceedings of the DAIS' 99 Conference.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{instruction}} caching {{scheme that}} utilizes the block <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> is proposed mainly targeted for embedded multimedia processors. The block <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> is obtained by profiling application programs. The {{goal of this}} caching scheme is to keep more important code blocks longer using the block <b>priority</b> <b>information,</b> which programmers provide by analyzing the profiling results of multimedia applications. In addition to a new caching scheme, the methods for determining the priority of each code block are also developed and their performances are evaluated using real multimedia applications. The experimental {{results show that the}} cache miss ratio can be reduced up to nearly a half of that of the normal LRU replacement scheme although the improvement depends on the cache size...|$|R

40|$|Dr Guy Rocheteau {{proposed}} that <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> themes, {{based on a}} study of the constraints to agricultural development in the ACP countries, could be grouped under six major headings: conquering markets; production intensification and optimization; improvement of natural resource management; mobilization of the civil society; strengthening national agricultural systems; and poverty alleviation in rural areas. With no order of priority implied, these six headings nevertheless gave a common point of reference for the six regional working groups: Pacific, Caribbean and four regions of Africa West, Central, East and Southern Africa. The working groups of ten or twelve people were asked to list the constraints to rural development from a regional perspective. Retaining on this list only those constraints which could be directly linked to a lack of information, each workshop then identified <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> themes for its region.

5000|$|She {{has also}} been {{investigating}} how emotional arousal shapes memory. Mather and her graduate student Matthew Sutherland outlined an arousal-biased competition (ABC) model that they argue can account for a disparate array of emotional memory effects, including some effects that initially appear contradictory (e.g., emotion-induced retrograde amnesia vs. emotion-induced retrograde enhancement). ABC model posits that arousal leads to both [...] "winner-take-more" [...] and [...] "loser-take-less" [...] effects in memory by biasing competition to enhance high <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> and suppress low <b>priority</b> <b>information.</b> <b>Priority</b> is determined by both bottom-up salience and top-down goal relevance. Previous theories fail {{to account for the}} broad array of selective emotional memory effects in the literature, and so the ABC model fills a key theoretical hole in the field of emotional memory.|$|R

30|$|The {{bitstream}} adaptation {{process for}} scalable videos utilizes the scalability features of SVC streams {{in order to}} adapt the video stream according to the application controller's decision. Firstly, the SVC <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> contained in the NALU header is a key tool for SVC bitstream adaptation. Any part of an SVC bitstream can be simply extracted by removing NALUs based on these parameters. The <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> is contained in specific fields of the SVC NALU header, namely the dependency_id, temporal_id, quality_id (QID), and priority_id, indicating the spatial, temporal, quality, and priority layers the SVC NALU belongs to, respectively. Secondly, the Scalable Supplemental Enhancement Information (SSEI) NALUs {{can be used for}} defining the bitrates and other characteristics of the SVC stream and its sub-streams. The SSEI information can be send in-band as well as out-of-band.|$|R
40|$|Representing and {{reasoning}} with priorities {{are important in}} commonsense reasoning. This paper introduces a framework of prioritized logic programming (PLP), which has a mechanism of explicit representation of <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> in a program. When a program contains incomplete or indefinite information, PLP is useful for specifying preference to reduce non-determinism in logic programming. Moreover, PLP can realize various forms of commonsense reasoning in AI such as abduction, default reasoning, circumscription, and their prioritized variants. The proposed framework increases the expressive power of logic programming and exploits new applications in knowledge representation. Keywords: prioritized logic programs, abduction, default reasoning, prioritized circumscription 1 Introduction In commonsense reasoning a theory is usually assumed incomplete and may contain indefinite or conflicting knowledge. Under such circumstances, <b>priority</b> <b>information</b> is useful to select appropriate know [...] ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{introduction}} of electronic patient records that are accessible by multiple providers raises security issues and requires informed consent - {{or at the}} very least, an opportunity to opt out. Introduction of the Summary Care Record (SCR) (a centrally stored electronic summary of a patient's medical record) in pilot sites in the UK was associated with low awareness, despite an intensive public <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> that included letters, posters, leaflets, and road shows. AIM: To understand why the public <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> had limited impact and to learn lessons for future programmes. METHODS: Linguistic and communications analysis of components of the programme, contextualized within a wider mixed-method case study of the {{introduction of}} the SCR in pilot sites. Theoretical insights from linguistics and communication studies were applied. RESULTS: The context of the SCR pilots and the linked <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> created inherent challenges which were partially but not fully overcome by the efforts of campaigners. Much effort was put into designing the content of a mail merge letter, but less attention was given to its novelty, linguistic style, and rhetorical appeal. Many recipients viewed this letter as junk mail or propaganda and discarded it unread. Other components of the <b>information</b> <b>programme</b> were characterized by low visibility, partly because only restricted areas were participating in the pilot. Relatively little use was made of interpersonal communication channels. CONCLUSION: Despite ethical and legal imperatives, informed consent for the introduction of shared electronic records may be difficult to achieve through public information campaigns. Success may be more likely if established principles of effective mass and interpersonal communication are applied...|$|R
