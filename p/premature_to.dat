5|$|The {{classification}} {{of this species}} is still debated, and molecular research by Joseph and Wilke in 2006 found that the complex split genetically into two clades—one roughly correlating with B. z. barnardi {{and the other with}} the other three forms; B. z. macgillivrayi was more closely related to B. z. zonarius than to the neighbouring B. z. barnardi. The researchers felt it was <b>premature</b> <b>to</b> reorganise the {{classification of}} the complex until more study was undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations that {{make it difficult to}} produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems to have lost a characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is <b>premature</b> <b>to</b> define higher levels of classification such as order, and recommend instead a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate and articulate, two approaches appeared in the 1990s: one approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with articulate brachiopods, since both use the same material in the mineral layers of their shell; the other approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer {{is different from that}} in either of the other two. However, some taxonomists believe it is <b>premature</b> <b>to</b> suggest higher levels of classification such as order and recommend a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or the deuterostomes.|$|E

25|$|In 1919 Goddard {{thought that}} it would be <b>premature</b> <b>to</b> {{disclose}} the results of his experiments, because his engine was not sufficiently developed.

25|$|Following the 2012 discovery, it {{was still}} {{unconfirmed}} {{whether or not the}} 125 GeV/c2 particle was a Higgs boson. On one hand, observations remained consistent with the observed particle being the Standard Model Higgs boson, and the particle decayed into {{at least some of the}} predicted channels. Moreover, the production rates and branching ratios for the observed channels broadly matched the predictions by the Standard Model within the experimental uncertainties. However, the experimental uncertainties currently still left room for alternative explanations, meaning an announcement of the discovery of a Higgs boson would have been <b>premature.</b> <b>To</b> allow more opportunity for data collection, the LHC's proposed 2012 shutdown and 2013–14 upgrade were postponed by 7 weeks into 2013.|$|E
25|$|In his 1997 account, Chatterjee infers the {{presence}} of feathers from alleged quill knobs on the badly smashed ulna and metacarpals III and IV, and infers {{the presence}} of remiges from such structures (though he does caution that this is uncertain). As {{is the case with}} the alleged quill knobs on the ulna, the metacarpal structures appear to be attributable to post-mortem damage. Moreover, the thumb, unlike the case in all birds, is not medially divergent. Considering how poorly preserved the ulna is, it is entirely <b>premature</b> <b>to</b> make any definitive conclusions as to {{the presence of}} quill knobs until such time as more adequate material becomes available.

25|$|When the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway (A) scandal {{divided the}} Liberal caucus, Puffer {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government of Premier Alexander Cameron Rutherford. When Rutherford's government fell and was replaced with that of fellow Liberal Arthur Sifton, Puffer joined Rutherford and his allies in voting against the new administration on its 1910 plan to confiscate the money raised by the A from a provincially guaranteed bond issue (on the grounds that it had defaulted on its obligations). However, he did not join Rutherford in supporting a 1913 Conservative motion of non-confidence against the government, which decried Sifton's handling of the A issue; instead, Puffer read a statement on behalf of several representatives saying that, while Rutherford's concerns were legitimate, it was <b>premature</b> <b>to</b> pass final judgment until the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had ruled on the legality of the government's plan.|$|E

According to the diary of Grand Chamberlain Hisanori Fujita, the Emperor, looking for a decisive battle (tennōzan), replied that it was <b>premature</b> <b>to</b> seek peace [...] "unless we make one more military gain". Also in February, Japan's treaty division wrote about Allied policies towards Japan regarding [...] "unconditional surrender, occupation, disarmament, elimination of militarism, democratic reforms, punishment of war criminals, and the status of the emperor."

The reporter from La Technique Aeronautique wrote, [...] "In the absence of definitive trials, permitting the precise yield of this machine, it is without doubt <b>premature</b> <b>to</b> say it will supersede the propeller... the tentative is interesting and we watch it closely." [...] The official exhibition report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described Coandă's novel wing design, and the unusual empennage.

500|$|The Zimbabwean {{government}} publicly threatened Smith on {{a regular}} basis, but in practice left him and his property largely untouched—Mugabe frequently pointed to Smith's freedom as evidence of Zimbabwe's reconciliation policy. Smith renamed the RF the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe (CAZ) on 21 July 1984, concurrently removing racial criteria for membership and inviting black Zimbabweans to join. The CAZ was very successful in the 1985 parliamentary election, winning 15 of the 20 white seats; Smith won decisively in Bulawayo Central. Mugabe interpreted this as [...] "the racists of this country" [...] defying his government and rejecting reconciliation, and immediately pledged to abolish the white seats, which he said compromised [...] "the sovereignty of our people". After Smith described Mugabe's government as [...] "illiterate" [...] on BBC television in November 1985, Mugabe told the House of Assembly Smith was [...] "an incorrigible racist" [...] who [...] "should long ago have been hanged and hanged publicly". Later that month, Smith's close friend and long-standing political associate [...] "Boss" [...] Lilford, who had provided much of the finance to form the RF, was found beaten and shot to death on his ranch.
