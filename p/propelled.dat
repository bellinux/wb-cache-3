40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a brief {{overview}} of the <b>Propel</b> Distributed Services Platform, the infrastructure component of the recently announced <b>Propel</b> Commerce System. The <b>Propel</b> Distributed Services Platform is Internet infrastructure software that provides an integrated set of core services for developers of mission-critical, datacentric, e-business applications. It is designed to provide the foundation for future as well as current <b>Propel</b> product offerings. We list the current problems and key requirements that have driven the design of the <b>Propel</b> Platform and then describe the resulting system architecture and highlight its feature set. 1 Introduction At <b>Propel,</b> we are currently {{putting the finishing touches on}} our initial product offering, the <b>Propel</b> Commerce System. Figure 1 gives a high-level view of the overall system. The <b>Propel</b> Commerce System is a full-featured e-commerce software product made up of three key elements: The <b>Propel</b> E-Commerce Suite is designed to support cust [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Propel</b> Fitness Water was {{introduced}} in 2002 by the company Pepsico. In January 2006, Gatorade introduced <b>Propel</b> Calcium to market. In summer of 2006, Gatorade introduced <b>Propel</b> powder packets, a dry powder mix of <b>Propel,</b> where {{the contents of a}} powder packet are added to a 500 mL (16.9 oz) bottle of water. <b>Propel</b> powder with Calcium launched in January 2010.In early 2009, Gatorade changed the bottle design. [...] The packaging claims that the bottles contain 20% less plastic than their predecessors. <b>Propel's</b> logo remains the same, but the words [...] "Fitness Water" [...] have been removed from the packaging, leaving the only description as [...] "Vitamin Enhanced Water Beverage".|$|R

5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling <b>Propelled</b> Explorer (TALISE).

5|$|Although {{busy with}} The Gates of Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an {{opportunity}} to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honoré de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met {{with varying degrees of}} disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that <b>propelled</b> him toward fame.|$|E

Turbofan engines may have an additional and separate <b>propelling</b> nozzle which produces a high speed <b>propelling</b> jet from the energy {{in the air that}} has passed through the fan. In addition, the nozzle helps to determine how the gas generator and fan operate as it acts as a downstream restrictor.|$|R
50|$|In {{projectile}} {{motion the}} most important force applied to the ‘projectile’ is the <b>propelling</b> force, {{in this case the}} <b>propelling</b> forces are the muscles that act upon the ball to make it move, and the stronger the force applied, the more <b>propelling</b> force, which means the projectile (the ball) will travel farther.

5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles <b>propelled</b> by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E

40|$|NoCs) will be {{required}} to support the increasing number of cores in future chip multiprocessors. In this paper, we propose a scal-able low-power 64 -core NoC design called <b>PROPEL</b> that uses emerging nanophotonic technology. <b>PROPEL</b> strikes a balance be-tween cheaper electronics and more expensive optics by facilitating nanophotonic interconnects for long distance interrouter commu-nication and electrical switching for routing and flow control. In addition, <b>PROPEL</b> reduces the number of required components by facilitating communication in both the x- and y-directions. We also propose a 256 -core scaled version of <b>PROPEL</b> called E-PROPEL that uses four separate <b>PROPEL</b> networks connected together by an optical crossbar. We also propose two different op-tical crossbar implementations using single and double microring resonators, where the single microring design has minimal optical losses (− 4. 32 dB) and the double microring design has minimal area overhead (0. 0576 mm 2). We have simulated both <b>PROPEL</b> and E-PROPEL using synthetic and SPLASH- 2 traffic, where our results indicate that <b>PROPEL</b> and E-PROPEL significantly reduce power (tenfold) and increase performance (twofold) over other well-known electrical networks.
