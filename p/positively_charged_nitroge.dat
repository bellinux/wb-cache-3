40|$|Plasma {{polymerized}} allylamine {{films were}} deposited onto quartz particles at low pressure to optimize humic acid removal by varying the plasma power, flow rate, and polymerization times. Increasing the plasma power {{increased the number}} of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> groups and humic acid removal. Increasing the allylamine flow rate {{increased the number of}} <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> groups but maximum humic acid removal was observed at 6. 48 sccm due to humic acid removal by <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> and uncharged crosslinked species. Longer polymerization times increased the number of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> groups while similar humic acid removal resulted as the larger humic acid molecule cannot penetrate as readily into the film as the acid orange 7 used to determine the number of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> groups. Manipulation of the plasma parameters has shown to provide significant control over humic acid removal...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCapillary {{electrochromatography}} (CEC) {{is shown}} {{to be capable of}} separating mixtures containing both <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> and neutral styrene oxide–adenosine adducts. In a study of the mechanism of deamination of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl) adenosine using 18 O-labeled water, possible contamination of the chromatographically purified deamination product, 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl) inosine, with the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl) adenosine was observed. Because the deamination product and the presumed contamination have the same molecular weights and similar structures, CEC-microelectrospray mass spectrometry (CEC-μESI/MS) was used to confirm the presence and identity of the suspected impurity. A trace amount of the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl) adenosine, which could not be observed by either HPLC-UV or CEC-UV, was detected by CEC-μESI/MS. This discriminatory ability of CEC-μESI/MS is attributed to the fact that positive ion mode ESI-MS is a more sensitive detector for a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> compound than a UV detector, and that the combination of electroosmotic and electrophoretic flows and hydrophobic interactions with the stationary phase contributes to the separation of the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> compound. As a result, the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> compound was observed to elute much earlier and with much sharper peaks than the neutral compounds for which electroosmotic flow is the only “pumping” force for the solvent...|$|R
5000|$|Different polymer {{surfaces}} {{have different}} side chains on their monomers that can become charged {{due to the}} adsorption or dissociation of adsorbates. For example, polystyrene sulfonate has monomers containing negatively charged side chains which can adsorb <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> adsorbates. Polystyrene sulfonate will adsorb more <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> adsorbate than negatively charged. Conversely, for a polymer that contains <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> side chains, such as poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), negatively charged adsorbates will be strongly attracted.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles generated during sputtering on the performances of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with Mg:Ag alloy electrodes fabricated by sputtering. The number of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles increased by several orders of magnitude when the target current was increased from 0. 1 A to 2. 5 A. When a high target current was used, many <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles with energies higher than the bond energy of single C–C bonds, which are typically found in organic molecules, were generated. In this situation, we observed serious OLED performance degradation. On the other hand, when a low target current was used, OLED performance degradation was not observed when the number of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles colliding with the organic underlayer increased. We concluded that sputtering damage caused by <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles can be avoided by using a low target current...|$|R
50|$|For the {{blockage}} {{of sodium}} channels, electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds are needed. Important for the electrostatic interaction {{is the presence}} of a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> region in the toxin, because the receptor site of the sodium channel contains a lot of negatively charged residues. In HNTX-I, the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> residues and a vicinal hydrophobic patch have most influence on the binding to the sodium channels. HNTX-IV has a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> patch containing the amino acids Arg26, Lys27, His28, Arg29 and Lys32, of which Lys27, Arg29 and Lys32 are the most important for interaction with the TTX-S VGSCs. HNTX-V also shows an interface of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> amino acids that are responsible for the binding with the TTX-S VGSCs, where also Lys27 and Arg29 are the most important. Subtle differences in the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> patch can result in altered electrostatic properties, causing altered pharmacological effects.|$|R
30|$|Another {{critical}} factor which influences cellular uptake of NPs is surface charge. In the recent decade, nano surface modification has been employed to engineer the surface charge of NPs {{to be either}} cationic or anionic [92]. The negatively charged CM enhances the uptake of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs. In particular, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs have higher internalization than neutral and negatively charged NPs [47, 120]. However, the uptake of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs may disrupt the integrity of CM and {{lead to an increase}} in toxicity [121, 122]. In general, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs induce cell death [123, 124]. Interestingly, neutrally charged NPs will lower the cellular uptake as compared to negatively charged NPs [110, 125 – 127]. Moreover, the internalization of negatively charged NPs leads to gelation of membranes, while <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs cause fluidity in the CM [128, 129]. In addition to the uptake rate of NP, surface charges also affect the uptake mechanisms. More specifically, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs are mainly internalized by the cell via macropinocytosis whereas clathrin-/caveolae-independent endocytosis is the mechanism for the uptake of negatively charged NP [130]. Cellular uptake pathways vary when the surface of the AuNPs is coated by organic molecules. For instance, plain AuNPs which are <b>positively</b> <b>charged,</b> are internalized via macropinocytosis and clathrin and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, while negatively charged polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated AuNPs are mainly internalized via caveolin- and/or clathrin-mediated endocytosis [131].|$|R
50|$|Cucurbiturils are {{efficient}} host {{molecules in}} molecular recognition {{and have a}} particularly high affinity for <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> or cationic compounds. High association constants with <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> molecules are attributed to the carbonyl groups that line {{each end of the}} cavity and can interact with cations in a similar fashion to crown ethers. The affinity of cucurbiturils can be very high. For example, the affinity equilibrium constant of cururbit7uril with the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> 1-aminoadamantane hydrochloride is experimentally determined at 4.23*1012.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the right}} ring has a {{negative}} charge, it similarly attracts positive charge into the right-hand stream. When drops break {{off the end of}} that stream, they carry positive <b>charge</b> to the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> bucket, making that bucket even more <b>positively</b> <b>charged.</b>|$|R
50|$|An SN1 {{reaction}} {{occurs when}} a molecule separates into a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> component and a negatively charged component. This generally occurs in highly polar solvents through a process called solvolysis. The <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> component then reacts with a nucleophile forming a new compound.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of EPD processes, anodic and cathodic. In the anodic process, {{negatively}} charged material is deposited on the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> electrode, or anode. In the cathodic process, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> material is deposited on the negatively charged electrode, or cathode.|$|R
30|$|The {{surface charge}} affects NP {{interaction}} with the cells [35]. The surface of the cell membrane is negatively charged; thus, theoretically, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> nanoparticles should be absorbed much easier than negatively <b>charged</b> once. Hence, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs should show higher level of internalization. The better uptake of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs was observed for gold and silver, superparamagnetic iron oxide, hydroxylapatite, silicon dioxide, lipid, poly(lactic acid), chitosan, polymeric particles, and polystyrene NPs, {{as compared to the}} respective anionic ones [25, 36 – 44].|$|R

5000|$|<b>Positively</b> <b>charged</b> {{particles}} like {{protons and}} positrons are instead repelled from the nuclei of the plane, and after entering {{the space between}} two neighboring planes, they will be repelled from the second plane. So <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles tend to follow the direction between two neighboring crystalline planes, but at the largest possible distance from each of them. Therefore, the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles have a smaller probability of interacting with the nuclei and electrons of the planes (smaller [...] "dechannelling" [...] effect) and travel longer distances.|$|R

40|$|The {{orientation}} of many membrane proteins {{is determined by}} the asymmetric distribution of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> amino acid residues in cytoplasmic and translocated loops. The positive-inside rule states that loops with large amounts of these residues tend to have cytoplasmic locations. Orientations of constructs derived from the inner membrane protein leader peptidase from Escherichia coli were found to depend on the anionic phospholipid content of the membrane. Lowering the contents of anionic phospholipids facilitated membrane passage of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> loops. On the other hand, elevated contents of acidic phospholipids in the membrane rendered translocation more sensitive to <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> residues. The results demonstrate that anionic lipids are determinants of membrane protein topology and suggest that interactions between negatively <b>charged</b> phospholipids and <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> amino acid residues contribute to the {{orientation of}} membrane proteins...|$|R

30|$|A high {{toxicity}} of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs {{is explained by}} their ability to easily enter cells, in contrast to negatively charged and neutral NPs. This is accounted for by electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged cell membrane glycoproteins and <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs. Comparison of the cytotoxic effects of negatively and <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> polystyrene NPs on HeLa and NIH/ 3 T 3 cells {{has shown that the}} latter NPs are more toxic. This is not only because <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs more effectively penetrate through the membrane, but also because they are more strongly bound to the negatively charged DNA, causing its damage and, as a result, prolongation of the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Negatively charged NPs have no effect on the cell cycle [85]. Similar results have been obtained for <b>positively</b> and negatively <b>charged</b> gold NPs, positive NPs being absorbed by cells in larger amounts and more rapidly than negative ones and being more toxic [86].|$|R

This paper compared the removal of Raoultella terrigena ATCC 33257 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 by negatively and <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> types of activated carbon particles. Both strains display bimodal negative zeta-potential distributions in stabilized water. Carbon particles were suspended to an equivalent external geometric surface area of 700 cm(2) in 250 mL of a bacterial suspension, with shaking. Samples were taken after different durations for plate counting. Initial removal rates were less elevated for the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> carbon particle than expected, yielding the conclusion that bacterial adhesion under shaking is mass-transport limited. After 360 min, however, the log-reduction of the more negatively charged R. terrigena in suspension was largest for the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> carbon particles {{as compared with the}} negatively charged ones, although conditioning in ultrapure or tap water of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> carbon particles for 21 days eliminated the favorable effect of the positive charge due to counterion adsorption from the water. Removal of the less negatively charged E. coli was less affected by aging of the (<b>positively</b> <b>charged)</b> carbon particles, confirming the role of electrostatic interactions in bacterial removal by activated carbon particles.
