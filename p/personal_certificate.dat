L-GRID is a light portal to access the EGEE/EGI Grid infrastructure via Web, allowing users to submit their jobs from a common Web browser in a few minutes, without any knowledge about the Grid infrastructure. It provides the control over the complete lifecycle of a Grid Job, from its submission and status monitoring, to the output retrieval. The system, implemented as client-server architecture, is based on the Globus Grid middleware. The client side application is based on a java applet; the server relies on a Globus User Interface. There is no need of user registration on the server side, and the user needs only his own X. 509 <b>personal</b> <b>certificate.</b> The system is user-friendly, secure (it uses SSL protocol, mechanism for dynamic delegation and identity creation in public key infrastructures), highly customizable, open source, and easy to install.

40|$|A signcryption scheme {{allows a}} sender {{to produce a}} {{ciphertext}} for a receiver so that both confidentiality and non-repudiation can be ensured. It is built to be more efficient and secure, for example, supporting insider security, {{when compared with the}} conventional sign-then-encrypt approach. In this paper, we propose a new notion called heterogeneous signcryption in which the sender has an identity-based secret key while the receiver is holding a certificate-based public key pair. Heterogeneous signcryption is suitable for practical scenarios where an identity-based user, who does not have a <b>personal</b> <b>certificate</b> or a public key, wants to communicate securely with a server which has a certificate with its public key. We propose two constructions and show their security under the model we define in the random oracle model. The model we define captures the insider security for both confidentiality and unforgeability. Both of the schemes also support public verifiability and key privacy, that is, an adversary cannot find out who the sender and receiver are from a ciphertext in the insider security model. The second scheme is the most efficient one computationally among all key-privacy-preserving signcryption schemes even when compared with schemes in an identity-based cryptographic setting or certificate-based public key setting...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are becoming}} a standard part of workflows in structural biology. They are used for tasks as diverse as assessing molecular flexibility, probing conformational changes, assessing the impact of mutations, or gaining information about molecular interactions. However, performing a successful simulation requires sufficient computational resources, familiarity with the simulation software, and experience in the setup of a system and {{the analysis of the}} resulting trajectories. These considerations become especially critical in large-scale parametric MD simulations. Offering such tools to a wide user community requires a robust and versatile, but user-friendly, facility for molecular dynamics simulations with access to vast computational resources. Here, we present the GROMACS grid-enabled Web portal for the setup and execution of molecular dynamics simulation on the WeNMR grid infrastructure, a distributed network of computational resources within the European Grid Initiative. The Web portal aims at ease-of-use through automated setup of the simulation system using best-practice protocols, yet allowing for tuning of key parameters. Alternatively, the simulation can be started from preconfigured GROMACS simulation systems. Performing multiple lengthy calculations using multiple processors on the WeNMR grid infrastructure ensures scalability. The combination of analysis routines for quality assurance and automatic recovery in case of failures provides a reliable platform for MD simulations. The GROMACS Web portal is embedded within the services of the WeNMR Virtual Research Community (VRC) accessible from [URL] It is freely accessible upon registration with a valid X 509 <b>personal</b> <b>certificate</b> with the enmr. eu Virtual Organization (VO) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{huge amount}} of {{resources}} available in the Grids, and the necessity {{to have the most}} updated experiment software deployed in all the sites within a few hours, have spotted the need for automatic installation systems for the LHC experiments. In this paper we describe the ATLAS system for the experiment software installation in LCG/EGEE, based on the Lightweight Job Submission Framework for Installation (LJSFi). This system is able to automatically discover, check, install, test and tag the full set of resources made available in LCG/EGEE to the ATLAS Virtual Organization in a few hours, depending on the site availability. The installations or removals may be centrally triggered as well as requested by the end-users for each site. A fallback solution to the manual operations is also available, in case of problems. The installation data, status and job history are centrally kept in the installation DB and browseable via a web interface. The installation tasks are performed by one or more automatic agents. The ATLAS installation team is automatically notified in case of problems, in order to proceed with the manual operations. Each user may browse or request an installation activity in a site, directly by accessing the web pages, being identified by his <b>personal</b> <b>certificate.</b> This system has been successfully used by ATLAS since 2003 to deploy about 60 different software releases and has performed more than 75000 installation jobs so far.

40|$|The project GapSLC {{aimed to}} {{developing}} alternative methods for authentication and authorization in grids. The work {{was focused on}} three use cases coming from the participating grid communities. For users without a conventional grid certificate, a portal delegation mechanism is implemented where the grid portal generates a certificate request for short lived certificates (SLC) {{on behalf of the}} user. Shibboleth is used for authentication of the user with a federation of distributed Identity Providers. Whole process of certificate request and handling is transparent for the user. Authorization information based on SAML from the identity providers and the virtual organization are collected at the portal an embedded into the proxy certificate for the grid job. They can be used for fine granular authorization on resource provider site. For the use case of grid jobs of more general character (e. g. monitoring) robot certificates can be used. Discussions with DFN during the project phase led to a EUGrid-PMA accreditationed new policy. A concept for integration of robot certificates into D-Grid was developed. The basic idea is partitioning of resources: at one part only <b>personal</b> <b>certificates</b> are allowed whereas at the other (separated) part grid jobs with robot certificates can be accepted.

This characteristic will make accessible wherever the acquired data from a telescope (or satellite) in a quite-simultaneous way.
