Studies {{have shown that}} exposure to natural elements, such as natural light, ventilation and vegetation improves student performance and concentration. The Waldorf School understands a child 2 ̆ 7 s innate need for natural learning; making it a natural choice when studying design options that integrating nature into the educational environment. The emphasis on nature based learning in the curriculum leads Waldorf {{to be the perfect}} school to test the boundaries of what is possible in urban educational environments. The project integrates nature into an urban adaptive re-use school environment, through use of natural lighting, access to green areas, and sustainable materials. The site is a total of 30, 000 square feet, evenly separated between two floors and a roof garden. The site was built in 1923, as an automobile storage facility and straddles the boundary between an industrial neighborhood and a historic residential neighborhood. Through use of the Waldorf principles and architecture, an educational environment infused with natural rhythms and access to nature will be realized. Through the research conducted on various site, <b>program</b> and <b>process</b> <b>case</b> studies, investigation of architectural options and a thorough understanding of the needs of a Waldorf school, the project develops a prototype to be used in other urban schools. The work considers the possibilities in urban educational environments to integrate natural elements in the architecture for the benefit of students and teachers; creating a design example for both Waldorf and public educational environments...|$|R

An important goal of our introductory programming course is that the students learn a systematic approach {{for the development of}} computer programs.

Traditional assessments (e. g. oral, written, or multiple choice) are unsuitable to test the <b>programming</b> <b>process.</b> We describe and evaluate a practical lab examination that assesses the students’ <b>programming</b> <b>process</b> as well as the developed programs. The evaluation is performed in three ways: by analyzing the results of four lab examinations (with more than 1100 students), by semi-structured individual interviews with representatives of the involved persons (students, teaching assistants (TAs), lecturer, and examiner) and by an experiment to evaluate the impact of the assignment text on the <b>programming</b> <b>process.</b> The result of the evaluation is encouraging and indicates the value of alignment and strong conformity between goal, content and assessment of the introductory programming course...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} SEA in {{planning}} and <b>programming</b> <b>processes</b> Abstract. The current paper aims to outline the potential and most {{important aspects of the}} Strategic Environmental Assessment process (directive 2001 / 42 /EC). First of all, the analysis considers the importance of evaluation instruments in decision-making processes and moves on to environmental assessment, focusing on the peculiarities of Strategic Environmental Assessment. Although SEA is an innovative instrument in favouring and promoting a democratic approach to the government and development of the territory, it nonetheless presents a series of problems. The latter regard aspects such as: its integration into planning and programming activities, its role within these processes, the methodologies applied, stakeholder involvement, the quality of the assessment process and the how the suggestions are perceived and acknowledged. Key words: Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), evaluation, plans and programmes Evaluation supports planning and <b>programming</b> <b>processes</b> The evaluation of policies, planning and <b>programming</b> <b>processes</b> is fundamental not only to optimize the available resources, but also to involve the larger numbers of people in understanding and agreeing on solutions for the problems...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for {{scientific}} efficiency of faith-based development programs, resulting in the need for well-defined program goals.

The influence of organizational structure on the systematic <b>program</b> planning <b>process</b> was also explored.

Results from this study indicate that systematic program planning does occur in faith-based development organizations.
