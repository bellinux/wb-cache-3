5|$|<b>Prerogative</b> {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting {{on his or}} her own initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet—who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision—has been required in order for the <b>prerogative</b> to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal <b>prerogative</b> against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{remedies}} of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and {{habeas corpus}} were originally only {{available to the}} British Crown and thus termed <b>prerogative</b> writs, that is, writs that could be issued at the <b>prerogative</b> of the sovereign. By {{the end of the}} 16th century, they could theoretically be sought by any aggrieved citizen. In 1938, the writs were abolished in the United Kingdom and replaced by <b>prerogative</b> orders with essentially the same names and functions. As a former British colony, Singapore inherited English administrative law at independence and the Singapore courts continue to pay close attention to English cases. In Singapore, the <b>prerogative</b> orders were known by their traditional names until 2006, when the names were modernized.|$|E

2500|$|In {{history and}} in {{canonical}} literature (i.e. the Church's canons and traditional commentaries on them), the Ecumenical Patriarchate has been granted certain <b>prerogatives</b> (presbeia) which other autocephalous Orthodox churches do not have.

5|$|Today, some <b>prerogative</b> {{powers are}} {{directly}} exercised by ministers without {{the approval of}} Parliament, including the powers of declaring war and of making peace, the issue of passports, and the granting of honours. <b>Prerogative</b> powers are exercised nominally by the monarch, but {{on the advice of}} the prime minister (whom the monarch meets weekly) and of the cabinet. Some key functions of the British government are still executed by virtue of the royal <b>prerogative,</b> but generally the usage of the <b>prerogative</b> has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis.|$|E

5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for <b>prerogative</b> orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings.

5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for <b>prerogative</b> orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of <b>prerogative</b> order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for <b>prerogative</b> orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a <b>prerogative</b> order.|$|E
5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under <b>prerogative</b> powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of <b>prerogative</b> powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the <b>prerogative)</b> rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the <b>prerogative</b> was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable.|$|E

Simply put, the focus shifted from the source of the power to the subject matter.|$|E

5|$|The monarch {{also has}} power to {{exercise}} her <b>prerogative</b> over {{the granting of}} honours, the regulation {{of the armed forces}} and ecclesiastical appointments. Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, the monarch is still the person who technically awards them. Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which the monarch has complete discretion to grant. In relation to the armed forces, the monarch is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal <b>prerogative.</b> Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces, and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of <b>prerogative</b> power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory. The <b>prerogative</b> empowers the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England, and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible. The monarch also exerts a certain influence power on His or Her weekly and closed conversations with the Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom.|$|E
