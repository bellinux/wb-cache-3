50|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>obligations</b> confer duty. But as we {{see with}} the police officer, exercising a duty may violate {{negative}} obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> are almost never considered prima facie. The greatest negative obligation may have just one exception - one higher obligation of self-defense - but even the greatest <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically {{in the case of}} triage after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably prima facie. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> are not reliably prima facie they must always be agreed to through contract.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> is {{familiar}} to different legal systems that seek to protect fundamental rights. This concept means that states {{are required to take}} active measures to protect fundamental rights, for example by adopting a general legal framework to regulate same-sex relationships to ensure protection of the right to private life. In Europe, the development of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> has taken place by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) from the 1970 ’s onwards which has explained that <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> are necessary to secure that fundamental rights become practical and effective to everyone. The ECtHR is not the only supranational court in Europe that protects fundamental rights. The Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) also protects fundamental rights within the scope of EU law. So far, the concept of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> has not been developed by this Court. It has been questioned whether such a development can, if at all, take place under EU law. The EU is a rather different organisation which has other, moreover economic, interests to protect. It is also unclear whether the EU has competences to undertake any regulatory action to protect fundamental rights. This volume further analyses how <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> could be incorporated into EU law and what exact limitations apply to this development. Insights are given into the implications of the development of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> by the ECtHR, while much attention is paid to the specific EU system for protecting fundamental right and the position of the ECJ. The relevant provisions laid down in the EU Treaties and the EU Charter, and the case-law of the ECJ are studied to find that there indeed scope for recognition of the concept of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> under EU law, and the case-law of the ECJ provides examples thereof. However, there are clear limitations which apply which indeed must be take into account...|$|R

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled that}} Articles 2 and 3, before their {{alteration}} in 1999, did not impose a <b>positive</b> <b>obligation</b> upon {{the state that}} could be enforced {{in a court of}} law. The reference in Article 41 to the family's [...] "imprescriptable rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law" [...] has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as conferring upon spouses a broad right to privacy in marital affairs. In the 1974 case of McGee v. The Attorney General the court invoked this right to strike down laws banning the sale of contraceptives. The court has also issued a controversial interpretation of Article 40.3, which prohibits abortion. In the 1992 case of the Attorney General v.

40|$|In the {{supranational}} {{system of}} the European Convention of Human Rights, the state's liability is {{defined in terms of}} <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> when human rights have to be actively protected. In addition to the traditional negative obligation of non-interference, the state must also guarantee the enjoyment of human rights to all individuals within its jurisdiction. Individuals have to be actively protected against acts of interference from private parties and, where appropriate, to be assisted if they are not able to enjoy human rights due to their own circumstances of personal vulnerability. The liability of the states in terms of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> induces a freestanding imperative of human rights that changes fundamentally the perception {{of the role of the}} state and the participatory ability of the individual, who can now assert her human rights in all circumstances in which they are relevant. In that regard, <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> herald the most advanced control of the state ever attempted in international law. Opening the scope of protection of human rights across the board necessitates corresponding adjustments in the functioning of the European Court of Human Rights, which can no longer rely on ad hoc balances of overall justice to sustain such an unprecedented extension of its business. The current study focuses on the technical expertise that is needed to establish the practical legitimacy of the apparently open-ended scope of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> in view of the actual capabilities of the Convention's institution and those of the member states. <b>Positive</b> <b>obligations</b> are evaluated in relation to their potential to extend and further improve the protection of human rights in the wide range of circumstances in which the state authorities do not directly interfere. What is sought is a comprehensive methodological framework of critical stages and parameters through which the content of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> can be determined. The emphasis is put on the quality of legal reasoning that guarantees certainty and predictability in the planning of the application and development of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations.</b> For this purpose, procedural safeguards are particularly stressed to ensure an objective application of law, as well as the necessary access for the participation of the individual in the implementation and enforcement of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> at the domestic level.

40|$|Defence date: 20 November 2015 Examining Board: Professor Ruth Rubio-Marín, European University Institute, Supervisor; Professor Martin Scheinin, European University Institute; Professor Jerome Edmond Bickenbach, University of Lucerne; Professor Gerard Quinn, Centre for Disability Law and Policy, National University of Ireland, Galway. In {{light of}} the doctrinal {{innovations}} of the latest thematic treaty, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the present thesis revisits the concept of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> in human rights law. Having as a main point of reference {{the vision of the}} human being upon which human rights law is based, the thesis suggests a new approach towards conceptualising and analysing <b>positive</b> <b>obligations,</b> namely in terms of human interactions. Under this revised schema, <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> ought to be defined as calls for assistance to enable the individual to reach a minimum threshold of both material welfare and sociability. In addition, upon assuming its protective duty the State ought to ensure that in delivering its services it also forges a relationship with the recipient that reflects its caring role. The thesis grounds this revised understanding of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> {{in the evolution of the}} notion of autonomy within human rights law. It argues that human rights law has gradually shifted away from the vision of the isolated and independent individual that characterised early human rights instruments and towards a more truthful conception of the human person as a needful and sociable person, a process that the CRPD epitomises. While this change has primarily taken place through thematic treaties, the present thesis argues that the most basic characteristics of this revised notion of selfhood — dependence and relatedness — affect us all and ought to be integrated within our mainstream human rights framework. The thesis explores the analytical and practical implications of this argument by drawing from the human rights jurisprudence on <b>positive</b> <b>obligations,</b> which it will revisit on the basis of its own model...|$|R

40|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>obligations</b> {{of state}} arising from Art. 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights {{focusing}} on {{persons with disabilities}} Absolute prohibition of torture and ill-treatment is clearly set in article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. When assessing particular obligations, which are arising out of it, {{we need to look}} deep into the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence. The aim of this thesis is to analyse <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> of state arising from article 3 focusing on persons with disabilities. This is achieved also with the aid of various human right bodies such as UN Human Rights Committee, UN Committee on Torture or UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Due to the fact that this area is not really covered yet, certain parts of this thesis are focused on defining important terms and putting them together. The approach is analytic with elements of comparison between the view of European Court of Human Rights and other relevant international human rights bodies. The thesis is composed of three main chapters. Chapter One is introductory and defines the main terms such as ill-treatment, torture, scope of the article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights in connection with rights of persons with disabilities and the concept of <b>positive</b> <b>obligations</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{right to}} life is {{essentially}} {{bound up with the}} darkest – and perhaps most disturbing – sides of prison: use of force, violent deaths and suicides, and the need for swift medical aid in the event of injury after violence or malady in prison. With regard to the {{right to life}}, the state applies two categories of obligations. Firstly, the state has negative obligations that can be drawn directly from the wording of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under the negative obligations, the state must refrain from doing things that would endanger a prisoner’s life; for example, it must not employ non-proportional force. Secondly, the state has several <b>positive</b> <b>obligations,</b> not enumerated in Article 2. Under the <b>positive</b> <b>obligations,</b> it is not enough for the state to be passive and not violate the right to life; the state also has to take actions, such as establishing suicide prevention mechanisms in prisons.
