40|$|Objectives: Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was {{a marker}} for heart failure and cardiac wall tension. We {{analysed}} {{the trend of}} BNP after <b>predischarge</b> testing {{in order to get}} non-invasive details about the cardiac stress during <b>predischarge</b> testing. Methods: 4 - 5 days after ICD implant we measured BNP, myoglobin, cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase in 20 patients before and 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 minutes and at the next day after <b>predischarge</b> testing. We evaluated actual values and percentage alterations of BNP. Results: BNP significantly increased with a maximum after 5 minutes (804. 0 ± 803. 4 vs. 475. 7 ± 629. 5 pg/ml, P < 0. 0001) {{and in terms of the}} percentage values (100 vs. 199. 4 ± 61. 4 %, P < 0. 0001) compared with baseline BNP. BNP decreased after that with the last significantly increased BNP value after 20 minutes (540. 2 ± 604. 9 vs. 475. 7 ± 629. 5 pg/ml, P = 0. 017). We excluded a cardiac necrosis during <b>predischarge</b> testing because of similar values of myoglobin, cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase during the 2 -hour follow-up. Conclusions: Our data showed a great increase with a doubling of BNP after 5 minutes as a result of induced ventricular fibrillation during <b>predischarge</b> test. This increase was not generated by myocardial necrosis but rather caused by an acute cardiac failure as a consequence of induced ventricular fibrillation in <b>predischarge</b> testing...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Predischarge</b> {{defibrillation}} threshold {{testing is}} often performed {{a few days}} after ICD implantation in order to validate defibrillation thresholds obtained at the time of implant. Ventricular fibrillation is induced with such testing and causes an increase in serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels. BNP is an indicator for cardiac stress. We wanted to examine the feasibility to alter the trend of BNP after <b>predischarge</b> testing in VVI, DDD and CRT ICD´s. Methods: We measured BNP before <b>predischarge</b> testing and 5, 10, 20 and 40 minutes after <b>predischarge</b> testing in 13 groups with each 20 patients. We evaluated patients without post shock pacing and patients with a post shock pacing frequency of 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 bpm and a duration of 30 and 60 sec as well as a post shock pacing frequency of 80 and 90 bpm and a duration of 120 sec post shock pacing. Results: Patients without post shock pacing showed the highest BNP during the follow-up. The percentage values of BNP increased consistent significantly after 5 minutes compared with BNP before <b>predischarge</b> testing. The percentage values of BNP trend was significantly lower with a post shock pacing of 90 bpm and duration of 60 sec. In addition, we excluded a cardiac necrosis by <b>predischarge</b> testing because of similar values of myoglobin, cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase during the follow-up. Conclusions: Our results suggested that post shock pacing with 90 bpm and duration of 60 sec as the best optimized post shock pacing frequency and duration for VVI, DDD and CRT ICD´s.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the value of serial B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) assay for predicting post-discharge outcome of patients admitted for decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). BackgroundPatients hospitalized for decompensated CHF are frequently re-admitted. Thus, identification of high-risk patients before their discharge is a major issue that remains challenging. B-type natriuretic peptide measurement could be useful. MethodsSerial BNP measurements were performed from admission to discharge in two samples of consecutive patients. Survivors were monitored for six months; the main end point combined death or first re-admission for CHF. ResultsAmong the 105 survivors of the derivation study, all serial BNP values, percentage change in BNP levels, and <b>predischarge</b> Doppler mitral pattern correlated with the outcome. In contrast, clinical variables and left ventricular ejection fraction were poorly predictive. The <b>predischarge</b> BNP assay had the best discriminative power (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0. 80) and remained the lone significant variable in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1. 14 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 1. 02 to 1. 28], p = 0. 027). Among the 97 survivors of the validation study, the <b>predischarge</b> BNP assay was also the most predictive parameter (area under the ROC curve = 0. 83). The risk of death or re-admission increased in stepwise fashion across increasing <b>predischarge</b> BNP ranges (p 700 ng/l, compared with BNP < 350 ng/l. ConclusionsHigh <b>predischarge</b> BNP assay is a strong, independent marker of death or re-admission after decompensated CHF, more relevant than common clinical or echocardiographic parameters and more relevant than changes in BNP levels during acute cares...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe Initiation Management Predischarge: Process for Assessment of Carvedilol Therapy in Heart Failure (IMPACT-HF) {{trial was}} an investigator-initiated study to {{evaluate}} if <b>predischarge</b> carvedilol initiation in stabilized patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF) {{increased the number}} of patients treated with beta-blockade at 60 days after randomization without increasing side effects or length of hospital stay. BackgroundBeta-blockers are underused in HF. <b>Predischarge</b> initiation may improve the use of evidence-based beta-blockade. MethodsThe IMPACT-HF was a prospective, randomized open-label trial conducted in 363 patients hospitalized for HF. Patients were randomized to carvedilol initiation pre-hospital discharge or to postdischarge initiation (> 2 weeks) of beta-blockade at the physicians' discretion. The primary end point of the study was the number of patients treated with beta-blockade at 60 days after randomization. Secondary end points included the number of patients discontinuing beta-blockade, median dose achieved, and a composite of death, rehospitalization, unscheduled visit for HF, or ≥ 50 % increase in oral diuretic, new oral diuretic, or any intravenous therapy with diuretics, inotropes, or other vasoactive agents. ResultsAt 60 days 165 patients (91. 2 %) randomized to <b>predischarge</b> carvedilol initiation were treated with a beta-blocker, compared with 130 patients (73. 4 %) randomized to initiation postdischarge (p < 0. 0001). <b>Predischarge</b> initiation was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events. The median length of stay was five days in both groups. ConclusionsPredischarge initiation of carvedilol in stabilized patients hospitalized for HF improved the use of beta-blockade at 60 days without increasing side effects or length of stay. <b>Predischarge</b> initiation may be one approach to improve beta-blocker use in this population...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} {{studies have shown that the}} early {{mortality}} following TURP is higher for patients with prostate cancer than those with benign disease. This study examines the effect of the histological diagnosis on the <b>predischarge</b> complication rate following TURP. METHODS: Information on the postoperative, <b>predischarge</b> complications of 3036 patients, who underwent TURP over the last decade at our institution, was collated from the urology department database (AuditBase for Windows). The information on this database is collected prospectively, at the point of care and validated at monthly audit meetings. Statistical analyses were performed using chi 2 and difference of proportion where n > 60. Statistical significance was taken as P < 0. 05. RESULTS: The postoperative, <b>predischarge</b> major complication rate for patients with benign disease was 2. 1 %. This was not statistically different from the 2. 3 % complication rate seen in patients with malignant disease. Patients suffering a postoperative complication stayed in hospital significantly longer than those who had a straightforward postoperative course (P < 0. 001); however, patients with malignant histology suffering a postoperative complication did not stay statistically significantly longer than those with benign histology suffering a postoperative complication (P < 0. 1).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} relative values of the low level <b>predischarge</b> exercise test and the postdischarge (6 weeks) symptom-limited test in 518 consecutive patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction. Of the patients who did not develop significant ST segment depression or angina during the <b>predischarge</b> test, the symptom-limited test also remained negative in 91. 5 and 91. 9 % of the patients, respectively. Similar results were obtained with ST segment elevation and the systolic blood pressure response during the two exercise tests with only 2. 1 and 11. 4 % changing from normal to abnormal, respectively. Discriminant function analysis was done to predict the occurrence of coronary events (unstable angina, reinfarction, cardiac failure, cardiac death) with use of {{the data from the}} exercise tests together with other clinical and investigational data. The jackknife method correctly classified 71. 9 and 71. 4 % of the patients with the data from the <b>predischarge</b> exercise test and symptom-limited test, respectively. Combining the data from the two tests improved the overall predictive accuracy to only 75. 0 %. It is concluded that the routine performance of a symptom-limited test 6 to 8 weeks after infarction does not reveal any significant additional information in those patients who have undergone a <b>predischarge</b> low level exercise test. Thus the 6 to 8 week test should be restricted to selected patients after myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} 198 {{consecutive}} patients with {{acute myocardial infarction}} were prospectively studied before hospital discharge and during 24. 0 ± 8. 6 months of follow-up. A <b>predischarge</b> thrombus was found in 38 (31 %) of 124 patients with anterior infarction but in none of 74 patients with inferior infarction (p < 0. 001). Early thrombolytic therapy in 34 patients did not decrease the rate of thrombus occurrence. Acute anterior infarction, ejection fraction ≤ 35 % and apical dyskinesia or aneurysm (but not akinesia) {{were significantly related to}} the appearance of thrombus during hospitalization by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Echocardiographic follow-up of 159 patients for at least 6 months (mean 26. 6 ± 8. 4) revealed that thrombus disappeared in 14 (48 %) of 29. Disappearance of thrombus was related to <b>predischarge</b> apical akinesia (but not dyskinesia) and to warfarin therapy during the follow-up period. A new thrombus first appeared after hospital discharge in 13 of 130 patients, and in 7 of the 13 it resolved during further follow-up. Thus, 30 % (13 of 42) of thrombi in these patients appeared after discharge from the hospital. Three factors were related to occurrence of new thrombi during the follow-up period: deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction, <b>predischarge</b> ejection fraction ≤ 35 % and ventricular aneurysm or dyskinesia. Systemic embolism occurred in six patients, all with a <b>predischarge</b> thrombus (p < 0. 001). Mobility of the thrombus was the only variable significantly related to subsequent embolic events (p = 0. 001) by logistic regression analysis. Thus, the <b>predischarge</b> echocardiogram identifies patients with thrombus and those at highest risk of embolic events. It can indicate patients who are likely to have thrombus resolution and those at risk of developing a new thrombus after hospital discharge. Follow-up echocardiograms may help in guiding the length of long-term anticoagulant therapy. Four additional patients with a <b>predischarge</b> apical mobile thrombus (not part of the consecutive series) received thrombolytic therapy. In two of the four, lysis of thrombus was achieved without complications, but systemic embolism occurred in the other two, and proved fatal in one...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{responsiveness}} and predictive {{validity of the}} Self-Identified Goals Assessment (SIGA), a client-centered tool designed to elicit goals that have meaning and purpose to the rehabilitation client. An occupational therapist recruited 18 participants in a subacute rehabilitation facility, and these data were combined with results from 21 persons studied in a previous study by Hasenmeier (2008). Altogether, 9 were male and 30 female. The research design involved a three-step process through semi-structured interviews: (a) postadmission administration of the SIGA by the occupational therapist, (b) <b>predischarge</b> administration of the SIGA by the same occupational therapist, and (c) postdischarge administration of the SIGA with a follow-up interview conducted in a masked way by the student investigator.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether data related to <b>predischarge</b> {{clinical}} examinations, resting radionuclide ventriculography and symptom-limited bicycle ergometry can predict the achievement of a normal exercise capacity after a rehabilitation program in patients with a recent myocardial infarction. The study population consists of 141 consecutive patients who completed a 3 -month training program. Patients with heart failure and/or severe angina were excluded. The rehabilitation program included two training sessions weekly during the 3 months. Working capacity (WC) increased from 79 +/- 17 % at hospital discharge to 105 +/- 21 % of normal values after rehabilitation (P less than 0. 001), by 33 % on average. Ninety-five patients achieved a normal WC. Conventional <b>predischarge</b> clinical evaluation, resting left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise induced angina, or ST segment depression were not predictive of normal WC after rehabilitation. <b>Predischarge</b> WC was the single best predictor of a normal WC after rehabilitation compared to those with a persistently low WC (84 +/- 15 % in patients with normal WC vs 69 +/- 14 % in those with persistently low WC, P less than 0. 001). Nevertheless, 49 % of patients with a baseline WC of less than 80 % achieved a normal WC after rehabilitation. No correlation was found between the change of WC after rehabilitation and <b>predischarge</b> WC or ejection fraction. Therefore, the selection of patients for cardiac rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction should be based primarily on clinical grounds.

40|$|Background/aim: <b>Predischarge</b> home {{assessment}} visits are a commonly accepted, but little researched, aspect of occupational therapy practice. The {{aim of this}} research was to systematically investigate current <b>predischarge</b> occupational therapy home assessment visit practices in a rehabilitation ward of a regional Australian hospital. Methods: A retrospective chart audit was conducted over a 7 -month time period and included 227 patients discharged from the inpatient rehabilitation ward at the study hospital. Results: Fifty-five per cent of patients in the study sample received home {{assessment visits}}.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{thrombolytic}} era, {{conflicting data}} {{have been reported}} on {{the usefulness of the}} QRS score in estimating the amount of left ventricular (LV) damage after acute myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS AND RESULTS: We correlated the QRS score with the extent of LV hypoperfusion and ejection fraction (EF) in 95 consecutive male patients with a first anterior Q-wave MI; the 6 -month evolution of QRS score and changes in LV perfusion and function were also compared. The Selvester-Wagner QRS score was computed from the digitized 12 -lead electrocardiogram, both at <b>predischarge</b> and 6 months later; at the same time, resting sestamibi first-pass ventriculography and single photon emission computed tomography imaging were performed. A reduction in QRS score occurred at 6 months (6. 7 +/- 3. 4 vs 7. 8 +/- 2. 9 at predischarge; P <. 001); the perfusion defect extent also decreased (P <. 01), and LV EF improved (P <. 05). At <b>predischarge,</b> no correlation was found between QRS score and hypoperfusion extent or EF; in contrast, a weak correlation was observed 6 months later (r = 0. 55; P <. 001; and r = 0. 48; P <. 01, respectively). QRS score changes from <b>predischarge</b> to 6 months showed limited accuracy in predicting clinically meaningful changes of perfusion or EF (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, 0. 58 and 0. 61, respectively). Thrombolytic therapy did not influence the relationship between QRS score and scintigraphic findings. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recent anterior Q-wave MI, QRS scoring showed a weak, delayed correlation with the amount of LV damage, as estimated by radionuclide techniques. Spontaneous changes in QRS score from <b>predischarge</b> to 6 months seem to be of limited value in identifying patients with late improvement in LV perfusion and function...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study used}} {{myocardial}} contrast echocardiography {{to investigate the}} extent of residual perfusion within the infarct zone in {{a select group of}} patients with recently reperfused myocardial infarction and evaluated its influence on the ultimate infarct size. Background. Limited information is available on the status of myocardial perfusion within postischemic dysfunctional segments at <b>predischarge</b> and on its influence on late regional and global functional recovery. Methods. Twenty patients with acute myocardial infarction were selected for the study. Patients met the following inclusion criteria: 1) single-vessel coronary artery disease; 2) patency of infarct-related artery with persistent postischemic dysfunctional segments at predischarge; 3) stable clinical condition up to 6 months after hospital discharge. All selected patients underwent coronary angiography and myocardial contrast echocardiography before hospital discharge and repeated the echocardiographic examination 6 months later. Patients were grouped according to the pattern of contrast enhancement in <b>predischarge</b> dysfunctional segments. Results. In nine patients (group I), the length of segments showing abnormal contraction coincided with that of the contrast defect segments. In the remaining 11 patients (group II), postischemic dysfunctional segments were partly or completely reperfused. There was no {{difference between the two groups}} in asynergic segment length at <b>predischarge</b> (7. 3 ± 2. 5 vs. 7. 2 ± 4. 3 cm, p = NS).

40|$|Although novel {{technologies}} in CRT have been implemented, phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) remains an adverse effect observed in many CRT-patients. Modern CRT-devices {{in combination with}} bipolar LV-leads provide the option of electronic repositioning (ER). The software-based adaption of the pacing configuration allows for non-invasive avoidance of PNS. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how often PNS can be avoided by ER. Patients who had an indication for implantation of a first CRT-D with the option of ER were enrolled. Primary endpoint was the efficiency of ER determined by the frequency of PNS with the standard pacing configuration (LV tip to RV coil) avoidable by an alternative pacing configuration. During implantation, <b>predischarge</b> and follow-up PNS and pacing parameters were evaluated by using four different pacing configurations. In total, 34 patients were enrolled (70. 6 % male, age mean 60. 71 ± 10. 48 years old, all NYHA- III, LVEF mean 24. 97 ± 6. 5 %). At implantation, <b>predischarge</b> and follow-up PNS was inducible in the standard pacing configuration in 32. 4 % / 41. 2 % / 47. 1 %, respectively resulting in 52. 9 % of the patients presenting at least once with PNS.

40|$|Objective: To perform {{risk factor}} {{analysis}} for the prediction of hyperbilirubinemia in an African American male neonatal cohort. Study design: A database of 500 previously published term and near-term African American male neonates was further analyzed to determine the role of risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia. Factors studied included birth weight ≥ 4. 0 kg, gestational age ≤ 37 weeks, breast-feeding, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PD) deficiency, and <b>predischarge</b> bilirubin ≥ 75 th percentile. Hyperbilirubinemia was defined as any bilirubin value ≥ 95 th percentile on the hour-of-life–specific bilirubin nomogram. Results: Forty-three (8. 6 %) neonates developed hyperbilirubinemia. At 48 ± 12 hours, median transcutaneous bilirubin was 8. 3 mg/dL, 75 th percentile 10. 0 mg/dL, and 95 th percentile 12. 6 mg/dL. Of the risk factors, only exclusive breast-feeding, G- 6 -PD deficiency and <b>predischarge</b> bilirubin ≥ 75 th percentile were significant (Adjusted Odds Ratios [95 % Confidence Intervals; CI] 3. 15 [1. 39 - 7. 14], P =. 006; 4. 96 [2. 28 - 10. 80], P =. 001; and 7. 47 [3. 50 - 15. 94], P <. 0001, respectively).

Design: Randomized controlled trial and cohort study. We randomized eligible patients for whom there was clinical uncertainty {{about the need to}} conduct a home visit to a randomized controlled trial; patients for whom a visit was judged ‘essential’ were enrolled into a cohort study. Setting: Stroke rehabilitation unit of teaching hospital. Participants: One hundred and twenty-six participants hospitalized following recent stroke. Interventions: <b>Predischarge</b> home visit or structured, hospital-based interview. Main outcome measures: The primary objective was to collect information on {{the feasibility of}} a randomized controlled trial, including eligibility, control intervention and outcome assessments. The primary outcome measure was the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale at one month after discharge from hospital. Secondary outcomes included mood, quality of life and costs at one week and one month following discharge.

40|$|Background: Considering the {{increasing}} rates of early hospital discharge and kernicterus in healthy full term newborns, timely identification of neonates {{at risk of}} severe hyperbilirubinemia is of great significance. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the predictive value of umbilical cord serum (UCS) bilirubin level for subsequent hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, we compared the predictive value of UCS bilirubin with that of risk factor assessment and <b>predischarge</b> bilirubin level. Methods: In this prospective, cohort study, 450 healthy neonates born at the gestational age of ³ 35 weeks were included. UCS bilirubin concentration, direct Coombs test results, and blood group were determined in the newborns. Total serum bilirubin level was re-assessed before hospital discharge. The subjects were followed-up for 1 - 4 days after discharge and the total serum bilirubin level was measured in neonates with clinical jaundice. Results of the assessment of risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia were recorded. Results: In total, 319 newborns were followed-up within the study period. The mean UCS bilirubin level in non-icteric and icteric neonates was 2. 35 and 2. 49 mg/dl, respectively. No significant relationship was found between UCS bilirubin level and development of hyperbilirubinemia (P= 0. 30), whereas a significant correlation was detected between <b>predischarge</b> bilirubin level and development of jaundice (P= 0. 009). Gestational age, birth weight, history of jaundice in siblings, and mode of delivery were the clinical risk factors which showed a significant correlation with postnatal hyperbilirubinemia. Conclusion: Based on the findings, UCS bilirubin level could not predict subsequent hyperbilirubinemia.

40|$|Objectives. The {{effects of}} propafenone, a {{predominantly}} class IC antiarrhythmic drug, on defibrillation and pacing thresholds were evaluated in patients undergoing cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Background. Previous {{studies have shown}} that the class IC agents encainide and flecainide may increase the energy requirements for pacing and defibrillation. Animal studies with propafenone have shown inconsistent results regarding its effect on defibrillation energy requirements. This report investigated the effects of propafenone on defibrillation and pacing thresholds in humans. Methods. After cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, 47 patients were enrolled in a double-blind, three-way parallel, randomized trial of 450 mg/day (Group 1) or 675 mg/day (Group 2) of oral propafenone or placebo (Group 3) for 3 to 7 days. <b>Predischarge</b> defibrillation and pacing thresholds after treatment were compared with baseline thresholds obtained at implantation. Results. There was no statistically significant difference between implantation and <b>predischarge</b> defibrillation thresholds in the three groups (Group 1 : [mean ± SE] 11. 0 ± 1. 3 vs. 12. 1 ± 1. 5 J; Group 2 : 11. 5 ± 1. 1 vs. 13. 6 ± 1. 3 J; Group 3 : 12. 5 ± 1. 2 vs. 13. 3 ± 1. 6 J), and no significant difference between treatment groups was found with a 0. 86 power to detect a 5 -J difference between groups. Paired pulse width pacing thresholds at 2. 8 V were compared in 14 patients. A small increase of 0. 02 ms was noted at <b>predischarge</b> testing in patients treated with propafenone and placebo. Conclusions. Short-term oral propafenone (450 and 675 mg/day) does not significantly affect defibrillation or pacing thresholds. Concomitant use of propafenone in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators with recurrent ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmias should not interfere with proper device function...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{predictive}} value of mean RR interval assessed from <b>predischarge</b> Holter recordings with that of heart rate variability and left ventricular ejection fraction for risk stratification after myocardial infarction. Background. Heart rate variability is a powerful tool for risk stratification after myocardial infarction. Although heart rate variability is related to heart rate, little is known of the prognostic value of 24 -h mean heart rate. Methods. A total of 579 patients surviving the acute phase of myocardial infarction were followed up for at least 2 years. <b>Predischarge</b> heart rate variability, 24 -h mean RR interval and left ventricular ejection fraction were analyzed. Results. During the first 2 years of follow-up, there were 54 deaths, 42 of which were cardiac (26 sudden). Shorter mean RR interval was a better predictor of all-cause mortality as well as cardiac and sudden death than depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Depressed heart rate variability predicted the risk of death better than mean RR interval for sensitivities < 40 %. For sensitivities ≥ 40 %, mean RR interval was as powerful as heart rate variability. All three variables performed equally well in predicting nonsudden cardiac death. For cardiac death prediction, a left ventricular ejection fraction < 35 % had a 40 % sensitivity, 78 % specificity and 14 % positive predictive accuracy; a mean RR interval < 700 ms had a 45 % sensitivity, 85 % specificity and 20 % positive predictive accuracy; and a heart rate variability < 17 U had a 40 % sensitivity, 86 % specificity and 20 % positive predictive accuracy. Conclusions. <b>Predischarge</b> 24 -h mean heart rate is a strong predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction that can compete with left ventricular ejection fraction and heart rate variability...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} a <b>predischarge</b> {{exercise}} test combined with thallium- 201 myocardial scintigraphy in detecting patients with severe multivessel disease (MVD) was studied in 58 consecutive patients discharged after a first acute myocardial infarction. Twelve electrocardiographic, clinical and scintigraphic variables were analysed. Angiography at one month revealed MVD (greater than 70 % narrowing in vessels unrelated to infarction) in 26 patients (45 %). ST segment depression of 1 mm or greater, thallium defects in multiple vascular distributions (MVTL), and reversible thallium defects in a vascular distribution different from the infarct related vessel predicted patients at risk for MVD (predictive value respectively of 68 %, 65 % and 75 %). The other variables were not significantly associated {{with the presence of}} MVD. Only ST segment depression and thallium defects in multiple vascular distributions emerged as independent predictors of MVD. Their combination yielded a 77 % sensitivity and a 59 % specificity for MVD. Combination of thallium imaging with the <b>predischarge</b> exercise ECG significantly improved the stratification provided by the exercise test alone (P less than 0. 05). A positive thallium scan (MVTl defects) associated with a positive ECG (ST depression) carried a risk for MVD of 80 % in the population studied. When both tests were negative, MVD was infrequent (risk 22 %). Because improvement in the stratification of patients is not as clear as expected from studies performed at a later stage, it appears that exercise thallium scintigraphy at a submaximal level one or two weeks after infarction does not provide optimal information. <b>Predischarge</b> exercise thallium- 201 scintigraphy, however, is superior to an exercise tolerance test alone in separating patients into those with high and low risk of MVD.

It was performed {{in a group of}} 312 patients randomized double blindly to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (n = 156) or placebo treatment and followed thereafter for at least one year. Two weeks after the infarction, enzymatic infarct size, infarct-related vessel, and number of diseased coronary arteries were significant determinants of the infarct-related regional wall motion (centerline method) (R 2 = 0. 25 to 0. 60, P = 0. 0001).

The findings suggest that home assessments were carried out because of mobility or environmental concerns. Satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the outcome of the home assessment were related to the incidents that occurred during the assessment.

The purpose of this study was to: (1) compare ambulatory activity parameters in subacute stroke survivors over three time periods; and (2) discuss options for measurement of ambulatory activity data with respect to absolute activity, intensity of activity, and variability and pattern of activity. Methods—Ten subacute stroke survivors participated (meanSD; age: 6615 years; time from stroke to discharge: 7531 days). Data collection was completed across three time periods, <b>predischarge,</b> 2 weeks postdischarge, and 6 weeks postdischarge. The Step Activity Monitor (Cyma Corporation) was used to measure daily activity parameters. Parameters representing dose, intensity, and variability/pattern of activity were determined using MatLab.

40|$|To {{determine}} if the occurrence {{and the consequences of}} spontaneous <b>predischarge</b> postinfarction ischemia could be predicted early after hospital admission, a consecutive series of patients with acute myocardial infarction was studied and followed for 3 years. No patient was treated by thrombolysis. Spontaneous <b>predischarge</b> ischemia was defined as angina that occurred at rest before hospital discharge, at least 3 days after the acute event, and that was accompanied by electrocardiographic changes, but not by an increase in cardiac enzymes. Patients who died within the first 3 days were excluded from analysis. Among the 943 patients who survived at least 3 days, 165 (17. 5 %) had spontaneous ischemia before discharge. They had a higher 1 -year post-hospital mortality (16 vs. 10 %), but did not have significantly higher total 3 -year mortality rates. Four independent, early available variables predictive of the occurrence of spontaneous ischemia were selected from a stepwise logistic discriminant analysis: history of angina before infarction, non-Q-wave infarct, absence of smoking, and higher age. Among the 165 patients with spontaneous ischemia, 3 independent variables predictive of 3 -year mortality were selected stepwise: left ventricular function score, history of previous infarction, and absence of smoking.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relative}} prognostic merits of 15 clinical and 10 <b>predischarge</b> exercise test variables, 226 {{patients who had}} sustained an acute myocardial infarction were studied. A submaximal treadmill test was performed on 205 patients to a mean work load of 5. 7 ± 2. 9 METS. Testing was performed an average of 11. 7 (range 6 to 33) days after myocardial infarction. During {{the first year of}} observation, major cardiac events were noted in 33 patients (16 %), unstable angina in 7 (3. 4 %), recurrent myocardial infarction in 14 (6. 8 %) and death in 12 patients (5. 9 %). Cardiac mortality correlated with mean peak serum creatine kinase (CK) (p < 0. 05), history of previous myocardial infarction (p < 0. 01) and ST segment depression at rest (p < 0. 01). The only exercise variable that correlated with cardiac mortality was poor exercise endurance (p < 0. 05). Multivariate risk stratification of clinical and treadmill variables from these 205 patients using linear discriminant analysis produced a function that correctly classified 95 % of those who were event-free and 80 % of those who died. The first four discriminant variables that contributed independent information for the prediction of cardiac mortality were: 1) ST segment depression at rest; 2) CK greater than 1, 280 IU/liter; 3) exercise duration less than 3 minutes; and 4) a history of previous myocardial infarction. ST segment depression on the <b>predischarge</b> treadmill test did not predict any event, nor did it improve the predictive accuracy of the clinical variables. It is concluded that a history of previous myocardial infarction and ST segment depression on the rest electrocardiogram indicate a poor prognosis after acute myocardial infarction. Poor endurance is the only exercise variable that suggests a future cardiac event. Prognosis after acute myocardial infarction is more accurately predicted by these clinical data than by variables derived from the <b>predischarge</b> treadmill test...|$|E
