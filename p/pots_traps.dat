The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include <b>pots,</b> <b>traps,</b> trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E

50|$|Ash is an {{important}} constituent of wood pasture, a European management system in which open woodland provided shelter and forage for grazing animals. Ash was coppiced and pollarded, often in hedgerows, and evidence {{in the form of}} some huge boles with multiple trunks emerging at head height can still be seen in parts of Britain. The Glen Lyon ash is a notable example of a pollarded ash which at about 400-500 years of age achieved a girth of 6 m. In Northumberland, crab and lobster <b>pots</b> (<b>traps)</b> sometimes known as 'creeves' by local people are still made from ash sticks. Because of its elasticity European Ash wood was commonly used for walking sticks. Poles were cut from a coppice and the ends heated in steam. The wood could then be bent in a curved vise to form the handle of the walking stick. The light colour and attractive grain of ash wood make it popular in modern furniture such as chairs, dining tables, doors and other architectural features and wood flooring.|$|E

The release of setose female lobsters (those with ovigerous setae) and of nonsetose female lobsters larger than a maximum legal size was required, the minimum legal carapace length (CL) was raised by 1 mm during the migratory phase between November and January, and the number of <b>pots</b> (<b>traps)</b> fished was reduced by 18 %. Between 1993 and 1999, increases were observed in the indices of egg production obtained from research surveys and in the estimated released catches of setose female lobsters and of nonsetose female lobsters larger than the maximum size. From these and other fishery data, an age-structured model was developed to determine the status of the fishery and the effectiveness of each management control. By 1999, egg production of the stock had increased to 134 % of the target level and 22 % of the virgin level.

40|$|In the {{carnivorous}} plant genus Genlisea a unique lobster <b>pot</b> <b>trapping</b> mechanism supplements nutrition in nutrient-poor habitats. A {{wide spectrum of}} microbes frequently occurs in Genlisea’s leaf-derived traps without clear relevance for Genlisea carnivory. We sequenced the metatranscriptomes of subterrestrial traps versus the aerial chlorophyll-containing leaves of G. nigrocaulis and of G. hispidula. Ribosomal RNA assignment revealed soil-borne microbial diversity in Genlisea traps, with 92 genera of 19 phyla present {{in more than one}} sample. Microbes from 16 of these phyla including proteobacteria, green algae, amoebozoa, fungi, ciliates and metazoans, contributed additionally short-lived mRNA to the metatranscriptome. Furthermore, transcripts of 438 members of hydrolases (e. g. proteases, phosphatases, lipases), mainly resembling those of metazoans, ciliates and green algae, were found. Compared to aerial leaves, Genlisea traps displayed a transcriptional up-regulation of endogenous NADH oxidases generating reactive oxygen species as well as of acid phosphatases for prey digestion. A leaf-versus-trap transcriptome comparison reflects that carnivory provides inorganic P- and different forms of N-compounds (ammonium, nitrate, amino acid, oligopeptides) and implies the need to protect trap cells against oxidative stress. The analysis elucidates a complex food web inside the Genlisea traps, and suggests ecological relationships between this plant genus and its entrapped microbiome...|$|R

Except for five samples taken from under cultivated plants, all the others came from under Ammophila arenaria and Oenothera drummondii colonizing sand dunes adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea. After a continuous cultivation of the mixtures in <b>pot</b> <b>trap</b> cultures with Plantago lanceolata as the plant host up to 2006 and their examination {{at least twice a}} year, spores of AMF were found in 41 and 103 cultures with the 1997 and 2000 soil and root mixtures, respectively. The spores represented 30 species and 8 undescribed morphotypes in 7 genera of the Glomeromycota. The AMF most frequently found in Israeli soils were Glomus aurantium and G. constrictum, followed by G. coronatum, G. gibbosum, an undescribed Glomus 178, and Scutellospora dipurpurescens. Up to 2001, 21 species of AMF were known to occur in Israel, and this paper increases this number to 33, of which 11 are new fungi for this country.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) of the, phylum Glomeromycota associated with plants of maritime sand dunes of the Vistula Bar localed in north-eastern Poland was investigated. The presence of AMF was revealed based on spores isolated from field-collected root-rhizosphere soil mixtures and two-cycle <b>pot</b> <b>trap</b> cultures established with parts of these mixtures. The mixtures came from under five species in four plant families. Spores of AMF occurred in 54. 8 % {{of the field}} samples and belonged to eight species. Additionally, culturing of root-soil mixtures in trap cultures revealed nine species and three undescribed morphotypes carlier {{not found in the}} field samples. Considering the number of records of species and morphotypes in the field samples and trap cultures, the fungal species most frequently occurring in dunes of the Vistula Bar is Scutellospora dipurpurescens, followed by Archaeospora trappei, Glomus laccatum, and Scu. armeniaca. The overall average spore abundance in the field samples is low (4. 48, range O- 3 l in 100 g dry soil). The ovcrall average species richness determined based on spores from both the field and trap cultures was 2 l and ranged from 0 lo 7 in 100 g dry soil. The plant harbouring the highest number of species of AMF was Festuca rubra. Of the maritime dune sites of Poland examined to date, the species composition of AMF of the Vistula Bar is most {{similar to that of the}} Słowiński National Park.
