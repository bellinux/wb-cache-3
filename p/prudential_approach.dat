40|$|This paper re-assesses {{the place}} of {{theology}} in Leibniz’s thought focusing {{on the relationship between}} theory and praxis. It takes as its point of departure a general conclusion established in previous work, namely that Leibniz’s key formulations of his overarching plan for the reform and advancement of all the sciences, are devoted to a set of objectives which is both shaped by broadly theological concerns and ultimately practical. Against this backdrop, the discussion will then turn to an exploration of how Leibniz thought of theology as such. I argue that Leibniz was committed to the elaboration of a robust Christian dogmatic which was rationally defensible, and that this commitment resulted in a genuine engagement with Christian theology which took very seriously its theoretical content. The key additional thesis argued for in this paper is that this theoretical engagement was in the service of a science which he conceived as ultimately practical. For Leibniz, the ultimate aim of theology was to lead to the love of God above all things and, in so doing, to salvation and eternal happiness. It is in the light of this practical end that his theological pragmatism should be evaluated. When this is done, it becomes apparent that, beneath Leibniz’s efforts at theological reconciliation in the context of his Kirchenpolitik, there lies a deeper, fundamental and properly theological emphasis on praxis, grounded in Leibniz’s epistemology and driven by his conception of salvation as ultimately dependent on a practical attitude – the love of God above all things. Leibniz’s theological pragmatism was remarkably [...] perhaps even surprisingly [...] close to the family of <b>prudential</b> <b>approaches</b> to religious belief proposed by Pascal and later authors such as William James. The paper concludes that Leibniz’s conception of theology as ultimately practical is very much in line with the whole thrust of Leibniz’s intellectual programme as expressed in the over-arching plans discussed in the first section. These plans too were driven by a practical end: the promotion of the common good and of human happiness as the celebration of the glory of God in his creation. At the same time, the end of happiness – whether worldly or eternal [...] should not be regarded as competing with Leibniz’s theoretical endeavours – whether in the sciences or in theology [...] but as directly supported by them...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} some {{significant}} implications of the new European single banking supervision for the economics of banking and the market of financial services. It {{is one of the}} three pillars of the European Banking Union architecture, as part of a longer term vision for further economic and monetary integration in EU. The new supervisory mechanisms implies a huge and complex transfer of powers from national authorities to the European Central Bank. It aims to ensure the safety and soundness of the European banking system, increase financial integration and stability, and ensure consistent supervision. Banks are being held to common supervisory standards. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 1 introduces the paper and outlines the general context of the study. Section 2 analyzes some organizational and regulatory issues of the single supervisory scheme. Section 3 examines the comprehensive assessment of the main banks performed by the European Central Bank together with the national supervisors. Section 4 discusses the implications of the single supervisory mechanism for banks’ business models and management, and explores some of the challenges likely to be faced by the supervised banks.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{critical}} {{assessment of the}} financial reforms adopted or proposed at the European level. The reshaping of the EU institutional architecture and {{the adoption of the}} new Basel 3 rules should reduce the national margins of discretion that have up to now characterised supervisory practices, often leading to light touch supervision, and restrain the growth of bankarisation, hence excessive systemic leveraging. However, the limitations of a purely <b>prudential</b> <b>approach</b> to regulation may not be overcome by setting up new institutions and make prudential requirements more stringent. In addition, given unavoidable national banking specificities, more severe rulebooks homogenously applied across the EU countries could further worsen the inconsistencies of a one-size-fits-all rule. The criticisms directed at the new regulatory framework assume particular relevance in the EU, whose peculiar construction requires that the financial sector should not be permitted to jeopardise its critical fiscal equilibrium. This opens the way to the adoption of structural measures, as the one presented by the Vickers Commission on ring-fencing. Looking at the financial system as a whole, we argue that even these measures do not offer effective protection for the economy and tax-payers, and that much more radical interventions are needed. financial reforms, European Union, Basel 3, Vickers Commission, ring-fencing...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid 20 th century {{progress}} in biomedical science has been {{punctuated by the}} emergence of bioethics which has fashioned the moral framework of its application to both research and clinical practice. Can we, however, consider the advent of bioethics as a form of progress marking the advances made in biomedical science with an adequate ethical stamp? The argument put forward in this chapter is based on the observation that, far from being a mark of progess, the development of bioethics runs the risk of favouring, like modern science, a dissolution of the links that unite ethics and medicine, and so of depriving the latter of the humanist dimensions that underlie the responsibilities that fall to it. Faced with this possible pitfall, this contribution proposes to envisage as a figure of moral progress, consubstantial with the development of biomedical science, an ethical approach conceived as a means of social intervention which takes the first steps towards an ethics of responsibility integrating the bioethical perspective within a hermeneutic and deliberative approach. By the yardstick of a <b>prudential</b> <b>approach,</b> it would pay particular attention to the diverse sources of normativity in medical acts. It is suggested that this ethical approach is a source of {{progress in}}sofar as it constitutes an indispensable attitude of watchfulness, which biomedical science can lean on as it advances, with a view to ensuring that the fundamental link uniting ethics and medicine is maintained...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Norman Daniels ' and Daniel Callahan's {{recent work}} {{attempts}} {{to develop and}} deepen theories of justice {{in order to accommodate}} intergenera-tional moral issues. Elsewhere, I have argued that Callahan's arguments furnish inadequate support for the age rationing policy he accepts. This essay therefore examines Daniels ' account of age rationing, together with the complex theory of age-group justice that buttresses it. Sections one and two trace the main features of Daniels ' prudential lifespan approach. Section three calls into question the theory's conformity to liberal tenets. The next section attempts to show that the outcome of the <b>prudential</b> <b>approach</b> fails to match our considered judgments. The brief final section offers a broader perspective on the task of articulating a liberal theory of age-group justice. Key Words: elderly, age-group justice, biomedical model of disease, rationing, liberalism, distributive justice Since 1950, the ranks of Americans sixty-five years of age and over have more than doubled [...] .

Until quite recently, theories of justice have by and large neglected this sphere or relegated it to a peripheral place.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a quantitative analysis to verify {{the extent to which}} the sources of systemic risk identified in the academic and regulatory literature actually contribute to it. This analysis shows that all institutions contribute to systemic risk albeit to a different degree depending on various risk factors such as size, interconnection, un-substitutability, balance sheet and risk quality. From the analysis we conclude that using a single variable or a limited series of variables as a proxy for systemic risk generates considerable errors when identifying and measuring the systemic risk of each institution. When designing systemic risk mitigation measures, all contributing factors should be taken into account. Likewise, classifying institutions as systemic/non-systemic would mean giving similar treatment to institutions that may bear very different degrees of systemic risk, while treating differently institutions that may have very similar charge of systemic risk inside. Therefore, we advocate that some continuous approach to systemic risk -in which all institutions are deemed systemic but to varying degrees- would be preferable. We acknowledge that this analysis may prove somehow limited in the way that it is not founded on a predefined conceptual approach, does not fully consider other very relevant qualitative factors 1 and accounts only for some of the relevant sources of systemic risk in the banking system 2. These limits are currently set due to data availability and state of the art in empirical research, but we believe that these should not hinder our work identifying the true sources of systemic risk and our aim to help avoiding any partial and thus limited <b>prudential</b> policy <b>approach.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|When {{addressing}} European matters we {{must remember}} that European construction is still a work in progress, with its peculiar architecture subject to a long-term evolutionary process. As normally happens with unfinished projects, the constituent, national, parts do not properly fit in the general design. This consistency gap persists, and may even widen as the system design itself evolves over time. Beyond the potential deficiencies of the projected architecture, its unfinished character may prove a serious threat when individual imbalances spill over into general fragilities. In other words, European construction is characterised by a largely unproven design, by its evolution over time, and by the ‘traverse’ problem coming from the adjustment of heterogeneous national conditions to the ‘acquis communautaire’. Structural socio-political and economic changes induced by the integration process take time, with different adjustment rates in different member countries; enforcement may become feeble and moral hazard a recurring danger for the decision process. The evolution of the architecture is far from being the result of unanimous national approaches, with the necessary compromises leaving room to the persistence of ample degrees of national discretion and specificities. In the past serious problems were often addressed through architectural reforms, sometimes leading, {{as in the case of}} Economic and Monetary Union, to the deepening of certain features of the unification process. The recent crisis could have led to a breakdown in European construction, especially in its later phase characterised by potential sovereign debt defaults. On the contrary, however, the response to the Lehman debacle was to reaffirm the acceleration in the convergence process sanctioned by the Lisbon Treaty. The lesson drawn from the crisis has been to re-draft the European institutional architecture, not just for the financial sphere. Common goals have been re-focused and the institutional set up redesigned, not secondarily aiming at more limited national discretion and increased enforcement of common rules. The reforms of the financial sector must then be analysed as part of the reshaping of the entire design. The EU design derives its strong peculiarities from the cohabitation of Member State sovereignty with the goal of a single market. Enhancement of harmonisation and convergence necessarily requires a complex political process, with Member States willing to pass on some parts of their sovereignty to collegial decisions, increasingly taken without veto powers. The wisdom of the EU decision process lies in seeking unanimity or large convergences wherever possible. Compromise solutions are, then, a necessary trait of the EU construction. In normal times it is easier for each Member State to be satisfied with the balance of its own benefits, although distribution within the Union may not be uniform. Analogously to the Minsky process, it is in normal times that the fragility of the construction may increase. Not driven by apparent threats, the enforcement mechanisms may significantly lag behind in the desirable advance towards harmonisation, thus leaving room for the accumulation of various sorts of imbalances. When a shock hits the Union or part of it, those fragilities may radically change the perceived national balances of costs and benefits and their distribution within the EU. Heightened national interest may produce serious damage to the whole EU edifice. The recent crisis represented such a shock, laying the cumulated fragilities bare. The entire EU construction rests, then, on keeping economic, monetary and financial imbalances within socially and politically acceptable limits and preparing smooth resolution procedures when they occur. The three institutional legs - the broad fiscal one under the umbrella of the European Semester, the ECB and the financial regulatory and supervisory authorities - represent the result of of compromises among national 'egoisms'. As the recent crisis has shown, the efficacy of enforcement, from which their credibility derives, rests on serious shocks not seriously disturbing this fragile equilibrium. It has also made clear how the increased interconnections between member countries have entailed further individual weaknesses throughout the whole area. Light touch supervision in some countries has directly or indirectly generated cross-border negative externalities, while economic negative and positive imbalances have contributed to weakening the edifice. The present paper has repeatedly argued in favour of attempts to increase convergence primarily homogenising procedures and strengthening enforcement. The EU financial regulatory and supervisory construction requires particularly strong measures to prevent the financial sector from generating such heavy negative externalities as to disrupt the delicate equilibriums on which the European monetary and fiscal constructions rest. Although the reforms in the institutional architecture are going in the right direction, doubts can be raised as to whether, following the international approach to financial re-regulation, the European financial systems will gain the extra resilience required by the peculiar European construction. The international agenda on financial reforms does not, in fact, imply radical changes to the previous architecture. It explicitly follows the same <b>prudential</b> <b>approach,</b> seeking to reinforce its mechanisms. The point is that the increases in capital requirements are widely judged insufficient and continue to be based on discredited methodologies; the financial institutions will continue to be too big to fail and to be resolved; since the non-banking sector will continue to be regulated with a light-touch approach, leaving connectedness and contagion untouched, the focus on banks will give way to new forms of regulatory arbitrage; the ample discretion attributed to supervisors, with the problem of their capture left unsolved, adds to their regulatory status and to regulatory uncertainty. Given the dependence of the European financial systems on banking, these reforms will certainly increase their regulatory costs, probably more than in other contexts characterised by a less systemic role of the banking sector. The European banking industry is already pressing for a softer approach, pointing out the disproportionate impact of stricter requirements on Europe's already sluggish growth. It is certainly impracticable for Europe to extra-toughen requirements for banks, as it is highly improbable that it will implement nonbank international standards with stricter rules. The financial sector will continue to pose serious threats in all countries. For Europe it might jeopardise its entire construction. For a full understanding of the European responses to the crisis, help to outline both the more salient characteristics of the European financial system (section 1) and the more recent stages in the process of regulatory harmonisation (section 2), delving into the management and resolution of crossborder crises, which is a particularly crucial problem for the European Union (EU) (section 3). A brief description of the crisis in Europe from the first phase of financial turmoil to the sovereign crises (section 4) brings light to bear on the policy and regulatory responses (sections 5, 6 and 7). An analysis of the process leading to the new overall design places those responses into the broader perspective of the consistency of the entire architecture (section 8). Some conclusions are finally offered on the relevance of the financial reforms for the viability of the entire European construction and on the dangers deriving from an approach to re-regulation that seems incapable of significantly reducing systemic fragilities...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary egalitarianism {{has largely}} {{developed}} in abstraction from the basic fact that time passes, people age, and so any given society comprises several overlapping generations. As a result, few normative tools {{are available to}} assess claims made about the fairness of time-sensitive distributions. The field of intergenerational justice has emerged to fill this gap, but its theorists have primarily focused {{on the question of}} what we owe to future generations. My thesis contributes to egalitarian thought and intergenerational justice by providing an egalitarian account of justice between co-existing generations. It answers the question of which inequalities between age groups, on the one hand, and birth cohorts, on the other hand, matter; and it offers a framework to establish what counts as a suitably egalitarian treatment of young people. The thesis is in two parts: the first establishes the theoretical framework, and the second makes explicit its implications for two policy discussions. In Part I, I highlight the generational implications of the dominant diachronic view of equality through time – complete lives egalitarianism (CLE). While it provides key insights into birth-cohort justice, CLE cannot account for why some cases of age-group inequalities are unjust. I then propose two complements to CLE to overcome its limitations: a <b>prudential</b> diachronic <b>approach</b> grounded on Daniels’s theory of age-group justice, and a synchronic alternative inspired by McKerlie’s work. From the first three chapters, I derive three principles of equality between overlapping generations: (1) approximate cohort equality, (2) prudential lifespan planning (lifespan sufficiency and efficiency), and (3) relational synchronic equality. I then draw on these principles to establish what ‘treating the young as equals’ means. In Part II, I put forward an intergenerational egalitarian case for basic income. I then consider whether we should be concerned about the absence of young people in parliaments, and propose the introduction of youth quotas...|$|R

The paper explores the factors that contributed to the Supreme Court reversal. The author first conducted an analysis of the text of the Court's two rulings.

According to Paul Wahlbeck, these factors are: (1) judicial preferences, (2) legal constraints, (3) litigation environment, and (4) political environment. According to a Filipino legal luminary, the December reversal resulted from a change in the Court's choice of approach to constitutional interpretation—that is, from a textual and historical <b>approach</b> to a <b>prudential</b> and structural <b>approach.</b> The adoption of a different approach to constitutional interpretation however partly explains the court reversal.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} one {{chapter of the}} volume “Regulation and Economics” of the second edition of the Encyclopedia of Law and Economics. The authors review the {{economics}} of banking and financial markets and the regulatory response to market failure. Market failure in finance depends on problems of information and externalities. Regulation addresses these problems through {{conduct of business rules}} and <b>prudential</b> requirements. This <b>approach</b> has recently proved insufficient to prevent financial crises. Governments and central banks had to step in with massive safety nets in order to prevent financial meltdown. Although the appropriate regulatory response to the global financial crisis is still to be discovered, this chapter tries to draw a few lessons for financial regulation and supervision. First, prudential regulation and supervision should monitor, and possibly limit, competition between banks and non-banks in order to identify timely new sources of systemic risk. Second, financial stability policies need to strike a difficult balance between ex-ante strictness and ex-post leniency {{in order to deal with}} non-quantifiable risks. Moral hazard is not the only determinants of systemic instability; knightian uncertainty also determines instability by suddenly curtailing market and funding liquidity. Third, all financial institutions falling within the regulatory perimeter should have good corporate governance. However, what is good governance for non-financial firms is not necessarily efficient for financial firms due to the quality and quantity of externalities involved. Finally, because systemic externalities are cross-jurisdictional in modern financial markets, at least coordination among monetary and supervisory authorities of different countries is warranted...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{accelerating}} accumulation {{and risk}} concentration of Chinese local financing platforms debts have attracted wide attention throughout the world. Due {{to the network}} of financial exposures among institutions, the failure of several platforms or regions of systemic importance will probably trigger systemic risk and destabilize the financial system. However, the complex network of credit relationships in Chinese local financing platforms {{at the state level}} remains unknown. To fill this gap, we presented the first complex networks and hierarchical cluster analysis of the credit market of Chinese local financing platforms using the “bottom up” method from firm-level data. Based on balance-sheet channel, we analyzed the topology and taxonomy by applying the analysis paradigm of subdominant ultra-metric space to an empirical data in 2013. It is remarked that we chose to extract the network of co-financed financing platforms in order to evaluate the effect of risk contagion from platforms to bank system. We used the new credit similarity measure by combining the factor of connectivity and size, to extract minimal spanning trees (MSTs) and hierarchical trees (HTs). We found that: (1) the degree distributions of credit correlation backbone structure of Chinese local financing platforms are fat tailed, and the structure is unstable with respect to targeted failures; (2) the backbone is highly hierarchical, and largely explained by the geographic region; (3) the credit correlation backbone structure based on connectivity and size is significantly heterogeneous; (4) key platforms and regions of systemic importance, and contagion path of systemic risk are obtained, which are contributed to preventing systemic risk and regional risk of Chinese local financing platforms and preserving financial stability under the framework of macro <b>prudential</b> supervision. Our <b>approach</b> of credit similarity measure provides a means of recognizing “systemically important” institutions and regions for a targeted policy with risk minimization which gives a flexible and comprehensive consideration to both aspects of “too big to fail” and “too central to fail”...|$|R
