40|$|SummaryThe main {{objective}} of this research work is optimisation of <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> number using Detuning principle. <b>Connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> are used for constraining transmission system on vehicle frame. The model of transmission system designed for FEA and RSM analysis consists of 5 – 37 <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> for tightly mounting on vehicle frame. At zero displacement condition when all 37 <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> were constraint, natural frequency reaches in a higher order range of 1650. 5 – 3565. 1 Hz. This higher order range of frequency makes the model a conservative design when critical frequency for medium duty vehicle varies from 0 to 100 Hz. Using detuning principle and RSM optimisation technique an optimised number of <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> can be identified. Response surface methodology (RSM) {{has been used for}} parametric optimisation and finite element analysis (FEA) was used for calculation of modal frequency and mode shapes. FEA analysis was done using ANSYS 14. 5 and solid edge, and Pro-E has been used for geometric modelling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} {{the mechanism of}} damping and its theoretical evaluation for layered copper cantilever structures jointed {{with a number of}} equispaced <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> under an equal tightening torque. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a number of specimens for comparison with numerical re-sults from the theory. Intensity of interface pressure, its distribution characteristics, dynamic slip ratio and kinematic coefficient of friction at the interfaces, relative spacing of the <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts,</b> and frequency and amplitude of excitation are all found to {{have an effect on the}} damping capacity of such structures. It is established that the damping capacity of copper structures jointed with <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> can be improved considerably by increasing the number of layers while maintaining uniform intensity of pressure distribution at the interfaces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTruck {{transmission}} gearbox casing is {{subjected to}} vibration induced by the harmonic excitation, meshing excitation, load fluctuations, gear defects, varying speed and torque conditions. Noise and vibrations are {{the reasons for the}} transmission failure. The transmission gearbox casing vibrations are the resultant of internal excitation caused by the gear meshing process and transmission error. This internal excitation produces a dynamic mesh force, which is transmitted to the casing through the shafts and bearings. The objective of this research work is to simulate the relation between dynamic vibrations of transmission and fixed constraint of vehicle frame. Transmission casing is tightly fixed on vehicle frame using <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts.</b> 37 <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> were used to fix the casing on vehicle frame. If <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> were loosened, it causes heavy vibration and deformation. For transmissions type multi degree freedom system the natural frequency and vibration mode are important modal parameters. First 10 inherent natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes were evaluated. Grey cast iron HT 200 was used as casing material. FEA based numerical simulation method was used to find the dynamic response of the casing. The numerical simulation method used reciprocity principle to apply the mesh forces transmitted to the casing and to determine the main responsible forces for the vibration of the casing. The FEA simulation results show that the natural frequency of one bolt unconstraint condition varies from (1637. 2 – 2674) Hz. The analysis results were verified with experimental result available in literature...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of this research work is to study the effect of mechanical properties of materials on natural frequency and mode shapes of heavy vehicle gearbox transmission casing. Material mechanical properties {{play an important role}} for evaluation of frequency, deformation, stress and strain. Four materials have different density and the origin of material is also different. Grey cast iron has damping property, structural steel has high density and rigidity, Al and Mg alloys have low density. Free vibration study was performed for the vibration response study of casing. Grey cast iron grade FG 260, Structural Steel, Al alloy and Mg Alloy materials were analyzed on the design and vibration index. The free vibration study of casing was performed using finite element simulation. The vibration response for all materials shows the variation of natural frequency (1002 - 3879) Hz and various vibrations mode shapes. The vibration responses for first twenty modes were studied. Solid Edge and Pro-E was used for CAD designing of transmission gearbox casing. FEA based ANSYS 14. 5 is used for modal analysis. Fixed- fixed constraint based boundary condition was used by constraining the <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> hole.

40|$|AbstractMost large wind {{turbines}} currently installed use self-supporting steel tubular towers. The present study aims to per-form a structural {{analysis of a}} 100 kW wind turbine tower, taking into consideration several structural integrity requirements. Among many requirements of {{the design of a}} tower, the analysis of free vibration has been performed. Details of static and elas-tic stability analysis are also presented. The integrity analysis was performed using the commercial software ANSYS. The height of the tower was defined as 24 m. The tower has been designed as an assembly of four 6 m height modules <b>connected</b> by <b>bolted</b> joints. A special consideration of the module connections will be presented. Flanges are adopted to strengthen the tower modules end, having also the purpose of attaching the modules extremities by pre stressed bolts. Contact elements were adopted for the joint model. A distinct tool provided by ANSYS is the possibility of applying a preload to the <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts.</b> Under the condi-tion of a load produced by the turbine blades thrust, the connected flanges tend to separate at the outer edge.

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} {{stability}} problem of {{continuous welded rail}} (short for CWR) on bridge in the small radius curve section, a sleeper connector structure was proposed, {{which is used to}} connect sleepers together and strengthen the stability of CWR. A FEM model was established to study the effect of the CWR stability strengthening scheme. This study result shows that the integrity of the track structure and the stability of CWR in the small radius curve section of which the radius is from 250 m to 600 m will be both improved by the strengthening scheme, and the larger the curve radius is, the better the CWR stability improvement will be. In order to guarantee the strength of sleeper connector and <b>connecting</b> <b>bolt,</b> it is suggested that the sleeper connectors at beam gaps should not be connected, and small resistance fasteners should be used in strengthening area...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a failure analysis of <b>connecting</b> <b>bolts</b> used for holding streetlights inside the tunnels {{of a mountain}} highway. The fracture occurred in correspondence to crevices formed in bolted joints. Fractographic and metallurgical studies indicate that the bolt failure {{is due to a}} deep crevice corrosion process that is further aggravated by the presence of chlorides coming from the spray formed inside tunnels during the winter when sodium chloride is spread for de-icing roads. Metallographic studies highlighted also that corrosion affects only bolts, while all the other joints’ components are intact. EDS analyses revealed that the bolt material was a Cu-bearing stainless steel that, in chloride media, has a bad corrosion resistance because Cu destabilises the alloy passive film. Therefore, it is recommended that the bolt material should be changed to prevent similar failures and that in such environment crevices should be avoided in design...|$|R
