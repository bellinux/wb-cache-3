5|$|A {{photograph}} of the building that was to house the theater appeared in The Morning Oregonian newspaper in 1913. Known as the Kleist Building after its owner, Edward Kleist, it had a <b>pressed</b> <b>brick</b> front and walls with hollow tiles. The second floor was intended for residential rooms and apartments, and the ground floor was designed for business storerooms and a movie theater.

5|$|Spring Street, {{a typical}} {{commercial}} 19th century corridor, {{is the primary}} roadway within the district. Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian. The structure vary between two and three stories tall, with brick as the most common building material. The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition. It contains the Old Strauss Hotel {{at the corner of}} Riverside Drive, a three-story Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows. The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings, the most notable being the old Elk's Club structure (a three-story highly decorated glazed brick building) and the Bensinger's Building (a 1920s commercial building of <b>pressed</b> <b>brick</b> and crenelated parapet). There is more diverse architecture on the 300-block, with a 19th-century Masonic Temple, the LaRose Theatre (a 1920s orange glazed brick structure with terra cotta trim), Horner's Novelty (which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville's history), and Schimpff's Confectionery, a candy store that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum. More Italianate structures are on the 400 block, but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building, which is stone Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment. The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council. Warder Park is located {{on the east side of}} the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century.|$|E

This was later demolished in 1884, to become the site of the Clothworkers buildings of the Baines Memorial Wing and the Great Hall. The buildings were designed by the renowned Victorian architect Alfred Waterhouse R.A in red <b>pressed</b> <b>brick</b> and had dressings of Bolton Wood stone in a Gothic Collegiate style. The cost of the build was £22,000 and was raised partially by public appeal and served as the university library until the opening of the Brotherton Library.
