50|$|Wilson Benesch {{developed}} {{its first}} drive technology in house through the Bishop Project, {{resulting in the}} Tactic Multirole <b>Drive</b> <b>Unit.</b> The Tactic <b>Drive</b> <b>Unit</b> allowed Wilson Benesch {{to use the same}} <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> for its midrange and bass <b>drive</b> <b>units.</b> In addition the Wilson Benesch introduced an unusual adaptation of the Isobaric loudspeaker configuration in the Bishop loudspeaker in 1999. The design featured two Tactic <b>Drive</b> <b>Units</b> in a clamshell or push-pull formation, the external <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> has its rear magnet outside the cabinet. Wilson Benesch called this formation the Isobaric Drive System.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{analysis}} of a novel robotic <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> intended as the driving kernel for multi-degree of freedom (dof) parallel manipulators. The transmission system of this unit features a planetary gear train and a ball-screw mechanism. Due to this special transmission design, two driving motors can {{be placed on the}} fixed base, thereby enhancing the load-carrying capacity of the robotic <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> Parallel robots constructed and actuated with the proposed units should exhibit higher load-carrying capacity and faster motion capability, as compared to existing drives. The conceptual design of the unit is first proposed, and a design alternative is then discussed. The application of this novel <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is illustrated by the example of integrating three such <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> into a six-dof parallel manipulator with three Universal-Prismatic-Spherical (UPS) legs. With six actuators installed on the fixed base, such a manipulator can be endowed with high stiffness, high speed, high accuracy and high load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, a testbed is designed in order to verify the kinematic and dynamic performance of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> The kinematic analysis of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> the testbed and the six-dof parallel manipulator is conducted. The CAD modelling and animation results are included to validate the design and the kinematics of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 1997, Wilson Benesch {{was awarded}} a second DTi Grant under the SMART Award scheme. Wilson Benesch were awarded £250,000 for an {{application}} that outlined a proposal {{to develop a new}} dynamic <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> based around materials technology previously not used in <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> design. The project was code named 'The Bishop Project' by Wilson Benesch. The outcome was the company's Tactic Multirole <b>Drive</b> <b>Unit.</b> The <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> features a Neodymium Rare Earth Magnet and an Isotactic Polypropylene cone that was developed through collaborative research with the University of Leeds and Professor Ian Ward. The first product which used this drive technology was the Bishop loudspeaker in 1999. The drive technology was also subsequently used in the company's Odyssey Range and the Square Series.|$|R
40|$|During the {{placement}} of components in micro-assembly, high impact forces occur. The current approach is to reduce these impact forces by coupling the gripper to the <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> of {{the placement}} device with 5 DOF, wherein the gripper that contacts the component has a relatively low mass. To prevent the gripper from bouncing back {{at the end of}} the placement collision a force must be exerted between gripper and <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> which can significantly increase the impact forces. A solution has been found to realise an adequate force build-up between gripper and <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> such that a rebounce of the gripper is prevented without significantly increasing the impact forces. This solution can be implemented relatively easily by placing a spring between gripper and <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> combined with a force limiter...|$|R

50|$|An {{intermediate}} development {{between the}} Bendix drive {{developed in the}} 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear {{as soon as the}} engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of flyweights {{in the body of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> When the starter motor begins turning and the <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the engaged position. Only once the <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|R

50|$|The complex {{loading of}} the bass <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> demands {{specific}} Thiele-Small driver parameters to realise the full {{benefits of a}} TL design. Most <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> in the marketplace are developed for the more common reflex and infinite baffle designs and are usually not suitable for TL loading. High efficiency bass drivers with extended low frequency ability, are usually designed to be extremely light and flexible, having very compliant suspensions. Whilst performing well in a reflex design, these characteristics do not match {{the demands of a}} TL design. The <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is effectively coupled to a long column of air which has mass. This lowers the resonant frequency of the <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> negating the need for a highly compliant device. Furthermore, the column of air provides greater force on the driver itself than a driver opening onto a large volume of air (in simple terms it provides more resistance to the driver's attempt to move it), so to control the movement of air requires an extremely rigid cone, to avoid deformation and consequent distortion.|$|R
