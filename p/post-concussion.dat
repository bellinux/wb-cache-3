5|$|Kolb {{retired in}} 2014 due to <b>Post-concussion</b> syndrome, citing {{lingering}} effects from 3 career concussions.|$|E
5|$|As a {{free agent}} in the off-season, Ballard was still {{suffering}} from <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome and opted to end his professional career to pursue studies in sport science at the University of Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis can be complex because {{concussion}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions. For example, <b>post-concussion</b> {{symptoms such as}} cognitive problems may be misattributed to brain injury when, in fact, due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E
5|$|In the 19thcentury it {{was noted}} that TBI is related to the {{development}} of psychosis. At that time a debate arose around whether <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome was due to a disturbance of the brain tissue or psychological factors. The debate continues today.|$|E
5|$|On January 2, 2011, Favre {{was unable}} to play against the Detroit Lions in {{the final game of}} the regular NFL season due to his {{inability}} to pass NFL-mandated <b>post-concussion</b> tests. In a press conference immediately following the game, Favre announced his intention to retire from professional football. On January 17, 2011, Favre officially filed his retirement papers with the NFL.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive deficits {{that can}} follow TBI include {{impaired}} attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive {{functions such as}} abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People who have suffered TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. <b>Post-concussion</b> syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed {{may be at risk}} for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).|$|E
25|$|Lindros' {{younger brother}} Brett {{played for the}} New York Islanders and retired early on May 1, 1996, due to <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Some {{experts believe}} <b>post-concussion</b> {{symptoms}} {{are caused by}} structural damage to the brain or disruption of neurotransmitter systems, resulting from the impact that caused the concussion. Others believe that <b>post-concussion</b> symptoms are related to common psychological factors. Most common symptoms like headache, dizziness, and sleep problems {{are similar to those}} often experienced by individuals diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. In many cases, both physiological effects of brain trauma and emotional reactions to these events {{play a role in the}} development of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders {{have set}} out {{criteria}} for <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome (PCS) and post-concussional disorder (PCD), respectively.|$|E
25|$|Injuries {{took their}} toll on {{position}} players as well. Jim Edmonds missed half the month with <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome and David Eckstein went {{on the disabled list}} with a strained oblique muscle. The Cardinals signed Preston Wilson, who had been released by Houston, to fill the hole caused by Edmonds' injury.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Penguins {{qualifying}} for the 2016 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Fleury {{was unable to}} play due to <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome until May 20 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Final against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Fleury subbed in for Murray at the start the third period. Fleury then started game 5, which the Penguins lost 4–3 in overtime. Fleury was then benched in favour of Murray. The Penguins {{would go on to}} win the Stanley Cup with Murray in goal, defeating the San Jose Sharks in six games.|$|E
25|$|Montador's {{death at}} age 35 {{was a shock}} to players {{throughout}} the NHL; many of his former teammates spoke positively of his influence and attitude. Daniel Carcillo reflected on his friendship with Montador in an interview for The Players' Tribune and cited Montador as a positive influence who helped him overcome his substance abuse problems. Carcillo noted that he witnessed Montador's mental state slowly deteriorate before his death and called upon the NHL community to establish a formal exit-procedure for players suffering from <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. Chris Montador had also noted a change in Steve's behaviour prior to his death.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals' strange, up/down season {{would get}} even {{stranger}} {{in the final}} month, as the team staggered to the finish while trying to avoid a shocking collapse. As August passed into September, Eckstein {{was still on the}} DL and Edmonds was still absent from the lineup with <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. On September 3, Pujols had his second three-homer game of the season and third of his career, as the Cardinals beat Pittsburgh 6-3. However, two days later the Cardinals were nearly no-hit; Ramón Ortiz of the Washington Nationals took a no-hitter into the ninth before Aaron Miles' single spoiled it. Ortiz settled for a 4-1 victory.|$|E
25|$|Though no universally {{accepted}} definition of postconcussive syndrome exists, {{most of the}} literature defines the syndrome as the development of at least 3 of the following symptoms: headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, impaired memory and concentration, insomnia, and lowered tolerance for noise and light. One complication in diagnosis is that symptoms of PCS also occur in {{people who have no}} history of head injury, but who have other medical and psychological complaints. In one study 64% of people with TBI, 11% of those with brain injuries, and 7% of those with other injuries met the DSM-IV criteria for <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. Many of these PCS sufferers were misdiagnosed as having other unrelated conditions due to commonality of symptoms. (see diagnosis, below).|$|E
25|$|On November 22, 2009, {{during a}} 21–13 {{victory over the}} St. Louis Rams, Warner left the game after {{suffering}} a concussion. Warner continued to suffer from <b>post-concussion</b> symptoms and on November 29, 2009, he was deactivated against the Tennessee Titans, breaking his consecutive starts streak at 41 straight games. On December 6, 2009, Warner returned to action as the Cardinals defeated the Minnesota Vikings 30–17. Warner registered his fourth consecutive game with a passer rating of 120 or better, making him only the second quarterback in NFL history to accomplish the feat. After his three-touchdown performance, Warner was named both the NFC Offensive Player of the Week and the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Week.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} {{straight}} year, the D.C. team bowed out in the quarterfinals of CONCACAF play. An away goal in the 4th minute locked up the series for Querétaro, but United did manage to reclaim some dignity with an impressive late strike for a goal by rookie Julian Büscher. Unable to practice with the team because of lingering <b>post-concussion</b> symptoms, Davy Arnaud retired from playing and joined the coaching staff. Because he had a guaranteed contract, Arnaud's retirement was not expected to free up any salary cap space, but it did open a roster spot. United made a trade to acquire the rights to U.S. youth international goalkeeper, Charlie Horton, who had left his English team, Leeds United, to play closer to home.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{controversial}} ending to the match between Bret Hart and Goldberg at Starrcade, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship was vacated {{the following night}} on WCW Monday Nitro. Hart and Goldberg faced each other later on the show, where Hart regained the title {{with the help of}} Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. Hart, Hall, Nash and Jeff Jarrett formed a new incarnation of the New World Order (nWo) group, named nWo 2000. The mule kick Goldberg performed to Hart during their match at Starrcade gave Hart a severe concussion. Unaware of the severity of the injury, Hart continued to compete in matches in the days following. Hart was diagnosed with <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome, and relinquished the title on January 16. nWo 2000 disbanded soon after, and was the last incarnation of the nWo in the promotion. Later that year, Hart retired from professional wrestling.|$|E
25|$|On February 22, 2011, in a {{game against}} the Carolina Hurricanes, Staal was checked by his brother, Eric. Marc was looking down, {{fighting}} for the puck with another Hurricanes player, when Eric came and threw a hard shoulder check, and Marc was slow to get up. It was a legal check, and Marc played {{for the rest of the}} season, setting career highs with 22 assists and 29 points. However, it was revealed before the Rangers' 2011 training camp began that Staal was suffering from <b>post-concussion</b> symptoms. He did not play until January 2, 2012, in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic against the Philadelphia Flyers. He only played 46 games in 2011–12, struggling to get his timing back from the injury as he posted a career worst −7 and only five points (two goals and three assists). He got better as the season went on, however, and helped the Rangers reach the Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E
25|$|After the elimination, team {{management}} vacated all the Sharks' captaincy positions, including Thornton's role {{as one of}} the alternate captains. Prior to the 2010–11 season, he was chosen to replace the retiring Rob Blake as the eighth captain in team history on October 7, 2010. Nine days later, he signed a three-year, US$21 million contract extension with the Sharks. Near the start of the 2010–11 season, Thornton scored the fourth hat-trick of his NHL career against Martin Brodeur in a 5–2 win over the New Jersey Devils. In November 2010, Thornton was suspended two games for a controversial hit to the head against St. Louis Blues forward David Perron. Perron missed the remaining 72 games of the 2010–11 season due to <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. He returned after missing 97 games over 13 months (394 days) on December 3, 2011. Later in the campaign, Thornton eclipsed Marleau as the Sharks' all-time leader in assists. Thornton scored his 1,000th career point with a goal in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on April 8, 2011. In {{the first round of the}} 2011 playoffs, Thornton scored the series-winning goal in overtime of game 6 against the Los Angeles Kings to advance the Sharks to the second round.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his penchant}} for making big moves, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren pulled off perhaps the most {{stunning}} move of his tenure, trading Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 second-round draft pick; and Jeff Carter to Columbus for their 2011 first-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Sean Couturier), 2011 third-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Nick Cousins) and Jakub Voracek, all within the span of one hour on June 23. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the Phoenix Coyotes' Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a five-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a two-year contract. Additionally, Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the 2011–12 season, he was lost {{for the remainder of}} the regular season and playoffs with severe <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to sub-par, including being benched in favor of Sergei Bobrovsky for the Flyers' 3–2 loss to the New York Rangers in the 2012 Winter Classic, but also being named NHL First Star for the month of March. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Couturier, Schenn and Matt Read standing out impressively.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his NHL career, Kariya {{struggled}} with concussions, which eventually forced {{his retirement in}} June 2011 after sitting out the [...] season because of <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. Psychiatrist Daniel Amen provided diagnosis and therapy for Kariya, advising him to retire as a professional, which he did.|$|E
500|$|The Brewers brought Braun {{to spring}} {{training}} in 2007. [...] Their regular third baseman Corey Koskie was suffering from <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome, and missed the entire year. [...] In 11 spring training games, Braun tied for 10th in the majors in home runs (5), and second in RBIs (15).|$|E
500|$|In <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome, {{symptoms}} do {{not resolve}} for weeks, months, or {{years after a}} concussion, and may occasionally be permanent. About 10% to 20% of people have post concussion syndrome {{for more than a}} month. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, memory and attention problems, sleep problems, and irritability. [...] There is no scientifically established treatment, and rest, a recommended recovery technique, has limited effectiveness. Symptoms usually go away on their own within months. The question of whether the syndrome is due to structural damage or other factors such as psychological ones, or a combination of these, has long been the subject of debate.|$|E
500|$|If the Glasgow Coma Scale is {{less than}} 15 at two hours, or less than 14 at any time, a CT is recommended. In addition, a CT scan {{is more likely to}} be {{performed}} if observation after discharge is not assured or intoxication is present, there is suspected increased risk for bleeding, age greater than 60, or less than 16. Most concussions, without complication, cannot be detected with MRI or CT scans. However, changes have been reported on MRI and SPECT imaging in those with concussion and normal CT scans, and <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome may be associated with abnormalities visible on SPECT and PET scans. [...] Mild head injury may or may not produce abnormal EEG readings.|$|E
500|$|Early {{on in the}} 2009–10 season, Mitchell {{delivered}} an open-ice {{hit that}} concussed Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews in the two teams' first game against each other since the 2009 playoffs. Mitchell had just exited the penalty box when he caught Toews with his head down receiving a pass in the neutral zone; the hit was deemed legal as Mitchell checked Toews with his shoulder. Toews was sidelined for six games as a result. [...] Later on in the season, Mitchell suffered a concussion himself, receiving a hit from opposing forward Evgeni Malkin, causing his head to hit the end boards, during {{a game against the}} Pittsburgh Penguins on January 16. [...] He was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season with <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome, finishing with 12 points and a +13 rating in 48 games.|$|E
500|$|During a {{training}} camp game on September 25, 2016, MacArthur suffered another concussion when newly-acquired Patrick Sieloff hit MacArthur into the boards. Bobby Ryan immediately began {{a fight with}} Sieloff, which was quickly broken up. Sieloff {{was sent to the}} Senators' AHL affiliate the Binghamton Senators shortly afterwards. On January 20, 2017, the Senators announced that MacArthur will not play any of the remaining games of the season on the recommendation of various doctors, despite MacArthur's insistence, {{that he did not have}} any symptoms of <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. On April 4, 2017, MacArthur returned to the [...] Senators' lineup after an 18-month absence and would play in all of the Senators' four remaining regular season games. On April 23, 2017, MacArthur scored the series-winning goal (on the powerplay for a 3-2 win 6:30 into overtime of Game 6) against the Boston Bruins in their first round playoff matchup.|$|E
500|$|With his {{contract}} expiring in the off-season, Teemu Selänne, who had since {{returned to the}} Ducks, was reportedly in talks with team management to sign Kariya. On August 27, 2010, however, {{on the advice of}} doctors who refused to clear him to play, Kariya announced that he would sit out the 2010–11 season with <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat, the same doctors advised Kariya that it was too risky to try to play again, and Kariya officially announced his retirement from hockey on June 29, 2011, through the NHLPA. He continued to be outspoken regarding the prevalence of concussions among hockey players; {{in an interview with the}} Globe and Mail, he commented, [...] "The thing I worry about is that you'll get a guy who is playing with a concussion, and he gets hit, and he dies at centre ice." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{pre-season}} play in September 2000, Kariya {{received a}} one-game suspension after slashing Minnesota Wild player Aaron Gavey, {{though he was}} able to serve the suspension during exhibition play. Several months into the 2000–01 season, Kariya suffered a broken right foot after blocking a shot from Tampa Bay Lightning defenceman Pavel Kubina during a game in December 2000. Missing 15 games, he returned to the lineup in late-January 2001. The Ducks struggled as a team while both Kariya and Selänne's paled in comparison to previous years. In March 2001, Selänne was traded to the San Jose Sharks, marking the end of his duo with Kariya. Despite he and Kariya's success playing with each other, the Ducks had advanced to {{the second round of the}} playoffs just once in their tenure together. While disappointed with the trade, Kariya later commented that with the tandem constituting nearly half of the Ducks' $39 million payroll, [...] "If [...] were running the business, [...] would have done something too." [...] Kariya finished the season with 67 points (33 goals and 34 assists) over 66 games. In addition to losing Selänne via trade, Kariya played the majority of the season without centre Steve Rucchin, who was suffering from <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome.|$|E
500|$|Suffering from <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome, Kariya {{experienced}} {{headaches and}} a loss of short-term memory. During his recovery, he was personally encouraged by fellow NHL players Eric Lindros and Pat LaFontaine, who were also dealing with serious concussions. He was not permitted by doctors to begin training until May 1998. Leading up to the 1998–99 season, Kariya told reporters he was ready to play a rougher style to protect himself from the opposition, including [...] "getting [...] stick up" [...] against oncoming players. He also adopted a helmet with increased protection, featuring extra padding and a tighter chin strap. In a similar effort, the Ducks additionally acquired enforcers Stu Grimson and Jim McKenzie during the off-season. During his recovery, Kariya was outspoken regarding the culture of the league regarding excessive physicality, as well as the lack of deterrence. In an article from the Sporting News, he commented that, [...] "There's too much of a lack of respect players have for one another ... If the league wants to stop that kind of conduct, it will have to punish players ... Ten-game suspensions ... and more, have to be brought back to help wake up players." [...] He also added that [...] "There probably isn't a player in the league who hasn't had a concussion." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2003–04 NHL season {{would be}} the last for Stevens. [...] Before ending the season, he surpassed former {{teammate}} Larry Murphy as the NHL's all-time leader in games played by a defenceman, when he appeared in his 1,616th game in November. He missed several games in January with the flu, and while he was out, he was diagnosed with <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome (which would eventually coerce him into retirement). [...] Despite missing {{the second half of the}} season, he was still voted in as a starter for the Eastern Conference All-Star team. Scott Niedermayer filled in as captain in Stevens' absence, but the loss of Stevens, as well as Daneyko, who had retired before the season, was too much of a loss for the Devils' defence, and they fell to the Flyers in the first round of the playoffs. In the offseason, Stevens recovered and continued to work out, and expected to return to the Devils for the 2004–05 NHL season. However, the lockout canceled the entire season, and Stevens retired on September 6, 2005, after 1635 NHL games, fourth at the time (and now seventh) all-time in games played, the leader in games played by a defenceman (since passed by Chris Chelios), and 14th all-time in career penalty minutes.|$|E
500|$|MTBI has a {{mortality}} rate of almost zero. The symptoms of most concussions resolve within weeks, but problems may persist. These are seldom permanent, and outcome is usually excellent. The overall prognosis for recovery {{may be influenced}} by a variety of factors that include age at the time of injury, intellectual abilities, family environment, social support system, occupational status, coping strategies, and financial circumstances. People over age55 may take longer to heal from MTBI or may heal incompletely. Similarly, factors such as a previous head injury or a coexisting medical condition have been found to predict longer-lasting <b>post-concussion</b> symptoms. [...] Other factors that may lengthen recovery time after MTBI include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression, poor health before the injury or additional injuries sustained during it, and life stress. Longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual symptoms. [...] For unknown reasons, having had one concussion significantly increases a person's risk of having another. Having previously sustained a sports concussion {{has been found to be}} a strong factor increasing the likelihood of a concussion in the future. Other strong factors include participation in a contact sport and body mass size. The prognosis may differ between concussed adults and children; little research has been done on concussion in the pediatric population, but concern exists that severe concussions could interfere with brain development in children.|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{started his}} career with the Capitals, where he helped the team make the playoffs for the first time. [...] After {{spending}} a season with the Blues, he was acquired by the Devils through arbitration. [...] Personifying the team's defence-first mentality, he captained the Devils to four Stanley Cup Finals appearances in nine years, winning three of them. [...] In 2000, he won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Despite his team success with the Devils, he never won the Norris Trophy as the league's best defenceman. [...] His career came to an end after a slapshot hit his head and caused <b>post-concussion</b> syndrome. He was later inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007, his first year of eligibility. Stevens retired with the most games played by an NHL defenceman (1,635 games), later passed by Chris Chelios. [...] Stevens was also the youngest player in league history to reach 1,500 games played, playing in his 1,500th game at age 37 years, 346 days. [...] He did not have a negative plus/minus in any of his 22 NHL seasons, and had the most penalty minutes of any player enshrined in the Hall of Fame until Chris Chelios was inducted in 2013. On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Stevens was part of the second group of players to be named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.|$|E
500|$|The Hippocratic Corpus, {{collection}} of medical works from ancient Greece, mentions concussion, later translated to commotio cerebri, and discusses loss of speech, hearing and sight {{that can result}} from [...] "commotion of the brain". This idea of disruption of mental function by [...] "shaking of the brain" [...] remained the widely accepted understanding of concussion until the 19thcentury. The Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi {{was the first to}} write about concussion as distinct from other types of head injury in the 10thcentury AD. He may have been the first to use the term [...] "cerebral concussion", and his definition of the condition, a transient loss of function with no physical damage, {{set the stage for the}} medical understanding of the condition for centuries. In the 13thcentury, the physician Lanfranc of Milan's Chiurgia Magna described concussion as brain [...] "commotion", also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury (though many of his contemporaries did not), and discussing the transience of <b>post-concussion</b> symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from the injury. In the 14thcentury, the surgeon Guy de Chauliac pointed out the relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as skull fractures and penetrating head trauma. In the 16thcentury, the term [...] "concussion" [...] came into use, and symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and memory problems were described. [...] The 16thcentury physician Ambroise Paré used the term commotio cerebri, as well as [...] "shaking of the brain", [...] "commotion", and [...] "concussion".|$|E
