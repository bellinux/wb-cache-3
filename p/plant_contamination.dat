We quantified the respective contributions of the Of, OAh, Ah, and Bw horizons in an acid brown soil to the total Cs- 137 soil-to-plant transfer through a rhizospheric approach. The macroscopic rhizosphere was realized by creating a close contact between Cs- 137 -contaminated soil horizons earlier mixed with agar and a dense root mat previously developed by young, K-stressed ryegrass seedlings (Lolium multiflorum Lam., rv Lemtal) {{during a period of}} 7 d. The intimate mot-soil contact was maintained for 4 d. The uptake of radiocesium by plant roots was readily effective as the Cs- 137 rhizospheric mobilization (RM) amounted to 0. 07 to 23. 42 % of the initial Cs- 137 soil contamination, Assuming negligible horizon to horizon transfer and equivalent root exploration in each horizon, the respective contributions of the horizons to the Cs- 137 soil-to-plant transfer were 96. 7 % in Of, 0. 13 % in OAh, 1. 34 % in Ah, and 1. 84 % in Bw.

They occurred worldwide and were found predominantly in corn and in corn-based animal feeds and also {{can be found in}} other crops. Contamination of food and feed with fumonisins has been implicated in and associated with a number of diseases in both livestock as well as human beings. Approach: A review was done on the effect of fumonisins on animal and human and detoxification method for the prevention. ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, Google and Yahoo were used in the preparation of this review. Results: This review clarified that the major forms of fumonisins found in food were the B series, fumonisin B 1, B 2 and B 3. Fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) was the most common and the most thoroughly studied. FB 1 caused toxicities in animals including Equine Leukoencephalomalacia (ELEM), Porcine Pulmonary Edema (PPE) in pigs and nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic in rats.

40|$|The {{degree of}} mixing {{of organic matter}} with {{minerals}} in organic and hemi-organic horizons of forest soils largely differs between humus types. As clay minerals might control the mobility of radiocesium in these forest floor horizons, <b>plant</b> <b>contamination</b> could greatly vary {{with the kind of}} humus. We measured the mobility of radiocesium in the upper O, OAh and Ah horizons of three acid forest soils with three distinct humus types: eumoder, dysmoder and fibrimor. We used two different approaches: a physico-chemical test quantifying the radiocesium interception potential (RIP) and a biological assay simulating an experimental rhizosphere. The results show that the (137) Cs horizon-to-plant transfer is directly governed by RIP, and thus by frayed edge sites born by weathered micaceous minerals. The inverse relationship between RIP and organic matter content indicates that in the three sites investigated the mixing of organic residues with Cs-fixing minerals is a key process in 137 Cs mobility. These Cs-fixing clay minerals indeed decrease in the sequence eumoder > dysmoder > fibrimor because they are more diluted in forest floor with less bioturbation. Our results suggest that humus type might be an important parameter in classifying forest soils with respect to their ability to transfer radiocesium to the above standing vegetation...|$|E
