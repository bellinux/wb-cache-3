40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a large, lightweight antenna panel for an active phased array operating at L-band. The panel was developed under a JPL program of technology development for space based radar. It utilizes dual-stacked patch elements that are interconnected with corporate feed manifold of striplines. This paper focuses on the electromagnetic design and performance of the radiating elements, with emphasis on scan performance, and also addresses mechanical and thermal aspects of the panel. The element in the array environment has a bandwidth of more than 80 MHz centered at 1260 MHz and is fed {{so that it can}} radiate orthogonal linear polarizations. The envisioned phased array, with a nominal aperture of 50 m x 2 m, is designed to scan +/- 45 degrees in azimuth and +/- 20 degrees in elevation. The <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> has a mass density of 3. 9 kg/m 2, which represents approximately 50 % of the target 8 kg/m 2 total panel mass density that includes T/R modules and feed manifolds...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a backhaul network for Ka-band. In this band, antenna arrays must employ {{large number of}} elements with appropriate beamforming techniques to combat the severe path loss. The goal {{of this paper is}} to analyze massive antenna arrays under realistic considerations for the use in terrestrial backhaul links. This analysis addresses practical issues from the implementation point of view such as 3 D array geometry, the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> needed to fulfill link budget requirements in backhaul links, distribution <b>of</b> <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> in a 3 D array geometry and influence of realistic antenna patterns on beamforming capabilities of such arrays.

40|$|A {{printed circuit}} <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> {{comprises}} a geometrically symmetric planar {{area of a}} conducting material separated from a ground plane by a dielectric medium. The driving point <b>of</b> the <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> is {{at the base of}} a notch in one side thereof so that the driving impedance is reduced from that obtained when the element is driven at its edge. Symmetrically disposed on opposite sides of an axis of symmetry of the element along which the driving point lies are two notches which restore the electrical symmetry <b>of</b> the <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> thereby to suppress higher order modes. The suppression of these higher order modes results in a radiation pattern with minimal cross-polarized energy in the principal planes and high port-to-port isolation which could not be achieved with an asymmetrical element. Two driving points may be employed with the <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> to produce a dual linearly polarized antenna and a reactive combiner or hybrid may be employed to obtain circularly-polarized radiations.

30|$|As {{the demand}} for higher {{throughput}} satellites increases, multibeam architectures with smaller beam spots are becoming common place. If the same frequency is strongly reused, the resulting interference when serving simultaneously many users requires some sort of pre or post-cancelation process. This article focuses on precoding and multiuser detection schemes for multibeam satellites, comparing hybrid on-board on-ground beamforming techniques with fully ground-based beamforming. Both techniques rely on the exchange <b>of</b> <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> signals between the satellite and the corresponding gateway but, in the latter case, the interference mitigation process acts on all the <b>radiating</b> signals instead <b>of</b> the user beams directly, with the corresponding extra degrees of freedom for those cases for which the number <b>of</b> <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> {{is higher than the}} number of user beams. The analysis carried out in this study has shown that the potential advantage of ground-based beamforming may exceed 20 % of the total throughput.|$|R
