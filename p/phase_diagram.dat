The reasons for the complicated <b>phase</b> <b>diagram</b> are not entirely understood. The α form has a low-symmetry monoclinic structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility, and poor thermal conductivity.|$|E

Two types of <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams</b> are constructed: one based on the lattice stabilities extracted from empirical data, and the other using the lattice stabilities computed from first principles. It is shown that the <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams</b> obtained using the empirical values contain clear contradictions with the experimental <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams</b> at the well known limits of low or high temperatures.

Three-dimensional (3 D) ternary <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams</b> outweigh traditional two-dimensional ones for better visualization and are good tools {{to help students}} understand ternary <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams.</b> As part of the five year project to produce a web-based tutorial for ternary <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams</b> funded by FeMET, five 3 D hypothetical ternary <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams</b> modules, including ternary isomorphous, ternary unlimited solid solubility eutectic, ternary limited solid solubility eutectic, ternary peritectic, and one isothermal and two limited solid solubility eutectic, have been constructed by utilizing the software of AutoCAD™ and SolidWorks™.

With the newly developed method different 3 D phase regions can be extruded and cut both horizontally (isothermal sections) and vertically (isoplethal sections), which will help individuals find the phase relationships inside the complex ternary <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams.</b> All modules of 3 D ternary <b>phase</b> <b>diagrams</b> will be incorporated to webpages.
