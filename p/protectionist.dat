5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the <b>protectionist</b> measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these <b>protectionist</b> measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|After Argentina became {{independent}} in 1810, {{an era in}} which commerce was controlled by a small group of peninsular merchants came to an end. The Primera Junta, the first government established after the 1810 May Revolution, undertook a <b>protectionist</b> policy until their fall from government.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a <b>protectionist</b> market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the <b>protectionist</b> economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E

5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the <b>Protectionist</b> Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E
5|$|In the 1906 redistribution, McCay's {{electorate}} of Corinella was abolished and {{its territory}} {{divided between the}} electorates of Laanecoorie and Corio. McCay decided to run in Corio against the sitting member, Richard Crouch, although {{he was also a}} <b>Protectionist,</b> but Crouch won convincingly. In 1910, the Commonwealth Liberal Party Senate candidate, Thomas Skene, died suddenly two days before the nomination date for the 1910 election. McCay submitted himself as candidate but lost.|$|E
5|$|Juan Manuel de Rosas forced Lavalle {{to leave}} the province, and the federals ruled Buenos Aires until 1852. Rosas {{modified}} a number of policies of the Rivadavian period but maintained others: he set a customs law with <b>protectionist</b> policies, but kept the port under the exclusive control of Buenos Aires and refused to call a constituent assembly.|$|E

50|$|A scandalised establishment, took {{measures}} to counter Labour's growing electoral dominance. Believing that an anti-socialist alliance was necessary, it pressured Deakin and Anti-Socialist Party's new leader, Joseph Cook, to begin merger talks. The {{main body of}} <b>Protectionists,</b> including Deakin and his supporters, merged with the Anti-Socialist Party in May 1909 to become the Commonwealth Liberal Party. The more liberal <b>Protectionists</b> joined Labour.|$|R
5|$|The BJP's {{economic}} policy has changed considerably since its founding. There {{is a significant}} range of economic ideologies within the party. In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates. It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a <b>protectionist</b> export policy. However, it supported internal economic liberalisation, and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|The First Triumvirate (1811–1812), {{influenced}} by Bernardino Rivadavia and Manuel García, instead promoted unrestricted trade with Britain. The Second Triumvirate (1812–1814) and José Gervasio Artigas (who controlled the Liga Federal during the 1815–1820 period) sought {{to restore the}} initial <b>protectionist</b> policy, but the Supreme Director restored free trade once more. Thus, {{the economy of the}} Río de la Plata {{became one of the most}} open economies in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans campaigned {{heavily on}} the tariff issue, turning out <b>protectionist</b> voters in the {{important}} industrial states of the North. Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B. Hill, weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state. A letter from the British ambassador supporting Cleveland caused a scandal which cost Cleveland votes in New York.|$|E
5000|$|The multi-member electorates of 1889 {{votes for}} Free Trade, <b>Protectionists</b> and the {{recently}} formed Labor Party ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of the parliament, the Labor party engaged in a {{partnership}} with the more radical <b>Protectionists,</b> but Labor's wide-ranging policies for social reform met with only lukewarm support from most <b>Protectionists.</b> Fear of socialism became widespread among the ranks of the establishment, and as the question of tariffs was settled, there was increasing pressure on the non-Labor parliamentary forces to unite in opposition to Labor.|$|R
2500|$|Alfred Deakin {{took over}} from Barton as Prime Minister {{and leader of}} the <b>Protectionists.</b> At the 1903 election, the Free Trade Party won 24 seats, with the Labour vote {{increasing}} mainly {{at the expense of the}} <b>Protectionists.</b> In August 1904, when the Watson government resigned, [...] Reid became Prime Minister. He was the first former state premier to become Prime Minister (the only other to date being Joseph Lyons). Reid did not have a majority in either House, and he knew it would be only a matter of time before the <b>Protectionists</b> patched up their differences with Labour, so he enjoyed himself in office while he could. In July 1905 the other two parties duly voted him out, and he left office with good grace.|$|R
5|$|The Tories promised {{changes in}} {{agricultural}} policies. Many Canadian farmers {{were unable to}} find buyers for their wheat; the PC party promised generous cash advances on unsold wheat and promised a <b>protectionist</b> policy regarding foreign agricultural products. The Liberals argued that such tariffs were not worth the loss of bargaining position in efforts to seek foreign markets for Canadian agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{proposed to}} avoid exporting money, and to include high tariffs on {{the import of}} luxury goods. This is often seen as a contradiction of The Representation of the Hacendados, but each request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition of trade with Britain, {{which is not the}} same than allowing it while following a <b>protectionist</b> policy. As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports, but kept high ones for imports.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Pilcher contested {{the seat}} of Thornbury in the 1918 general election. He opposed the sitting Liberal member Athelstan Rendall, a Coalition Coupon candidate, {{representing}} the splinter right-wing National Party of Conservatives opposed to the Coalition. He was heavily defeated, taking only 38% of the vote in what had previously been a relatively close seat. He continued a loose association with right-wing politics, chairing the anti-Bolshevik National Security Union, and joining the anti-socialist and <b>protectionist</b> British Commonwealth Union. When the British Fascisti was formed in the early 1920s, Pilcher became a member and an official of its London branch.|$|E
5000|$|The Liberal Party of Canada, at the time, was {{associated}} with the concept of free trade. <b>Protectionists</b> opposed the concept.|$|R
5000|$|George Reid of the Free Trade Party {{was sworn}} in as Prime Minister on 18 August, and Watson {{returned}} to negotiations with the liberal wing of the <b>Protectionists.</b> Reid governed in shaky coalition with the <b>Protectionists,</b> and his government lasted until July 1905. Reid denounced Labour as the [...] "Socialist tiger". Watson encouraged Deakin to abandon the Free Traders, saying: [...] "We, and especially me, don't want office, but I have the utmost anxiety to stop the retrogressive movement which Reid is heading." [...] Deakin commenced his second term as Prime Minister in July 1905, with Labour's support.|$|R
500|$|Fisher {{committed}} Labour to {{amending the}} Constitution {{to give the}} Commonwealth power over labour, wages and prices, to expanding the navy and providing compulsory military training for youths, to extending pensions, to a land tax, {{to the construction of}} a transcontinental railway, to the replacement of pound sterling with Australian currency and to tariffs to protect the sugar industry. [...] In May 1909, the more conservative <b>Protectionists</b> and Freetraders merged to form the Commonwealth Liberal Party, while the more liberal <b>Protectionists</b> joined Labour. With a majority of seats, the CLP led by Alfred Deakin ousted Labour from office, with Fisher failing to persuade the Governor-General Lord Dudley to dissolve Parliament.|$|R
5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to <b>protectionist</b> sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.|$|E
5|$|Martin Wolf, an {{economics}} leader writer with the Financial Times, suggested {{there may be}} advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years had been {{by far the biggest}} practitioner of competitive devaluation. Though he advised that rather than using <b>protectionist</b> measures which may spark a trade war, a better tactic would be to use targeted capital controls against China to prevent them buying foreign assets in order to further devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by Daniel Gros, Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{stood for}} the Senate at the 1901 federal {{election}} in March and {{was elected in}} the fourth position, with 40% of the vote (electors cast six votes, with the six candidates with the highest totals winning election). The only <b>Protectionist</b> Senator from New South Wales, he was appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate, and {{was instrumental in the}} evolution of that house as subordinate to the House of Representatives, although he encouraged the introduction of legislation into the Senate.|$|E
50|$|The three {{parties that}} contested the 1901 {{election}} also contested the 1903 election, {{with only the}} <b>Protectionists</b> changing leaders to Alfred Deakin {{as a result of}} Edmund Barton's appointment as an inaugural judge of the newly constituted High Court of Australia. The Free Trade Party was again led by George Reid. The only significant difference in policy between these parties was on trade issues. The <b>Protectionists</b> sought to protect Australian industry and agriculture by placing tariffs on imports. The Free Traders downgraded the view they had last election of having no tariffs to campaigning on minimal tariffs. The other major party contesting the election was the Labour Party.|$|R
5000|$|Fisher {{committed}} Labour to {{amending the}} Constitution {{to give the}} Commonwealth power over labour, wages and prices, to expanding the navy and providing compulsory military training for youths, to extending pensions, to a land tax, {{to the construction of}} a transcontinental railway, to the replacement of pound sterling with Australian currency and to tariffs to protect the sugar industry. [...] In May 1909, the more conservative <b>Protectionists</b> and Freetraders merged to form the Commonwealth Liberal Party, while the more liberal <b>Protectionists</b> joined Labour. With a majority of seats, the CLP led by Alfred Deakin ousted Labour from office, with Fisher failing to persuade the Governor-General Lord Dudley to dissolve Parliament.|$|R
50|$|The Commonwealth Liberal Party {{was formed}} in {{response}} to Labor forming its second government under Andrew Fisher in 1908. Under considerable pressure from middle- and upper-class interests, Alfred Deakin, {{the leader of the}} <b>Protectionists,</b> and Joseph Cook, leader of the Anti-Socialists, joined forces in order to counter Labor's growing popularity. In 1909, the two parties at a meeting in Melbourne's Parliament House agreed to merge into the CLP, based on a shared anti-Labor platform. Deakin was the new party's first leader, with Cook as deputy leader. The merger didn't sit well with several of the more liberal <b>Protectionists,</b> who defected to Labor or sat as independents.|$|R
5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout {{his first year}} in office, Clinton {{consistently}} supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, <b>protectionist</b> Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-French {{businessman}} James Goldsmith {{announced the}} formation of the Referendum Party on 27 November 1994. Goldsmith had once been a strong supporter of the EEC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a superstate governed by centralised institutions in Brussels. He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic <b>protectionist,</b> he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E
5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored <b>protectionist</b> policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
50|$|Dibbs {{had assumed}} office {{shortly before the}} {{election}} after the previous Premier, Sir Henry Parkes, lost {{a vote on the}} floor of the Assembly. Dibbs' <b>Protectionists</b> never commanded a majority {{on the floor of the}} Assembly in this period.|$|R
50|$|In October 2002 she {{and other}} animal <b>protectionists</b> founded the Party for Animals (Partij voor de Dieren). During the Dutch general {{election}} of 2003 the party gained 50.000 votes (0.5%), but not {{a seat in the}} House of Representatives.|$|R
50|$|The Free Traders won most of {{the seats}} in New South Wales, apart from the border areas where the <b>Protectionists</b> were strong. The <b>Protectionists</b> won {{most of the}} seats in their stronghold, Victoria. Labour won some inner urban seats but most of their members {{represented}} pastoral and mining areas. In the smaller states many members had no fixed party loyalty and saw themselves as representing the interests of their states. Seven Prime Ministers of Australia (Barton, Deakin, Watson, Reid, Fisher, Joseph Cook and Hughes) were elected at this election, as {{were a number of}} influential former state Premiers (Sir John Forrest, Lyne, George Turner, Anderson Dawson, Philip Fysh and Charles Kingston among them).|$|R
