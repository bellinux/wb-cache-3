There he established the office of Arthur Dyson and Associates that remains his base of operations.

[...] The Carlson Apartment Building project (1959) proposed a 17 story, 36 unit concrete and glass tower designed to overlook the Pacific Ocean at Santa Monica, California. The Cannery Row Hotel project (1966) for a site in Monterey, California further developed the grammar of a multi-story residential tower. The subsequent 27 story Chamlian Plaza Hotel project (1979) in Fresno, California, featured a sophisticated system of suspended structural engineering, <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction,</b> and a skin of automated solar tempering for guest rooms that virtually eliminated the possibility of being trapped by fire. The Westrend Visitors Center complex project (1972) for a tourist area adjacent to a main highway in the San Joaquin Valley suggested innovative use of textile in a massive circular canopy supported by a spar tower, a creative structural technique that decades later would be adopted by prominent architects.|$|E

50|$|An {{example from}} house-building {{illustrates}} {{the process of}} prefabrication. The conventional method of building a house is to transport bricks, timber, cement, sand, steel and construction aggregate, etc. to the site, and to construct the house on site from these materials. In <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction,</b> only the foundations are constructed in this way, while sections of walls, floors and roof are prefabricated (assembled) in a factory (possibly with window and door frames included), transported to the site, lifted into place by a crane and bolted together.|$|E

The choice of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> materials was partly a consequence of a shortage of bricks in the UK at the time.

40|$|In recent years, the {{prefabricated}} house industry has rapid development,.

According to {{the characteristics of the}} <b>prefabricated</b> house <b>construction</b> engineering, we analyse the construction engineering logistics risks and use the combined weights method to determine the weight of indexes which contains both subjective and objective factors, to improve the scientific value and the validity of the assessment. Based on credibility measure method, a new logistics risk evaluation model in prefabricated housing is established to estimate the risk during making <b>prefabricated</b> house <b>construction</b> engineering.

40|$|The {{preformed}} metal crowns (PMCs) are <b>prefabricated</b> <b>constructions,</b> {{used for}} restoring a severely broken teeth, affected by multisurfice carious lesions. The {{aim of the}} current study is to analyze and criticize the contemporary scientific conclusions related to indications, the usage methods, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the PMCs, used in the treatment protocol in pediatric dentistry. The subject of the analysis is 64 english language papers, published in the period from 1966 to 2017 y. The analysis shows that disadvantages of these restorations are related to the aesthetics and previous preparation of the hard tooth tissues. The numerous advantages are related to the mechanical durability; the successful tightness concerning the non-operative sealing of caries and the prophylactic effect related to secondary caries lesion as well as the orthodontic jaw malformations, justify the usage of the PMCs in pediatric dentistry and also explain the need of scientific, clinical research in this domain...|$|R

5000|$|The clock {{tower was}} of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction,</b> {{composed}} of cream and brown tiles {{held in place}} by ornamental cast iron work. The tiles were made by Mintons, and were 14 in by 11 in in size. It was 60 ft high, 7 ft wide, and had an internal stairway running to the top, where there was a balustraded platform. The clock required winding once a week. A gilded kangaroo acted as a weather vane at the apex of the tower. It was described by Sir Thomas Maltby in an article printed in The Geelong Advertiser as [...] "a lifelike model of a Kangaroo about four feet high, exclusive of the four cardinal points on which it pivots freely. The tail in a horizontal position, gives direction to the erect body, looking always into the wind." [...] Sir Thomas Maltby purchased this irreplaceable relic thereby saving it from being turned into scrap metal and is still in perfect working order.|$|E
50|$|Harold Hill was {{a planned}} community, {{conceived}} {{as part of}} the Greater London Plan in 1944 as a satellite town {{on the edge of the}} built up area. Land for the estate, which consisted of the remaining 850 acre of Dagnams, was purchased in 1947 by the London County Council. The rest of Dagnams had been sold off in 1919, with the land used for the estate consisting of parkland, woodland and farmland. The area was within the designated Metropolitan Green Belt, but an exception was made for the development because of the exceptional housing need in London following the Second World War. Reflecting the urgency of the problem, housing was initially <b>prefabricated.</b> <b>Construction</b> of 7,631 permanent homes, housing 25,000 people, began in 1948 and was complete by 1958. The development is fairly low density with large sections of parkland retained in the centre and edges of the estate. The estate was constructed primarily in brick, with mostly terraces of houses and some flats. Provision was made for community facilities and three shopping areas were planned to break up the size of the development. Some industrial development already existed to the south and adjacent to the A12 road and this was retained.|$|E
40|$|The {{directions}} of {{development of the}} construction market are not only related {{to the need to}} own one’s own home but also to increasing functional and economic requirements and conditions of sustainable development. The perception and understanding of prefabrication in housing construction are undoubtedly starting to change. Sustainable construction criteria may constitute a significant turning point and support for the development of new <b>prefabricated</b> housing <b>construction</b> technologies. Entrepreneurs are slowly perceiving an opportunity for the development of prefabrication in the construction market. The implementation and popularisation of ready-made homes will undoubtedly constitute a favourable change in the Polish construction market; however, this will require a modification of habits.

As {{a new form of}} green building, <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> is of particular interest. On account of the immature development of the green building market in China, the investment risk for <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> is higher than for traditional architecture.

This study adopts system dynamics and builds a risk identification feedback chart and risk flow chart, to comprehensively identify investment risks that projects in China may face and to process quantitative estimation of investment risk factors. Key factors influencing project investment risks are found, and corresponding measures are pointedly proposed.

40|$|International audienceGiven {{the strong}} {{presence}} {{of all types}} of formulaic language in communication, {{it is not surprising that}} the question of whether and which types of phrasemes should be part of systematic foreign language teaching evokes intensive discussion within phraseodidactics. While some researchers favour an unrestricted approach to the teaching {{of all types of}} phrasemes, others adopt a more differentiated view. In the present paper a distinction is drawn between formulaic expressions which should be acquired by the foreign language learner for both productive and receptive competence (routine formulae, collocations, sequential “frames”) from those <b>prefabricated</b> <b>constructions</b> which should be excluded from any systematic language teaching, i. e. idiomatic expressions based on metaphors or strong pictorial elements. Six basic arguments are developed to justify the exclusion of idioms from systematic foreign language teaching: the lack of an empirical basis, complex conditions of use and connotations, the discrepancy between the learner’s general language level and the stylistic level of idioms, metaphorical and / or pictorial expressions as “culturemes”, the conversational treatment of pictorial constructions by native speakers, and the elimination of constructions with an irregular syntactic and / or semantic structure...|$|R
