5|$|In 2006, Canterbury City Council began a <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> {{to discuss}} the regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the {{shopping}} centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier {{and replacing it with}} other tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, the Eden Academy Trust began a <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> on reopening {{the former}} {{elementary}} {{school as a}} free special school in January 2015. Under the plans, it would be refurbished and open to 32 pupils, and would be gradually expanded to eventually have a full intake of 140 pupils by September 2016. The school, named Pentland Field School, opened to its first intake of pupils on 12 January 2015, and was officially reopened by the Permanent Secretary for the Department for Education, Chris Wormald.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} new {{crossings}} have been proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry crossing in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council suggest that this crossing will be essential for managing congestion. A <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017, though Highways England {{do not expect to}} start construction before 2026.|$|E
5|$|Falling attendances {{due to the}} {{commercial}} nature of the district, and also a sense {{that there was some}} redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, caused the Manchester diocese to review the status of St John's and its parish in the 1920s. Following an internal review and a <b>public</b> <b>consultation,</b> in 1927 it was formally proposed that the two parishes should be merged as St Matthew's parish. The diocese preferred to retain St Matthew's and demolish St John's, at least in part because the former was a more recent construction. This was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919, when the predominantly transient Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish was given as a reason to merge it into St John's.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, was {{considering}} a scheme with two cordons, one covering the main urban {{core of the}} Greater Manchester Urban Area and another covering the Manchester city centre. The measure {{was supported by the}} government, but three local authorities rejected it (Bury, Trafford and Stockport); the support of two-thirds of Manchester's 10 local councils was needed for it to be implemented. A comprehensive transport investment package for Manchester, which included the congestion pricing element, was released for further <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> and was to be subject of a referendum in December 2008. On 12 December 2008 the scheme was overwhelmingly rejected by 10 out of 10 councils by a public referendum.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, {{plans to}} improve the route through the Blackdown Hills (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) were {{abandoned}} in favour of upgrading the A358 from Ilminster to the M5 motorway at Taunton to reduce traffic west of Ilminster. The scheme {{was the subject of}} a <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> in March 2007, and incorporated plans to widen the Ilminster bypass from South Petherton to a dual two-lane road. The plans were shelved in 2009 when it was concluded that the dualling could not be funded from the Regional Funding Allocation for the South West. In 2016, the plans were revived by Highways England, with a final decision expected to be announced the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups. This proposed barrage would pass two miles (3km) west of Flat Holm. The study is expected to last {{at least two years}} and will be split into two stages with a decision point at the end of each. The first, which is likely to run until late 2008, will focus on high-level issues and reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary. Subject to the decision {{at the end of the}} first phase, the second phase will look at the issues in more detail and culminate in a full <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> in early 2010.|$|E
5|$|A {{regeneration}} {{scheme was}} announced in 2004; supported by the Phoenix Trust, the maltings would be converted into residential, retail and business space. <b>Public</b> <b>consultation</b> took place in 2005 and 2006, with around 90% of participants supporting regeneration and three-quarters asking for a cinema and entertainment complex. Lincolnshire Enterprise granted £200,000 towards the regeneration scheme and the Gladedale Group came forward to develop the project. Over the next three years, they worked with the Prince's Regeneration Trust to draw up plans for the site's regeneration which protected the historic exterior. In 2009, their proposals were submitted for planning permission. North Kesteven District Council approved the £50million development in 2011; Tesco was also granted permission to build a £20million supermarket {{as part of the}} redevelopment. The maltings would be converted into retail and office space, alongside 220 apartments.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011 Manchester City Council began a <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> {{on moving}} the cenotaph to an {{alternative}} {{site in the}} square to allow for expansion of the Metrolink tram network. The plans had a mixed reception. Some objections {{were made by the}} public but there was support from veterans, church, and heritage groups. The relocation was approved in 2012, and in January 2014 it was dismantled before it was cleaned and restored. In 2014 it was reconstructed in a new memorial garden {{on the opposite side of}} the square aligned with Manchester Town Hall's southern entrance. The city council commissioned conservation architects Stephen Levrant Heritage Architecture to manage the relocation and design the new setting which places the cenotaph, obelisks and stone on a plinth in an oval surrounded by a low wall. The garden opened to the public in September 2014. The cenotaph was damaged in the first week when skateboarders began using the area as a skatepark. Repair work costing £4,000 started shortly afterwards, and extra security measures (including 24-hour CCTV) were put in place.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Shamrock Rovers {{were granted}} {{land in the}} Dublin suburb of Tallaght {{to build a new}} stadium. On 30 March 2000, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern turned the sod at the site. However, work on the stadium ceased in 2001 and in March 2005, South Dublin County Council {{announced}} that they were taking back the land that they had granted to the club, as the conditions of the planning permission had not been met. A <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> process was initiated in July 2005 and a resolution was passed in December 2005 to alter the stadium to accommodate senior GAA games while still having Shamrock Rovers as the preferred tenants. This decision was subject to additional government funding. This funding was not made available and on 13 January 2006 the council voted to proceed with the original plan.|$|E
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and a <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> {{was held}} in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>consultations</b> are an {{important}} communication channel between policymakers and interest organisations across systems and levels of governance and constitute a key venue for lobbying and interest representation. The European Union implements {{one of the most}} elaborated and complex systems of stakeholder consultations. This consultation regime constitutes an institutional constraint that structures stakeholders’ organisational and lobbying behaviour. This is particularly relevant for European level associations, which aim to perform various roles within EU policymaking but whose presence and function in Brussels are challenged by a constant increase in the direct lobbying of policymakers by individual interest organisations. In relation to this, this study asks: to what extent and in what way do <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> support the lobbying activities of European associations in EU policymaking? The study argues that <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> support the European associations’ lobbying by offering them a venue in which they can successfully combine their ‘logic of memerhsip’ with their ‘logic of influence’ in pursuit of their lobbying goals. The argument is supported with examples and evidence from five <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> conducted by the European Commission in the environmental policy and two consultations on reforming the EU Better Regulation policy. <br/...|$|R

5|$|The 1979 general {{election}} brought a Conservative government {{to power and}} allowed the Council to shift its focus towards retaining Grammar Schools where they still existed and improving schools where work had been put on hold during the comprehensive debate; despite 90% of English councils adopting comprehensive education, Lincolnshire had retained its grammar schools. Although the County Council began discussing the abolition of them again in 1985, opposition from parents at a <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> in 1987 resulted in the plans being dropped. With the question of its future resolved, Carre's applied for grant-maintained status in 1989; the Education Secretary approved the proposals and formally granted the status in September 1990. When grant-maintained status was abolished in 1999, Carre's became a Foundation School. Following a successful bid to the DfES, submitted in October 2002, the school was granted specialist Sports College status in 2003. An all-weather pitch was laid out in 2007, and a new technology building with a fitness suite opened in 2011. In 2009, Carre's became a specialist Science College and a lead school for gifted and talented students. The school converted to Academy status in August 2011. In 2014, the governors announced their intention to bid for conversion to a multi-Academy trust and become a coeducational, selective school on a new site; in February 2015, Kesteven and Sleaford High School announced its intention to join the proposed trust, a moved welcomed by Carre's. Carre's officially {{became part of the}} Robert Carre Multi-Academy Trust on 1 September 2015; the schools continue to operate on their sites, sharing staff and facilities.|$|E
5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E
