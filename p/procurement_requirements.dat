2500|$|Dassault Rafale won the Indian MMRCA {{competition}} to supply 126 medium {{multi-role combat aircraft}} to the Indian Air Force. In April 2015, the inabilities to conclude negotiations on contractual obligations [...] led the Modi government to transform the acquisition into a G2G procurement for 36 aircraft in flyaway condition to equip 3 squadrons of the Indian Air Force. Defense analysts have voiced concern that equipment <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements</b> which were defined 2 decades ago are {{out of sync with}} current requirements and the future nature of air-combat. Air forces of advanced Western nations, especially US & France, are reorganizing their air forces with increase in space-based assets and down-sizing of fleets of manned combat aircraft. Autonomous drones have become the preferred platform for high-risk missions over enemy territory in both high and low intensity conflict zones. At present, NATO uses aerial reconnaissance drones to monitor the borders of Europe and US uses maritime surveillance drones in the Western Pacific and unmanned combat drones in missions against low-value and unsophisticated targets in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. Defense white-papers published in OECD countries show that use of combat and reconnaissance pilotless vehicles (like the flight-tested Dassault nEUROn and Northrop Grumman X-47B UAVs or the Boeing X-37 robotic spacecraft) will become widespread in the years ahead.|$|E

40|$|Today social <b>procurement,</b> and <b>requirements</b> {{to create}} {{employment}} for disadvantaged groups in particular, are increasingly {{used in the}} construction sector. In Sweden, a growing interest in social <b>procurement</b> and employment <b>requirements</b> {{is partly due to}} problems with segregation and high unemployment rates among immigrants. As a result, many municipalities and landlords see opportunities to combine construction projects with employment opportunities for tenants. Simultaneously, prognoses state that building will be booming in Sweden the upcoming years, creating new drivers for the construction industry to search for new employees among new groups in society. However, research on the implementation and effects of social employment requirements on organizations in the construction sector is scarce and mainly descriptive. This paper aims to address this recent trend in construction procurement and the implications for the sector as well as for research. Previous research on social <b>procurement</b> and employment <b>requirements</b> in the construction industry and written material on three Swedish cases serve as a basis for the discussion. Findings suggest that the changes in the construction industry can be understood as an ongoing institutionalization process, where the institutional work of procurement- and construction actors are reshaping old institutional logics towards a more socially service-oriented sustainable industry...|$|R

5000|$|Body armor {{standards}} are regional. Around the world ammunition varies {{and as a}} result the armor testing must reflect the threats found locally. Law enforcement statistics show that many shootings where officers are injured or killed involve the officer's own weapon. [...] As a result, each law enforcement agency or para-military organization will have their own standard for armor performance if only to ensure that their armor protects them from their own weapons. While many standards exist, a few {{standards are}} widely used as models. The US National Institute of Justice ballistic and stab documents are examples of broadly accepted standards. In addition to the NIJ, the UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB - formerly the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB)) standards are used by a number of other countries and organizations. These [...] "model" [...] standards are usually adapted by other countries by incorporation of the basic test methodologies with modification of the bullets that are required for test.NIJ Standard-0101.06 has specific performance standards for bullet resistant vests used by law enforcement. This rates vests on the following scale against penetration and also blunt trauma protection (deformation):NIJ standards are used for law enforcement armors. The US and NATO military armor designs are tested using a standard set of test methods under ARMY MIL-STD-662F and STANAG 2920 Ed2. This approach defines the test process under the 662F/2920 standard. Each armor program can select a unique series of projectiles and velocities as required. The DOD and MOD armor programs-of-record (MTV for example) procure armor using these test standards. In addition, special requirements can be defined under this process for armors for flexible rifle protection, fragment protection for the extremities, etc. These military <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements</b> do not relate to NIJ, HOSDB or ISO law enforcement armor standards, test methods, garment size, projectiles or velocities.|$|E
40|$|Infrastructure {{projects}} are today major contributors to global warming. However, various strategies for reduction {{of greenhouse gas}} emission are available, as described in sustainability assessment schemes and performed in infrastructure projects. Beyond the choice of methodology, greenhouse gas reduction represents an important challenge, namely to engage involved actors. The establishment of a common sustainability policy, reflected in <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements</b> could be a solution. However, often in subject of complications such as misunderstandings or increased cost. Impres, a research project aiming to streamline the process of greenhouse gas reduction in the infrastructure sector, conducts case studies {{around the world in}} which useful methods and examples are assimilated. In cooperation with Impres, the present report includes the case study of California High-Speed Rail (CHSR). The aim of this report is to compare strategies for greenhouse gas reduction of sustainability assessment schemes for infrastructure projects, and evaluate the feasibility as <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements.</b> Furthermore, to identify corresponding processes of greenhouse gas reduction in the case study of CHSR, as well as revealing important factors towards realization. The course of work involves a study of the schemes Envision, BREEAM Infrastructure, CEEQUAL, IS Rating System as well as the standard PAS 2080. Regarding the case study, the sustainability policy, <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements</b> and project reports are the main used sources. Moreover, qualitative interviews with involved actors have been performed in California. Finally, to create a comparative matrix for greenhouse gas reduction processes, standards ISO and PAS 2080 have been reviewed. The results show that greenhouse gas criteria of the studied schemes not are mandatory to perform in anyone but PAS 2080. Which means that further requisites might be needed in order for the schemes to be useful as <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements.</b> Furthermore, the outlining of processes reveals a weakness in the setting of a greenhouse gas reference point, and while every scheme includes a greenhouse gas quantity assessment, there is a difference in the priority of reduction. Regarding CHSR, an exclaimed policy goal is to perform climate neutral construction. While <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements</b> are limited to quantification of emitted greenhouse gases and the use of effective construction machinery, which is insufficient to meet the goal. Nevertheless, the Authority in charge is performing CO 2 compensating measures, such as planting trees. Finally, a variety of driving forces, success factors and challenges for realizing greenhouse gas reduction have been identified. For example, personal motivation and legislation as driving forces. Whereas, sustainability as a core mission, experience and communication are seen as success factors, and resistance to transfer sustainability goals to procurement is an exclaimed challenge. As a conclusion, sustainability assessment schemes do have certain processes for greenhouse gas reduction in common. However, they present criteria with different degrees of obligation, affecting feasibility as <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements.</b> In CHSR, similar processes are found, where further reduction of greenhouse gases can be achieved, especially by an optimized choice of construction materials. In the end, personal motivation seems to be an important factor for introducing and realizing greenhouse gas reduction goals in infrastructure projects. Impre...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{explores the}} challenges facing organisations in aligning sustainable <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements</b> and marketing needs and the attendant shifts in supply chain management practices. Whilst external influences are readily understood (e. g. regulation and customer demand), less is understood about the implications for suppliers trying to meet sustainable <b>procurement</b> <b>requirements</b> and the organisational challenges of aligning marketing with sustainable supply chain management. An exploratory case study of a UK University catering department has been undertaken, to explore the strategies, processes and relationships associated with synthesising sustainable supply chain and green marketing needs. The empirical findings illustrate the divergence between organisational perspectives on sustainability and procuring sustainable products with marketing demands. Thus, the findings extend the theoretical discussion on sustainable supply chains by providing empirical data based on real-life implementation and from this an emergent aligned supply chain model is proposed, which confirms two drivers for alignment, lean and resource efficient and local and seasonal contingent on market demand.

40|$|Energy poverty, in particular, {{the lack}} of access to electricity, is a chronic {{impediment}} to sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting over one billion people. Recently, electrification efforts have bifurcated into two pathways: grid extension/enhancement and off‑grid. Expanding and enhancing the existing national grid is the de facto approach, but is struggling to keep up with growing populations and demand in many countries. Off-grid solutions such as solar home systems and mini-grids are seen as a way to ‘leap frog’ the national grid, but face distribution, affordability, and regulatory challenges.
