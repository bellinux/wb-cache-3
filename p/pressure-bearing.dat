5000|$|A {{plasmoid}} is {{a finite}} configuration of magnetic fields and plasma. With the virial theorem {{it is easy}} to see that any such configuration will expand if not contained by external forces. In a finite configuration without <b>pressure-bearing</b> walls or magnetic coils, the surface integral will vanish. Since all the other terms on the right hand side are positive, the acceleration of the moment of inertia will also be positive. It is also easy to estimate the expansion time τ. If a total mass M is confined within a radius R, then the moment of inertia is roughly MR2, and the left hand side of the virial theorem is MR2/τ2. The terms on the right hand side add up to about pR3, where p is the larger of the plasma pressure or the magnetic pressure. Equating these two terms and solving for τ, we find ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFlexible {{composite}} pipes are advantageous in ultra high strength, high modulus, pH and {{corrosion resistance}} and light weight, {{but there are}} still some hidden safety troubles because they are poorer in thermostable capacity. Therefore, test samples of flexible composite pipes were prepared with high-temperature polythene (PE-RT) as the neck bush and aramid fiber as the reinforcement layer. Experimental study was conducted by using HPHT vessel and differential thermal scanner for different working conditions, different temperatures, whole-pipe <b>pressure-bearing</b> capacity and 1000  h viability. It is shown by the environmental compatibility test that high temperature has little effect on the weight, Vicat softening temperature, mechanical properties and structures of neck bush PE-RT, but exerts an obvious effect on the tensility and whole-pipe water pressure blasting of the reinforcement aramid fiber. Besides, the drop of whole-pipe <b>pressure-bearing</b> capacity is caused by deformation and breaking of aramid fibers when the reinforcement layer is under the force of internal pressure. Finally, disorientation and crystallization of molecular thermal motion occur with the rise of temperature, so amorphous orientation reduces, crystallinity factor and crystalline orientation factor increase gradually, thus, disorientation of macromolecular chains increases and tensile strength decreases. It is concluded that this type of flexible composite pipe can smoothly pass 1000  h viability test. And it is recommended that it be used in the situations with temperature not higher than 95  °C and internal pressure not higher than 4  MPa...|$|E
40|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{control in}} millimeter-wide fractures {{has been a}} challenge in well drilling all the time. Low <b>pressure-bearing</b> capacity of a plugging zone will result in excessive consumption of lost circulation materials (LCMs) and extra down time. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted on the plugging of millimeter-wide fractures to evaluate the plugging effects {{of different types of}} LCM including rigid granules, elastic particles and fiber. Maximum plugging pressure, total loss volume before sealing and plugging time were taken as the evaluation index of the LCM plugging effect. According to the experimental results, the synergistic plugging mechanisms of different LCM combinations were also analyzed. Experimental results showed that the total loss volume of the plugging zone formed by rigid and elastic particle combination was generally greater than 400  mL, and the maximum plugging pressure of the plugging zone formed by elastic particle and fiber combination was generally less than 6  MPa. In contrast, the plugging zone formed by the combination of the three types of LCMs has the maximum plugging pressure of up to 13  MPa and total loss volume before sealing of 75  mL. In the synergistic plugging process, rigid granules form a frame with high <b>pressure-bearing</b> capacity in the narrower parts of the fractures; elastic particles generate elastic force through elastic deformation to increase the friction between a fracture and a plugging zone to make the plugging zone more stable; fibers filling in the pore space between the particles increase the tightness and integrity of the plugging zone. The experimental results can provide guidance for the optimal design of LCMs used in the field...|$|E
40|$|Keratin 16 (K 16) is a cytoskeletal {{scaffolding}} protein highly expressed at <b>pressure-bearing</b> {{sites of}} the mammalian footpad. It can be induced in hyperproliferative states such as wound healing, inflammation and cancer. Here we show that the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF 2 (iRHOM 2) regulates thickening of the footpad epidermis through its interaction with K 16. K 16 expression is absent in the thinned footpads of irhom 2 (-/-) mice compared with irhom 2 (+/+) mice, due to reduced keratinocyte proliferation. Gain-of-function mutations in iRHOM 2 underlie Tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC), characterized by palmoplantar thickening, upregulate K 16 with robust downregulation of its type II keratin binding partner, K 6. By orchestrating the remodelling and turnover of K 16, and uncoupling it from K 6, iRHOM 2 regulates the epithelial response to physical stress. These findings contribute {{to our understanding of}} the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperproliferation of the palmoplantar epidermis in both physiological and disease states, and how this 'stress' keratin is regulated...|$|E

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} of 508 feet in 310 patients after telescoping osteotomy of the lesser metatarsals for metatarsalgia. The patients were predominantly female (80 %), {{with a mean}} age of 55 years; the range of follow-up was 1 to 12 years. In 22 % of the patients the metatarsalgia was associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Improvements in assessment and modifications in technique are reported and the management of complications is discussed. The results show that telescoping osteotomy for established cases of pressure metatarsalgia is a simple and reliable operation. Permanent relief of symptoms can be expected in over 80 % of patients. Pain in the region of the metatarsals and metatarsophal-angeal joints is called metatarsalgia. When pain occurs on bearing weight it is termed pressure metatarsalgia. The common cause is displacement of the normal <b>pressure-bearing</b> pads of fat from beneath one or more of the metatarsal heads. The skin underlying the metatarsal heads thickens to form callosities which are the usual source of pain. In longstanding pressure metatarsalgi...|$|E

Presplitting blasting for hard coal rocks is crucial for the prevention and control of strong pressure in stope. In this study, pressured water coupling blasting technique was proposed. The process and effect of blasting were analyzed by orthogonal test and field practice. Results showed {{that the presence of}} <b>pressure-bearing</b> water and explosive cartridges in the drill are the main influence factors of the blasting effect of cement test block. The high load-transmitting performance of pore water and energy accumulation in explosive cartridges were analyzed. Noxious substances produced during the blasting process were properly controlled because of the moistening, cooling, and diluting effect of pore water. Not only the goal of safe and static rock fragmentation by high-explosive detonation but also a combination of superdynamic blast loading and static loading effect of the pressured water was achieved. Then the practice of blasting control of hard coal rocks in Datong coal mine was analyzed to determine reasonable parameters of pressured water coupling blasting. A good presplitting blasting control effect was achieved for the hard coal rocks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVulnerability {{to natural}} {{disasters}} falls into three categories: exposure, resistance, and resilience, where resilience mainly {{refers to the}} capability of a <b>pressure-bearing</b> system to recover by returning to its initial state, that is, the ability to adapt to disaster pressure. Resilience is a major subject of research on disaster prevention and mitigation. This research mainly focuses {{on the ability of}} the hydraulic structure to recover from the significant impacts of typhoons. According to the load/unload response ratio theory, the degree of instability by which nonlinear systems can be identified according to the difference between load and unload responses was analyzed. This analysis was used as a basis to study the resilience of a hydraulic structure. Taking the Yangtze River embankments under the impact of Typhoon Matsa as an example, the ability of the typical sections of different types of embankments to adapt to the significant impact of the typhoon, i. e., the resilience of the hydraulic structure, is described {{with the help of the}} load/unload response ratio (L). The results of the calculated resilience reflect the actual conditions of the structure and can be used to determine the applicability of the embankment section. The load/unload response ratio theory is one of the effective tools for calculating the resilience of hydraulic structures under the significant impacts of typhoons...|$|E
30|$|In the {{framework}} of the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) joint research project in the karst area of Gunung Kidul, Province of Yogyakarta Special Region on the Java Island, Indonesia, an underground hydropower driven water extraction facility in the cave “Bribin” was developed using pump-as-turbine-driven systems for freshwater supply of the rural area. As numerous other caves in the Gunung Kidul area, Bribin is part of a ramified system of all-season water-bearing subterraneous rivers and natural caves in karstic limestone. The elliptic cross section of the cave was completely closed with a concrete barrage, thus creating a year-round underground retention volume with an operational storage level of approx. 15  m. This contribution highlights the geotechnical and geohydraulic challenges handled within the sub-project “Short-time and long-time behaviour of karst rock surrounding <b>pressure-bearing</b> underground water-retaining structures”. One key to the feasibility of an artificial water retention scheme in a natural cave is to ensure the mechanical stability of the cave roof and sidewalls. The necessary geotechnical investigations are described. Another key to the effectiveness of such a water retention concept is the control and minimization of “lost” seepage water bypassing the barrage structure through the karst rock mass. Measures to monitor and to explain the seepage phenomena are presented as well as grouting efforts to minimize them. The limitations of improving the overall tightness will be discussed. Interpretation includes the use of analytical and numerical methods.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium spp. are diphtheroid {{bacteria}} {{responsible for}} pitted keratolysis, a common plantar infection {{confined to the}} thick stratum corneum. AIM: To study a series of demographic features of patients suffering from pitted keratolysis, and to present {{a review of the}} Corynebacterium-associated infections, including pitted keratolysis, erythrasma, and trichobacteriosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2 -year, two-center, prospective survey assessed the demographics of pitted keratolysis, including age, gender, site of infection, symptoms, patients' complaints, the use of protective and/or occlusive shoes, seasonality of diagnosis, drug intake, associated skin signs (including dyshidrosis, erythrasma, and trichobacteriosis), recurrences, and previous diagnoses and treatments. RESULTS: The mean age of the 53 patients with pitted keratolysis was 24. 9 years (range, 10 - 57 years). The male to female ratio was 7. 8 : 1. The soles of both feet were commonly involved (92. 4 %). <b>Pressure-bearing</b> areas were the usual sites of infection, ranging from restricted involvement of the toes (12 / 53, 22. 6 %) to spreading to the entire plantar surface (15 / 53, 28. 3 %). A total of 36 (68 %) of the 53 patients complained of hyperhidrosis. An unpleasant smell and pain were noted by 35 (66 %) and 25 (47 %) of the 53 patients, respectively. Occlusive and protective shoes were worn in 51 (96. 2 %) and 31 (58. 4 %) of the 53 cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pitted keratolysis commonly affects young male patients wearing protective shoes for professional reasons, inducing a moist and warm environment. Hyperhidrosis, an unpleasant smell, and pain are the main clinical complaints. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Borehole instability and reservoir damage had become the international technical problems of petroleum exploration and development of complicated area, and the water of drilling fluid invading borehole wall and petroleum reservoir was {{the main cause of}} borehole instability and reservoir damage. In order to prevent the water of drilling fluid invading borehole wall and petroleum reservoir, domestic and foreign scholars recently put forward the technology of ultra-low permeable drilling fluid. Film forming agent was the key treating agent of ultra-low permeable drilling fluid, the film forming agent (HN- 1) was developed, which did not affect properties of the drilling fluid and could decrease the filter loss of drilling fluid applied in Enping 24 - 2 oil field. Based on this research, ultra-low permeable drilling fluid could be applied to Enping 24 - 2 oil field. By the methods of testing ultra-low permeable drilling fluid properties, the drilling fluid invasion sand-bed depth, drilling fluid high temperature/high pressure (HTHP) sand-bed filter loss, the <b>pressure-bearing</b> ability of rock core and the ability of reservoir protection were studied. By synergistic effect, HN- 1 containing the organic silicate and natural fiber polymer modified by organic amine prevented the liquid and solids in drilling fluid invading reservoir, decreased drilling fluid invasion sand-bed depth and drilling fluid HTHP sand-bed filter loss, im...|$|E
40|$|Kick {{tolerance}} {{is a key}} parameter {{to indicate}} whether shut-in operation {{can be carried out}} safely and a proper well killing method should be chosen in well drilling. At present, however, the calculation of kick tolerance in deepwater drilling is not efficient enough. In this paper, a calculation method for volume kick tolerance of deepwater drilling was developed by means of theoretical derivation and example verification. Based on deepwater borehole temperature profile, choke manifold and annulus circulating pressure loss, the calculation model of volume kick tolerance was established under the constraint of the <b>pressure-bearing</b> capacity of the formation at the casing shoe, resistance to internal pressure of casing, blowout preventer (BOP) and choke control. Then, its reliability was verified by using the calculation results of a deepwater well in the South China Sea. It is indicated that the well can be shut in safely and the well killing will be safer if the Engineer's Method is used. The result is in agreement with the measures that were adopted on site. Finally, the newly developed calculation model was compared with those which don't take temperature and pressure loss into account, and the effect of choke manifold, annulus pressure loss and temperature inside wellbore on kick tolerance was analyzed. It is shown that the volume kick tolerance will get smaller if the effect of pressure loss and temperature is not taken into account, and the well killing conditions will be more rigorous. In addition, the technical measures to increase kick tolerance were proposed after the influential laws of pit gain and overflow depth on kick tolerance were analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Convection of plasma {{within the}} {{terrestrial}} nightside plasma sheet {{contributes to the}} structure and, possibly, the dynamical evolution of the magnetotail. In order to characterize the steady state convection process, we have extended the finite tail width model of magnetotail plasma sheet convection. The model assumes uniform plasma sources and accounts for both the duskward gradient/curvature drift and the earthward E × B drift of ions in a two-dimensional magnetic geometry. During periods of slow convection (i. e., when the cross-tail electric potential energy is small relative to the source plasma 2 ̆ 7 s thermal energy), {{there is a significant}} net duskward displacement of the <b>pressure-bearing</b> ions. The electrons are assumed to be cold, and we argue that this assumption is appropriate for plasma sheet parameters. We generalize solutions previously obtained along the midnight meridian to describe the variation of the plasma pressure and number density across the width of the tail. For a uniform deep-tail source of particles, the plasma pressure and number density are unrealistically low along the near-tail dawn flank. We therefore add a secondary source of plasma originating from the dawnside low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL). The dual plasma sources contribute to the plasma pressure and number density throughout the magnetic equatorial plane. Model results indicate that the LLBL may be a significant source of near-tail central plasma sheet plasma during periods of weak convection. The model predicts a cross-tail pressure gradient from dawn to dusk in the near magnetotail. We suggest that the plasma pressure gradient is balanced in part by an oppositely directed magnetic pressure gradient for which there is observational evidence. Finally, the pressure to number density ratio is used to define the plasma “temperature. ” We stress that such quantities as temperature and polytropic index must be interpreted with care as they lose their nominal physical significance in regions where the two-source plasmas intermix appreciably and the distributions become non-Maxwellian...|$|E
