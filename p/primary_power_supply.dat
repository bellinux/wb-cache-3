40|$|Abstract: – Electrical {{distribution}} systems {{usually have}} complex configurations {{with a number}} of missions corresponding to the many different requested functions. The levels of reliability and availability of each function depend on both the length of each reliability chain and on the devices involved in each path starting from the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> node and terminating at an end-user supply. This paper describes a new procedure for an FMECA (Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis), since the classical FMECA procedure usually applied to analyze electronics and mechanical systems is inadequate to analyze electrical power systems. Actually, the classical procedure using the so-called bottom-up approach implies that components (the “sons”) are responsible for failures in a system (the “father”). In electrical radial systems where <b>primary</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> are placed upstream and the end-users are downstream, the failures of the upstream components (fathers) affect the final supplies (sons). This implies a reversal of the hierarchy reliability logic. In addition, there is a further difference because in electronics and mechanical systems a great number of causes can provoke system failure (end-effect) while in electrical systems very few causes (connected to <b>primary</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies)</b> can involve very numerous end-effects on a myriad of end-user supplies. In order to overcome these difficulties, the FMECA method here described proceeds by subdividing a system into levels, then examines the failure causes and the linked effects level by level, starting from the end-users (top-events), and going upwards to the power-supply nodes (first-causes). After a general overview of the difficulties arising when the classical FMECA is applied to electrical systems, the new method is thoroughly described and discussed...|$|R

The design of an all electric power and propulsion system for small UAVs {{was the focus}} of a detailed study. Currently, many of these small vehicles are <b>powered</b> by <b>primary</b> (nonrechargeable) lithium-based batteries. While this type of battery is capable of satisfying some of the mission needs, a secondary (rechargeable) battery <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> system that can provide the same functionality as the current system at the same or lower system mass and volume is desired. A study of commercially available secondary battery cell technologies that could provide the desired performance characteristics was performed. Due to the strict mass limitations and wide operating temperature requirements of small UAVs, the only viable cell chemistries were determined to be lithium-ion liquid electrolyte systems and lithium-ion gel polymer electrolyte systems. Two lithium-ion gel polymer cell designs were selected as candidates and were tested using potential load profiles for UAV applications. Because lithium primary batteries have a higher specific energy and energy density, for the same mass and volume allocation, the secondary batteries resulted in shorter flight times than the primary batteries typically provide. When the batteries were operated at lower ambient temperatures (0 to - 20 C), flight times were even further reduced. Despite the reduced flight times demonstrated, for certain UAV applications, the secondary batteries operated within the acceptable range of flight times at room temperature and above.

40|$|Novel design {{techniques}} are presented for load-resonant and quasi-resonant converters for use in, for example, arc-welding and fan-load power supplies. Both converters {{are capable of}} very high switching frequency {{over a wide range}} of output power, with high efficiency and the presentation of near-unity power factor to the <b>primary</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Previous work, by the author and his colleagues, has produced. a frequency-domain approach to produce circuit-designs for use in load-resonant converter applications. This design technique, although simple and straight-forward to understand, suffers by requiring some rather tedious trial-and-error algebraic and arithmetic manipulations albeit computer assisted. In this thesis, a systematic way of designing such circuits, based on Gr 6 bner Basis ideas, is explained, developed and compared with the previous best-practice design method. By employing the Gr 6 bner Basis techniques to synthesize electrical circuits, an entirely novel approach to the design of series-parallel load-resonant converter circuits is presented. This has led to the formulation of a new output-power control methodology {{in the design of the}} converters. These techniques produce output-power-control designs that have superior properties, compared with other established methods, in the sense of their simplicity, robustness and flexibility. It is found that the methodology can be further extended to alter any resonant circuits and, hence enables multilevel-output power to be controlled without involving complex control and advanced mathematical theories, while still preserving the desirable characteristics of resonant switching. The technique is, in fact, far more generally useful in the circuit-design/synthesis arena than the specific load-resonant-converter application for which it was developed. The novel technique used to vary the speed of an induction motor is found to be promising. Various test results are presented based on an experimental system...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{designing}} an electric power supply system for an aircraft, parameters like low weight and low losses are important. Reliability, robustness and low cost are other important factors. In the Saab Gripen aircraft, {{the design of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> of the electric flight control system was updated by exchanging a switching transistor regulator to a magnetic amplifier (magamp). By introducing a magamp design, weight was saved and a more reliable power supply system at a lower cost was achieved. In this particular case, with the power supply of the electric flight control system in the Saab Gripen fighter, advantage could be taken of a specific permanent magnet generator (PM-generator). The frequency of the generator offered the perfect conditions for a magamp controller. A key parameter in designing magnetic amplifiers (magamps) is low losses. New amorphous alloys offer new possibilities of the technique in designing magnetic amplifiers, because of their extremely low losses. The core losses are evaluated by studying the equations and diagrams specifying the power losses.

Evaluations of the hysteresis characteristics for the magnetic alloys, as well as modeling and simulation of the core losses, are presented in this work.
