5000|$|Some Diesel-powered cars can {{run with}} minor {{modifications}} on 100% pure vegetable oils. Vegetable oils tend to thicken (or solidify {{if it is}} waste cooking oil), in cold weather conditions so vehicle modifications (a two tank system with diesel start/stop tank), are essential in order to heat the fuel prior to use under most circumstances. Heating to the temperature of engine coolant reduces fuel viscosity, to the range cited by injection system manufacturers, for systems prior to 'common rail' or 'unit injection ( [...] VW PD)' systems. Waste vegetable oil, especially if {{it has been used}} for a long time, may become hydrogenated and have increased acidity. This can cause the thickening of fuel, gumming in the engine and acid damage of the fuel system. Biodiesel does not have this problem, because it is chemically processed to be PH neutral and lower viscosity. Modern low emission diesels (most often Euro -3 and -4 compliant), typical of the current production in the European industry, would require extensive modification of injector system, pumps and seals etc. due to the higher operating pressures, that are designed thinner (heated) mineral diesel than ever before, for atomisation, if they were to use <b>pure</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> as fuel. Vegetable oil fuel is not suitable for these vehicles as they are currently produced. This reduces the market as increasing numbers of new vehicles are not able to use it. However, the German Elsbett company has successfully produced single tank vegetable oil fuel systems for several decades, and has worked with Volkswagen on their TDI engines. This shows that it is technologically possible to use vegetable oil as a fuel in high efficiency / low emission diesel engines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{major part}} of all energy {{consumed}} worldwide comes from fossil sources. However these sources are limited and will be exhausted by the near future. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> have become more attractive because of its environmental benefits. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> are a renewable and potentially inexhaustible source of energy with an energetic content close to diesel fuel. The major problem {{associated with the use}} of <b>pure</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> as fuels for diesel engines are caused by high fuel viscosity in compression ignition engine. These problems can be minimized by the process of transesterification. In the present work experiments are conducted on D I diesel engine with tangential grooved piston, using jatropha methyl ester blends.

50|$|The engine, {{because it}} is {{indirect}} injection, with a slower combustion burn time than direct injection, is suitable to run on SVO (<b>pure</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil).</b> A feature of the Ricardo Comet pre-chamber design {{is that it makes}} the engine tolerant of low Cetane value fuels such as SVO. The viscosity of vegetable oil when cold is too great for rotary injection pumps, (in particular the weaker Lucas CAV pump, the Bosch VE fuel pump is superior), preventing it from acting as a lubricant and increasing the workload on the distributor/rotary injection pump and damaging it. The Lucas EPIC pump fitted to the 2.1 L 12 valve turbodiesel engine after 1995 is the weakest pump of all. Different fresh vegetable oils have different viscosities: thinnest are; sunflower, rapeseed (often only labelled vegetable oil, but with pictures of distinctive yellow flowers), then soya and corn oil, but palm oil (may be only marked vegetable oil) is thickest and may be solid at room temperature. Vegetable oils thicken when used for cooking, so used oils can be much thicker than any fresh oil, they may even solidify at room temperature. It is necessary for used oil to be very well filtered (ideally cold filtered to 1 micron), to avoid filter plugging and/or injection pump damage. Heavily used oil may be highly acidic and corrode the inside of the injection pump. Such oil can only be used as fuel without the risk of damage, if it has been chemically processed into bio-diesel. The open market price for used oil is often quite close to special offer supermarket prices for new oil, which can be used straight away. In order to reduce the viscosity of the SVO, it should be heated to engine coolant operating temperature, typically with a two tank system, in order to start and shutdown on diesel or bio-diesel. Versions of this engine from the early '90s onward, are typically fitted with a Peugeot-type coolant heated fuel filter that helps heat fuel and reduce viscosity. Fuel / engine coolant heat exchangers, usually required for straight vegetable oil conversions, are still needed for long term life expectancy, or there will be accelerated wear of the fuel injection pump. Heated vegetable oil is a good injection pump lubricant. This is especially important in cold weather ambient temperatures. Mixing with major oil company brand diesel, (which in winter is thinner and contains anti-waxing winterising agents) to thin the vegetable oil fuel, choosing a thin vegetable oil, winterising additive, or electric heating, or a combination of these are helpful especially when starting and warming up, as coolant heating will not yet be at operating temperature. The difference between the use of good quality fuel and supermarket diesel, in a diesel / vegetable oil fuel mix, will be very noticeable, especially at lower temperatures. The fuel systems used on this engine return heated fuel to the fuel tank. Running with half a tank of fuel instead of fully filling up, will allow the tank to be heated more effectively by this warmed fuel in low ambient temperatures. Due to different calorific values some oils will give less mpg and some more.|$|E

RESULTS A low-temperature mixed ionic liquid system with dual extraction and catalytic functions for the conversion of waste oils containing high levels of free fatty acids to biodiesel was successfully trialled. The solvent, a totally miscible system of HPyrBr and the Brønsted acid, SPyrHSO 4, allows the key properties of each ionic liquid, as extractant or catalyst, to work uninhibited {{by the presence of}} the other.

The objective of this research project is to produce advanced multipurpose, continuous microwave biofuelslchemical reactors to utilise waste <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> The heat transfer efficiency of the reactor was studied using <b>pure</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> to establish the reactor design, operating temperatures and controls necessary to produce First Generation biodiesel by advanced microwave technology. Water modelling was used to scale up the reactors from 200 W to 1. 2 kW and then subsequently to 2 kW. Once the initial continuous reactor was optimised, the work was repeated using various grades of waste cooking oils provided by Longma Clean Energy Ltd. In order to achieve the required conversion to give 96. 5 % methyl esters, these oils needed larger quantities of both catalyst and methanol to reduce the viscosity of the crude oil. The system was then modified to carry out microwave assisted methanol extraction of free fatty acids, {{with the addition of}} a decanter to allow continuous phase separation. This process produced no glycerol, was energy efficient and the free fatty acids that were removed, were recovered in the methanol distillation unit. In the future, the waste frictional heat from the diesel engine could be used to grow algae, the waste heat from the exhaust gases could be used to heat the distillation unit and the carbon dioxide could be biofixated by microalgae. An industrial prototype 1. 2 kW microwave de-acidification unit has now been built at the Longma Clean Energy site at Hereford. There is a surplus of poor quality biodiesel glycerol that is currently regarded as a waste product. The novel continuous microwave unit which was developed from the biodiesel reactor has been used to acetyl ate the glycerol with acetone at below 50 °C to produce acetals for use as fuel additives. An atmospheric/vacuum fractional distillation column will be required to recover the methanol or acetone and to distil the acetal from the unreacted glycerol, which is then recycled. The technology developed can utilise any waste cooking oils, acidic seed oils or fats as biofuels for combined heat and power generation or to convert them to biodiesel fuels.
