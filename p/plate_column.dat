50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>column</b> (or tray column) is a {{chemical}} equipment {{used to carry}} out unit operations where {{it is necessary to}} transfer mass between a liquid phase and a gas phase. In other words, it is a particular gas-liquid contactor. The peculiarity of this gas-liquid contactor is that the gas comes in contact with liquid through different stages; each stage is delimited by two plates (except the stage {{at the top of the}} column and the stage at the bottom of the column).|$|E
50|$|Some common {{applications}} of <b>plate</b> <b>columns</b> are distillation, gas-liquid absorption and liquid-liquid extraction. In general, <b>plate</b> <b>columns</b> {{are suitable for}} both continuous and batch operations.|$|R

50|$|In general, unit {{operations}} are designed by writing down the balances for the transported quantity for each elementary component (which may be infinitesimal) {{in the form}} of equations, and solving the equations for the design parameters, then selecting an optimal solution out of the several possible and then designing the physical equipment. For instance, distillation in a <b>plate</b> <b>column</b> is analyzed by writing down the mass balances for each plate, wherein the known vapor-liquid equilibrium and efficiency, drip out and drip in comprise the total mass flows, with a sub-flow for each component. Combining a stack of these gives the system of equations for the whole column. There is a range of solutions, because a higher reflux ratio enables fewer plates, and vice versa. The engineer must then find the optimal solution with respect to acceptable volume holdup, column height and cost of construction.|$|E

40|$|Although the non-agitated {{extraction}} columns (spray column, packed column, perforated <b>plate</b> <b>column,</b> sieve <b>plate</b> <b>column,</b> etc) {{can handle}} high flow rates and are simple and cheap, {{there have been}} relatively few applications of these columns because they suffer from serious backmixing of the continuous phase. It was shown that the backmixing is reduced when the spray column is operated with dense packing of drops. Another way of increasing the efficiency of a non-agitated extraction column is to introduce an inert gas (air, nitrogen, oxygen) as a mixing agent in the two-phase liquid-liquid (L-L) system. This method of energy introduction increases the turbulence within the new three-phase gas-liquid-liquid (G-L-L) system, which causes an improved dispersion of droplets, and, consequently, a higher dispersed phase holdup and therefore a great mass transfer area. The present study reports the hydrodynamics in the non-agitated extraction columns, {{as well as the}} axial dispersion for the two- and three-phase systems...|$|E

40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} for improving seismic resisting performance of steel columns representing highway bridge piers. One such attractive method is to use linearly tapered steel plates at the critical part of a column because it is economical in terms of steel usage and useful in improving seismic resisting performance. In this study, several important {{issues related to the}} comparison of tapered <b>plate</b> <b>columns</b> with equivalent constant thickness <b>plate</b> <b>columns</b> are discussed in view of economical and seismic performance aspects. For comparison purposes an equivalent section is chosen for tapered section by using several constant thickness plate sections which satisfy a given design conditions.

40|$|Multiparameter {{radar and}} {{polarized}} microwave radiative transfer models for arbitrarily shaped particles are developed. The ice crystals modeled are horizontally oriented hexagonal <b>plates,</b> <b>columns,</b> and needles. The ice water content is fixed at 0. 1 g/cu m, and a realistic size distribution is used. The radar modeling {{is done for}} S through K-band, and the passive microwave calculations are at 37, 85, and 157 GHz. The modeling results show that particle shape is important for both multiparameter radar and passive microwave radiometry. Radar reflectivity and upwelling microwave brightness temperatures depend strongly on the individual particle volume, which in turn depends on the ice crystal shape. Radar differential reflectivity is high for the plates and lower for needles and columns. Linear depolarization calculations indicate that oblate ice crystals such as plates can be distinguished from prolate crystals such as columns.
