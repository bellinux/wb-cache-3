AdditIonalKeyphraees:electrolytes reference interval ti-trimetry compared lactatemeasurement measurementof anions by “vacancy ’ chromatography. pediatric hemistry Sweat chloride measurements are widely used in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). The most generally used test, the piocarpine iontophoresis sweat test, was intro-duced by Gibson and Cooke (1) in 1959. Chloride concentra-tions in sweat that exceed 60 to 70 mmol/L are considered diagnostic for CF (2, 3). The current investigation was undertaken in an effort to apply to the analysis of sweat the newly described technique of “vacancy ” chromatography on a liquid chromatograph equipped with an anion-exchange column. Vacancy chromatography involves equilibrating the column with a buffer, such as <b>potassium</b> <b>phthalate,</b> that absorbs light in the ultraviolet range. When <b>potassium</b> <b>phthalate</b> buffer is used as the eluent buffer with an anion exchange column, A decreases when anions are eluted from the column. Here, we define the retention times for various anions on this column and demonstrate that the chloride concentra-tion in sweat can be accurately measured by this technique.
