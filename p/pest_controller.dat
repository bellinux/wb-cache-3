40|$|BACKGROUND: Rodenticide {{resistance}} to anticoagulants in Rattus norvegicus {{will lead to}} increased difficulties in combating these pest animals. Here, the authors present {{the results of a}} survey in the Netherlands where tissue samples and droppings were tested using a newly developed TaqMan PCR test for genotypic variation at codon 139 in the Vkorc 1 gene associated with anticoagulant rodenticide resistance. Test results are linked to results of a questionnaire that was conducted among <b>pest</b> <b>controllers.</b> RESULTS: Genetic mutations at codon 139 of the Vkorc 1 gene in R. norvegicus can be encountered {{in many parts of the}} Netherlands. In 34 / 61 rat tails, a genotypewas found that is linked to anticoagulant rodenticide resistance (56 %). In droppings, 42 / 169 samples (25 %) showed a resistance-mediating genotype. In addition, indications of a clear genetic substructure in the Netherlands were found. In some regions, only resistance-mediating genotypes were found, corroborating results from the questionnaire in which <b>pest</b> <b>controllers</b> indicated they suspected {{resistance to}} anticoagulant rodenticides.

2500|$|Unlike most {{birds of}} prey, the {{secretary}} bird is largely terrestrial, hunting its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as loose familial flocks, stalking through the habitat with long strides.

Larger herbivores are not generally hunted, although there are some reports of secretary birds killing young gazelles and cheetah cubs. The importance of snakes in the diet has been exaggerated in the past, although they can be locally important and venomous species such as adders and cobras are regularly among the types of snake preyed upon.Secretarybirds are kept as <b>pest</b> <b>controllers</b> by farmers to rid of snakes.|$|R
40|$|Grapevine leafroll {{disease in}} New Zealand is {{predominantly}} {{caused by the}} ampelovirus GLRaV- 3, which is vectored between vines by up to three species of mealybugs (Pseudococcus spp.). However, global understanding of the transmission and spread of GLRaV- 3 remains limited, and does not definitively show how to successfully manage the disease in New Zealand. The disease is a manifestation of a complex relationship between the virus, vine and vectors, each component of which is interdependent on the other two. The review suggests that {{a full understanding of}} the disease will require research and operational input from plant virologists, entomologists, vine physiologists, <b>pest</b> <b>controllers,</b> vineyard managers, grapevine breeders/improvers and winemakers. Such a wide range of expertise should ensure that the factors behind the spread of the disease over time (its epidemiology) are accurately determined, and that effective management solutions are delivered over the course of decades...|$|R

5000|$|She {{returns to}} her house, {{attempting}} {{to return to her}} normal life. Whilst summoning the cats, she receives an angry complaint from a neighbour, who threatens to call pest control. After this, she meets Mitzi, a young, homeless woman willing to be her new roommate. She had lied about being Susan's daughter merely to save her life. When Susan sees the Queen of Maggots behind Mitzi, she realises she is close to death, leading Mitzi to reveal she has cancer. Susan learns that Mitzi had a boyfriend named Jack who was driven to insanity upon learning of her cancer. He stumbled upon a suicide forum online, in which a troll called the [...] "Eye of Adam" [...] lured people to kill themselves using a mixture of two household chemicals. Jack has attempted to persuade her into it, though Mitzi had refused, leaving Jack to kill himself. Mitzi insists that she just wants to find the person, who is in the flat, to [...] "talk" [...] with them before she dies. Soon after, Susan investigates outside after hearing the cats howling outside, only to be kidnapped by the <b>pest</b> <b>controller.</b> Susan awakes in the pest controllers' house, tied to a table. The man reveals he is sexually attracted to Susan, and had previously sought after other women, though his wife then interrupts and pours bleach over Susan's face. The <b>pest</b> <b>controller,</b> seeing Susan so bloodied, loses interest in her and abandons her with a gun, unaware of Susan's immortality. Susan awakes and finds the house littered with cat and human meat. She unsuccessfully calls the police and then Mitzi, asking for the chemical combination used by Jack, and uses this to murder the couple.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Based on the {{implementation}} of a most stringent IPM-concept especially tailored for US Military Communities in Europe between 1986 - 88, guidelines for non-agricultural IPM were developed for the German Government. The implementation was partwise very successful. Selected experiences and observations with {{the implementation}} and suggested consequences are being presented: The major challenge is the successful transfer of information and products to those who need it in a way they can use it. Communication and coordination must be adapted in many respects to make an IPM implementation successful. Other observations concern motivation, proper use & useful properties of entomologists, lag times between introduction and implementation, pest related variations in human behavior, and 'pest' problems beyond the reach of a <b>pest</b> <b>controller.</b> The risk-use-assessment of IPM techniques must be looked at interdisciplinary, and it should include e. g. food hygiene, psychology, communication techniques, stress, toxicologic familiarity, repellency, and resistance potential...|$|E
50|$|Like any fast-running spider, the Agelenidae possess good vision, and are {{generally}} photosensitive (i.e. react {{to changes in}} the light), so they can successfully retreat upon perceiving a larger threat's shadow approaching. Some are also sensitive to wind blows, and can retreat before the prey even spots them. Males are less successful ambushers than females, so prefer to roam around and wander to new areas, rather than stay in one single web the whole time. In September, males of outdoors species (such as Agelenopsis and Agelena) can seek refuge within houses, usually nesting on or underneath outer windowsills, or also around the porch door. These spiders often are neither <b>pest</b> <b>controllers</b> nor <b>pests</b> themselves; they are very selective in their prey, and do not consume large quantities; also, they are immune to intimidation and come back to their webs even after being disturbed, unless they are completely destroyed.|$|R
5|$|Redback spiders {{are also}} found in small colonies in areas of New Zealand. They are {{frequently}} intercepted by quarantine authorities, often among steel or car shipments. They were introduced into New Zealand in the early 1980s and now are found around Central Otago (including Alexandra, Bannockburn and near Wanaka) in the South Island and New Plymouth in the North Island. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates warn residents and visitors of redback spiders, which have been present since 1990. Colonies have also been established in greenhouses in Belgium, and isolated observations indicate possible presence in New Guinea, the Philippines, and India. Some redbacks were found in Preston, Lancashire, England, after a container of parts arrived from Australia; some may have escaped into the countryside before <b>pest</b> <b>controllers</b> could destroy them. One redback {{was found in a}} back garden in Dartford in Kent. Two females were discovered in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Fipronil is an {{insecticide}} {{belonging to}} a class known as phenylpyrazoles. It was rarely used in California ten years ago, but is now emerging as an insecticide commonly used by professional <b>pest</b> <b>controllers.</b> Unlike many other insecticides, the compound is not registered in California for any agriculture use. It is used nearly entirely for structural pest control and landscape maintenance, and thus its presence in surface waters {{would be expected to}} be of urban origin. While originally used for termite control, several years ago it was approved for treatment of ants, an above-ground application that would make residues susceptible to off-site movement to surface waters. Fipronil can be quite toxic to aquatic life, with LC 50 s to many aquatic invertebrates in the low µg/L, and the most sensitive reported being the mysid shrimp with an acute EC 50 of 140 ng/L and full life-cycle effects on survival reproduction and growth at less than 5 ng/L (EPA, 1996). However, what makes ecotoxicology of the compound so challenging is that fipronil has a variety of environmental degradates. The major photodegradation product is fipronil desulfinyl. Oxidation creates fipronil sulfone, reductive processes produce fipronil sulfide, and hydrolysis yields fipronil amide. Man...|$|R
