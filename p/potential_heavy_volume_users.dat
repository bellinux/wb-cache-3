50|$|Plastic {{spiral binding}} is a three-step process: punch, insert, crimp. First, a punch creates holes {{along the edge}} of the document. Second, a coil {{inserter}} spins the coils through the holes. Third, a pair of coil crimping pliers or a crimping machine is used to cut off the excess coil and crimp the end to prevent the coil from coming loose from the document. There are also more automated systems that will insert and cut and crimp the coil in one process and even some fully automated systems that will punch, insert, and crimp for the very high <b>volume</b> <b>users.</b> Light <b>volume</b> or personal <b>users</b> may choose to buy a single machine that does all of these features or may even choose to spin the coils onto their books by hand. Higher <b>volume</b> <b>users</b> will often choose to separate these three functions to help increase productivity.|$|R

40|$|Background: Not much {{is known}} about how much {{geographical}} units matter for heavy alcohol consumption {{and how much of}} the geographical variations are explained by characteristics such as institutional alcohol policies and regional economic conditions. The study aim was to address these gaps considering three types of heavy alcohol consumption. Methods: Analyses were based on data collected on 5879 men (age: 20. 0 years, standard deviation: 1. 2) years participating in the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors in Switzerland. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess overall prevalence, geographical variations in prevalence across geographical units (institutional units, economic micro regions, linguistic regions, urban/rural status), and explanatory variables in three different types of heavy alcohol consumption (heavy weekend drinking, heavy workweek drinking, <b>heavy</b> <b>volume</b> drinking). Results: The overall prevalence for heavy weekend drinking was 46. 8 %, 10. 8 % for <b>heavy</b> <b>volume</b> drinking and 3. 6 % for heavy workweek drinking. The extent and locations of geographical variation in prevalence rates were contingent upon the type of alcohol consumption. Institutional alcohol policies explained substantial geographical variations in heavy weekend drinking, but not in heavy workweek or <b>heavy</b> <b>volume</b> drinking. Regional economic conditions were not related to alcohol consumption. Conclusions: Different types of heavy alcohol consumption are determined by different geographical units. Alcohol policies protectively impact the major drinking style of heavy weekend drinking, but not other low prevalence forms of heavy drinking. Research and public health efforts must take into account these differences between types of alcohol consumption...|$|R
