5|$|The {{ship was}} the third in the Royal Mail Lines fleet to carry the name Magdalena, she was built {{to serve on the}} Tilbury – Cherbourg – Vigo – Lisbon – Las Palmas – Pernambuco – Bahia – Rio de Janeiro – Santos – Montevideo – Buenos Aires route. She was {{launched}} on 11 May 1948. Her passenger certificate was issued on 18 February 1949. Her <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> was London.

50|$|After the {{issuance}} of captured British orders, all merchant vessels were directed to paint over their names and <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> and to fly under the flag of a neutral nation. They were instructed not to stop when challenged by a submarine but instead to open fire at once or, if unarmed, to attempt to ram the sub. In response, German orders came from Kaiser Wilhelm who declared that as of February 18, 1915, the waters surrounding England, including the Channel, were a war zone. Any merchant ship found in that zone would be immediately destroyed without first determining if the ship were neutral.|$|R
50|$|Before {{these ships}} were mass-produced, the main way {{to board a}} larger ship (mainly ocean liners) was to board a {{passenger}} tender. Passenger tenders remained based at their <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry,</b> and when a ship came through the area, the tender would tie up with the ship and embark passengers on an elevated walkway. These vessels were larger, had a greater passenger capacity, and a broader sense of individuality in their respective companies than the more modern tenders seen today. Because of their increased size, lifeboats and life preservers were commonplace on board these ships (with two boats being the standard amount for an average tender).|$|R
5000|$|The year {{began with}} a {{significant}} loss for the company - {{the closure of the}} Venice route. The fate of the ships that operated on this line remained uncertain until the end of July 2012, when Europa Palace joined Cruise Europa and Cruise Olympia on the Ancona route. Meanwhile, Olympia Palace was laid up in Perama. Despite the rumored reopening of the Piraeus - Chania route, both ships were then chartered to CIN, owner of the recently privatized Tirrenia di Navigazione, and used on the Cagliari - Arbatax - Civitavecchia route. Europe Palace was renamed Amsicora, and [...] "Olympia Palace" [...] became Bonaria. Both ships underwent a partial refit at Messina, and changed their <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> from Heraklion to Cagliari, and their flags from Greek to Italian.|$|R
5|$|Alster was {{launched}} on 5 January 1928, and completed on 25 February 1928. She {{was built for}} Norddeutscher Lloyd. The Code Letters QMHG were allocated and her <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> was Bremen. She served on routes between Germany and Australia and East Asia. Lloyds Register entries show that she held a passenger certificate from 1934–40. With the change in Code Letters in 1934, Alster was allocated DOEO as her callsign. She had a crew of 69 and could initially take 14 passengers. In 1930 the passenger capacity was increased to 16.|$|E

She was built {{under the auspices of}} Wartime Merchant Shipping Ltd., a Canadian {{government}} corporation coordinating wartime shipbuilding in Canada, and on completion on 31 July 1942 delivered by that corporation to the United States War Shipping Administration (WSA) which then delivered the ship to the Ministry of War Transport under Lend Lease at Vancouver, British Columbia on the same date. Ownership was retained by WSA with the Ministry of War Transport placing her under the management of the Port Line. The United Kingdom Official Number 168351 and Code Letters BKLG were allocated.

5|$|In 1937, Astrid (then {{known as}} W.U.T.A.) {{was sold to}} Swede J. Jeppson and renamed Astrid. Her <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> was changed to Skillinge and the Code Letters SLEK were allocated. By this time, she had been derigged and was {{operating}} on her engine alone. Astrid was used on trade routes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea until 1975. Astrid then sailed under a Lebanese flag. She was allegedly used for drug smuggling, and was being shadowed in the English Channel by HM Customs and Excise when she mysteriously caught fire. Astrid was found abandoned and burnt to a shell {{off the coast of}} England in the early 1980s by Graham Neilson.|$|E
5000|$|A ship {{registered}} {{in any country}} within the Red Ensign group is entitled to fly the Red Ensign, or it can choose to fly the Red Ensign defaced with its home port national colors.

5000|$|Some Caribbean islands take {{advantage}} of flag of convenience policies followed by foreign merchant fleets, registering the ships in Caribbean <b>ports.</b> The <b>registry</b> <b>of</b> ships at [...] "flag <b>of</b> convenience" [...] <b>ports</b> is protected by the Law of the Sea and other international treaties. These treaties leave the enforcement of labour, tax, health and safety, and environmental laws under the control <b>of</b> the <b>registry,</b> or [...] "flag" [...] country, which in practical terms means that such regulations seldom result in penalties against the merchant ship. The Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Antigua, Bermuda and St. Vincent are among the top 11 flags of convenience in the world. However, the flag of convenience practice has been a disadvantage to Caribbean islands as well, since it also applies to cruise ships, which register outside the Caribbean and thus can evade Caribbean enforcement of the same territorial laws and regulations.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, all wrecks {{became the}} sole {{responsibility}} of the Receiver of Wrecks and Droits {{and it was his}} prerogative to dispose of a wreck, and its cargo, by auction, or any other suitable means. By this time, all ships from the Pembrey area were registered with the Register of British Ships at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Llanelli, and each ship was issued with a certificate <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> and details <b>of</b> the vessel were entered in the Register.|$|R
5|$|Alster {{was passed}} to the MoWT and renamed Empire Endurance. The United Kingdom Official Number 164841 and Code Letters GMJJ were allocated. Her <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> was Middlesbrough. She was placed under the {{management}} of the Booth Steamship Co Ltd. Empire Endurance was a member of Convoy FN 255, which departed from Southend, Essex on 17 August and arrived at Methil, Fife two days later. She then joined Convoy OA 202, which departed on 21 August and dispersed at sea on 25 August. Her destination was Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where she arrived on 3 September. Empire Endurance sailed on 12 September for Sydney, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, arriving three days later. She then joined Convoy HX 74, which departed from Halifax, Nova Scotia on 17 September and arrived at Liverpool, Lancashire, United Kingdom on 2 October. She was carrying general cargo stated to be bound for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northumberland. She left the convoy at the Clyde on 2 October.|$|E
5|$|Centaur was {{allocated}} the United Kingdom Official Number 147275 and the Code Letters KHHC. Her <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> was Liverpool. When Centaur entered {{service at}} the end of 1924, the Fremantle–Java– Singapore trade route was being serviced by two other Blue Funnel Line vessels; Gorgon (which remained in service until 1928) and Charon (which Centaur was replacing). Centaurs route ran from Fremantle up the Western Australian coast calling at Geraldton, Carnarvon, Onslow, Point Samson, Port Hedland, Broome, and Derby then to the Bali Strait, Surabaya, Semarang, Batavia, and Singapore. Centaur operated as a cross between a tramp steamer and a freight liner; she travelled a set route, but stops at ports along the route varied between journeys. From 1928 until sometime in the 1930s, Centaur remained alone on her route, but the increase in trade along this route prompted Blue Funnel Line to reassign Gorgon and assign the new Charon to work alongside Centaur.|$|E
