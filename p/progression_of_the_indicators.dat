40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this {{research}} was to identify world-class apprenticeship standards and to make suggestions as to how these {{could be applied to}} the English system. By ‘world class’ we mean that the standards described here are acknowledged to be among the best in <b>the</b> world. Thirteen <b>indicators</b> for world-class apprenticeship standards were identified through the research and these have been divided into four sub-sections: (1) training, (2) skills and expertise, (3) recognition and (4) <b>progression.</b> Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>indicators</b> is explained separately in this report but they have to be understood as being in close relationship to each other. As well as identifying world-class apprenticeship standards <b>the</b> <b>indicators</b> are also designed to compare these standards to apprenticeship standards that are of a good level but do not necessarily feature amongst the best in the world. Identifying and applying standards in apprenticeships is important because apprenticeship training, especially if delivered at a world-class standard, can raise <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> people in employment, increase individual and company productivity and enhance economic growth. The findings from our research suggest that world-class apprenticeship standards require: •	extended apprenticeships of between three to four years; •	broad and in-depth scientific and industrial skills and knowledge; •	<b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a ‘master’ in the company to train an apprentice; •	high-quality knowledge-based education and training; •	recognition through an occupational title on completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> training; •	apprentices to acquire all the skills and knowledge necessary to work effectively in an occupation; •	apprentices to become skilled workers in an occupational area with a critical and creative approach; and •	progression routes into employment as well as into further education and training. This report is based on interviews with seven experts from Australia, Denmark, England, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Korea on vocational education and training with a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} utilizes {{a longitudinal}} methodology {{to study the}} entrepreneurial learning strategies of a representative sample (n= 173) of nascent entrepreneurs in Sweden. We examine Sarasvathy’s theory of effectuation with respect to six different learning strategies and their effect on <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> start-up processes. <b>The</b> results show that <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> start-up process, as represented by <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> gestation activities undertaken during each time period, is systematically related to the nascent entrepreneur’s learning strategy. The analysis covers 24 months, and findings indicate that learning strategies associated with effectuation processes have positive effects on <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> start-up process. We also found positive effects from persistent learning strategies in <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> start up process...|$|R
