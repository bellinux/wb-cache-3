5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, <b>phthisis</b> miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Girolamo Fracastoro {{became the}} first person to propose, in his work De contagione, that <b>phthisis</b> was {{transmitted}} by an invisible virus. Among his assertions were that the virus could survive between two or three years on the clothes of those suffering from the disease and that it was usually transmitted through direct contact or the discharged fluids of the infected, what he called fomes. He noted that <b>phthisis</b> could be contracted without either direct contact or fomes, but was unsure of the process by which the disease propagated across distances.|$|E

It is a type of pneumoconiosis.|$|E
25|$|Hippocrates, in Book 1 of his Of the Epidemics, {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} the disease: fever, colorless urine, cough resulting in a thick sputa, and loss of thirst and appetite. He notes that most of the sufferers became delirious before they succumbed to the disease. Hippocrates and many other at the time believed <b>phthisis</b> to be hereditary in nature. Aristotle disagreed, believing the disease was contagious.|$|E
25|$|In 1720, Benjamin Marten {{proposed}} in A New Theory of Consumptions more Especially of <b>Phthisis</b> or Consumption of the Lungs {{that the cause}} of tuberculosis was some type of animacula—microscopic living beings that are able to survive in a new body (similar to the ones described by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1695). The theory was roundly rejected and it took another 162 years before Robert Koch demonstrated it to be true.|$|E
25|$|The first Christian missionary, Eugène Eyraud, {{arrived in}} January 1864 and {{spent most of}} that year on the island; but mass {{conversion}} of the Rapa Nui only came after his return in 1866 with Father Hippolyte Roussel and shortly after two others arrived with Captain Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier. Eyraud was suffering from <b>phthisis</b> (tuberculosis) when he returned and in 1867, tuberculosis raged over the island, taking a quarter of the island's remaining population of 1,200 including the last member of the island's royal family, the 13-year-old Manu Rangi. Eyraud died of tuberculosis in August 1868, by which time the entire Rapa Nui population had become Roman Catholic.|$|E
25|$|Consumption, <b>phthisis,</b> scrofula, Pott's disease, and the White Plague are all terms used {{to refer}} to {{tuberculosis}} throughout history. It is generally accepted that Mycobacterium tuberculosis originated from other, more primitive organisms of the same genus Mycobacterium. In 2014, results of a new DNA study of a tuberculosis genome reconstructed from remains in southern Peru suggest that human tuberculosis is less than 6,000 years old. Even if researchers theorize that humans first acquired it in Africa about 5,000 years ago, {{there is no evidence that}} the first tuberculosis infection happened about 9,000 years ago. It spread to other humans along trade routes. It also spread to domesticated animals in Africa, such as goats and cows. Seals and sea lions that bred on African beaches are believed to have acquired the disease and carried it across the Atlantic to South America. Hunters would have been the first humans to contract the disease there.|$|E
500|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} known by many names from the {{technical}} to the familiar. <b>Phthisis</b> (Φθισις) is a Greek word for consumption, an old term for pulmonary tuberculosis; around 460 BCE, Hippocrates described <b>phthisis</b> as a disease of dry seasons. The abbreviation [...] "TB" [...] is short for tubercle bacillus. [...] "Consumption" [...] {{was the most common}} nineteenth century English word for the disease. The Latin root [...] "con" [...] meaning [...] "completely" [...] is linked to [...] "sumere" [...] meaning [...] "to take up from under." [...] In The Life and Death of Mr. Badman by John Bunyan, the author calls consumption [...] "the captain of all these men of death." [...] "Great white plague" [...] has also been used.|$|E
2500|$|Laennec's work put him {{in contact}} with the vanguard of the French medical establishment, {{including}} Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis. Louis would go on to use statistical methods to evaluate the different aspects of the disease's progression, the efficacy of various therapies and individuals' susceptibility, publishing an article in the Annales d'hygiène publique entitled [...] "Note on the Relative Frequency of <b>Phthisis</b> in the Two Sexes". Another good friend and co-worker of Laennec, Gaspard Laurent Bayle, published an article in 1810 entitled Recherches sur la Pthisie Pulmonaire, in which he divided pthisis into six types: tubercular <b>phthisis,</b> glandular <b>phthisis,</b> ulcerous <b>phthisis,</b> <b>phthisis</b> with melanosis, calculous <b>phthisis,</b> and cancerous <b>phthisis.</b> He based his findings on more than 900 autopsies.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about its frequency before the 19th century, its incidence is thought to have peaked between the end of the 18th century {{and the end of the}} 19th century. Over time, the various cultures of the world gave the illness different names: <b>phthisis</b> (Greek), consumptione (Latin), yaksma (India), and chaky oncay (Incan), each of which make reference to the [...] "drying" [...] or [...] "consuming" [...] affect of the illness, cachexia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{implication}} is that Kaminsky's syphilis was not cured in May 1888 but in remission, {{and he began to}} kill prostitutes as an act of revenge because it had affected his brain. However, Cohen's death certificate makes no mention of syphilis but gives the cause of death as [...] "exhaustion of mania" [...] with <b>phthisis,</b> a then prevalent form of pulmonary tuberculosis, as the secondary cause. Kaminsky might have died as an [...] "unknown" [...] as hundreds of people did each year in the late 19th century. That would account for Fido's inability to find a record of his death in England and Wales during the probable period of his life.|$|E

These progressions include the formation of cataracts, deterioration of the iris with adhesions forming between the iris and the lens or the cornea, and shallowing of the anterior chamber which may increase intraocular pressure, causing eye pain. As the situation worsens, there is corneal opacification, where the cornea becomes opaque, and band keratopathy. Intraocular pressure is lost and the globe shrinks.

2500|$|Franciscus Sylvius began {{differentiating}} {{between the}} various forms of tuberculosis (pulmonary, ganglion). He {{was the first person to}} recognize that the skin ulcers caused by scrofula resembled tubercles seen in <b>phthisis,</b> noting that [...] "phthisis is the scrofula of the lung" [...] in his book Opera Medica, published posthumously in 1679. Around the same time, Thomas Willis concluded that all diseases of the chest must ultimately lead to consumption. Willis did not know the exact cause of the disease but he blamed it on sugar or an acidity of the blood. Richard Morton published Phthisiologia, seu exercitationes de Phthisi tribus libris comprehensae in 1689, in which he emphasized the tubercle as the true cause of the disease. So common was the disease at the time that Morton is quoted as saying [...] "I cannot sufficiently admire that anyone, at least after he comes to the flower of his youth, can [...] dye without a touch of consumption." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1889 Urrea had a serious illness and began to {{experience}} religious visions. [...] When she recovered she believed she had been given healing powers by the Virgin Mary, and she soon gained a following when 1200 people camped nearby to seek healing and observe miracles. [...] Indigenous people began to call her [...] "The Saint of Cabora". [...] She drew criticism from church officials for giving informal sermons in which she drew attention to clerical abuses. [...] It {{was reported in the}} church that she was [...] "always friendly with the sick, especially with the poor, without ever getting angry, demonstrating an exemplary humility. A heroic, she is without rest from dawn until sometimes late at night, and caters patiently and personally with the angry, touching with her hands the most nasty sores, making her bed alongside some patients who suffered from infectious diseases such as <b>phthisis,</b> lazarinos , and others."

2500|$|In 1869, the Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, Thomas Anderson, {{fell ill}} (left for Europe {{and died in}} 1870) and in 1871, the Secretary of State for India {{selected}} King as a successor. King took up the position and was also a Professor of Botany in the Medical College of Bengal. King was faced by the destruction wrought by two cyclones in 1864 and 1867. King was also involved in matters associated with tea and cinchona cultivation. While on an official visit to the Nilgiris in July 1872, he developed symptoms of pulmonary <b>phthisis.</b> He was treated in Coonoor before moving to Europe. He {{spent a year in}} the Riviera and returned to Calcutta to resume duties in November 1873. King restructured the Calcutta Botanical Gardens, raising the level of the ground, creating ponds and laying out footpaths and conservatories. A fireproof herbarium was also constructed based on plans from Kew. King also altered the garden design from one segregated linearly on the basis of taxonomy to one based on regions with combinations of species showing the natural plant associations. He began a journal, the Annals of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta ...|$|E
2500|$|George {{was born}} in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, to Robert King and Cecilia Anderson. Robert King was a {{bookseller}} who moved to Aberdeen to partner with his brothers who were also in the book business. One brother Arthur was {{the founder of the}} Aberdeen University Press. Another brother George was an antiquarian, founder of a local liberal newspaper and a prominent writer on economic and social matters. King's parents both died from <b>phthisis,</b> the father in November 1845 aged thirty six and the mother in 1850 at the age of forty. Orphaned at the age of ten, George was taken care of by his namesake uncle. After studying at the Aberdeen Grammar School where he was nicknamed [...] "Tertius" [...] to distinguish him from other [...] "King" [...] namesakes, something that stuck. One of his teachers was Patrick Geddes. Although a good student, his health was poor and was forced to leave in 1854. The family had associated with the Free church but King later favoured the Anglican church. For a while he worked with his uncle's press business but continued to take a greater interest in natural history that had developed in his youth. He started putting together a collection in his work place, something the printer uncle despised. At the age of eighteen King decided to pursue a medical education and entered the University of Aberdeen in 1861, where he was influenced by his teachers George Dickie, Alexander Harvey and John Struthers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, a Danish {{ophthalmologist}} named Mette Warburg reported about a Danish {{family that}} showed seven cases of a hereditary degenerative disease throughout seven generations. The first {{member of the}} family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating. The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass. [...] Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of retinoblastoma, a cancerous tumor on the retina. A histologic examination showed a hemorrhagic necrotic mass in the posterior chamber, surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) glial tissue. The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, hyperplasia of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment epithelium, hypoplasia and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and <b>phthisis</b> bulbi. This means his eye was removed because the physician suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells already began to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well. She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, Gordon Norrie (1855–1941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.|$|E
