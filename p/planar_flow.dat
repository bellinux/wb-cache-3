40|$|We present simple {{changes to}} the cell method for {{neighbor}} list construction that enable it {{to be used in}} molecular dynamics studies of systems subject to a <b>planar</b> elongational <b>flow</b> field. The modifications for <b>planar</b> elongational <b>flow</b> are similar to those required for <b>planar</b> shear <b>flow</b> and should be easy to incorporate into any cell neighbor list method that is used in simulations of homogeneous shear. The execution time of the code at equilibrium is shown to be proportional to the number of particles N. The introduction of the modifications allowing shear, and more importantly, elongational flow are shown to affect the performance of the code in both CPU time and memory usage. The modifications to enable the simulation of <b>planar</b> elongational <b>flow</b> using the cell method of neighbor list construction will not introduce any higher order dependency if applied to code that is N-dependent in <b>planar</b> shear <b>flow.</b> We use this code to study large systems of diatomic molecules at low strain-rates, and find that the linear regime in <b>planar</b> elongational <b>flow</b> can be determined by the ratio of the two planar elongational viscosity functions. The properties investigated in <b>planar</b> shear <b>flow,</b> such as angular velocity and alignment angle, were inconsistent with the shear viscosity results in their evaluation of where the linear regime ends.

The principle may be extended to two or more coaxial fluids; gases and liquids may be combined; and, depending of the geometry of the feed tube and orifices, the flow pattern may be cylindrical or planar.

We extend their discussion to higher-dimensional systems of Hamiltonian type by formulating the problem as the existence of intersection points of two Lagrangian manifolds. Their various assumptions can be restated and interpreted as ensuring some complexity of the generating function {{of one of the}} Lagrangian manifold with respect to symplectic coordinates that trivialise the second Lagrangian manifold. The critical points thus obtained correspond to homoclinic solutions.

40|$|AbstractWind-excited {{vibrations}} in {{the frequency}} range of 10 to 50 Hz due to vortex shedding often cause fatigue failures in the cables of overhead transmission lines. Damping devices, such as the Stockbridge dampers, have been in use {{for a long time}} for supressing these vibrations. The dampers are conveniently modelled by means of their driving point impedance, measured in the lab over the frequency range under consideration. The cables can be modelled as strings with additional small bending stiffness. The main problem in modelling the vibrations does however lay in the aerodynamic forces, which usually are approximated by the forces acting on a rigid cylinder in <b>planar</b> <b>flow.</b> In the present paper, the wind forces are represented by stochastic processes with arbitrary crosscorrelation in space; the case of a Kármán vortex street on a rigid cylinder in <b>planar</b> <b>flow</b> is contained as a limit case in this approach.

40|$|We derive the {{conditions}} for the stability of strips or filaments of vorticity {{on the surface of}} a sphere. We find that the spherical results are surprisingly different from the planar ones, owing {{to the nature of the}} spherical geometry. Strips of vorticity on the surface of a sphere show a greater tendency to roll-up into vortices than do strips on a planar surface. The results are obtained by performing a linear stability analysis of the simplest, piecewise-constant vorticity configuration, namely a zonal band of uniform vorticity located in equilibrium between two latitudes. The presence of polar vortices is also considered, this having the effect of introducing adverse shear, a known stabilizing mechanism for <b>planar</b> <b>flows.</b> In several representative examples, the fully developed stages of the instabilities are illustrated by direct numerical simulation. The implication for planetary atmospheres is that barotropic flows on the sphere have a more pronounced tendency to produce small, long-lived vortices, especially in equatorial and mid-latitude regions, than was previously anticipated from the theoretical results for <b>planar</b> <b>flows.</b> Essentially, the curvature of the sphere's surface weakens the interaction between different parts of the flow, enabling these parts to behave in relative isolation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} ideal flow theory, which {{is well known}} for {{isotropic}} rigid perfectly plastic materials, to quite general orthotropic materials which comply with the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The new theory is restricted to steady <b>planar</b> <b>flow.</b> The original ideal flow theory is widely used as the basis for inverse methods for the preliminary design of metal forming processes driven by minimum plastic work. The new theory extends this area of application to orthotropic materials. Moreover, another design criterion based on the Cockroft–Latham ductile fracture criterion is incorporated in the theory. To this end, the extended Bernoulli’s theorem relating pressure and velocity along any streamline during the steady <b>planar</b> <b>flow</b> of rigid perfectly plastic solids when the streamline is coincident everywhere with a principal stress trajectory is used. In particular, this theorem and the concept of ideal flow combine to evaluate the integral involved in the ductile fracture criterion. The final result is a simple relation between process parameters and the constitutive parameter involved in the ductile fracture criterion. The simplicity of this relation makes it suitable for quick design of metal forming processes...|$|E
