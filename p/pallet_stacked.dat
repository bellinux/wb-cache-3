40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the use of}} a vision-based method known as camera-space manipulation [1, 2] for the accurate 3 -D point positioning of a manipulator and how this method is capable of addressing the applications listed above. The method of camera-space manipulation derives its accuracy and robustness by carring out the control of the manipulator entirely within the reference frame of the participating cameras (two or more for general 3 -D tasks) without regard to any physical reference frame. The method is predicated on estimating view parameters that describe the relationship between the appearance of image-plane visual features (or "cues") located on the robot manipulator and the internal joint configuration of the robot. Cameraspace manipulation has been successfully applied to general 3 -D experimental tasks which require accuracy in both positioning and orientation.

5000|$|Sawmill shed Standing {{close to}} the road at the {{southeast}} corner of the site, the heart of the mill operations is an open timber framed shed with corrugated iron clad roofs. The main part is sheltered by a gable roof the north side of which extends west over the docker area and northeast with a small skillion roof over the number two bench. The shed is framed with sawn and unsawn timber, the roof supported by round posts. The compact milling operation is organised around the sequence of saws and the accompanying benches, motors, trolleys and rails accommodated within the shed. The saws stand in a line from the breakdown saw (Canadian saw) to the south to the number two bench saw to the north. Timber logs are stacked by forklift at the southwest, rolled onto a trolley where they are secured with a dog and run through the breakdown saw for the half cut. The cut logs then roll across to the number one bench saw where the bark is stripped and the half logs are cut into 2" [...] (50mm) or 2.5" [...] (62.5mm) width planks. The cut planks are stacked north of the number one bench and taken across to the number two bench saw where they are cut into thinner 1" [...] (25mm) boards which are stacked to the west and taken across to the docker where they are cut into shorter lengths (mostly 6 metres). From here the boards pass to the groover where the sides are grooved before being placed in the <b>pallet</b> <b>stack</b> west of the log stack.

A pallet jack, which cannot <b>stack</b> a <b>pallet,</b> uses front wheels mounted inside {{the end of}} forks that extend to the floor as the pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel. A counterbalanced lift truck (sometimes {{referred to as a}} forklift truck, but other attachments besides forks can be used) can transport and <b>stack</b> <b>pallets</b> and allows the operator to ride on the truck. The weight of the vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of vehicle beyond front wheels); the front wheels act as a fulcrum or pivot point. Narrow-aisle trucks usually require that the operator stand-up while riding {{in order to reduce the}} truck’s turning radius. Reach mechanisms and outrigger arms that straddle and support a load can be used in addition to the just the counterbalance of the truck. On a turret truck, the forks rotate during stacking, eliminating the need for the truck itself to turn in narrow aisles. An order picker allows the operator to be lifted with the load to allow for less-than-pallet-load picking. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are industrial trucks that can transport loads without requiring a human operator.|$|R

40|$|Butter {{keeping quality}} and pallet {{physical}} stability during {{transport and storage}} are dependent on the temperature distribution through the product. Understanding these temperature changes are of vital importance for the dairy industry with regard to butter manufacture, storage and shipping. Three dimensional mathematical models of heat transfer were developed to predict thawing and freezing in butter products. These models require accurate thermophysical data as an input. Specific heat capacity and enthalpy of butter with different composition was measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The specific heat capacity of butter differs for cooling and heating operations due to significant supercooling and delayed crystallization of the fat fraction of butter at temperatures well below the equilibrium phase change temperature during cooling. This reduces the heat capacity for cooling relative to that for heating. Thawing of individual blocks of butter was accurately predicted by the conduction only model (no mass transfer limitations) with equilibrium thermal properties giving accurate predictions when the butter was completely frozen before thawing. For partially frozen butter the conduction model with the measured temperature dependent specific heat capacity data for unfrozen butter including melting {{of some of the}} fat fraction gave accurate predictions. For freezing it was observed that water in the butter supercools many degrees below its initial freezing point before freezing due to its water in oil structure. Experiments suggested that during freezing release of latent heat observed as a temperature rebound is controlled as much by the rate of crystallisation of water in each of the water droplets as by the rate of heat transfer. A conduction only model including water crystallization kinetics based on the Avrami Model predicted freezing in butter successfully. Simple models with equilibrium thermal properties and nucleation only kinetics (based on homogenous nucleation theory) or the sensible heat only model (no release of latent heat) gave poor predictions. The models for individual blocks were extended to predict heat transfer in butter pallets. A butter pallet contains product, packaging material and the air entrapped between the packaging and butter cartons. Measurements were made for freezing and thawing of full and half pallets at a commercial storage facility and in the University laboratory. Thawing and freezing in wrapped tightly <b>stacked</b> <b>pallets</b> was predicted accurately by the conduction only model with effective thermal properties (incorporating butter, packaging and air) estimated by the parallel model. For unwrapped tightly stacked or loosely <b>stacked</b> <b>pallets</b> there is potential for air flow between the adjacent cartons of butter. An alternative approach was developed which consisted of modeling the pallet on block by block basis using effective heat transfer coefficients for each surface. Different heat transfer coefficients were used on different faces of the blocks depending on the location of the block in the pallet. This approach gave good predictions for both unwrapped tightly stacked and loosely <b>stacked</b> <b>pallets</b> using the estimated effective heat transfer coefficients from the measured data. Further experimental and/or modelling work is required in order to develop guidelines for estimating effective heat transfer coefficient values for internal block face for industrial scenarios...|$|R

40|$|We {{continue}} the interview between CTA staff and Spore, started in Spore 101, and explain, {{in response to}} many readers queries, how Spore is produced. It s a tight and complex process, exercising intellects and logistics. In its evolution over the past 17 years, it {{has not always been}} easy as in 2002 to keep it up, for which our apologies. Here s how it works when it works well. It s a long road from the idea for an article to the time the magazine reaches the reader. Spore is the flagship publication of CTA, and its daily management {{is in the hands of}} the Information Products and Services Department (IPSD). The IPSD engages an external agency to do the bulk of the work in originating and writing articles, and designing and producing the print and electronic versions. Currently, that agency is the Spore consortium, formed by the Médiateurs group based near Amsterdam in The Netherlands, and Louma productions in Aniane, near Montpellier in southern France. Médiateurs provides the editorial services, and runs a network of 24 correspondents in all six ACP regions and beyond. Louma looks after all the design aspects, including the popular photographs and illustrations, and the production. The sister edition of Esporo is produced by the Edições group in Lisbon, Portugal they take most of their material from Spore, and add sections of special interest to Portuguese readers, in the same way as the French and English Spore editions have different articles about publications or some training courses. Planning Each October, CTA s Spore team (composed of IPSD staff) meets with the consortium team and Esporo s representative to decide on the major topics (long articles) for the coming year s six issues. Very occasionally, these change during the year. Then, every 2 months, about 90 days before an issue is due to appear (what we call D Day minus 90, the D for delivery), they all meet to plan that issue in detail, section by section, article by article. There is input from all CTA departments from IPSD, the consortium and Esporo with a growing volume of proposals from correspondents and readers. The outlines of long articles are discussed as in a high-level seminar; sometimes a suggestion for a short article will be promoted to a longer article. The air is thick with dozens of suggested articles, and the room full of champions of so many ideas. Books, videos and CD-ROMS are examined and weighed up, and accepted or rejected for a review. In the following weeks, the consortium writes and edits the articles. The only pieces we hardly touch are readers letters, which speak for themselves. CTA then approves the copy, adding its own editing touches and suggestions for improvements. Sometimes, an article turns out to be less interesting than expected, and a replacement is found; there are always one or two articles in reserve. All this is done in accordance with a stout document called the Spore Content and Style Guide, the team s own rule book about, as the song says, what to leave in and what to leave out. Such as how much, or how little, coverage there should be of CTA events, how often an ACP region has to be written about, checking stories, spelling rules, type of language to be used, how much should be originated in French, or in English, how many words in a headline you name it. The quality of writing is also defined, based in part on readers levels of reading, and with the requirement of having the same quality as, for example, The Economist and Le Monde. One of the greatest and few critics of Spore s accessible style once spluttered that 'This article could have been in Newsweek magazine', which we took as a great compliment. Another, more cautiously, warned us that our open style is not the right approach for writing for policy-makers, who need their information to be opaque. He had a point, but we decided to keep it open. The Uses of Spore Survey has shown that most readers are satisfied with the style, and we always welcome informed comments for improvement. All leading magazines publish their style guides, and Spore s will be published soon. From words to messages, with graphics After approval, about 40 days before D day, texts are translated and then comes a period of metamorphosis. Photographs and illustrations are selected, and the words on a typed page are converted into a properly laid-out article in Louma s design studios. First one language edition is completed, and the other follows. Designs, like the photos and texts and draft articles before them, are shared between team members by email. Then CTA approves the design, more usually with a 'Wow!' than a whimper, and it is rushed to an impatient printer in Montpellier. While printing is going on, a new phase of work opens up: the design is delivered to the CTA Website, the email Ennouncement goes to subscribers; the new package of Spore and more starts broadcast on our WorldSpace satellite channel; and the Spore indexers add the edition to the Spore index, scheduled to go public as from mid- 2003. The final design is also sent to Lisbon to complete work on Esporo, for distribution a few weeks later. About 10 days later, D Day, <b>pallets</b> <b>stacked</b> high with more than 40, 000 copies of Spore are collected from the printers and taken to the distributors in The Netherlands. A few days later, they are on their way by mail to subscribers in 126 countries. Does anyone have time to put their feet up on D day + 1 ? Not really. The next issue has already been written, its photos are being selected; correspondents are already researching stories for the issue after that, and trying to tie down two more evasive Viewpoint articles; memos or chitchat fly around on whether the headlines in the last issue were too obtuse or too direct; the consortium updates its score-book on how well are we doing; an anxious subscriber is chasing an errant back number; another 800 subscription applications have been received; and the mailbag of Mailbox is bursting with new ideas from readers.

40|$|ABSTRACT Carton Clamp Test Methodologies and the Effects on Load Containment and Retention Tyler Don Blumer A carton clamp is an {{alternative}} device for moving packages and material. Instead of using iron tines {{like that of a}} conventional forklift, a carton clamp uses two large aluminum platens to slightly compress and secure the load for handling. This is advantageous as it allows operators to move layers of a unitized load individually, and eliminates the need for a pallet when handling full unitized loads. When using a carton clamp attachment, it is often difficult for operators to accurately gauge the amount of force being applied to the load. The required clamping force changes depending on the size, shape, and weight of the load. This creates the potential for under-clamping (slippage) and over-clamping (compressive damage). Seeing a market need for a reliable means of testing, two organizations set out to develop a testing protocol. A rift formed between schools of thought regarding the correct testing procedure. ISTA provides a sterile, calculated, and stationary simulation of carton clamp handling in its ISTA 6 -SAMS test protocol. ASTM offers a more holistic, dynamic, observational approach in its mobile ASTM 6055 standard protocol. One school of thought is suggested to imply that a package should be developed to be handled by the carton clamp (ASTM). The other school of thought is that the carton clamp attachment should be properly adjusted to the package specimen (ISTA). Previous studies have been performed citing the ISTA standard and using a specialized carton clamping device vibration device that is calibrated for laboratory research. Arguably, this method, though repeatable in nature, does not accurately simulate carton clamp handling found in industry. Likewise, the equipment investment is cost prohibitive for those in industry wishing to duplicate such a study. ASTM uses a carton clamp truck as used in industry, but does not specify any specific parameters making repeatability between laboratories and practitioners ambiguous. This study examined whether or not a common ground can be reached; implementing a carton clamp lift truck as found in industry allowing for mobile (hazard course) testing. A modified version of ISTA 3 B will be paired off against ASTM 6055 for evaluating both column and cross <b>stack</b> <b>pallet</b> patterns with a variety of treatments. This study attempted to determine if carton clamps as found in industry are capable and repeatable enough to provide consistent data. Similarly, this study examined the test methodologies effect on load containment via stretch film force, load retention via unitized load slippage, and the effects of ride height and driver interaction. The study sought to understand if these effects are uniform across the unitized load, or if particular layers of the load more affected than others...|$|R
