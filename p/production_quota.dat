5|$|An ineffectual start {{led to the}} {{conclusion}} that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called perestroika, or restructuring. Perestroika relaxed the <b>production</b> <b>quota</b> system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.|$|E
5|$|These {{effects were}} not felt uniformly, however. For example, {{by the end}} of the Brezhnev era, blue-collar workers had higher wages than {{professional}} workers in the Soviet Union. For example, the wage of a secondary school teacher in the Soviet Union was only 150 rubles while a bus driver's wage was 230. As a whole, real wages increased from 96.5 rubles a month in 1965 to 190.1 rubles a month in 1985. A small minority benefited even more substantially. The state provided daily recreation and annual holidays for hard-working citizens. Soviet trade unions rewarded hard-working members and their families with beach vacations in Crimea and Georgia. Workers who fulfilled the monthly <b>production</b> <b>quota</b> set by the Soviet government were honored by placing their respective names on the factory's Roll of Honor. The state awarded badges for all manner of public services, and war veterans were allowed to go to the head of the shop queues. All members of the USSR Academy of Sciences were given a special badge and their own chauffeur-driven car. These awards, perks and privileges made it easier for some to find decent job placements, though they did not prevent the degeneration of Soviet society. Urbanization had led to unemployment in the Soviet agricultural sector, with most of the able workforce leaving villages for the local towns.|$|E

When he meets Stalin, who tends his garden, the leader helps him to understand his emotions and tells him to recite poetry to her.

This paper compares <b>production</b> <b>quotas</b> and market sharing agreements in a Cournot duopoly where firms incur a fixed cost for serving each market. We show that there exists a threshold value of the fixed cost such that collusion is easier to sustain with <b>production</b> <b>quotas</b> below the threshold and with market sharing agreements above the threshold.

Besides {{a wide array of}} punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet <b>production</b> <b>quota),</b> they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onwards), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfillment and overfulfillment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onwards), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers (shock workers or Stakhanovites in Soviet parlance).|$|E

500|$|Frantically rushed {{production}} was {{very common in}} Soviet industry, and in particular {{a process known as}} [...] "storming" [...] (Russian: штурмовщина, pronounced shturmovshchina) was endemic; it involved crash programs in which factories tried to undertake all their monthly <b>production</b> <b>quota</b> in a very short space of time. This was usually the result of a lack of industrial materials that left factories without the resources to complete production until new supplies arrived {{at the end of the}} month. Workers then worked as many hours as possible to meet monthly quotas in time; this exhausted them and left them unable to work at the beginning of the next month (although lack of raw materials meant there would have been very little for them to produce at this point anyway).|$|E
500|$|For {{countries}} that export petroleum at relatively low volume, their limited negotiating power as OPEC members {{would not necessarily}} justify the burdens imposed by OPEC production quotas and membership costs. Ecuador withdrew from OPEC in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under its OPEC quota at the time, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. In May 2008, Indonesia {{announced that it would}} leave OPEC when its membership expired {{at the end of that}} year, having become a net importer of oil and being unable to meet its <b>production</b> <b>quota.</b> It rejoined the organization in January 2016, but announced another [...] "temporary suspension" [...] of its membership at year-end when OPEC requested a 5 percent production cut.|$|E
500|$|The Drapier {{does not}} {{directly}} attack Isaac Newton's assay of Wood's coin, but instead attacks the process behind the assay and the witnesses who testified before the Privy Council. In his criticism of the Privy Council's report, the Drapier claims that the report is part of Wood's propaganda and lies, because Wood released three proposals concurrent with the report: lowering the patent <b>production</b> <b>quota</b> from £100,800 to £40,000 worth; {{that no one is}} obliged to accept more than five pence halfpenny per transaction; and to sell the coin at 2s 1d a pound or his raw copper at 1s 8d a pound. Wood's choice of wording, that the Irish would be [...] "obliged" [...] to accept the coin, was criticised by the Drapier who then accused Wood of [...] "perfect High Treason" [...] for obliging the people to take any copper coin when the king lacked the constitutional authority to do such a thing.|$|E

The 1969 crop was heavily damaged by a hurricane, {{and to meet}} its export quota, the government drafted in the army, implemented a seven-day working week, and postponed public holidays to lengthen the harvest. When that year's <b>production</b> <b>quota</b> was not met, Castro offered to resign during a public speech, but assembled crowds insisted he remain.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} how distortionary factor taxes {{affect the}} welfare impacts of <b>production</b> subsidies, <b>production</b> <b>quotas,</b> acreage controls, subsidies for acreage reductions, and cash transfers to farmers. Pre-existing taxes substantially raise {{the costs of}} all these policies. These additional costs reflect the welfare losses from financing certain policies by distortionary taxes. They also reflect interactions with factor markets caused by changes in the costs of producing agricultural output. Previous studies ignore the latter types of effect. Consequently they significantly overstate the costs of production subsidies and understate the costs of <b>production</b> <b>quotas,</b> acreage controls, and subsidies for acreage reductions.

2500|$|In early 1944, the Allied air {{war began}} to focus {{primarily}} upon {{the destruction of the}} Luftwaffe in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. Plans for the so-called [...] "Big Week", which was intended to permanently smash the German capacity to produce fighter aircraft through targeted airstrikes on final assembly factories, were already underway in 1943. Between February 20–25, 1944, approximately 10,000 American and British aircraft, including about 6,000 bombers, attacked strategic targets all over Germany. Following these attacks, which seriously damaged German aircraft production, the <b>production</b> <b>quota</b> fell drastically. In response the Jägerstab (Fighter Staff) was founded in March 1944 with the task of ensuring the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. It superseded the Ministry of Aviation in this jurisdiction. At the head of the Jägerstab was armaments minister Albert Speer, as Deputy the Secretary of State Erhard Milch, as Chief of Staff Karl Saur. Their plan to protect the aircraft industry, especially the manufacture of the jet-powered Messerschmitt Me 262, entailed the relocation of assembly plants into underground bunkers. This idea was not entirely new, as a similar (but never realized) proposal had already been considered in October 1943. The Jägerstab's plan included six locations in which partially underground bunkers were to be built, and at first called for the bunkers to be encompass a minimum area of 600,000 to 800,000 m2 apiece. However, {{by the time of the}} Jägerstab meeting of 17 March 1944, the projected size of the each building had sunk to 60,000 m2. By June 1944 the invasion of the allies had forced the Jägerstab to focus in the end on two locations in Upper Bavaria. Three bunkers were to be built at Kaufering in the Landsberg am Lech district under the codename [...] "Ringeltaube" [...] (common wood pigeon), while the codename [...] "Weingut I" [...] (Vineyard I) was chosen for the factory in the [...] According to the testimony of Franz Xaver Dorsch, who was responsible for the construction, the fighter factory would be completed in five to six months at best. Speer later wrote in his memoirs that at the time it was already not difficult to foresee that the project would not be completed within the planned time.|$|E
