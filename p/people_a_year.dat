5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{occurs in}} about 26,000 <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in the United States. While the {{condition}} has been commented on throughout history, {{the first modern}} description was following an earthquake in 1908. Important discoveries as to its mechanism were made during the Blitz of London in 1941. It is a significant problem for those injured in earthquakes and relief efforts for such disasters often include medical teams equipped to treat survivors with rhabdomyolysis.|$|E

5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, the {{population}} of Berlin was growing rapidly with the influx of around 50,000 <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> creating a large administrative burden. When construction began on the Rotes Rathaus, the city had around half a million inhabitants, but this grew to 800,000 {{by the time of}} its completion in 1869. By the 1880s, the city had offices in ten additional buildings near the Rotes Rathaus and since it could not be extended, it was clear that a second administration building was required.|$|E
5|$|The Institution grew slowly until 1964 when Sidney Dillon Ripley became secretary. Ripley {{managed to}} expand the {{institution}} by eight museums and increased admission from 10.8 million to 30 million <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> This period included the greatest and most rapid growth for the Smithsonian, and it continued until Ripley's resignation in 1984. Since {{the completion of the}} Arts and Industries Building, the Smithsonian has expanded to twenty separate museums with roughly 137 million objects in their collections, including works of art, natural specimens, and cultural artifacts. The Smithsonian museums are visited by over 25 million people every year.|$|E

5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product, and in total the bunkers cost {{more than twice as}} much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming three times as much concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E
5|$|The valleys that delimit the massif {{were used}} as {{communication}} routes by the Romans until they left around the 5thcentury AD. The region has remained of some military importance through to the mid-20thcentury. A peasant farming economy operated within these valleys for many centuries until the glaciers and mountains were discovered by the outside world in the 18thcentury. Word of these impressive sights began to spread, and Mont Blanc was finally climbed in 1786, marking {{the start of the}} sport of mountaineering. The region is now a major tourist destination, drawing in over sixmillion visitors per year. It provides a wide range of opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities such as sight-seeing, hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering and skiing. Around one hundred <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> die across its mountains and, occasionally, bodies have been lost and entombed in its glaciers for decades.|$|E
5|$|Treviño Morales {{reportedly}} coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico, {{including the}} murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later in San Fernando, Tamaulipas.

Although it {{was not the first time}} Calderón received death threats from organized crime, the authorities deemed the drug lord's threat as credible, and urged the President to cancel his trip (though he ultimately went anyway). Under Treviño Morales' leadership, Los Zetas were considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to be highly sophisticated, advanced, and one of the most dangerous criminal organizations operating in Mexico and the hemisphere. He was widely regarded as one of the most violent drug lords operating in Mexico.|$|E

Chronic symptoms are well described and are known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, although it is often called chronic Lyme disease.
