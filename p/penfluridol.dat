5000|$|<b>Penfluridol</b> (Semap, Micefal, Longoperidol) is {{a highly}} potent, first {{generation}} diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotic. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1968. Related to other diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotics, pimozide and fluspirilene, <b>penfluridol</b> has an extremely long elimination half-life and its effects last for many days after single oral dose. Its antipsychotic potency, in terms of dose needed to produce comparable effects, is similar to both haloperidol and pimozide. It is only slightly sedative, but often causes extrapyramidal side-effects, such as akathisia, dyskinesiae and pseudo-Parkinsonism. <b>Penfluridol</b> is indicated for antipsychotic treatment of chronic schizophrenia and similar psychotic disorders, it is, however, like most typical antipsychotics, being increasingly replaced by the atypical antipsychotics. Due to its extremely long-lasting effects, it is often prescribed to be taken orally as tablets only once a week (q 7 days). The once-weekly dose is usually 10-60 mg. A 2006 systematic review examined the use of <b>penfluridol</b> for people with schizophrenia: ...|$|E

A novel self-microemulsifying drug delivery system has been successfully developed to benefit the solubility of <b>penfluridol.</b> Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to investigate the phase behaviour and to assess the effects of different co-surfactants and the mass ratios of surfactant to co-surfactant (Km) on the phase regions. Optimal compositions of the formed systems were screened via viscosity studies and microemulsion droplet size tests. The optimal formulation of penfluridol-loaded self-microemulsion consists of <b>penfluridol</b> 5. 0 %, oil (MCT) 15. 8 %, surfactant (cremophor EL) 52. 8 %, co-surfactant (PEG- 400) 26. 4 %, with the average particle size at approximately (53. 5 ± 4. 3) nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the spherical nature and size homogeneity of the microemulsion droplets. No significant variations (droplet sizes and <b>penfluridol</b> contents) in microemulsion were observed over a period of 30 days at 4 °C and 25 °C, respectively. The developed self-microemulsion proved to be a potential candidate to enhance the solubility of <b>penfluridol...</b>|$|E
40|$|Incubation of bovine adrenal chromaffin {{cells with}} veratridine (10 – 100 [*]μM) during 24 [*]h, caused a concentration-dependent {{release of the}} cytosolic lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) into the bathing medium, an indicator of cell death. Lubeluzole or its R(−) enantiomer, R 91154, did not enhance LDH release. Both lubeluzole and R 91154 (0. 3 – 10 [*]μM) decreased the veratridine-induced LDH release. <b>Penfluridol</b> did not increase LDH release at concentrations 0. 003 – 1 [*]μM; 3 – 10 [*]μM increased LDH release to 50 – 60 %, after 24 [*]h exposure. <b>Penfluridol</b> (0. 03 – 0. 3 [*]μM) did not protect against the cytotoxic effects of veratridine; at 1 [*]μM, 15 % protection was produced. Higher concentrations (3 – 10 [*]μM) enhanced the cytotoxic effects of veratridine. Ba 2 + ions caused a concentration-dependent increase of LDH release. This cytotoxic effect was partially prevented by 3 [*]μM lubeluzole and fully counteracted by 1 [*]μM <b>penfluridol.</b> R 91154 was less potent than lubeluzole and only protected against the lesion induced by 0. 5 [*]mM Ba 2 +. Ouabain (10 [*]μM during 24 [*]h) increased LDH release to about 30 %. Both lubeluzole (0. 3 – 10 [*]μM) and the lower concentrations of <b>penfluridol</b> (0. 003 – 0. 3 [*]μM) prevented the ouabain cytotoxic effects. At higher concentrations (3 [*]μM), <b>penfluridol</b> increased drastically the ouabain cytotoxic effects. 6 -Hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) caused significant cytotoxic effects at 30 and 100 [*]μM. Lubeluzole (3 – 10 [*]μM) or <b>penfluridol</b> (0. 03 – 0. 3 [*]μM) had no cytoprotective effects against 6 -OHDA. Lubeluzole (3 [*]μM), R 91154 (3 [*]μM) and <b>penfluridol</b> (1 [*]μM) blocked the current through Na+ channels in voltage-clamped chromaffin cells (INa) by around 20 – 30 %. Ca 2 + current through Ca 2 + channels (ICa) was inhibited 57 % by lubeluzole and R 91154 and 50 % by <b>penfluridol.</b> The effects of <b>penfluridol</b> were not washed out, but those of lubeluzole and R 91154 were readily reversible. Lubeluzole (3 [*]μM) induced reversible blockade of the oscillations of the cytosolic Ca 2 +, [Ca 2 +]i, in fura- 2 -loaded cells exposed to 30 or 100 [*]μM veratridine. <b>Penfluridol</b> (1 [*]μM) inhibited those oscillations in an irreversible manner. The results suggest that lubeluzole and its R-isomer caused cytoprotection against veratridine cell damage, by blocking the veratridine stimulated Na+ and Ca 2 + entry, {{as well as the}} [Ca 2 +]i oscillations. The Ba 2 + and ouabain cytotoxic effects were prevented more efficiently by <b>penfluridol,</b> likely by blocking the plasmalemmal Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger. It remains dubious whether these findings are relevant to the reported neuroprotective action of lubeluzole in stroke; the doubt rests in the stereoselective protecting effects of lubeluzole in in vivo stroke models, as opposed to its lack of stereoselectivity in the in vitro model reported here...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA rise in {{intracellular}} free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) {{is required}} to activate sperm of all organisms studied. Such elevation of [Ca 2 +]i can occur either by influx of extracellular Ca 2 + or by release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. We have examined these sources of Ca 2 + in sperm from the sea squirt Ascidia ceratodes using mitochondrial translocation to evaluate activation and the Ca 2 +-sensitive dye fura- 2 to monitor [Ca 2 +]i by bulk spectrofluorometry. Sperm activation artificially evoked by incubation in high-pH seawater was inhibited by reducing seawater [Ca 2 +], {{as well as by}} the presence of high [K+]o or the Ca channel blockers pimozide, <b>penfluridol,</b> or Ni 2 +, but not nifedipine or Co 2 +. The accompanying rise in [Ca 2 +]i was also blocked by pimozide or <b>penfluridol.</b> These results indicate that activation produced by alkaline incubation involves opening of plasmalemmal voltage-dependent Ca channels and Ca 2 + entry to initiate mitochondrial translocation. Incubation in thimerosal or thapsigargin, but not ryanodine (even if combined with caffeine pretreatment), evoked sperm activation. Activation by thimerosal was insensitive to reduced external calcium and to Ca channel blockers. Sperm [Ca 2 +]i increased upon incubation in high-pH or thimerosal-containing seawater, but only the high-pH-dependent elevation in [Ca 2 +]i could be inhibited by pimozide or <b>penfluridol.</b> Treatment with the protonophore CCCP indicated that only a small percentage of sperm could release enough Ca 2 + from mitochondria to cause activation. Inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) delivered by liposomes or by permeabilization increased sperm activation. Both of these effects were blocked by heparin. We conclude that high external pH induces intracellular alkalization that directly or indirectly activates plasma membrane voltage-dependent Ca channels allowing entry of external Ca 2 + and that thimerosal stimulates release of Ca 2 + from IP 3 -sensitive intracellular stores...|$|E
40|$|Acidic phospholipids, {{unsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} and limited proteolysis mimic the activating effect of calmodulin on erythrocyte Ca 2 +-transport ATPase and on brain cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, {{as has been}} reported previously in several studies. Three different antagonists of calmodulin-induced activation of these enzymes were tested for their inhibitory potency on the stimulation produced by the other activators. Trifluoperazine and <b>penfluridol</b> were found to antagonize all the above mentioned types of activation of Ca 2 +-transport ATPase in the same concentration range. Both inhibitors also can reverse the activation of phosphodiesterase by oleic acid, phosphatidylserine and calmodulin at similar concentrations. However, in contrast with erythrocyte Ca 2 +-transport ATPase, activation of phosphodiesterase by limited tryptic digestion cannot be antagonized by <b>penfluridol</b> and trifluoperazine. Calmidazolium, formerly referred to as compound R 24571, {{was found to be}} a relatively specific inhibitor of calmodulin-induced activation of phosphodiesterase and Ca 2 +-transport ATPase, since antagonism of the other activators required much higher concentrations of the drug. The results suggest that the investigated drugs exert their inhibitory effect on calmodulin-regulated enzymes not solely via their binding to calmodulin but may also interfere directly with the calmodulin effector enzyme. In addition, a general mechanism of activation and inhibition of calmodulin-dependent enzymes is derived from our results...|$|E
40|$|Antischizophrenic {{neuroleptic}} drugs of the diphenylbutylpiperidine class, {{which includes}} pimozide, fluspirilene, <b>penfluridol,</b> and clopimozide, inhibit [3 H]nitrendipine binding with IC 50 values of 13 - 30 nM. This inhibition involves receptors for the verapamil/prenylamine class of calcium channel antagonists. These diphenylbutylpiperidines also inhibit potassium-induced calcium-dependent contractions of rat vas deferens at concentrations of 40 - 350 nM. Other phenothiazine and butyrophenone neuroleptics lack such potent calcium-antagonist actions. Diphenylbutylpiperidines also differ from other neuroleptics {{in their ability}} to relieve negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as emotional withdrawal, as well as the positive symptoms which respond to all neuroleptics. We suggest that these unique antischizophrenic actions are related to a blockade by diphenylbutylpiperidines of voltage-operated calcium channels...|$|E

Although there have been reports that certain neuroleptics that primarily target D 2 dopamine receptors and are used to treat psychoses may also interact with T-type Ca channels, there has been no systematic examination of this phenomenon. In the present paper we provide a detailed analysis of the effects of several widely used neuroleptic agents on a family of exogenously expressed neuronal T-type Ca channels (� 1 G, � 1 H, and � 1 I subtypes).

40|$|Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) {{catalyze}} {{the conversion}} of ATP into the second messenger cAMP. Membranous AC 1 (AC 1) is involved in processes of memory and learning and in muscle pain. The AC toxin edema factor (EF) of Bacillus anthracis {{is involved in the}} development of anthrax. Both ACs are stimulated by the eukaryotic Ca(2 +) -sensor calmodulin (CaM). The CaM-AC interaction could constitute a potential target to enhance or impair the AC activity of AC 1 and EF to intervene in above (patho) physiological mechanisms. Thus, we analyzed the impact of 39 compounds including typical CaM-inhibitors, an anticonvulsant, an anticholinergic, antidepressants, antipsychotics and Ca(2 +) -antagonists on CaM-stimulated catalytic activity of AC 1 and EF. Compounds were tested at 10 μM, i. e., a concentration that can be reached therapeutically for certain antidepressants and antipsychotics. Calmidazolium chloride decreased CaM-stimulated AC 1 activity moderately by about 30 %. In contrast, CaM-stimulated EF activity was abrogated by calmidazolium chloride and additionally decreased by chlorpromazine, felodipine, <b>penfluridol</b> and trifluoperazine by about 20 - 40 %. The activity of both ACs was decreased by calmidazolium chloride in the presence and absence of CaM. Thus, CaM-stimulated AC 1 activity is more insensitive to inhibition by small molecules than CaM-stimulated EF activity. Inhibition of AC 1 and EF by calmidazolium chloride is largely mediated via a CaM-independent allosteric mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Bovine adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells {{express a}} noninactivating K+ current (IAC) that is {{inhibited}} by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at picomolar concentrations. Inhibition of IAC {{may be a}} critical step in depolarization-dependent Ca 2 + entry leading to cortisol secretion. In whole-cell patch clamp recordings from AZF cells, we have characterized properties of IAC and the signalling pathway by which ACTH inhibits this current. IAC {{was identified as a}} voltage-gated, outwardly rectifying, K(+) -selective current whose inhibition by ACTH required activation of a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP binding protein. IAC was selectively inhibited by the cAMP analogue 8 -(4 - chlorophenylthio) -adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (8 -pcpt-cAMP) with an IC 50 of 160 microM. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (2. 5 microM) also reduced IAC by 92 +/- 4. 7 %. Inhibition of IAC by ACTH, 8 -pcpt-cAMP and forskolin was not prevented by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors H- 89 (5 microM), cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide (PKI[5 - 24]) (2 microM), (Rp) -cAMPS (500 microM), or by the nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (100 nM) applied externally or intracellularly through the patch pipette. At the same concentrations, these kinase inhibitors abolished 8 -pcpt-cAMP-stimulated A-kinase activity in AZF cell extracts. In intact AZF cells, 8 -pcpt-cAMP activated A-kinase with an EC 50 of 77 nM, a concentration 2, 000 -fold lower than that inhibiting IAC half maximally. The active catalytic subunit of A-kinase applied intracellularly through the recording pipette failed to alter functional expression of IAC. The inhibition of IAC by ACTH and 8 -pcpt- cAMP was eliminated by substituting the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP for ATP in the pipette solution. <b>Penfluridol,</b> an antagonist of T-type Ca 2 + channels inhibited 8 -pcpt-cAMP-induced cortisol secretion with an IC 50 of 0. 33 microM, a concentration that effectively blocks Ca 2 + channel in these cells. These results demonstrate that IAC is a K(+) -selective current whose gating is controlled by an unusual combination of metabolic factors and membrane voltage. IAC may be the first example of an ionic current that is inhibited by cAMP through an A-kinase-independent mechanism. The A-kinase-independent inhibition of IAC by ACTH and cAMP through a mechanism requiring ATP hydrolysis appears to be a unique form of channel modulation. These findings suggest a model for cortisol secretion wherein cAMP combines with two separate effectors to activate parallel steroidogenic signalling pathways. These include the traditional A-kinase-dependent signalling cascade and a novel pathway wherein cAMP binding to IAC K+ channels leads to membrane depolarization and Ca 2 + entry. The simultaneous activation of A-kinase- and Ca(2 +) -dependent pathways produces the full steroidogenic response...|$|E
40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or benperidol or bromperidol or fluspirilene or pimozide or <b>penfluridol</b> or sulpiride or veralipride or levosulpiride or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
