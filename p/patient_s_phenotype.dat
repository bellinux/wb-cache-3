40|$|CONTEXT: Patients with {{sickle cell}} anemia (SCA) are {{frequently}} transfused with red blood cells (RBC). Recently, we reported that the calculated risk of RBC alloimmunization per transfused unit in Brazilian patients with SCA is 1. 15 %. We describe a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) presenting as a painful crisis in a patient with SCA. CASE REPORT: A 35 -year-old Brazilian female with homozygous SCA was admitted for a program of partial exchange transfusion prior to cholecystectomy. Her blood group was O RhD positive and no atypical RBC alloantibody was detected using the indirect antiglobulin technique. Pre-transfusional hemoglobin (Hb) was 8. 7 g/dL and isovolumic partial exchange transfusion was performed using 4 units of ABO compatible packed RBC. Five days after the last transfusion she developed generalized joint pain and fever of 39 °C. Her Hb level dropped from 12. 0 g/dL to 9. 3 g/dL and the unconjugated bilirrubin level rose to 27 mmol/L. She was jaundiced and had hemoglobinuria. Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed 48. 7 % HbS, 46. 6 % HbA 1, 2. 7 % HbA 2, and 2. 0 % HbF. The <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> extended RBC <b>phenotype</b> was CDe, K-k+, Kp(a-b+), Fy(a-b-), M+N+s+, Le(a+b-), Di(a-). An RBC alloantibody with specificity to the Rh system (anti-c, titer 1 : 16. 384) was identified by the indirect antiglobulin test. The Rh phenotype of the RBC used in the last packed RBC transfusion was CcDEe. The patient was discharged, asymptomatic, 7 days after admission.

40|$|Repeated use of {{glyphosate}} {{has resulted}} in evolution of glyphosate-resistant Lolium rigidum populations in Australia. The relative growth, competitiveness and reproductive output of glyphosate resistant (R) and susceptible (<b>S)</b> L. rigidum <b>phenotypes</b> from a single population were compared in competition with wheat. Vegetative growth of R and S individuals was studied in response surface experiments in the glasshouse and seed production was measured using an additive neighbourhood design experiment conducted in pots outside during the normal growing season of L. rigidum in Australia. There {{were no significant differences}} in vegetative growth or competitiveness of the R and the <b>S</b> <b>phenotypes.</b> The mean weight of seeds produced by R plants was significantly greater than that produced by S individuals. In the absence of wheat and at tow wheat densities, S plants produced more seeds than R plants. However, at higher crop densities, differences in seed production were not significant. This is the first study to compare components of fitness at key life history stages for glyphosate R and <b>S</b> <b>phenotypes</b> isolated from a single weed population. The results presented indicate important differences in resource allocation during the reproductive stage for R and <b>S</b> <b>phenotypes.</b> Subtle differences in life history strategies may be manipulated by agronomic management to exploit the potential ecological fitness costs of the R phenotype. Further studies are required to provide a greater understanding of the occurrence and extent of fitness costs associated with glyphosate resistance. This knowledge can then be incorporated into models that simulate resistance evolution to design management strategies to prevent and/or contain the spread of glyphosate resistance.

The ability of S. enterica to produce hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is an important phenotypic characteristic used to screen and identify Salmonella with selective medium; however, H 2 S-negative Salmonella have recently emerged. In this study, the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>phenotype</b> of Salmonella isolates was confirmed, and the selected isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular identification by multilocus sequence typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) analysis. The phs genetic operon was also analyzed. A total of 160 S. enterica serovar Aberdeen isolates were detected between 2005 and 2013 in China. Of them, seven non-H 2 S-producing isolates were detected. Notably, four samples yielded four pairs of isolates with different H 2 <b>S</b> <b>phenotypes,</b> simultaneously. The data demonstrated that H 2 S-negative isolates were genetically closely related to H 2 S-positive isolates. Three new spacers (Abe 1, Abe 2, and Abe 3) were identified in CRISPR locus 1 in four pairs of isolates with different H 2 <b>S</b> <b>phenotypes</b> from the same samples. Sequence analysis revealed a new nonsense mutation at position 208 in the phsA gene of all non-H 2 S-producing isolates. Additionally, we describe a new screening procedure to avoid H 2 S-negative Salmonella, which would normally be overlooked during laboratory and hospital screening. The prevalence of this pathogen may be underestimated; therefore, it is important to focus on improving surveillance of this organism to control its spread...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHuman face {{perception}} {{requires a}} network of brain regions distributed throughout the occipital and temporal lobes with a right hemisphere advantage. Present theories consider this network as either a processing hierarchy beginning with the inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area; IOG-faces/OFA) or a multiple-route network with nonhierarchical components. The former predicts that removing IOG-faces/OFA will detrimentally affect downstream stages, whereas the latter does not. We tested this prediction in a human <b>patient</b> (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P.) requiring removal of the right inferior occipital cortex, including IOG-faces/OFA. We acquired multiple fMRI measurements in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before and after a preplanned surgery and multiple measurements in typical controls, enabling both within-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before resection vs <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after resection) and between-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. vs controls). We found that the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream ipsilateral face-selective regions were stable 1 and 8 month(s) after surgery. Additionally, the reliability of distributed patterns of face selectivity in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before versus after resection was not different from across-session reliability in controls. Nevertheless, postoperatively, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1 of the resected hemisphere. Diffusion weighted imaging in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. and controls identifies white matter tracts connecting retinotopic areas to downstream face-selective regions, which {{may contribute to the}} stable and plastic features of the face network in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after surgery. Together, our results support a multiple-route network of face processing with nonhierarchical components and shed light on stable and plastic features of high-level visual cortex following focal brain damage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain networks consist of interconnected functional regions commonly organized in processing hierarchies. Prevailing theories predict that damage to the input of the hierarchy will detrimentally affect later stages. We tested this prediction with multiple brain measurements in a rare human patient requiring surgical removal of the putative input to a network processing faces. Surprisingly, the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream face-selective regions are stable after surgery. Nevertheless, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1. White matter connections from outside the face network may support these stable and plastic features. As processing hierarchies are ubiquitous in biological and nonbiological systems, our results have pervasive implications for understanding the construction of resilient networks...|$|R

Much evidence {{has shown that}} carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can restrain bone resorption. We had detected increased expression of carbonic anhydrase I (CA 1) in synovium of patients with AS. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of methazolamide, an anti-carbonic anhydrase drug, for treating patients with AS. Methods: Two <b>patients,</b> called as <b>S</b> and L, were diagnosed with active AS based on BASDAI and BASFI assessments, radiographic data and other clinical indices. They took methazolamide tablets at a dose of 25 mg twice every day. Results : <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASDAI score fell from 5. 4 to 4. 4, while patient L's BASDAI fell from 2. 4 to 2. <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASFI score change from 2. 7 to 2. 9, while patient L's BASFI score fell from 1. 2 to 0. 2. The ESR values of <b>patient</b> <b>S</b> were considerably reduced, while the ESR value of patient L remained unchanged and in the normal range. The calcium concentration of <b>patient</b> <b>S</b> decreased from 3. 05 mmol/L to 2. 39 mmol/L. The CT evidence indicates that the articular surfaces of the erosive sacroiliac joints became clearer and the area of the calcium deposits began decreased. No significant systemic side effects were observed in either patient. Conclusions: The above results indicate that methazolamide was effective for active AS.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{function}} of conflict prevention performed by keywords and key-expressions within medical consultations. Doctor-patient interaction within medical consultations {{can be interpreted as}} a problem-solving discussion, as it is oriented to the solution of a certain health problem. As such, medical consultations are based on an argumentative discussion, in which, roughly speaking, both parties try to reason together in order to find a solution for the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health problem. In this sense, a non-mixed dispute (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 2004) often arises, in which doctor and patient discuss a standpoint, normally advanced by the doctor, about the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> diagnosis or therapy. Problem-solving, however, is not the only possible interaction scheme (Rigotti and Rocci 2006) that can be involved in doctor-patient consultations. Indeed, other more confrontational interaction schemes are possible, which may also tend to real controversies; these cases are often triggered by the asymmetry of competences and knowledge which is typical of the relationship between doctors and patients. Such situations, of course, affect the quality of the consultation, because the issue at stake ceases to be the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health, and becomes the relationship between the patient and the doctor (in terms of trust, reliability, etc.). Ultimately, this may have negative effects on the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health and, thus, more in general, may contradict the raison d être of the health system. Thus during the medical consultation conflicts need to be avoided both by doctor and patient. The choice of keywords and key-expressions appears to be a crucial step within a strategy of conflict prevention. In fact, thanks to their close link to the relevant endoxa, their ability to trigger inferences, and their centrality within the argumentative structure of persuasive texts, keywords can be very important tools in the creation of emotive arguments and the prevention of conflict. Relying on examples from real-life consultations, this paper shows how keywords and key-expressions realize this function...|$|R

The results indicate that Symphysodon is composed of four genetic groups: group PURPLE—phenotype Heckel and abacaxi; group GREEN—phenotype green; group RED—phenotype blue and brown; and group PINK—populations of Xingú and Cametá. Although the phenotypes blue and brown are predominantly biological group RED, they also have substantial contributions from other biological groups, and the patterns of admixture of the two phenotypes are different. The two phenotypes are further characterized by distinct and divergent mtDNA haplotype groups, and show differences in mean habitat use measured as pH and conductivity. Differences in mean habitat use is also observed between most other biological groups. We therefore conclude that Symphysodon comprises five evolutionary significant units: Symphysodon discus (Heckel and abacaxi <b>phenotypes),</b> <b>S.</b> aequifasciatus (brown <b>phenotype),</b> <b>S.</b> tarzoo (green <b>phenotype),</b> Symphysodon sp. 1 (blue phenotype) and Symphysodon sp. 2 (Xingú group) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:The {{association}} of sarcoidosis (S) and thyroid autoimmunity {{has been reported}} by several studies {{in a wide range}} of variability. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of clinical and subclinical thyroid disorders in <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> vs gender-matched and age-matched control subjects. METHODS:Thyroid hormones and antithyroid antibodies, thyroid ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration were performed in 111 <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> who had been consecutively referred to the Respiratory Pathophysiology Section of the University of Pisa, and the results were compared to 333 gender-matched and age-matched control subjects from the same geographic area. RESULTS:The odds ratio for subclinical hypothyroidism for female <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> vs control subjects was 2. 7 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 3 to 5. 9); for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody titer (AbTPO) positivity, 2. 2 (95 % CI, 1. 2 to 3. 9); and for thyroid autoimmunity, 1. 9 (95 % CI, 1. 1 to 3. 2). The mean values of thyroid-stimulating hormone and AbTPO were higher in female <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects (p < 0. 01). A significantly higher prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism (four patients) and Graves disease (three patients) was observed in female <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects (none; p = 0. 005 and 0. 0026, respectively). Two cases of papillary thyroid cancer were detected in <b>S</b> <b>patients.</b> No significant difference between <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> and control subjects was detected for free triiodothyronine and thyroxine, antithyroglobulin autoantibodies, thyroid volume and nodularity, and subclinical hyperthyroidism. CONCLUSIONS:Thyroid function, AbTPO antibodies, and ultrasonography should be tested as part of the clinical profile in female <b>S</b> <b>patients.</b> Subjects who are at high risk (female subjects, those with positive AbTPOs, and those with hypoechoic and small thyroid) should have thyroid function follow-up and appropriate treatment in due course...|$|R

Prioritized biomarkers were evaluated in a case-control study of 156 <b>patients</b> with <b>S.</b> aureus or Gram-negative bloodstreams infections using serum samples collected within 1 - 3 days of empiric antibiotic therapy.|$|R
40|$|Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a {{surgical}} intervention {{that is known}} to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of common movement disorders, such as Parkinson. s disease, dystonia, or tremor. During the intervention the surgeon places electrodes inside of the <b>patient.</b> <b>s</b> brain to stimulate speci. c regions. Since these regions span {{only a couple of}} millimeters, and electrode misplacement has severe consequences, reliable and accurate navigation is of great importance. Usually the surgeon relies on fused CT and MRI data sets, as well as direct feedback from the patient. More recently Microelectrode Recordings (MER), which support navigation by measuring the electric. eld of the <b>patient.</b> <b>s</b> brain, are also used. We propose a visualization system that fuses the different modalities: imaging data, MER and patient checks, as well as the related uncertainties, in an intuitive way to present placement-related information in a consistent view with the goal of supporting the surgeon in the. nal placement of the stimulating electrode. We will describe the design considerations for our system, the technical realization, present the outcome of the proposed system, and provide an evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Every day {{in medical}} care the nurse {{and the patient}} meet, they are not just {{represented}} as the care giver and the care taker, but also as two unique individuals. The meeting {{is a very important}} part in caring and few studies have been made on this topic from the <b>patient.</b> <b>s</b> perspective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the <b>patient.</b> <b>s</b> perspective on the meeting with the nurse. The study is a literature review, where articles have been reviewed, encoded, and then categorized. The result builds on our four main categories, confirmed as a unique indidual, the meaning of the information according to the patient, the humanistic side of the nurse, and the importance of humor in the meeting. The patients. experiences of the meeting with the nurse are presented under these categories. To be treated as a unique individual was the main conclusion of this study. Furthermore, the information, and how the nurse gave the information, was of great importance in order for the patient to feel security...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{deficits and}} mood {{alterations}} {{are present in}} Schizophrenic <b>patients</b> (<b>S).</b> Since Artherapy (AT) stimulates emotional and attentional processes, necessary to realize an art product, this study was aimed to evaluate the effects of an AT treatment on attention and mood in <b>S</b> <b>patient.</b> 20 <b>S</b> {{took part in the}} study; they were dived into an experimental group (EG), submitted to AT treatment, and a Control group (CG). The two groups were no different in age, pathology beginning, pharmacology therapy (PT). Patients were submitted to an AT laboratory (lasting about two hours) every week, for one year. Before and after AT treatment, patients completed two Letter Cancellation Tasks (LCT), with both a low (LCT. 2 L) and a high attentional load (LCT. 3 L). Patients also completed mood visual analogue scales. Results showed an attentional improvement only for EG in both LCT. 2 L (accuracy:p<. 03; speed:p<. 03) and LCT. 3 L (accuracy:p<. 01, speed:p<. 004).
