In order to accommodate the intended uses of acetamiprid, Greece proposed to raise the existing MRLs of acetamiprid from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in purslane, from 0. 01 * mg/kg in peas (with pods) and 0. 06 mg/kg in beans (with pods) to 0. 5 mg/kg, from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 0. 05 mg/kg in beans (without pods) and from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 1 mg/kg in pulses (dry beans and peas). Greece drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 15 mg/kg on beans (with pods), 0. 4 mg/kg on peas (with pods), 0. 07 mg/kg on beans (without pods), 0. 15 mg/kg on <b>peas</b> (<b>without</b> <b>pods)</b> and 0. 07 mg/kg on pulses (dry beans and peas); these MRL proposals reflect the intended uses in southern EU only. In addition, a MRL proposal for purslane (3 mg/kg) was derived by extrapolation from trials on lettuce. A deficiency was noted in some trials concerning the storage conditions of the samples prior analysis. Information needs to be provided to confirm that samples were effectively stored under conditions for which integrity of residues is demonstrated. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of acetamiprid in the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess appropriate means of nursery propagation and to evaluate field adaptation and carbon sequestration potential of Pistacia chinensis- a root stock for edible nut bearing pistachio. The trial was conducted at Debre Zeit and Wondo Genet in 2006. Matured seeds of the species with protective seed coats were sown on standard soil mixture (SSM) that comprised 3 % top soil, 2 % cow dung and 1 % sand and their germination was compared with seeds with protective seed pods that were sown on composted farm yard manure (FYM). Two independent experiments were conducted in completely randomized design with four replications, each replication containing one hundred pure viable seeds. Mean comparisons of germination percentages revealed highly significant differences between the treatments (seeds with protective seed coats sown on farm yard manure) and control groups (seeds with protective seed coats sown on standard soil mixture) at P< 0. 05. Thus, the most viable means of propagating Pistacia chinensis under the nursery conditions of Debre Zeit was sowing seeds with pods on farm yard manure. In a separate experiment, seeds <b>without</b> <b>pods</b> were also sown in replicates on standard soil mixture and their germination was compared with that of intact seeds (Seeds with their pods) sown on standard soil mixture.

This experiment was carried out in a completely randomised design with five water regimes (control, S 4, S 5, S 6 and S 8) and four replicates. The water stress was exerted by withholding irrigation and placing the pots under a rain shelter at different growth stages starting with the onset of flowering (S 4) and ending with the completion of flowering (S 8). Wild radish pods from all the treatments were collected fortnightly from November 11 to December 23, 2005 (four collection dates). Seed dormancy was tested with and <b>without</b> <b>pod</b> for all treatments in January and May 2005.

Based on UPFC configuration, an additional series boosting transformer is considered to define a GUPFC configuration and its mathematical model; Phillips-Heffron scheme is used to formulate machine model, and modification of network dealing with GUPFC parameter is carried out to develop a MIMO as well as comprehensive power system with GUPFC model. Genetics Algorithm method was proposed to lead-lag compensation design, this technique provides the parameter controller. The controller produced supplementary signals, the PSS for machine and POD for GUPFC. By applying a small disturbance, the dynamic stability power system was investigated.

50|$|From a {{clinical}} perspective {{the most important}} and promising indications for PEA are linked to neuropathic and chronic pain states, such as diabetic neuropathic pain, sciatic pain, CRPS, pelvic pain and entrapment neuropathic painstates. In a blind pilot trial in 25 patients affected by temporomandibular joint's (TMJ) osteoarthritis or synovitis pain, patients were randomly to PEA or ibuprofen 600 mg three times a day for two weeks. Pain decrease after two weeks of treatment was significantly higher in PEA treated patients than in patients receiving the NSAID (p=0.0001) Masticatory function also improves more on PEA compared to the NSAID. In 2012, 20 patients suffering from thalidomide and bortezomib induced neuropathy were reported to have improved nerve functions and less pain after a two months treatment with PEA 600 mg daily. The authors pointed out that although a placebo effect might {{play a role in the}} reported pain relief, the changes in neurophysiological measures clearly indicated that PEA exerted a positive action on the myelinated fibre groups. 30 patients suffering from neuropathic pain, which were refractory to treatment with analgesics, included pregabalin, were responding well in 45 days, with a decrease of painscores > 50% when pregabalin was tapered in again, up to 600 mg/day in combination with <b>PEA,</b> <b>without</b> signs of drug-drug interaction. In 2013 a review was published on the clinical efficacy and safety of PEA in flu, based on a 6 double blind placebo controlled RCT's. This review underscores the anti-inflammatory action of PEA.

40|$|Objective: Postoperative {{delirium}} (POD) is {{a frequent}} complication after surgery and its occurrence is associated with poor outcomes. The pathophysiology of this complication is not clear, but identification of risk factors is important for positive postoperative outcomes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the associations between the preoperative expression levels of microRNA (miR) - 146 a, miR- 125 b, and miR- 181 c in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum and the development and severity of POD. Methods: Forty elderly patients aged 65 years old and older admitted for elective total hip/knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. Preoperatively, baseline cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Each patient was interviewed daily on the first and second postoperative days. Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method, and delirium severity was measured using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Preoperative serum and CSF miR levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: POD was detected in 27. 5 % (11 / 40) of patients. Up-regulation of miR- 146 a and miR- 181 c in CSF and down-regulation of miR- 146 a in serum were observed preoperatively in patients who developed POD, while patients with and <b>without</b> <b>POD</b> did not differ in serum or CSF levels of miR- 125 b. Delirious patients had higher CSF/serum ratios of miR- 146 a and miR- 181 c levels than non-delirious patients. The lower CSF miR- 146 a and CSF/serum miR- 146 a ratios were significantly associated with milder POD severity, represented by a lower MDAS score. Conclusion: The dysregulation of preoperative miR- 146 a and miR- 181 c in CSF and serum was associated with the development and severity of POD. These NeurimmiRs might participate in the neuropathogenesis of POD, pending further investigations.

40|$|Background: Postoperative {{delirium}} (POD) is {{a common}} complication in elderly patients undergoing surgery, but the underpinning causes are not clear. We hypothesized that inflammaging, the subclinical low and chronic grade inflammation characteristic of old people, can contribute to POD onset. Accordingly, we investigated the association of preoperative and circulating cytokines in elderly patients (> 65 yrs), admitted for elective and emergence surgery. Methods: This is secondary analysis of a sub-cohort of patients belonging to a previous large case-control study, where 351 patients were clinically and cognitively thoroughly characterized, together with the assessment of POD (47 patients) by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Delirium Rating Scale (DRS). 74 preoperative plasma samples were selected from a larger bio-bank and they included 37 subjects with <b>POD</b> and 37 <b>without</b> <b>POD.</b> Inflammaging related cytokines, i. e. IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10 and TNF-α were assayed by ELISA in pre-operative blood samples; univariate and multivariable analyses have been applied to identify cytokines independently associated to POD. Associations of cytokine levels with functional status, cognitive decline, intra-hospital mortality and comorbidity were also analyzed independently of POD onset. Results:. High IL- 6 and low IL- 2 levels {{were significantly associated with}} POD. After adjustment for potential confounders in multivariate analysis, high level of preoperative IL- 6 was confirmed to be significantly associated with risk of POD onset [...] High level of IL- 6 was also associated with several baseline features (including poor functional status, cognitive impairment, emergency admission and higher comorbidity burden) and intra-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Preoperative, high plasma level of IL- 6 (≥ 9 pg/mL) was significantly associated with POD onset. We propose IL- 6 as an additional risk factor of POD onset together with the previously identified factors. Discovery of all ris...|$|R

Brain enzymatic activity of FAAH and the endogenous levels of its substrates, anandamide (AEA; Narachidonoylethanolamine), 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), and Npalmitoylethanolamine (PEA), were measured in control and ST 4070 - treated mice. ST 4070 (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg) was orally administered to assess mechanical nociceptive thresholds and allodynia by using the Randall-Selitto and von Frey tests, respectively. Neuropathy was induced in rats by either the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine or streptozotocin-induced diabetes, whereas the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model was chosen to evaluate neuropathy in mice. ST 4070 produced a significant increase of nociceptive threshold in rats and counteracted the decrease of nociceptive threshold in the three distinct models of neuropathic pain. In diabetic mice, ST 4070 inhibited FAAH activity and increased the brain levels of AEA and <b>PEA,</b> <b>without</b> affecting that of 2 -AG. The administration of ST 4070 generated long-lasting pain relief compared with pregabalin and the FAAH inhibitors 1 -oxo- 1 [5 -(2 -pyridyl) - 2 -yl]- 7 -phenylheptane (OL 135) and cyclohexylcarbamic acid 3 �-carbamoylbiphenyl- 3 - ylester (URB 597) in CCI neuropathic mice. The antiallodynic effects of ST 4070 were prevented by pretreatment with cannabinoid type 1 and cannabinoid type 2 receptor antagonists and by the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor � antagonist [(2 S) - 2 - [[(1 Z) - 1 -methyl- 3 -oxo- 3 -[4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]- 1 -propenyl-]amino]- 3 -[4 -[2 -(5 -methyl- 2 -phenyl- 4 -oxazolyl) ethoxy]phenyl-]propyl]-carbamic acid ethyl ester (GW 6471). The administration of ST 4070 generated long-lasting neuropathic pain relief compared with pregabalin and the FAAH inhibitors OL 135 and URB 597. Taken together, the reversible FAAH inhibitor ST 4070 {{seems to be a}} promising nov...|$|R
