5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
25|$|No one {{can confirm}} when {{the concept of}} Taiwanization has started. Some <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> when {{the first wave of}} large Han People {{immigration}} decided to leave from mainland China to Taiwan in the mid-16th-century, then they must have had some concept to maintain some independence from the control of ruling class in their original hometown. And some other <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> not until the Kingdom of Tungning, with its capital at Tainan, had been built by Zheng Family in 1662, this kind of concept hasn't appeared.|$|E

He was {{supposed}} to get enrolled in University of California, Berkeley but for some unknown reasons he did not take admission in any college. In a historical note by Baba Jwala Singh, what mentioned is that when i went to Astoria, Oregon in December 1912 i found Kartar Singh working in a mill factory. Most of the <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that he studied in the respective college but the college itself did not get any record of enrollment with his name.|$|E

500|$|In the 1500m final race, {{with one}} lap {{remaining}} and currently in second place, Ohno {{attempted to make}} a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno raised his arms to signal he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm not going to say any more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. A lot of <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> it was right and a lot of <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> it's wrong. I've seen moves like that before that were not called. But I've seen them called too".|$|E
500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What {{are they going to}} do with all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect 2 was {{developed}} by BioWare and directed by Casey Hudson, who previously led {{the production of the}} first Mass Effect game. Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers and internal people. The company's main goal was to [...] "create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience." [...] In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities. He noted, [...] "the funny thing is that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> 'other than gathering your crew and building your team and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.' But that is the story." ...|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E
2500|$|During South Africa's 2008 tour of England Harris' bowling {{style was}} derided by English {{commentator}} and former player Geoffrey Boycott as being [...] "buffet" [...] bowling.

2500|$|One of Abu Zubaydah's FBI interrogators, Ali Soufan, wrote a {{book about}} his experiences. He later testified to Congress that Zubaydah was {{producing}} useful information in response to conventional interrogation methods, including the names of Sheikh Mohammed and Jose Padilla. He stopped providing accurate information in response to harsh techniques. Soufan, one of the FBI's most successful interrogators, explained, [...] "When they are in pain, <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> anything to get the pain to stop. Most of the time, they will lie, make up anything to make you stop hurting them. That means the information you're getting is useless." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, 2010, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich {{stated that}} Obama {{could only be}} {{understood}} by people who [...] "understand Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior". While Gingrich did not define what constitutes [...] "Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior", White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs accused Gingrich of [...] "trying {{to appeal to the}} fringe of people who don't believe the president was born in this country". Gibbs went on to say, [...] "You would normally expect better of somebody who held the position of Speaker of the House, but look, it is political season, and most <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> anything, and Newt Gingrich does that on a, genuinely, on a regular basis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manchester United {{were unable}} to defend their FA Cup title the {{following}} season, having instead been invited {{to compete in the}} inaugural FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil. The Football Association (FA) encouraged the club {{to take part in the}} new tournament as they believed it would help their bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Alex Ferguson initially suggested that The FA could allow his team a bye to a later round of the competition to help alleviate the fixture congestion that would arise from entering both competitions, but the FA suggested that Manchester United simply pull out of the FA Cup altogether, putting the club in what chairman Martin Edwards called a [...] "no-win" [...] situation. Edwards said: [...] "We're going to get criticised whatever we do. If we don't go <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that we are selfish and only looking after ourselves and not prepared to help the 2006 World Cup bid. But we will also be criticised if we say we're not going to compete in the FA Cup." [...] The offer was also criticised by Manchester United fans, with Andy Walsh of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association saying: [...] "They've shown very little offer of help in the past when United have looked to ease their fixture congestion. This blinding conversion is all to do with the 2006 campaign." ...|$|E

2500|$|Xu Wen {{continued}} {{to maintain control}} of the Wu governance. [...] This led to resentment {{by a number of}} Wu's senior generals — Liu Wei (劉威) the military governor of Zhennan Circuit, Tao Ya (陶雅) the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of She Prefecture (歙州, in modern Huangshan, Anhui), Li Yu (李遇) the governor of Xuan Prefecture (宣州, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), and Li Jian (李簡) the prefect of Chang Prefecture (常州, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) — each of whom had greater accomplishments and had higher standing in the army than Xu did when Yang Xingmi was alive. [...] Li Yu was particularly unhappy, often stating, [...] "Who is this Xu Wen? [...] I do not even remember his face, and now he is ruling the state!" [...] On an occasion when the officer Xu Jie was on a diplomatic mission to Wu's southeastern neighbor Wuyue, Xu Wen had Xu Jie stop by in Xuan Prefecture to try to persuade Li Yu to show submission by going to Guangling to pay homage to Yang Longyan. [...] Li Yu initially agreed, but Xu Jie inadvertently stated, [...] "If you, Lord, do not do so, <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that you are committing treason." [...] Li Yu angrily responded, [...] "You, sir, are saying that I, Li Yu, am treasonous. [...] Is it not more treasonous to murder the Shizhong ?" [...] When Xu Wen heard this, he became angry and sent the general Chai Zaiyong (柴再用), with Xu Wen's adoptive son Xu Zhigao serving as Chai's deputy, to attack Li Yu at Xuan. [...] Li Yu's initially was able to hold against Chai's attacks, but Xu Wen put Li Yu's youngest son, who was serving as an officer at Huainan headquarters, under arrest, and had him displayed at the army. [...] Xu Wen then sent the official He Rao (何蕘) to, in Yang Longyan's name, state to Li Yu: [...] "If you, Lord, are planning on rebelling, please execute He Rao to show yourself. [...] Otherwise, follow him out of the city." [...] Li Yu thus surrendered. [...] Xu Wen had Chai kill Li Yu and slaughter his household, and it was said that after this event, all the generals were fearful of Xu and did not dare to resist him further.|$|E
