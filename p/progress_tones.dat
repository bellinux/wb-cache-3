50|$|In telephony, call <b>progress</b> <b>tones</b> are audible tones {{that provide}} an {{indication}} of the status of a telephone call to the user. The tones are generated by a central office or a private branch exchange (PBX) to the calling party.|$|E
50|$|Novation also {{introduced}} an internal direct-connect modem, the Apple-CAT II, which plugged into an expansion slot in an Apple II computer. Due {{to the internal}} connection, the APPLE-CAT II was able to feature {{a full range of}} dialing commands, and could report a wide range of call <b>progress</b> <b>tones</b> (BUSY, REORDER, etc.) that many modems still lack today. These operations were handled directly by software on the host computer; the modem set certain registers when tones were heard on the line, by timing when these registers were set or clear, the software could determine what was happening on the line.|$|E
50|$|The reorder tone, {{also known}} as the fast busy tone, or the {{congestion}} tone, or all trunks busy (ATB) tone is an audible call <b>progress</b> <b>tone</b> in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) that isreturned to a calling party to indicate that the call cannot be processed through the network.|$|R
50|$|A call <b>progress</b> <b>tone</b> is {{a pattern}} of audible tones played to the caller in a {{telephone}} call, conveying {{the status of the}} call. ToneScript describes the pattern of frequency, cadence, and level of the signal. Many Internet telephony devices support configuration options for users to customize the tones, but standard patterns are provided for various telephone administrations. ToneScript is used in Sipura, Linksys and Cisco family of IP telephony products.|$|R
50|$|The {{magnificent}} {{stained glass}} {{was created by}} Marguerite Huré using colored coatings on clear glass for economy. The colors are dominated by blues near the entry and <b>progress</b> to warmer <b>tones</b> in the sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|As {{the series}} <b>progress</b> the <b>tone</b> {{of the series}} becomes less crime-focused and becomes more a gag comedy with strong touches of eroticism. The series was {{originally}} conceived by Nagai {{as a form of}} protest and parody of the controversy that arose with Harenchi Gakuen. While having a grim tone at the beginning, the series lightens up as it progresses, although the graphic violence remains through most of it but becoming less frequent.|$|R
5000|$|In {{western music}} theory, a {{diatonic}} scale is a heptatonic scale that includes five whole steps (whole tones) and two half steps (semitones) in each octave, {{in which the}} two half steps are separated from each other by either two or three whole steps, depending on their position in the scale. This pattern ensures that, in a diatonic scale spanning more than one octave, all the half steps are maximally separated from each other (i.e. separated by at least two whole steps). The word [...] "diatonic" [...] comes from the Greek , meaning <b>progressing</b> through <b>tones.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Yet this deterritorialization {{does not}} seem to have erased the {{tensions}} surrounding race and culture. The third poem, “The Fountain Outside the Arboretum” at first appears to depict the purity and beauty of the Desert and its people, as it illustrates and emphasizes the whiteness of one’s teeth: “Ahoy! Whitening wadder fountain…Afta cuppa-ful o aqua vitae, yo pissin fang transfomate to puh’ly whites”. However, as the poem <b>progresses,</b> the <b>tone</b> gradually transforms into something more sarcastic and biting. The Guide refers to the scientific ingredients of the water, “H2O with fluoride y sulfate y tu typical humectant lika xylitol,” [...] which almost sounds as if she has bitter feelings toward the Western modernist emphasis on science and technology.|$|R
50|$|Around issue 35, {{the comic}} {{began to develop}} a more {{polished}} look, with brighter highlights and sleeker lines. Onwards from 35, Haque has continued to develop this sleek, shiny appearance in the comic, lending itself {{to the establishment of}} such characters as Eve, who, being artificial, requires a slightly sharper, more technological look than the human cast. Also, as the comic <b>progressed,</b> the skin <b>tones</b> of several different characters darkened considerably.|$|R
5000|$|The comic debuted on June 26, 2005, and updates {{presently}} {{occur at}} the rate of approximately 1 pages per 2 months. The strip originally began in black and white, before converting to color in the thirtieth strip. The comic often employs humor related to metagaming in Dungeons & Dragons, such as a cleric praying to the all-powerful but nerdy Dungeon Master or characters arguing about {{whether or not they were}} subject to a random encounter. As the strip has <b>progressed,</b> the <b>tone</b> has become bleaker and the humor aspects have become less central than they were in early strips, although still present. In August 2006 Goblins joined Keenspot. In September 2006 it won Dragon Con's [...] "Most Outstanding New Webcartoonist" [...] award. A first bound volume of the webcomic is in print in North America and Europe, and contains a foreword by Dungeons and Dragons game designer Monte Cook. A second volume was released in 2009.|$|R
40|$|With {{a variety}} of themes and techniques, Philip F. O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s stories <b>progress</b> in <b>tone</b> from hopeful to nearly hopeless; in {{subjects}} from communal to private; in milieu from personal to cosmic. The early stories, set in San Francisco, suggest Mr. O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s Irish-American boyhood. Later stories sharply evoke the toughening experiences of adolescence. Finally, the stories enter an adult world where characters struggle desperately, often comically, in situations that are, at best, thinly hopeful. From the opening stories, which display a more traditional realistic mode, the fiction moves into lyricism and other experimental prose, with a striking effect on the reader 2 ̆ 7 s consciousness. Mr. O 2 ̆ 7 Connor skillfully uses language to activate the senses and to draw one into the characters. His style alters {{with the demands of}} each story. “Each story has its own reasons and its own music,” the author says. The origins of his short stories are not ideas, but fascination with characters. “What people do is what interests me, and fiction is about that. ”[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Yongning Na, {{also known}} as Mosuo, is a Sino-Tibetan {{language}} spoken in Southwest China. This book provides a description and analysis of its <b>tone</b> system, <b>progressing</b> from lexical <b>tones</b> towards morphotonology. Tonal changes permeate numerous aspects of the morphosyntax of Yongning Na. They are not {{the product of a}} small set of phonological rules, but of a host of rules that are restricted to specific morphosyntactic contexts. Rich morphotonological systems have been reported in this area of Sino-Tibetan, but book-length descriptions remain few. This study of an endangered language contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the diversity of prosodic systems in East Asia. The analysis is based on original fieldwork data (made available online), collected over the course of ten years, commencing in 2006. ...|$|R
5000|$|Stop {{consists}} of forty-two sections, each characterised {{by a different}} configuration of pitches, or by noises [...] The durations of these groups are related by proportions of Fibonacci numbers, while their pitches {{are based on a}} twelve-note [...] "central chord", within which a succession of nine single <b>tones</b> <b>progresses</b> gradually downward, alternating with a rising progression of six bichords that suddenly falls into the bass register for an ending, seventh bichord. Interspersed amongs these single and double pitches there are six trichords in a falling-rising pattern, four tetrachords in a jagged down-up-down shape, and two widely separated six-note chords in groups 9 and 41 [...] According to a different analysis, there are twelve central tones that gradually fall (with one deviation in the middle) {{over the course of the}} work :G6 B5 G5 A4 G4 D5 E4 D4 F3 C3 F2 C2.Near the end, a concealed children's song appears [...] "like wind", in agitated, dissonant tremolos over a solemn bass line [...] This tonal melody, introduced as a simulated short-wave radio signal, appears to be intended to provoke a strong emotional reaction [...]|$|R
40|$|The draft {{has been}} {{circulated}} among colleagues since 2012. A first version was {{deposited in the}} HAL-SHS archive in 2014 under the title "The tonal grammar of Yongning Na". The title was later changed to "Tone in Yongning Na: lexical tones and morphotonology". The draft was submitted for publication on June 1 st, 2016. Readers are most welcome to send me comments (alexis. michaud@cnrs. fr) This version is slightly improved from the submitted version (version 4 of the HAL deposit).
