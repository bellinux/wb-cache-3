50|$|Nevi are {{typically}} diagnosed clinically {{with the naked}} eye or using dermatoscopy. More advanced imaging tests are available for distinguishing melanocytic nevi from melanoma, including computerized dermoscopy and image analysis. The management of nevi depends on the type of nevus and the degree of diagnostic uncertainty. Some nevi are known to be benign, and may simply be monitored over time. Others may warrant more thorough examination and biopsy for histopathological examination (looking at a sample of skin under a microscope to detect unique cellular features). For example, a clinician may want to determine whether a <b>pigmented</b> <b>nevus</b> is a type of melanocytic nevus, dysplastic nevus, or melanoma as some of these skin lesions pose a risk for malignancy. The ABCDE criteria (asymmetry, border irregularity, color variegation, diameter > 6 mm, and evolution) are often used to distinguish nevi from melanomas in adults, while modified criteria (amelanosis, bleeding or bumps, uniform color, small diameter or de novo, and evolution) can be used when evaluating suspicious lesions in children. In addition to histopathological examination, some lesions may also warrant additional tests to aid in diagnosis, including special stains, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy.|$|E

PURPOSE: To qualify the spectral FT-Raman data, in order to differentiate cutaneous melanoma and <b>pigmented</b> <b>nevus.</b> METHODS: For this study, 10 samples of cutaneous melanoma, 9 samples of pigmented nevi, and 10 samples of normal skin were obtained by incisional biopsies performed during plastic surgeries ex vivo, immediately after removing the surgical sample. RESULTS: The FT-Raman spectra of each group presented a high correlation between the elements of the same group, thus favoring the elaboration of spectral averages. When analyzing the spectral standard of each group, the normal skin standard did not show a significant variation between the spectra; the standard of the pigmented nevi group showed significant variation, and the cutaneous melanoma group also showed variation. Through univariate analysis, specific bands were detected for each vibrational mode identified. The discriminatory analysis of the data showed a 75. 3 % efficiency of the differentiation between the three groups studied.

A 3 -year-old boy had a brownish black papule, 3 mm in diameter, on the dorsum of the first finger of his left hand, clinically diagnosed as a Reed nevus. Two follow-up examinations were performed after 3 and 6 months, when the lesion finally was excised for histopathologic examination.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{achieve a}} clinicopathologic {{classification}} of Spitz nevi by comparing their clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic features.

40|$|Objective: To {{achieve a}} clinicopathologic {{classification}} of Spitz nevi by comparing their clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic features. Design: Eighty-three cases were independently reviewed by 3 histopathologists and preliminarily classified into classic or desmoplastic Spitz nevus (CDSN, n = 11), <b>pigmented</b> Spitz <b>nevus</b> (PSN, n = 14), Reed nevus (RN, n = 16), or atypical Spitz nevus (ASN, n = 14); the remaining 28 cases were then placed into an intermediate category (<b>pigmented</b> Spitz-Reed <b>nevus,</b> PSRN) because a unanimous diagnosis of either PSN or RN was not reached. Setting: University dermatology and pathology departments and general hospital pathology departments. Patients: A sample of subjects with excised melanocytic lesions. Main Outcome Measure: Frequency of dermoscopic patterns within the different histopathologic subtypes of Spitz nevi. Results: Overlapping clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic findings were observed among PSN, RN, and PSRN, thereby justifying their inclusion into the single PSRN diagnostic category. Asymmetry {{was the most}} frequent indicator of histopathologic ASN (79 %; n = 11); in only 4 cases did dermoscopic asymmetry show no histopathologic counterpart, and in those cases the discrepancy was probably {{the result of an}} artifact of the gross sampling technique carried out with no attention to the dermoscopic. features. Conclusions: Among Spitz nevi, histopathologic distinction between PSN and. RN is difficult, not reproducible, and may be clinically useless. A simple clinicopathologic classification of these neoplasms might therefore be structured as CDSN, PSRN, and ASN. Asymmetry should be assessed using both dermoscopic and histopathologic analysis, and reliability in histopathologic diagnosis may be enhanced by the simultaneous evaluation of the corresponding dermoscopic images...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background - Deep {{penetrating}} nevus (DPN) is {{a distinct}} variant of melanocytic nevus and remains a histopathologic challenge to pathologists because of its resemblance to blue <b>nevus,</b> malignant melanoma, <b>pigmented</b> Spitz <b>nevus,</b> and congenital melanocytic nevus. It often goes unrecognized due to its relative rarity. Case presentation - Here we report a case of DPN of the left anterior leg in a 51 -year old female.

40|$|Early {{detection}} of malignant skin tumors, particularly malignant melanoma in childhood, {{which is most}} malignant of all, is of utmost importance for the prevention, treatment and outcome of the disease.
