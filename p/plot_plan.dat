50|$|Probably {{as early}} as 1834, after James Craft has {{purchased}} {{most of the land}} of Senator James Ross in Oakland, the area became known as Linden Grove. Bounded by the lands of Chadwick on the north, O’Hara or Schenley on the east, the bluffs on the south, and present day Bates Street on the west, the area may have been named Linden Grove by Craft. At least, he prepared a plan, never recorded. An 1859 <b>plot</b> <b>plan</b> calls much of Middle and Lower Oakland “Linden Grove” and so it continued until into the 20th century. An 1876 Atlas shows “Linden Station” on the Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad, about at Bates and Second Avenue. There may have been a recreational area here before the Civil War, and then during the Civil War, a training camp, known first as Linden Grove and later Camp Howe.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Mortimer Bates, Jr. (1887-1948) {{was born}} in Birmingham, Alabama and {{graduated}} from the University of Pennsylvania School of Architecture in 1911. The University of Pennsylvania, School of Architecture was established on October 7, 1890 {{and at the time}} was a leading architectural school in the United States wielding significant influence under a Beaux-Arts curriculum established first by the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Upon graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Bates obtained a competitive appointment to the Ecole des Beaux Arts and studied in the atelier of M. Bernier. While in Europe, Bates took a Grand Tour, further exposing himself to Greek, Roman, Italian Renaissance and Baroque elements. These architectural elements undoubtedly had an impact on Bates, as he laid out the <b>plot</b> <b>plan</b> for Mortimer Place, with its efficient use of space, common areas and wide ranging architectural styles.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMedieval {{and modern}} fiscal {{documents}} provide valuable {{information about the}} spatial organization of the countryside. They usually describe each plot, indicating the owner's name, the surface area, the land use, the neighbours, and the location. These lists, which contain hundreds of plots with their relative location, have great potential for analyzing the spatial pattern of village territories {{and the evolution of}} the landscape, especially when there is a series of successive documents for the same territory, as is often the case. Nevertheless, they have been dramatically under-exploited because it is difficult to reconstruct the landscape from fieldbooks without maps - and field-maps in France only appeared in the 17 th- 18 th centuries. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a model of plots described in fiscal documents based on the use of graph theory. The main idea is to take spatial information from registers and former <b>plot</b> <b>plans</b> and transform it into graphs. The translation of spatial data into graphs should allow a bridge to be created between mapped and unmapped historical documents. On these graphs, each plot corresponds to a vertex and each neighbourhood relationship (adjacency) - visible on a plan or described in the documents as a neighbour - to an edge. The work is carried out using two complementary approaches: the first focuses on establishing a database dealing with records without maps. The second extracts the graph from former <b>plot</b> <b>plans</b> in a Geographic Information System. The goal is to match the graphs produced by these two approaches in order to analyze spatial changes by comparing the graphs, which is not possible from plans or registers alone. First, the protocol to transform <b>plot</b> <b>plans</b> into graphs in the GIS will be developed. Secondly, we will consider the possibilities of comparing two graphs corresponding to two successive states in the GIS...|$|R
