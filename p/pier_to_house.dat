25|$|While Sea Side Park {{was going}} through the process of being incorporated, the Senate Amusement Company of Philadelphia was working on plans to build an oceanside {{attraction}} in Seaside Heights within feet of the border to Sea Side Park. Their plan was to build a covered <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>house</b> a carousel. The structure was built in 1915 under the direction of Joseph Vanderslice of Senate Amusement Company. Budget issues caused the business to not open in 1916, and the amusement ride and building was subsequently sold to Frank Freeman. The combination of the completion of the Toms River Bridge on October 23, 1914, and the DuPont Avenue carousel and boardwalk are what likely led to the 219% population growth shown between the 1910 and 1920 censuses in Sea Side Park.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 {{a wooden}} frame tower erected {{at the end}} of the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> <b>house</b> a light. This proved inadequate, and it was {{replaced}} with an iron tower in 1911. In 1913, work began on a new harbor inside the waterway, and in 1917 Congress appropriated $100,000 for a suite of new navigational aids, including this lighthouse to mark the outer end of the entrance way. Work on the structures began in 1919, and was completed in 1920. The fourth order Fresnel lens was transferred from the previous pierhead light to this one, and previous lights marking the mouth of the waterway were removed.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, over 600 BC Doukhobors {{were sentenced}} to three-year prison terms for public nudity. BC Penitentiary was unable to handle such a spike in the inmate population, so a {{satellite}} prison {{under the authority of}} the BC Penitentiary was constructed on <b>Piers</b> Island specifically <b>to</b> <b>house</b> these prisoners. When the majority of these sentences expired, the prison camp was closed and the remaining Doukhobor inmates were transferred to the main penitentiary.|$|R
60|$|In {{some places}} the dike seemed to widen, {{so as to}} make room for houses upon the top of it. There were snug little taverns, where the captains and crews of the vessels that were sailing by could stop and refresh themselves, when wind or tide bound in their vessels, and now and then a shop or store of some kind, or a row of pretty, though very queer-looking, cottages. At one place there was a ferry landing. The ferry house, {{together}} with the various buildings appertaining to it, was {{on the top of the}} dike, and a large pier, with a snug and pretty basin by the side of it, below. There was a flight of stairs leading up from the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> the ferry <b>house,</b> and also a winding road for carriages. At the time that the steamer went by this place, the ferry boat was just coming in with a carriage on board of it.|$|R

50|$|In July 2006, Hastings Borough Council, upon {{discovering}} {{that part of}} the pier's structure was unsafe, promptly closed the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> the general public. Protracted legal wranglings between the pier's owners, Ravenclaw Investments, and Hastings Borough Council followed. Finally, Stylus Sports, a pier tenant who operated the gaming attractions, in conjunction with Hastings Borough Council, funded much of the needed £300,000 of repairs, which enabled the court order closing the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> be lifted. This financial infusion enabled the majority of the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> reopen on 4 July 2007.|$|R
50|$|Phase I: Main Support Widening (Piers)In this phase, {{completed}} in May 2009, four river piers and one land <b>pier</b> were widened <b>to</b> support the additional lanes. Reinforcing framework and concrete filled the void {{sections of the}} <b>piers</b> <b>to</b> strengthen them. In addition, w-shaped metal bridge struts were anchored to {{the upper part of}} each <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> support the additional new trusses and the existing truss.|$|R

50|$|Other {{buildings}} {{built by}} Charles at Highgrove include beehive pavilions and a beef-yard designed by Willie Bertram, built in traditional Cotswold stone. Four semi-detached cottages dubbed 'the council houses' by Charles were also renovated. Highgrove House was given Grade II listed status in March 1985. In addition <b>to</b> the main <b>house,</b> the Coach <b>House</b> <b>to</b> the north west, and Lodge and Gate <b>Piers</b> <b>to</b> the east, were also given Grade II listed status.|$|R
2500|$|Like the <b>piers</b> <b>to</b> it south, its {{historic}} uses were superseded by containerization, {{and it was}} remodeled <b>to</b> <b>house</b> shops and restaurants. Triad Development bought the pier in 1995, and in the late 1990s it was remodeled as a headquarters for Go2Net, which was merged into InfoSpace, and fared poorly in the 2000–2001 crash that followed the dot-com bubble. Immediately before that remodel, in 1998 [...] was filmed there. Because the Central Waterfront piers are not zoned residential, the building was officially a 24-hour-a-day film set for the shoot.|$|R

50|$|Given the {{importance}} of shipping and water trade to the city, the Grand Haven Lighthouses were built in 1839 on the south <b>pier,</b> <b>to</b> mark the most navigable channel into the river. The current lighthouses, painted red, were built in 1875 (outer light) and 1905 (inner). They are connected by a lighted catwalk, which runs along the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> the shore.|$|R
50|$|Over a {{two year}} period {{starting}} in 1891 the pier was rebuilt in iron and {{the station was}} expanded <b>to</b> <b>house</b> two platforms and the facilities <b>to</b> allow the <b>pier</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} pleasure pier added. These facilities included a pavilion. The money for the pier's expansion came from part of a loan of £100,000 taken out by the harbour board which was also used to pay for dredging. The rebuilt pier was opened in 1902 by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In 1894 the gatehouse was expanded and four years later a new pontoon was added <b>to</b> the <b>pier</b> enabling two steamers to be berthed simultaneously. The addition of the new pontoon coincided with the <b>pier</b> being renamed <b>to</b> Royal Pier.|$|R
