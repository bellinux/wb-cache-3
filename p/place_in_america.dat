5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder of a popular local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E

500|$|Siegel and Shuster {{compared}} Superman's {{strength and}} leaping abilities {{to those of}} an ant and a grasshopper, respectively, as did Abednego for his son.

I was born there. All the men of Colorado are born as I was born and are like me. We are very strong. We are great fighters. We cannot be wounded except by the largest shells." [...] Other examples of similarities include both of their biological fathers are scientists (Jor-El and Abednego), both grow up in rural settings (Smallville and Indian Creek, Colorado), both are imbued with a strong moral compass from a young age both lift cars over their heads, and both hide their powers from the world.|$|E
500|$|Sam Winchester (Padalecki) is {{abducted}} by the yellow-eyed demon Azazel (Lehne) {{and taken to}} the abandoned town of Cold Oak, supposedly the most haunted <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>America.</b> Also placed there are Azazel's other [...] "psychic children"—young men and women whom the demon visited as babies, doing something that gives them supernatural abilities later in life—including Andy Gallagher (Gabriel Tigerman) and Ava Wilson (Katharine Isabelle), {{as well as new}} characters Lily (Jessica Harmon) and Jake Talley (Hodge). Ava had been abducted months earlier, but claims to have no knowledge of her whereabouts during the time gap. Lily tries to leave the town, but is killed by an Acheri demon, prompting the others to seek refuge in a building, protecting themselves from the demon with barriers of salt. As Dean Winchester (Ackles) and fellow hunter Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) head to Harvelle's Roadhouse—a saloon frequented by hunters—for help and find it burned to the ground with the body of hunter Ash (Chad Lindberg) buried in the wreckage, Andy uses his mind-control abilities to send Dean his location telepathically.|$|E
500|$|Municipalities {{suffered}} most, {{being forced}} to implement taxes, including the alcaba del viento (lit. [...] "wind tax"), which was imposed on foreign suppliers. However, these taxes barely helped, this was because each one had to receive a Royal certification, a bureaucratic procedure which usually lasted several years. Once they reached an established deadline, the process {{would have to be}} repeated, taking an extended amount of time. From January 1, 1636, to December 15, 1637, Philip IV of Spain imposed an obligatory payment to the treasuries in Puerto Rico. The debt was to be paid with currency symbolized by legalized papers bearing a Royal seal. Researchers believe that the use of these documents had an impact in the production of banknotes in Puerto Rico. In due time, these documents would be short in supply upon their arrival, in such cases the government officials would stamp the current date into old papers. Pedro Tomás de Cordova and Humberto Burzio claim in their research that Puerto Rico was the first <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> to print 8-real, establishing 1766 as the date for this achievement. Thus, putting Puerto Rico ahead by two decades before Cuba (1781), Hispaniola (1782) and even Spain (1783). Both researchers divided the first two types of banknotes issued, the two varieties were classified as [...] "issued" [...] and [...] "printed". Although both were manufactured using the same method, those referred to as [...] "printed" [...] bore stamps listing numbers and letters. In 1767, the Spanish Crown approved subsequent issues, conditioning that they should be collected once situado shipped. When this was lacking, paper money was used in a widespread manner throughout the main island. These requirements were met when possible, an example of this was in 1769, when 88,000 banknotes were reclaimed by the authorities.|$|E
