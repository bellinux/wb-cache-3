40|$|Recently an {{alternative}} way to quantify Bell nonlocality {{has been proposed}} [Phys. Rev. A 92, 030101 (R) (2015) ]. In this work we further develop this concept, the volume of violation, and analytically calculate its value for the spin-singlet state {{with respect to the}} settings of the first Bell's inequality. These settings correspond to three directions in space, or three arbitrary points on the unit sphere. It is shown that the triples of directions that lead to violations in local causality correspond to 1 / 3 of all possible configurations. From the perspective of quantum communications, this means that two distant parties that were capable of align their measurements in one direction only (the remaining direction in each site being random), have a probability of about 33. 3 % to be able to certify their entanglement.

This is a Web site in which one will show to a gallery of artisan exhibition with the works made by the craftsmen of Playas, impelling therefore the artisan manual labor {{of this part of}} the Ecuadorian coast, and obtaining the technological means inclusion that promotes these products. One appears in addition: • A brief description and photographies to the crafts. • A great variety of imitation jewellery done of tagua, nacre shell, shell to per it, seed of watermelon, crust of the Coco, leather, snails, diamonds of Brazil, stones of cat eye, to per it of river, chaquira, etc. • Crafts done in raft wood, as they are those of the naval strategy. • Crafts of Muyuyo and fabric of the Coco, etc. For the launching of this project it will be required approximately of an amount of initial investment of $ 9, 600. In period of 6 months investor will obtain his first income significant, his gains will grow vertiginously, since our site will be the point of attraction for the companies that buy and sell artisan products of the Playas Canton, which wished to <b>publicitar</b> itself and to comprise of the Web site...|$|E
