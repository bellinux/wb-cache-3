5000|$|The {{construction}} of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the [...] "formwork", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork {{to a depth of}} 10 to 25 cm and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height. The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall {{up to the top of}} the formwork. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing pneumatically <b>powered</b> <b>tampers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Many {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{consist of}} a large number of distributed sensor nodes that are batteries <b>powered,</b> vulnerable to <b>tampering,</b> and equipped with limited computational capabilities and memory. These characteristics render WSNs facing many security threats, which require cryptographic security mechanisms for secure communication, key revocation and management of security issues arising from the addition of new nodes. In this paper, we propose a key management scheme to meet the security requirements of {{wireless sensor networks}}. The scheme relies on the theory of random graph to build a fully secure connectivity for distributed sensor nodes. It uses heterogeneous structure to limit ranges of attacks, and utilizes hash chains to realize authentication of pool keys and broadcast messages of auxiliary nodes. The security and network connectivity characteristics supported by the key management scheme are discussed and simulation experiments are presented. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − Technical {{irregularities}} {{found in}} electrical power meters due to tampering, which {{are classified as}} fraud, {{are responsible for the}} most part of the energy loss experienced in the sector of electrical power distribution. The cost of energy theft is shared with all consumers in the form of non-technical losses. This work suits that context, by means of combating fraud in electric power meters in order to reduce losses due to the strengthening of effective punishment of cheaters. For that is proposed a systematization model of the process for verification of irregularities in electric power meters and the respective issuance of audit reports. The proposed systematization is based on a database containing standardized irregularities which were hierarchically arranged and also from information obtained from metrological calibration audits, thus ensuring the reliability of the results. The proposed model was tested in samples of <b>tampered</b> <b>power</b> meters provided by the electrical distribution utilities in southern Brazil. A main outcome of this research is a customized software that organizes the procedures of technical audit in a legally binding basis as applied to power meters. From the results of analysis conducted on sample power meters audited, it was possible to settle the software's report...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, secure {{cryptographic}} algorithms {{provide security}} against an adversary who has only black-box {{access to the}} secret information of honest parties. However, such models are not always adequate. In particular, the security of these algorithms may completely break under (feasible) attacks that tamper with the secret key. In this {{paper we propose a}} theoretical framework to investigate the algorithmic aspects related to tamper-proof security. In particular, we define a model of security against an adversary who is allowed to apply arbitrary feasible functions f to the secret key sk, and obtain the result of the cryptographic algorithms using the new secret key f(sk). We prove that in the most general setting it is impossible to achieve this strong notion of security. We then show minimal additions to the model, which are needed in order to obtain provable security. We prove that these additions are necessary and also sufficient for most common cryptographic primitives, such as encryption and signature schemes. We discuss the applications to portable devices protected by PINs and show how to integrate PIN security into the generic security design. Finally we investigate restrictions of the model in which the <b>tampering</b> <b>powers</b> of the adversary are limited. These restrictions model realistic attacks (like differential fault analysis) that have been demonstrated in practice. In these settings we show security solutions that work even without the additions mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new notion of {{cryptographic}} tamper evidence. A tamper-evident signature scheme provides an additional procedure Div which detects tampering: given two signatures, Div can determine whether {{one of them}} was generated by the forger. Surprisingly, this is possible even after the adversary has inconspicuously learned (exposed) some-or even all-the secrets in the system. In this case, it might be impossible to tell which signature is generated by the legitimate signer and which by the forger. But at least the fact of the tampering will be made evident. We define several variants of tamper-evidence, differing in their <b>power</b> to detect <b>tampering.</b> In all of these, we assume an equally powerful adversary: she adaptively controls all the inputs to the legitimate signer (i. e., all messages to be signed and their timing), and observes all his outputs; she can also adaptively expose all the secrets at arbitrary times. We provide tamper-evident schemes for all the variants and prove their optimality. Achieving the strongest tamper evidence turns out to be provably expensive. However, we define a somewhat weaker, but still practical, variant: α-synchronous tamper-evidence (α-te) and provide α-te schemes with logarithmic cost. Our α-te schemes use a combinatorial construction of α-separating sets, which might be of independent interest. We stress that our mechanisms are purely cryptographic: the tamper-detection algorithm Div is stateless and takes no inputs except the two signatures (in particular, it keeps no logs), we use no infrastructure (or other ways to conceal additional secrets), and we use no hardware properties (except those implied by the standard cryptographic assumptions, such as random number generators). Our constructions are based on arbitrary ordinary signature schemes and do not require random oracles...|$|R
