Jefferson opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of various states' debts by the federal government. Hamilton also had bold plans to establish the national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet.

60|$|She locked her door, {{threw herself}} in a chair; almost gasping for breath, she covered {{her face with her}} hands. It was some minutes before she {{recovered}} comparative composure; she rose and looked in the mirror; her face was quite white, but her eyes glittering with excitement. She walked up and down her room with a troubled step, and a scarlet flush alternately returned to and retired from her changing cheek. Then she leaned against a cabinet in thought. She was disturbed from her musings by the sound of Pauncefort's step along the vestibule, as she quitted her mother's chamber. In a few minutes Venetia herself stepped forth into the vestibule and listened. All was silent. The golden morning had summoned the whole household to its enjoyment. Not a voice, not a domestic sound, broke the complete stillness. Venetia again repaired to the apartment of Lady Annabel. Her step was light, but agitated; it seemed that she scarcely dared to breathe. She opened the door, rushed to the <b>cabinet,</b> <b>pressed</b> the spring lock, caught at something that it contained, and hurried again to her own chamber.|$|R
5000|$|Dr A. J. Cronin's {{controversial}} novel The Citadel, {{published in}} 1937, had fomented extensive {{concern about the}} severe inadequacies of health care. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels {{are said to have}} greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945. [...] The Emergency Hospital Service established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like. [...] A national health service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the Beveridge Report which Arthur Greenwood, Labour's Deputy Leader and wartime Cabinet Minister with responsibility for post-war reconstruction had successfully <b>pressed</b> the <b>cabinet</b> to commission from economist and social reformer William Beveridge. The coalition government accepted this assumption in February 1943, and after a White Paper in 1944 it fell to Clement Attlee's Labour government to create the NHS as part of the [...] "cradle to grave" [...] welfare-state reforms {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War. Aneurin Bevan, the newly appointed Minister of Health, was given the task of introducing the National Health Service. [...] Healthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific General Practice (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of National Insurance and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time. [...] Many doctors were initially opposed to Bevan's plan, primarily on the grounds that it reduced their level of independence. Bevan had to get them onside, as, without doctors, there would be no health service. Being a shrewd political operator, Bevan managed to push through the radical health care reform measure by dividing and cajoling the opposition, as well as by offering lucrative payment structures for consultants. On this subject he stated, [...] "I stuffed their mouths with gold".|$|R

Ahmad, who is also head of the BTN, denied allegations that it was systemically racist: [...] "Out of the 1,000 lectures given, maybe only one minute the lecturer had a slip-up so it is unfair that you portray BTN as racist just for that." [...] Describing typical course contents, he said participants [...] "are taught about the Federal Constitution, the social contract, the position of the Malays in this country and 60 per cent of the population are the bumiputras." [...] Although Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Nazri Aziz previously told the <b>press</b> that the <b>Cabinet</b> had ordered a revamp of BTN courses to eliminate elements inconsistent with 1Malaysia, Ahmad denied this, saying that Cabinet merely wanted an [...] "upgrade" [...] as opposed to a [...] "revamp". Responding, Nazri insisted that [...] "Whatever word you use, upgrade or revamp ... to me, it is a change of module. Datuk Ahmad Masalan {{is a member of the}} Cabinet, he can’t dispute my statement." [...] Nazri also criticised the denial of allegations against BTN, saying that opposition members who had previously been in government like Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim [...] "know, so what is there to deny?"

40|$|Mr. Korosenyi {{begins by}} {{analysing}} the particular relationship holding between politics and administration in different countries. Within Europe three major patterns {{have emerged in}} the 20 th century. Firstly there is the politically neutral British Civil Service, secondly the German and French state bureaucracies, which traditionally are supposed to embody the "common good", and thirdly there is the patronage system of the so-called consociate democracies, e. g. Austria. In general Mr. Korosenyi believes that, though politics do not penetrate into the Hungarian administration {{to the extent they}} do in Belgium and Austria, nevertheless, there is a stronger fusion than there is in the traditional British pattern. He is particularly interested in this relationship with regard to its effect on democratic institution building and the stabilisation of the new regime in Hungary, now the old "nomenklatura" system has been abolished. The structure of the Hungarian government was a result of the constitutional amendments of 1989 and 1990. Analysing this period, it becomes clear that for all the political actors who initiated and supported the democratic transition to democracy, the underlying assumption was a radical depoliticisation of the administration in order to maintain its stability. The political leadership of the executive is a cabinet government. The government is structured along ministries, each headed by a politician, i. e. the minister, {{who is a member of}} the cabinet. The minister's political secretary is not a cabinet member, but he or she is a politician, usually a member of the parliament. The head of the administration of the ministry is the administrative state secretary, who is a civil servant. He or she usually has four deputies, also civil servants. Naturally it is assumed that there should be a clear separation between politicians and civil servants. However in practice, the borders can be blurred, giving rise to a hybrid known as the "political civil servant". Mr. Korosenyi analyses the different faces of these hybrids. They are civil servants for the following reasons. They need special educational qualifications, working experience, a civil service exam etc., they are not allowed to do anything which is incompatible with their impartial role, and they cannot occupy political office nor may they appear in the name of any political party. On the other hand, the accepted political dimension to their function is revealed by the following facts. The state secretary (a civil servant) may participate in cabinet meetings instead of the minister. The state secretary is employed by the minister. A state secretary or any of their deputies can be dismissed at any time by the minister or the prime minister. In practice then, ministers appoint to these senior administrative positions civil servants whose personal and political loyaties are strong. To the second level of political patronage in ministries belong the ministerial <b>cabinet,</b> <b>press</b> office and public relation office. The ministerial cabinet includes the private advisors and members of the personal staff of the minister. The press office and the PR office, if they exist, are not adjusted to the administrative hierarchy of the ministry, but under the direct control of the minister. In the beginning of the 1990 s, such offices were exceptions; in the second half of the 90 s they are accepted and to be found in most ministries. Mr. Korosenyi's work, a 92 -page manuscript of a book in Hungarian, marks the first piece of literature within the field of political science which analyses the structure of the Hungarian government in the 1990 s and the relationship between the political leadership and the public administration...|$|R
