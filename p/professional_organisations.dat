5|$|The {{construction}} of memorials produced {{a lot of}} business in all the countries involved in the war. In Britain and Australia, stone masons provided large quantities of mass-produced design, often advertising through catalogues, while professional architects acquired the bulk of the specialised commissions for war memorials, making use of their <b>professional</b> <b>organisations.</b> Professional sculptors argued that their work was superior and more appropriate than that of architects, but they received far fewer commissions. British stone masons provided cheap products through catalogues. In France, funeral directors played a large part in the business of producing designs, producing catalogues of their designs for local communities to choose from. In the US, there was sufficient interest that a specialist magazine, Monumental News, was created to support the trade in war memorials.|$|E

25|$|The six {{member states}} {{individually}} strongly intervened in their agricultural sectors, {{in particular with}} regard to what was produced, maintaining prices for goods and how farming was organised.

Some members, particularly France, and all farming <b>professional</b> <b>organisations</b> wanted to maintain strong state intervention in agriculture.

25|$|The anti-nuclear {{movement}} {{is a social}} movement that opposes various nuclear technologies. Some direct action groups, environmental groups, and <b>professional</b> <b>organisations</b> have identified themselves with the movement at the local, national, and international level. Major anti-nuclear groups include Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service. The initial objective of the movement was nuclear disarmament, though since the late 1960s opposition has included {{the use of nuclear}} power. Many anti-nuclear groups oppose both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The formation of green parties in the 1970s and 1980s was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, {{the merchants}} along the Avenue joined {{together}} to form the Syndicat d'Initiative et de Défense des Champs-Élysées, changed to an association in 1916 to promote commercially the Avenue. In 1980, the group {{changed its name to}} the Comité des Champs-Élysées and to Comité Champs-Élysées in 2008. It is the oldest standing committee in Paris. The committee has always dedicated itself to seeking public projects to enhance the Avenue's unique atmosphere, and to lobby the authorities for extended business hours and to organizing special events. Today, the committee, in coordination with other <b>professional</b> <b>organisations,</b> may review with the Parisian administration the addition to the Avenue of new businesses whose floor area would exceed 1000 square meters. Because of the high rents, few people live on the Champs-Élysées; the upper stories tend to be occupied by offices. Rents are particularly high {{on the north side of}} the Avenue, because of better exposure to sunlight.|$|E
500|$|... noitulovE is {{the fifth}} television/cinema piece in the Good things come to those who wait series, and its premiere {{marked the end of}} a {{four-year}} hiatus. The advert and its associated campaign were a critical and financial success. It received over 30 awards from <b>professional</b> <b>organisations</b> in the advertising and television industries, and was the most-awarded commercial worldwide in 2006. The impact of the campaign was such that during a period in which the UK beer market experienced a substantial decline in revenue, Guinness reported that its year-on-year earnings within the region had noticeably increased. At the same time, Guinness achieved its highest-ever volume and value shares and became the market leader within the region. This was attributed in no small part to the positive reception of noitulovE.|$|E
