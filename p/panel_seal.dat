40|$|Silicone sealant {{is usually}} {{interposed}} between panels of precast façades. In ordinary cladding panel configurations, relative sliding between panels occurs under lateral actions. The shear drifts and consequent stresses arising in the silicone strips {{may lead to}} a significant increase of the load demand in the cladding panel connections and affect the seismic behaviour of the structural system. This paper presents the results of experimental tests and numerical analyses carried out to clarify the role of the silicone sealant on the seismic response of precast structures with cladding panels. An experimental campaign including monotonic and cyclic tests on both silicone strips applied to small concrete blocks and two <b>panel</b> sub-assembly <b>sealed</b> with silicone, has been developed at Politecnico di Milano.

The center calorimeter holds ca. 5, 000, and each end calorimeters holds 3, 000, gallons of LAr (BP= ca. 90 K) at a nominal pressure of 4 / 3 atm. The 96 (32 per cryostat) multilayer, G 10, signal boards map the signals from the detector to the preamplifiers, while 'feeding them through' the boundary wall between the argon cryostat and the atmosphere. The feedthrough function is accomplished by attaching a hermetic flange to the signal board, and then sealing the flange to an opening in a stainless steel 'signal box', an extension of the cryostat, with a bolted sea. The geometry is arranged to stratify the gas temperature in a 'tower' (port) to keep the box assemblies, nominally, at room temperature. The cryostat design must obey a set of physical constraints that, effectively, require that the circular cross-section be inscribed in a square. All warm 'access ports' are constrained to reside in the upper quadrants; defined as above the equator, outside the circular cross-section, and inside the square. The small diameter (8 -inch, 6 -inch pipe), vertical axis, ports penetrate the cylindrical, horizontal axis, cryostat shells at large (ca. 45 degree) azimuthal angles to allow a 'reasonable', vertical, heat leak path for the seven (one instrumentation, two HV, four signal) ports required.

Predicting the performance of gob gas ventholes is one of these mathematically complicated problems as {{it is difficult to know}} the exact relationships between various parameters influencing gob gas venthole (GGV) performance from active and <b>sealed</b> (completed) longwall <b>panels.</b> In this paper, a discussion of the NIOSH-developed software suite for methane control and prediction (MCP) based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is presented.

40|$|The thermal {{utilisation}} of {{the ground}} with the help of earth-coupled structural elements (“energy geostructures”) is a future-oriented method for domestic heat generation. Due to the incorporation of heat exchanging pipes into necessary structural elements, the installation costs for energy geostructures are much lower than for common geothermal systems. Traditionally, concrete geostructures are used as energy geostructures, whereby the heat exchanging pipes are attached to the existing reinforcement. In this context, the thermal activation of piles, walls, base slabs and tunnels is known. In this thesis, thermo-active <b>seal</b> <b>panels</b> were developed. The thermo-active <b>seal</b> <b>panels</b> can replace a conventional sealing system, for example for basement walls, which are in contact to (streaming) groundwater. The heat exchanging pipes are incorporated into concrete protecting plates made of PE-HD. Due to the thin plate a nearly direct contact to the ground can be achieved. Furthermore, a flexible arrangement of the heat exchanging pipes is possible, due to the existing regular arranged pimples (anchors) on the concrete protecting plate. For determining the effectiveness of the thermo-active <b>seal</b> <b>panels,</b> a large-scale laboratory test station was developed. In this test station, heat extraction tests were carried out, whereby different boundary conditions and system configurations were tested. The determined heat output varied between 25 W/m² and 300 W/m² depending on the applied conditions. The median was about 80 W/m². Thus, the possible heat output of thermo-active <b>seal</b> <b>panels</b> is in the same order of magnitude as documented values in literature for other energy geostructures. Until now, no suitable calculation approach, which considers all influencing parameters, exists. This is due to the fact, that different heat transport mechanisms in the ground, in the structural element and in the heat exchanging system with varying complexity has to be considered. Furthermore, different scales characterize the different sub-processes. Thus, the coupling of all sub-processes is an additional difficulty. Moreover, no rotation-symmetrical heat transfer exists for plane energy geostructures. Therefore, a heat transfer to the ground (outside) and to the adjacent room (inside) has to be taken into account. Hence, a calculation approach for plane energy geostructures was developed in this thesis. This approach considers all heat transport processes involved using the analogy to thermally active building systems (TABS). The multi-layered structural element as well as the heat exchanging system is modelled via thermal resistances. Due to a star connection, a distinction between the heat transfer to the outside and to the inside can be made and both heat flows can be calculated separately. For the coupling of the thermal resistance model and the ground both, analytical methods and numerical methods, were used. However, just numerical methods enable a detailed design of energy geostructures with sufficient accuracy. Thus, the thermal resistance model was implemented in the software tool SHEMAT-Suite, whereas the Geophysica Beratungs-gesellschaft mbH (Aachen) was responsible for the numerical implementation. The mathematical approach and its numerical implementation were verified and validated. For this purpose, comparative calculations using a fully discretised Finite-Element-Modell (COMSOL) were carried out. The results of both numerical models show a very good agreement. Additionally, a comparison between numerical model and laboratory tests was carried out. The modelled and measured return temperatures show also a very good agreement. Thus, the validity of the new calculation approach and its numerical implementation is proved. Furthermore, the computing times of the new approach are of some order of magnitude smaller than the computing time of the fully discretised numerical model. Energy geostructures are mainly utilised in the near-surface ground. Therefore, a time-varying ground temperature has to be taken into account. In this thesis, a calculation algorithm for determining the average earth-surface temperature for each month was developed. This approach is based on the energy balance at the earth surface. Therefore, a suitable combination of calculation approaches for each component of the energy balance was derived. This reference approach set delivers a very good agreement with measured ground temperatures for locations in Germany. Finally, an extensive parameter study was carried out. The most important parameters are the flow rate in the heat exchanging system, the ground temperature, the groundwater flow (direction and amount), the pipe and shank distance as well as the pipe cover. Furthermore, recommendations for the constructive design of plane and shallow energy geostructures were given. In this case, the avoidance of the heat flow to the inside is one important aspect to prevent a thermal circuit...|$|R
