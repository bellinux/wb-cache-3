5000|$|An early {{microcomputer}} {{power supply}} was either fully on or off, {{controlled by the}} mechanical line-voltage switch, and energy <b>saving</b> low-power idle <b>modes</b> were not a design consideration of early computer power supplies.

50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that UniPro {{supports}} the power efficient low speed communication modes provided by both the D-PHY (10 Mbit/s) and M-PHY (3 Mbit/sec up to 500 Mbit/s).

40|$|Implementation {{of dynamic}} voltage and {{frequency}} scaling for the memory subsystem/front bus, and to study the <b>power</b> <b>savings</b> thus achieved on the IBM PowerPC 405 LP board. MOTIVATION: Power management is an important design aspect of embedded systems design, especially for battery constrained devices. Various power optimization techniques have been proposed which offer power reduction while maintaining the safe operation of the system. Many processors support different <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>modes.</b> <b>Power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>modes</b> like sleep and suspend involve lot of overhead for hard real-time systems. Recently many processors added support for Dynamic Power Management (DPM) techniques which allow power parameters such as {{voltage and frequency}} to be changed even while a program is in execution [1]. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) and Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS) are the most widely deployed DPM techniques. Dynamic power management techniques when applied only to scale the voltage and frequency of processor core can be of limited use [2]. Latest technological advances in processor design has {{lead to the development}} of low-power processor cores. Power optimization on the already low power consuming processor cor...|$|R
50|$|Most {{hard disk}} drives today support {{some form of}} power {{management}} which uses a number of specific power modes that save energy by reducing performance. When implemented an HDD will change between a full power mode {{to one or more}} <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>modes</b> as a function of drive usage. Recovery from the deepest mode, typically called Sleep, may take as long as several seconds.|$|R
50|$|Frames are {{the basic}} unit of data transport, {{of which there are}} four {{fundamental}} types (data, acknowledgment, beacon and MAC command frames), which provide a reasonable tradeoff between simplicity and robustness. Additionally, a superframe structure, defined by the coordinator, may be used, in which case two beacons act as its limits and provide synchronization to other devices as well as configuration information. A superframe consists of sixteen equal-length slots, which can be further divided into an active part and an inactive part, during which the coordinator may enter <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>mode,</b> not needing to control its network.|$|E
50|$|The Z-Wave chip is {{optimized}} for battery-powered devices, {{and most of}} the time remains in a <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>mode</b> to consume less energy, waking up only to perform its function. With Z-Wave mesh networks, each device in the house bounces wireless signals around the house, which results in low power consumption, allowing devices work for years without needing to replace batteries. For Z-Wave units to be able to route unsolicited messages, they cannot be in sleep mode. Therefore, battery-operated devices are not designed as repeater units. Mobile devices, such as remote controls, are also excluded since Z-Wave assumes that all devices in the network remain in their original detected position.|$|E

The 7380 was designed at Nokia's Design Center in California (Lead Designer: Miki Mehandjiysky). What distinguishes this phone from others is its sensory navigation key which differs greatly from a conventional keypad and functions similarly to the touch-sensitive navigation wheel of the iPod. The display of the phone is another point if interest, measuring approximately 1.5 cm by 7 cm. The screen is also known for becoming highly reflective when in <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>mode,</b> with the ability to double as a mirror. This function, however, does not seem to hinder its visibility, including in dark situations.

50|$|In {{the context}} of {{wireless}} networking, Constant Awake Mode (CAM) is a mode that is intended for devices when power is not an issue, such as when AC power is available to a device.

50|$|Power {{management}} {{can also}} affect data transport, since devices may control their power use at their discretion.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} radio power management approaches including synchronous [15] and asynchronous [16, 17] cycling, {{as well as}} more advanced, on-demand solutions such as wakeup radios [18]. Asynchronous cycling presents a suboptimal solution, requiring very short rounds that may inhibit advanced <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>modes,</b> and can lead to long always-on periods if trying to transmit in the absence of neighbours. The use of wake-up radios is promising but requires additional hardware on most current platforms. This leaves synchronous cycling, which is generally a good solution although it requires a global time reference. The reference can either be provided by the CHARON-integrated synchronization mechanism or any other available source.|$|R

Specifically, this involves making decisions such as when to relocate VMs, which VMs to relocate, where to place VMs that are to be relocated, and which physical machines can be switched off. These decisions can be made with a view to meeting different objectives; in our case, we seek to maximize the profit of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) service provider by trading off income (which involves meeting SLAs) and expenditure (which involves saving energy by moving physical machines that are not needed into <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>modes).</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — According to {{employing}} <b>Power</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Mode</b> (PSM) scheme or not, stations (STAs) in Wireless Local Area Networks can {{be classified}} into two categories: STAs using PSM (PS-STAs) and STAs staying in Active Mode (AM-STAs). In IEEE 802. 11 standard, a PS-STA periodically wakes up and retrieves data buffered at the Access Point through contending with both other PS-STAs and AM-STAs for its PS-Poll’s transmission. Although AM-STAs usually have no concern with energy, their contention degrades the energy efficiency of PS-STAs, which usually have life concern, by 1) increasing the time duration for data retrieving and 2) {{increasing the number of}} PS-STAs which contend throughout the whole beacon interval but get no access opportunity. This paper first proposes a general Priority Based <b>Power</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Mode</b> (PBPSM) scheme which achieves PS-STAs’ higher energy efficiency than PSM by assigning different channel access priorities. Then, we choose Enhanced Distributed Channel Access in IEEE 802. 11 e to implement the general mechanism and analyze PS-STAs ’ energy efficiency for both PSM and PBPSM. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our mechanism. I...|$|E

Due to its high power consumption, <b>Power</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Mode</b> (PSM) schemes have been proposed to reduce power consumption.

In this paper, we propose A 2 PSM: an audio channel assisted power saving scheme for the Wi-Fi interface, which address the inefficiency of the existing power saving schemes in smart devices. In this scheme, we leverage the low power consumption of the audio interfaces (mic/speaker) to reduce the wakeup events of the Wi-Fi interface when it is in <b>Power</b> <b>Saving</b> <b>Mode.</b> In this paper, we develop a small-scale prototype testbed on real smartphones to evaluate the proposed A 2 PSM scheme. Experiments show that A 2 PSM could save {{up to more than}} 25 % more power than the existing schemes.

40|$|Over-provisioning is a {{standard}} capacity planning practice that leads to disk drives that operate mostly under very low utilization (as low as single digit utilization) but that are consuming disproportional amounts of power.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the design of}} the MAC layer for low power, low data-rate, impulse-radio ultra-wide band (IR-UWB) networks. In such networks, the primary concern is energy consumption rather than rate efficiency. We explore several dimensions such as power control, rate adaptation, mutual exclusion, slotted versus non-slotted operation, <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> <b>modes</b> and interference mitigation. We analyze the effect of these design choices on the energy consumption and rate efficiency. We use a method of energy quanta for computing the energy consumption. We find that for both cases, the optimal operation is non-coordinated and with no power control. Sources should send at their maximum power and not pay attention to neighboring nodes. However, sources should constantly adapt their transmission rate to the level of interference. I...|$|R
