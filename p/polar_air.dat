5|$|Directly {{under the}} {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold <b>polar</b> <b>air</b> meets warm air from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense <b>polar</b> <b>air</b> masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
5|$|This region's land is {{appropriate}} for agricultural and livestock activities. It is mostly a flat area, interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Maritime <b>polar</b> <b>air</b> from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes - a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas {{are influenced by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year often leads to higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging from an average of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Buenos Aires is {{dominated}} by the semi–permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year. This brings in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of <b>polar</b> <b>air</b> masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is polar maritime (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subarctic and arctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35oS (where the Andes are shorter in height), anticyclogenesis leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system {{in the center of the}} country (at around 40oS). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, polar continental air masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.|$|E

40|$|Na podstawie kalendarza mas powietrznych w Polsce Południowej opracowanego przez T. Niedźwiedzia scharakteryzowano długotrwałość występowania 6 typów mas powietrznych w latach 1951 – 2009. Skoncentrowano się na średnim czasie utrzymywania i ciągach dni z masami powietrznymi w porach roku oraz trendach ich zmian wieloletnich. Średnia długotrwałość mas zmienia się od 1, 4 dnia (masa PP_m_c w lecie) do 4, 5 dnia (masa PP_k w zimie). Największą długotrwałością występowania, niezależnie od pory roku cechują się masy PP_k (maksymalnie do 30 dni), a najmniejszą masy PP_m i PP_m_c. Czas utrzymywania się nad Polską Południową mas zależy nie tylko od ich częstości, ale też od kierunku adwekcji. Istotny wzrost średniej długotrwałości cechuje masy PA w zimie. The {{duration}} of six types of air masses was identified in southern Poland {{over the period}} 1951 – 2009. A calendar of air masses developed by T. Niedźwiedź was used, and the six air masses included: arctic (PA), polar maritime fresh (PP_m), polar maritime old (PP_m_s), polar maritime warm (PP_m_c), polar continental (PP_k) and tropical air (PZ). The study determined the average {{duration of}} air masses per season {{and the frequency of}} sequences of days with individual air masses. Linear regression analysis was used to identify trends in the average duration. The duration of air masses investigated in southern Poland was found to be highly variable. The average duration varied in the range from 1. 4 days of the warm <b>polar</b> maritime <b>air</b> (PP_m_c) in summer to 4. 5 days of the <b>polar</b> continental <b>air</b> (PP_k) in winter. The largest number of air–mass spells ranged from one to three days. <b>Polar</b> continental <b>air</b> masses (PP_k) were found to account for the longest uniform air–mass spells regardless of the season (up to 30 days in autumn of 1951), whilst the polar maritime fresh (PP_m) and warm <b>polar</b> maritime <b>air</b> masses tended to last the shortest. The Advection vector determined air mass duration more than the frequency of occurrence. The highly stable easterly air circulation was found to promote long durations of uniform air masses over the area and produced longer periods dominated by PP_k air. In the long term, average durations followed a number of various trends, of which only the trend of to an increase in the average duration of arctic air in winter was statistically significant. This trend was a result of a growing frequency of occurrence of this air mass type...|$|R

25|$|Arctic haze is the {{phenomenon}} of a visible reddish-brown springtime haze in the atmosphere at high latitudes in the Arctic due to anthropogenic air pollution.

The effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief. In general, most of Ontario's climate is classified as humid continental. Ontario has three main climatic regions.|$|E

50|$|The polar highs {{are areas}} of high {{atmospheric}} pressure around {{the north and}} south poles; the north polar high being the stronger one because land gains and loses heat more effectively than sea. The cold temperatures in the <b>polar</b> regions cause <b>air</b> to descend to create the high pressure (a process called subsidence), just as the warm temperatures around the equator cause air to rise to create the low pressure intertropical convergence zone. Rising air also occurs along bands of low pressure situated just below the polar highs around the 50th parallels of latitude. These extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the <b>polar</b> fronts where <b>air</b> masses of <b>polar</b> origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin. This convergence of rising air completes the vertical cycle around the polar cell in each latitudinal hemisphere. Closely related to this concept is the polar vortex.|$|R
