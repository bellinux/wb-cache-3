[...] This will allow artists that normally do not have a chance to share their work to participate in a collaborated effort with other artists from around the world. Once an artist decides to participate and take up the challenge of creating an original work, [...] a gas mask is sent to them.

50|$|For almost 10 {{years now}} Bart Dorsa {{has been living}} in Moscow and working with various {{photographic}} techniques creating images that are experimental, emotional and have consistently challenged conventional notions of beauty. Dorsa studies wet <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> in Europe and later experimented a lot with different cameras, lenses, and hand-made emulsions. To achieve the desired effect, Dorsa gradually removed all excess elements, until at some point he destroyed the camera and began shooting with only a lens and a camera obscura. Bart Dorsa has transformed traditional exhibition locations into spaces that create a context of mystery and emotion, covering the spaces in fabric and building unique 'sanctuary' space-within-space structures.|$|E

Types of hemolysins {{produced}} by Staphylococcus aureus {{as determined by}} the replica <b>plating</b> <b>technique.</b> J.

Unless horse and human red blood cells were used, a distinction between α-and δ-hemolysins was difficult to make.

This pattern of lysis was not detected by the radial streak or the tube titration procedures when mixed populations were examined, and may be due to a lytic factor not hitherto described...|$|R

40|$|Background: Plate on <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> can lessen {{operative}} {{time and}} patient morbidity. Objectives: This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} outcomes of minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) using plate on <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> of locking plate fixation for closed fractures of distal tibia in a prospective study. Patients and Methods: Twenty-five patients with distal tibial fractures were treated by MIPPO using locking plate by plate on <b>plate</b> <b>technique.</b> Preoperative variables including age of patient, mode of trauma, type of fracture and soft tissue status were recorded for each patient. Perioperative variables included surgical time and radiation exposure. Postoperative variables included wound status, time to union, return to activity and the American orthopaedic foot and ankle score (AOFAS). Results: All the fractures had united at one year. The average time to union was 16. 8 weeks. There were two cases of superficial infection and two cases of deep infection, which required removal of hardware after the fracture was united. The average AO foot and ankle score was 83. 6 in our study population. Conclusions: MIPPO using locking plate by plate on <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> was a safe, effective, inexpensive and easily reproducible method {{for the treatment of}} distal tibial fractures in properly selected patients, which minimized operative time and soft tissue morbidity...|$|E

40|$|Determination of {{the number}} of cultured {{bacteria}} is essential for scientific and industrial practice. A spread <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> is the most common and accurate method for counting of microorganisms. However, time consuming incubation does not allow for a quick estimation {{of the number}} of bacteria in a growing culture. In the present study, the results of photometric measurements: direct optical density method (OD at 585 nm), UV absorbance at 260 and/or 280 nm of separated and lysed bacteria by sodium hydroxide and surfactant with the spread <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> were compared. The linear regression model for bacterial strains Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was used to compare these three methods. The UV measurement method enabled determination {{of the number of}} bacteria with similar precision. The procedure for solubilized bacteria UV measurement is robust, and is not influenced by dispersions in the original culture medium...|$|E
40|$|Identification of Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium strains and {{especially}} of indigenous isolates {{continues to be}} one of the major difficulties associated with competition studies. Because there is no universally accepted method, the method of choice depends on preference, experience, and equipment. Here, an agar <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> was used to distinguish strains and field isolates of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii to provide a basis for identifying nodule occupants in further competition studies. A rapid <b>plate</b> <b>technique,</b> based on differential growth characteristics, complements other techniques such as serological reactions, particularly when antisera cross-react with nonhomologous strains. The technique involves culturing strains and isolates on chrome azurol S agar. Although similar responses were observed among some strains, the response was highly reproducible and was considered an ideal complementary technique used in conjunction with serological procedures. Strains with similar responses could often be differentiated by varying media components, such as the source of carbon...|$|E
30|$|This {{displacement}} of the fulcrum for growth around the physis would in theory lead to a different load of the physis resulting in a faster correction of the deformity [2, 12]. The tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> appears {{to be safe and}} an approximately 30 % faster correction rate was reported in the first published study on its use [2]. Since then a number of publications have focused on the use of tension band plating with all studies but one being retrospective. Overall results seem satisfying and the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> has now partly replaced stapling. The only prospective study published so far comparing staples and tension band plating (non-randomised) was unable to detect any difference between the treatments [17]. Complications with the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> reported so far have been very few. There have been reports on hardware failure, which children suffering from pathological physis such as Blount’s disease seem to be more likely to experience or extrusion of implants during treatment [18]. These complications have since led companies to develop solid screws {{that can be used in}} patients with high risk for hardware failure.|$|R

30|$|These are {{specifically}} recommended {{for treatment of}} obese children with Blount’s disease. A number of experimental animal studies have been published {{on the use of}} the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique.</b> In one animal study, rabbit hind limbs were allocated to either lateral stapling, lateral tension band plating, sham surgery or no surgery. Staple migration was observed after 2  weeks of treatment. No results from the histological analysis were reported apart from the growth plate appearing disturbed between the staple legs. Interestingly, staple hemiepiphysiodesis produced a larger valgus deformity when compared to the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique.</b> A similar result was observed in another study on rabbits but better grasp in bone was reported for the implants used for tension band plating. In their histological analysis, cellular disorganisation was reported around implants in 9 preparations from a total of 34 femurs. No differences were found between implant types and implant related injuries to the growth plate were not observed. Two porcine animal studies compared stapling with tension band plating in paired setups similar to the study presented were also reported [19, 20]. Medial hemiepiphysiodesis induced a varus deformity using both techniques but the angulation created was larger using the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique.</b> Signs of early loosening of staples as well as failure of implanted staples were reported. No histological analysis was included in these studies. A recent study investigated the effect of screw length on the rate of creation of the deformity but found no difference between short and long screws. However, guided growth using the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> was found to be more efficient overall than staples [21].|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: This {{research}} {{attempts to}} optimize the parameters for pulse plating of silver on printed circuit board. The idea here is to use pulse <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> which is metal deposition by pulsed electrolysis method.

Here the electro deposit is influenced by current density, silver concentration in the bath, applied current type. Pulse <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> is used in double sided printed circuit board especially in the case of <b>plated</b> through hole <b>technique.</b> Here exist a necessity to do plating which will deposit a metal wall in the substrate and it will connect between the components.
