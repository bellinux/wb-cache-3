5|$|The three destroyers and 16 {{small boats}} left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 14:00 on 26 March 1942. They formed into {{a convoy of}} three lanes, with the destroyers in the middle. On arrival at St Nazaire the <b>portside</b> MLs were {{to head for the}} Old Mole to {{disembark}} their Commandos, while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to disembark theirs. Not having the range to reach St Nazaire unaided, the MTB and MGB were taken under tow by Campbeltown and Atherstone.|$|E
25|$|Water {{from the}} highest point in the {{catchment}} has fallen from Mount Langley in the Conondale Range, 868 m above sea level. The Brisbane River then flows past wharves including Pinkenba Wharf and <b>Portside</b> Wharf, past Bulwer Island and Luggage Point through the Port of Brisbane and into southern Bramble Bay an embayment of Moreton Bay.|$|E
25|$|As {{the heavily}} damaged {{choppers}} returned to Palali airbase, {{it became clear}} that further missions might be impossible. Sqn Ldr Vinayraj's helicopter had sustained significant damage. The undercarriage had been hit, the <b>portside</b> battery compartment cover was missing and the whole fuselage was peppered with bullet holes. Wg Cdr Sapre’s Mi-8 returned with its hydraulic system damaged.|$|E
25|$|They {{planned to}} develop the land {{adjacent}} to Queen Mary, and upgrade, renovate and restore the ship. During their management, staterooms were updated with iPod docking stations and flatscreen TVs and the ship's three funnels and waterline area were repainted their original Cunard Red color. The <b>portside</b> Promenade Deck's planking was restored and refinished. Many lifeboats were repaired and patched, and the ship's kitchens were renovated with new equipment.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{differences}} from the Forrestals are greater length, {{and a different}} placement of elevators; two are forward of the island, one is aft of the island and another on the <b>portside</b> stern. The movement of the No. 4 elevator from the forward to the after end of the angle made it useful for aircraft movement, since the forward-end elevator in the Forrestals was sited in both the landing path and in the launch path of the waist catapults.|$|E
25|$|As in all mass-produced aircraft, {{there may}} have been some overlap of these {{features}} as new components became available. In mid-to-late 1944 other features were introduced to both the Typhoon and Tempest: A Rebecca transponder unit was fitted, with the associated aerial appearing under the <b>portside</b> centre section. A small, elongated oval static port appeared on the rear starboard fuselage, just above the red centre spot of the fuselage roundel. This was apparently used to measure the aircraft's altitude more accurately.|$|E
25|$|Raleigh was moored at berth F-12, on {{the east}} side of the north channel at Pearl Harbor, when the Japanese made their {{surprise}} attack. In the first attack wave a torpedo passed ahead and a second hit Raleigh <b>portside</b> amidships. The cruiser took such a list to port that it appeared she might capsize. As crew jettisoned topside weight to keep her upright, her gunners helped to destroy five Japanese planes. Several of her crew were wounded, but none were killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} the Harriet Lane {{involved}} also possibly the oldest active combatant of the Civil War. Captain Levi C. Harby of the Texas Maritime Service, 69 years old, was {{in command of the}} Neptune, and was the last to leave that vessel after ramming the Harriet Lane <b>portside.</b> The Neptune was hit by Federal gunners and sank, but the water was shallow enough that Harby and his men could continue firing their guns from her deck. This distraction enabled the Bayou City to carry out the successful starboard attack that captured the Harriet Lane.|$|E
25|$|Restigouche, {{named for}} a river that flows through Quebec and New Brunswick, was laid down on 15 July 1953 by Canadian Vickers Ltd., in Montreal, Quebec. The ship was {{launched}} on 22 November 1954. While still on sea trials by the builder, Restigouche collided with the freighter Manchester Port on 21 November 1957 in the Saint Lawrence River. The ship suffered damage to her <b>portside</b> superstructure and hull. Restigouche was commissioned at Montreal on 7 June 1958 with the number DDE 257. In June 1959, Restigouche {{took part in the}} opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.|$|E
25|$|Z51, {{the only}} ship {{of the class}} to be laid down, was ordered from Deschimag on 25 November 1942, and {{launched}} on 2 October 1944. She was sunk during a major air raid on Bremen, on 21 March 1945. She had just been moved away from a fitting-out quay at the Deschimag yard, although heavily incomplete: she had only her forward and after shelter decks, no machinery was installed and her shaft tunnels had been welded up to make them watertight. From this {{it has been suggested}} that her launch was done only to clear the slip for U-boat building. She was lying abandoned, with her <b>portside</b> to the eastern end of Kohlenhafen, alongside Röchling wharf.|$|E
25|$|The Sacrifice DLC {{campaign}} {{takes place}} before the main events of Left 4 Dead 2; and after the events of The Sacrifice comic. The original survivors of Left 4 Dead—Bill, Francis, Louis, and Zoey—arrive at the <b>portside</b> town of Rayford, in order {{to search for a}} boat that can take them to the Florida Keys. After finding an adequate sailboat, the Survivors have to manually start up generators in order to lift a bridge for their boat to pass through. One Survivor (canonically Bill) sacrifices himself in order to kick-start a generator once it gives out, so that the others may reach safety. This is the end of Bill's story in the Left 4 Dead video game series.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>portside</b> town of Rayford, {{they find}} a boat but must raise an old rusty bridge powered by an aging {{generator}} to get the boat into open waters, assured that the machinery noise will alert a large horde. However, the generator gives out. Bill sacrifices himself in order to restart it, so that the others may reach safety. After waiting for the horde to disperse, the three then encounter four more survivors. They move the boat {{to the other side}} of the bridge and help them re-lower the bridge so they can cross in their car. Afterwards, Louis, Zoey, and Francis head back to the boat and set course to the Keys.|$|E
25|$|Around 11:45 PM, The {{oil tanker}} S.C.T. Dodd of the Standard Oil Company of California began exchanging fog whistle blasts with the San Juan. Not long afterwards, the San Juan {{appeared}} {{in front of}} the S.C.T. Dodd's bow. Both the San Juan and S.C.T. Dodd were ordered to reverse thrust to prevent a collision. Unfortunately, despite all efforts, the S.C.T. Dodd collided with the San Juan's stern on her <b>portside.</b> Some survivors reported the collision was not greatly noticeable in feeling. On the San Juan, steward William Gano's bunk was partially destroyed when the S.C.T. Dodd's steel bow plowed straight through his room. Gano was able to escape by climbing up a rope leading to the San Juan's main deck. The collision destroyed one of the San Juan's lifeboats.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Eagle At Work {{was highly}} {{anticipated}} by many labor scholars, labor attorneys and {{activists in the}} labor movement. After its publication, the work was widely reviewed in the scholarly and labor press, including Labor Studies Journal, the Journal of Industrial Relations, WorkingUSA, Labor History, Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, LRA Online, Labor Research Association, British Journal of Industrial Relations, Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations, Hawaii Laborer, ILCA Online, <b>Portside,</b> The Progressive Populist, Workday Minnesota, Religious Socialism, All Aboard, NLRB, Labour/Le Travail, Noteworthy Books in Industrial Relations and Labor Economics, Princeton University, Benson's Union Democracy Blog, University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business and Employment Law, and the Annual Review of Law and Social Science. Some of the reviews expressed greater or lesser degrees of skepticism about the likelihood of Morris' thesis being adopted but praised the work highly.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} there was a repair done on the <b>portside</b> hull. To patch it, a larger portion of the hull was worked away and a rebate was cut around the edges. Then, a repair patch, some 1.25 m long, was {{manufactured}} with similar rebates so both parts would perfectly match. In both parts, the corresponding holes were cut and tree-nails used to fasten them from outside. The other repair, which was done to the starboard inner face of the hull at the stern, was patched by an insertion of a pre-shaped block and fastened by a tree-nail. Based on the analysis of the hull, this repair was initiated as a split stopper. Boring a hole at one end of a split is a recognized way of minimizing a possibility of its spreading. The split was therefore caulked, a section of wood around the transom removed, and the repair block inserted and the transom finished.|$|E
500|$|The wreck {{site was}} {{designated}} as a 'Protected Place' in 2002 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, 60 years after her sinking. Survivors described five torpedo hits on Repulse, four {{on the port side}} and one on the starboard side. The four <b>portside</b> hits purportedly were: two amidship, one abreast of the rear turret and one near the propellers. The starboard side hit was amidships. A 2007 diving expedition [...] could confirm only two of the hits by examination of the wreck: the <b>portside</b> hit near the propellers and the starboard hit amidship. Unfortunately, {{at the time of the}} expedition, the <b>portside</b> midships section of the wreck was buried in the ocean floor thus the claimed hits there could not be confirmed. However, the area abreast of the port rear turret was accessible though and no sign whatsoever of a torpedo hit - as described by survivors - was found to be there.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, the US Navy {{considered}} the internal arrangements of a submarine aircraft carrier that could carry {{three of these}} aircraft. Stored in pressure chambers that would not protrude from the hull, they would be raised by a <b>portside</b> elevator just aft of the sail and set to take off on their own on a smooth sea but catapulted aft in a higher sea. The program only reached the [...] "writing on a napkin" [...] stage, for two problems were not addressed: the hole for the elevator would have seriously weakened the hull and the load of a laden elevator would also be difficult to transmit to the hull structure.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 4:10am on 14 May 1943, {{while on}} her second run from Sydney to Port Moresby, Centaur was torpedoed by an unsighted submarine. The torpedo struck the <b>portside</b> oil fuel tank approximately [...] below the waterline, creating a hole [...] across, igniting the fuel, {{and setting the}} ship on fire from the bridge aft. Many of those on board were immediately killed by concussion or perished in the inferno. Centaur quickly took on water through the impact site, rolled to port, then sank bow-first, submerging completely {{in less than three}} minutes. The rapid sinking prevented the deployment of lifeboats, although two broke off from Centaur as she sank, along with several damaged liferafts.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{attempted}} {{to counter the}} battleships through the air. On 18 June, the ship's guns shot down their first Japanese aircraft, but on 22 June, a Mitsubishi G4M3 [...] "Betty" [...] medium bomber flew low over the still-contested Saipan hills and found Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Japanese plane dropped a torpedo, opening a large hole in Marylands <b>portside</b> bow. The attack caused light casualties, and in 15 minutes she was underway for Eniwetok, and from there she steamed for the repair yards at Pearl Harbor (in reverse the whole time {{so as not to}} do further damage to her bow), escorted by two destroyers. Two men were killed in the attack.|$|E
500|$|She was one {{of three}} ships to be struck by Japanese torpedoes during the {{surprise}} attack on Port Arthur during the night of 8/9 February 1904. Tsesarevich was hit abaft the <b>portside</b> torpedo bulkhead and the ship took on an 18° list that was partially corrected by counterflooding compartments on the starboard side. She got underway, but ran aground at the narrow harbor entrance. She was refloated and moved into the harbour for repairs that lasted until 7 June. Some of the ship's guns were removed during the summer to reinforce the defenses of the port. Tsesarevich lost a total of four 75-millimeter, two 47-millimeter and two 37-millimeter guns. The ship was hit twice on 7 August by Japanese [...] shells fired at long range; a fragment from one of them lightly wounded Vitgeft.|$|E
500|$|Nagato {{was briefly}} fitted with an [...] {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on No. 2 turret in August 1925. Yokosuka Ro-go Ko-gata and Heinkel HD 25 floatplanes were tested from {{it before it}} was removed early the following year. An additional boom {{was added to the}} mainmasts of both ships in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y then assigned to them. A Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 floatplane was tested aboard Nagato that same year. A catapult was fitted between the mainmast and No. 3 turret in mid-1933, a collapsible crane was installed in a <b>portside</b> sponson, and the ships were equipped to operate two or three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The sisters began to operate Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the one Kawanishi E7K that was added in 1939–40. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.|$|E
500|$|Szent István {{was hit by}} two [...] torpedoes abreast her {{boiler room}}s. The aft boiler room quickly flooded and gave the ship a 10° list to starboard. Counterflooding of the <b>portside</b> trim cells and {{magazines}} reduced the list to 7°, but efforts to use collision mats to plug the holes failed. While {{this was going on}} the dreadnought steered for the nearby Bay of Brgulje at low speed. However, water continued to leak into the forward boiler room and eventually doused all but the two boilers on the port side. This killed the power for the pumps and only left enough electricity to run the lights. The turrets were trained to port in a futile effort to counter the list and their ready ammunition was thrown overboard. An attempt by Tegetthoff to take the crippled battleship into tow was also abandoned after it became clear that Szent István was doomed. Flooding continued, and the ship capsized at 6:05am off Premuda Island. Only 89 sailors died—41 from Hungary—the low death toll partly attributed to the fact that all sailors with the KuK Navy had to learn to swim before entering active service.|$|E
500|$|The Basic Design Section of the Navy Technical Department decided upon an {{enlarged}} and improved Hiryū design with the island {{on the port}} side, amidships. After construction of the ships began, the Naval Air Technical Department (NATD) began having second thoughts about {{the location of the}} island because it thought that the <b>portside</b> location of the island on Hiryū and Akagi had an adverse impact on airflow over the flight deck. Another issue identified was that the amidships position shortened the available landing area, which had the potential to be problematic in the future as aircraft landing speeds increased with their growing weight. To verify these assumptions, the NATD filmed hundreds of takeoffs and landings aboard Akagi in October–November 1938 and decided to move the island over to the starboard side and further forward, about one-third of the length from the bow. Shōkaku was the furthest advanced by this point and the supporting structure for the bridge had already been built; rebuilding it would have delayed construction so it was left in place. The changes that had to be made consisted of a [...] widening of the flight deck opposite the island and a corresponding [...] narrowing on the starboard side and the addition of [...] of ballast on the port side to re-balance the ship.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{flight deck}} had a maximum width of [...] Because the {{unarmoured}} flight deck required an expansion joint about amidships, the Maltas' island {{could not be}} a single structure and was split into two, each section with its own funnel. This allowed turbulence around the islands to be reduced and provided more space for radars and fire-control directors. The carriers would have been fitted with 16 arrestor cables that were designed to stop landing aircraft up to [...] in weight, at speeds of up to [...] They would have been backed up by three crash barricades to prevent landing aircraft from crashing into aircraft parked on the ship's bow. Positioned on the forward part of the flight deck, two newly designed hydraulic aircraft catapults were intended to launch fully laden aircraft at [...] The ships were designed with four [...] lifts (two on the centreline ( [...] , and two on the <b>portside</b> deck edge (...) to facilitate the rapid movement of aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar. This was [...] long, with a maximum width of , and [...] high to accommodate American aircraft designed for that height. In case of fire the hangar was intended to be divided by four sliding steel doors. Between the hangar spaces and the deck park, the Malta class would have been capable of accommodating between 80 and 108 aircraft. For these aircraft, the ships would have been provided with [...] of aviation gasoline.|$|E
500|$|In mid-April she escorted {{the fast}} {{transport}} , together with Warspite and Valiant, from Alexandria to Malta before the battleships bombarded Tripoli {{on the evening}} of 20 April. On 612 May, she covered the Alexandria-Malta convoy of Operation Tiger. With her newly arrived sister Queen Elizabeth, Barham escorted Formidable as her aircraft attacked the Italian airfield at Scarpanto at dawn on 26 May with some success. While covering the evacuation of Crete the following day, the ship was attacked by Junkers Ju 88 bombers from II./LG (Demonstration Wing) 1 and Heinkel He 111 bombers of II./KG (Bomber Wing) 26. One [...] bomb struck 'Y' turret and started a fire inside the turret that took 20 minutes to quench. A near miss ruptured her <b>portside</b> bulge over an area [...] and caused a 1.5 degree list that was easily corrected by pumping oil. Casualties were five dead and six wounded. She reached Alexandria later that day, but she was too large for the floating dock there and had to be sent elsewhere for repairs. She sailed south through the Suez Canal to Mombasa, Kenya, where her damage was inspected. It proved to be worse than expected and Barham had to be repaired at Durban, South Africa as she was unfit to make the trans-Atlantic crossing for repair in the United States. Repairs were completed six weeks later on 30 July and the ship returned to Alexandria in August where she resumed her role as flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E
