25|$|When a simply {{supported}} beam is loaded in flexure, the top side is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending),</b> and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E

Effectiveness of this new technique has been demonstrated by experimental testing and numerical simulations.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a research {{program designed to}} investigate the seismic performance of square concrete-filled tubular (CFT) columns subjected {{to a combination of}} axial load and biaxial bending moment. The square CFT columns included normal strength and high-strength concrete-filled square steel hollow structural section columns with two ratios of tube wall thickness to tube dimension. An extensive experimental program included testing twenty-four, concrete filled, square steel hollow structural section column specimens under constant axial compressive load and cyclic horizontal load with horizontal displacement control. This experimental investigation included strength capacity, ductility and flexural stiffness of CFT beam-columns for 203 x 203 x 9. 5 HSS (Class 1, compact sections) and 203 x 203 x 4. 8 (Class 4, slender sections) hollow structural section (HSS) filled with either normal strength or high strength concrete. Class 1 (compact) and Class 4 (slender) HSS CFT columns subjected to constant axial load and cyclic shear displacements exhibited excellent hysteresis behavior using either normal strength concrete or high strength concrete. No premature failure, local buckling before yielding, was observed for either Class 1 or Class 4 HSS CFT columns. The drift ratios exceeded 7 %. The moment capacities of HSS CFT columns loaded with the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> across the diagonal were only slightly less than those loaded with the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> parallel to the square side. This reduces the need for elaborate procedures to calculate the biaxial moment capacities at orientations between 0 and 45 °. The strength capacity of square HSS CFT columns subjected to constant axial compressive load and biaxial cyclic bending moment can be conservatively calculated by column section analysis using fully plastic behavior for both concrete and steel. Strength modification factors alpha 1 and alpha 2 accommodate confinement and seismic loading, fast concrete strain rates, effects on the CFT column sections and softening of the columns caused by large axial load. Flexural stiffness of square HSS CFT columns can be calculated using the ACI 318 - 99 flexural stiffness formula with modification to the coefficient of the flexural stiffness contributed by the concrete...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{stiffness}} reduction {{method for}} the flexural–torsional buckling assessment of steel beam–columns subjected to major axis bending and axial compression is presented. The proposed method is applied {{by reducing the}} Young’s E and shear G moduli through the developed stiffness reduction functions and performing Linear Buckling Analysis. To account for second-order forces induced prior to buckling, the in-plane (in the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending)</b> and out-of-plane analyses of a member are separated and stiffness reduction for the out-of-plane instability assessment is applied {{on the basis of}} member forces determined from the in-plane analysis. Since the developed stiffness reduction functions fully take into account the detrimental influence of imperfections and spread of plasticity, the proposed method does not require the use of member design equations, thus leading to practical design. For the purpose of verifying this approach, the strength predictions determined through the proposed stiffness reduction method are compared against those obtained from nonlinear finite element modelling for a large number of regular, irregular, single and multi-span beam–columns...|$|E

40|$|Lateral Torsional Buckling (LTB) is {{a failure}} {{criteria}} for beams in flexure. The AISC defines Lateral Torsional Buckling as: the buckling mode of a flexural member involving deflection normal to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> occurring simultaneously with twist about the shear center of the cross-section. LTB occurs when the compression portion of a beam is no longer sufficient in strength and instead the beam is restrained by the tension portion of the beam (which causes deflection or twisting to occur). The design buckling (bending) resistance moment of laterally unsupported beams are calculated as per Section 8. 2. 2,IS 800 : 2007 of the code. If the non-dimensional slenderness λLT ≤ 0. 4, no allowance for lateral-torsional buckling is necessary.

Light and electron microscope investigations of spermatozoa from 10 species reveal many bizarre patterns of microtubules and suggest some basic similarities to flagella. Detailed analyses of spermatozoa which are naturally bent in definable planes during their elongation in the male and their storage in the female provide evidence that a constant topographical relationship is maintained between their unorthodox patterns of microtubules, as viewed in transections, and the direction of bending. The configuration common to most coccid spermatozoa consists of an acentrically positioned crescent of microtubules surrounded by one to several concentric rings. A line drawn to connect the two ends of the crescent appears to remain perpendicular to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending,</b> and it defines a plane in which bisection of the spermatozoon produces halves with unequal numbers of microtubules.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{materials}} can exhibit behaviour under load that cannot be described by classical continuum elasticity. Beams in bending can show a relative stiffening as the beam depth tends to zero, a size effect. Size effects are recognised in higher order continuum elastic theories such as micropolar elasticity. The drawback of higher order theories is {{the requirement of}} addition constitutive relations and associated properties that are often difficult to establish experimentally. Furthermore the finite element method, of great benefit in classical elasticity, has shown limitations when applied to micropolar elasticity.

40|$|AbstractIn the axoneme of {{eukaryotic}} flagella the dynein motor proteins form crossbridges {{between the}} outer doublet microtubules. These motor proteins generate force that accumulates as linear tension, or compression, on the doublets. When tension or compression is present on a curved microtubule, a force {{per unit length}} develops in the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> and is transverse to the long axis of the microtubule. This transverse force (t-force) is evaluated here using available experimental evidence from sea urchin sperm and bull sperm. At or near the switch point for beat reversal, the t-force is {{in the range of}} 0. 25 – 1. 0 nN/μm, with 0. 5 nN/μm the most likely value. This is the case in both beating and arrested bull sperm and in beating sea urchin sperm. The total force that can be generated (or resisted) by all the dyneins on one micron of outer doublet is also ∼ 0. 5 nN. The equivalence of the maximum dynein force/μm and t-force/μm at the switch point may have important consequences. Firstly, the t-force acting on the doublets near the switch point of the flagellar beat is sufficiently strong that it could terminate the action of the dyneins directly by strongly favoring the detached state and precipitating a cascade of detachment from the adjacent doublet. Secondly, after dynein release occurs, the radial spokes and central-pair apparatus are the structures that must carry the t-force. The spokes attached to the central-pair projections will bear most of the load. The central-pair projections are well-positioned for this role, and they are suitably configured to regulate the amount of axoneme distortion that occurs during switching. However, to fulfill this role without preventing flagellar bend formation, moveable attachments that behave like processive motor proteins must mediate the attachment between the spoke heads and the central-pair structure...|$|E
40|$|Axial {{load and}} biaxial bending {{strongly}} influence the deformation capacity of column cross-sections, {{in most cases}} causing a non-negligible loss of curvature and ductility {{with respect to the}} case <b>of</b> pure <b>bending</b> along principal axes, commonly assumed as the basic condition to assess the inelastic capacity. In consideration of this the paper investigates the biaxial deformation performance of RC rectangular cross-sections belonging to one-dimensional elements, focusing on the influence of some parameters as the cross-section aspect ratio and the distribution of the rebars, as well as the mechanical characteristics of concrete and steel and the impact of biaxial/axial stresses. In the paper ultimate curvature domains, yielding curvature domains and ductility domains as novel assessment tools are provided. The deformation performance of the cross-sections, represented by the above domains, is discussed through a parametric study on the sensitivity of the domain shape to the major governing geometrical and mechanical factors.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} constant S of {{the model}} {{is related to the}} material property of the flagellum found from experiment such as the bending modulus A or the twist modulus C. This is done by measuring the response of a straight elastic rod representing the structural organization of the filament to a bending or twisting. This section describes the method used in determining S from the experimental values of A and C. The evaluation of S is done following a similar procedure as done in Ref (1). S from the flexural rigidity To express S in terms of the flexural rigidity, a straight filament standing at the origin is considered. The structure of the filament is made to have the same molecular organization as the model. The centerline is chosen to lie along the z-axis. The filament is then bent at different values of curvature κ. For each κ, the elastic energy Eκ of the bent filament is calculated. First Eκ is evaluated using ENM based on the new local configuration (x’, y’, z’) of the bent filament. The new position (x’, y’, z’) can be expressed in terms of the material point (x, y, z) of the straight filament by making use of the Frenet-Serret frame (2). When the filament is bent, the position r(s) at the arc length s parameterizing the position of the rod centerline can be defined as r(s) = 0,R − R cos(s /R),R sin(s /R) [], (A 1) where R is the radius of curvature, so that κ = 1 /R is the curvature. Here the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> is chosen to be the y-z plane.

40|$|Body Area Network (BAN) is an {{expansion}} of Personal Area Networks (PANs) which enabled different devices {{to communicate with each}} other by placing them on human body. The applications of BAN include measuring run time physiological changes, foul playing detection in sports and navigation. We can also continuously keep the record of patient’s health by monitoring the changes in human body. The frequency bands used in such systems are Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band (2. 40 GHz to 2. 50 GHz) and Wireless Body Area Network application band at 2. 45 GHz. Wearable antennas are used as transceiver nodes in WBAN systems for sending and receiving the data or information. These antennas are kept flexible so that they do not hinder the movements of the human body. To make sure these antennas are flexible, different flexible materials are now-a-days used as substrates for the designing of the wearable antennas. Due to the constant motion of human body, it is difficult to get the proper polarization alignment of the transceiver nodes for better power reception. Circular polarization (CP) operation eliminates the need to continuously align two nodes for receiving maximum power. Previously reported wearable antennas are mostly non-flexible, linearly polarized, large in size or have thick substrate which makes them difficult to be used in wearable applications. In this thesis, two different flexible substrates have been used to design circularly polarized wearable antennas and their performance is analyzed near human body. The selected antenna type is microstrip patch antenna with circular patch configuration operating for ISM band and WBAN applications at 2. 45 GHz. To have a better idea of performance of flexible substrates, two substrates i. e. Denim and Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) foam are selected having 1 mm and 3 mm thickness respectively. Copper tape with thickness 0. 25 mm is used as conductive part for both the antennas. To achieve circular polarization a rectangular slot along the diagonal axis is inserted at the center of the circular patch. Performance of both antennas is analyzed in free space and in human body vicinity. The antenna showed good agreement between simulated and measured free space results, however due to fabrication inaccuracies, some shifting of operating frequency is observed. EPDM antenna shows better results in terms of return loss, bandwidth and Axial Ratio (AR) compared with Denim antenna in free space. Free space bending is analyzed in two planes i. e. xz and yz, with two different bending radii (50 mm and 75 mm). Bending analysis showed that the performance of the antenna is affected more when the antenna is bent along the direction which determines its resonance length. Impedance matching is improved when the antenna is bent in xz-plane. Beam width increases in the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> which results in decreased antenna gain. Human body is made up of 65 - 75 % water. The dielectric constant of water is very high (above 75 at 20 °C) and at higher frequencies it absorbs power and can reduce the efficiency of any antenna placed nearby. The near body performance of the designed antennas is analyzed by varying the distance between the antenna and the human body using a polyethylene foam sheet of different thicknesses. Three different distances were selected i. e. 0 mm (directly on skin), 2 mm and 5 mm to have a better idea of the effects with respect to varying distance between the human body and the wearable antenna. The performance of the antenna in terms of the input matching and the impedance bandwidth is analyzed on two different body parts i. e. arm and leg, with bending in both xz-plane and yz-plane. The results show a decrease in return loss due to lossy nature of the human body, and increase in bandwidth due to the lowering of the Q factor of the antenna. The antenna gain is increased due to low penetration depth and reflections from the human body in simulation and real on-body measurements at high frequencies. The percentage increase in gain near human body for EPDM and Denim is around 19. 56 % and 10. 66 % respectively. The summary of results shows that the designed antennas operate for desired frequency bands with good efficiency in all simulated and measured scenarios; however EPDM antenna is better in terms of antenna impedance and radiation characteristics, weight, wearing comfort, and can naturally and forcibly retract to its original dimensions after deformation. The copper tape used in fabricating the antenna peels off with time and makes the antenna less reliable. In future, the conductive part can be printed using Inkjet or Micro Dispense 3 D Printer for a more reliable and accurate design of the wearable antenna...|$|E

40|$|Incompressible flow in a {{guide vane}} bend may be {{considered}} as composed of a primary two-dimensional, nearly potential flow upon which is superimposed a secondary flow. The two-dimensional flow lies in the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bend</b> and {{is determined by the}} flow boundaries alone. If the flow entering a bend were everywhere irrotational, the two-dimensional flow pattern would be the three-dimensional pattern (nearly). Because the real flow entering a bend has a nonuniform velocity profile in planes normal to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bend,</b> the streamlines in the nonuniform region are determined not alone by the flow boundaries but also by the entrance profile or vorticity. The main purpose of this research was the study of the influence of secondary flows on the basic two-dimensional flow. It is shown in the report from experimental data that the secondary flows have a negligible influence on the average deflection of the flow by the guide vanes, but they have a major influence on the energy loss. The two-dimensional loss coefficient is increased 100 per cent and more by the secondary flows. The loss attributable to secondary flows may be divided into two parts. The smaller of the two parts occurs at the vanes and the larger part occurs in a region downstream of the vanes extending over three or four duct hydraulic diameters. This larger part of the loss is attributed mainly to increased wall shear downstream of the vanes. The increased wall shear occurs because the secondary flow brings high-energy, high-velocity fluid to the duct wall from the interior.

40|$|Femtosecond laser pulses {{were used}} for the direct point-by-point {{inscription}} of waveguides into the cladding of standard single-mode fibers. Homogeneous S-shaped waveguides have been processed as a bundle of overlapping lines without damaging the surrounding material. Within these structures, FBGs have been successfully inscribed and characterized. A sensor device to measure the <b>bending</b> direction <b>of</b> a fiber was created by two perpendicular inscribed cladding waveguides with FBG. Finally, a complete 3 D shape sensor consisting <b>of</b> several <b>bending</b> sensor <b>planes,</b> capable <b>of</b> detecting <b>bending</b> radii even below 2. 5 cm is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{model for the}} analysis of an E-plane right-angle bend in parallel-plate waveguide (PPW), with a single square step for matching purposes. This design can achieve wideband matching and can be implemented using hollow waveguides as well as multilayer printed circuit boards. An even- and odd-mode analysis is performed exploiting the symmetry of the structure. Two auxiliary problems are defined considering the bisecting <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bend</b> as a perfect electric conductor or a perfect magnetic conductor, respectively. They are solved using a mode matching method. The mathematical derivations are discussed in detail. The proposed procedure can be embedded in efficient tools {{for the analysis of}} complex PPW systems, such as feed networks for antenna arrays...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith {{the view}} to {{minimise}} {{the impact on}} the environment and to produce structural parts with a good production-rate/cost-ratio, the sheet forming of woven flax based fabric was investigated in this study. A flax fibre plain-weave fabric has been used to form a complex tetrahedron shape. This shape is of particular interest as it contains several geometric singularities required by many automotive parts such as double or triple curvature and low-curvature edges. Globally, the complex tetrahedron shape was obtained, but tow buckling (out <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> tows) was observed in specific zones of the shape. The main mechanism at the origin of this defect has been defined. A reduction of the tow buckle size was obtained by increasing the membrane tension. The influence of fabric architecture at the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales on the appearance of the tow buckles was demonstrated and discussed. Solutions to prevent the appearance of this defect based on the design of the fabric architecture at the tow or fabric scales were successfully proposed. As a consequence, when sheet forming of complex shapes is considered, specific fabric architectures should be chosen to prevent the appearance of the buckling defect...|$|R
