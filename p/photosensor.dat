25|$|The fluorescently labeled probe {{is excited}} by {{light and the}} {{emission}} of the excitation is then detected by a <b>photosensor</b> such as a CCD camera equipped with appropriate emission filters which captures a digital image of the western blot and allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis and a quantitative western blot analysis.

25|$|This {{pioneering}} setup {{gave way}} in 1958 {{to a system}} called 'GuideMatic' in reference to GM's Guide lighting division. The GuideMatic had a more compact dashtop housing and a control knob that allowed the driver to adjust the system's sensitivity threshold to determine when the headlamps would be dipped from high to low beam {{in response to an}} oncoming vehicle. By the early 1970s, this option was withdrawn from all GM models except Cadillac, on which GuideMatic was available through 1988. The <b>photosensor</b> for this system used an amber lens, and the adoption of retro-reflective yellow road signs, such as for oncoming curves, caused them to dim prematurely - possibly leading to their discontinuation.|$|E
50|$|The 50D adds 5 megapixels to an APS-C sized sensor (compared to the 40D), and as {{a result}} the size of the {{individual}} <b>photosensors</b> has decreased. To offset the increased noise that inevitably results from smaller <b>photosensors,</b> Canon eliminated the gaps between the microlenses covering the <b>photosensors.</b> Thus the microlenses are larger, and capture more light and direct it to the sensor sites.|$|R
50|$|The pixel count {{quoted by}} {{manufacturers}} {{can be misleading}} as {{it may not be}} the number of full-color pixels. For cameras using single-chip image sensors the number claimed is the total number of single-color-sensitive <b>photosensors,</b> whether they have different locations in the plane, as with the Bayer sensor, or in stacks of three co-located <b>photosensors</b> as in the Foveon X3 sensor. However, the images have different numbers of RGB pixels: Bayer-sensor cameras produce as many RGB pixels as <b>photosensors</b> via demosaicing (interpolation), while Foveon sensors produce uninterpolated image files with one-third as many RGB pixels as <b>photosensors.</b> Comparisons of megapixel ratings of these two types of sensors are sometimes a subject of dispute.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a thin film}} device, combining, on the same glass substrate, <b>photosensors</b> and long-pass interferential filter to achieve a compact and efficient sensor for biomolecule detection. The <b>photosensors</b> are amorphous silicon stacked structures, while the interferential filter is fabricated alternating layers of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide, directly grown over the <b>photosensors.</b> The system has been optimized to effectively detect the natural fluorescence of Ochratoxin A, a highly toxic mycotoxin present in different food commodities. In particular, the long-pass interferential filter {{has been designed to}} reject the wavelengths arising from the excitation source (centered at 330 nm) thus transmitting the OTA emission spectrum (centered at 470 nm). Experimental results show that the filter strongly reduces the <b>photosensors</b> quantum efficiency below 420 nm, while keeps it nearly constant at higher wavelengt...|$|R
25|$|A photoelectric, or optical smoke {{detector}} contains a source of infrared, visible, or ultraviolet light (typically an incandescent light bulb or light-emitting diode), a lens, and a photoelectric receiver (typically a photodiode). In spot-type detectors all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air, which may contain smoke from a nearby fire, flows. In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums, optical beam or projected-beam {{smoke detector}}s are used instead of a chamber within the unit: a wall-mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device, or reflected back to the receiver by a reflector. In some types, particularly optical beam types, the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the <b>photosensor.</b> The received light intensity will be reduced by absorption due to smoke, air-borne dust, or other substances; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke. In other types, typically chamber types, the light is not directed at the sensor, which is not illuminated {{in the absence of}} particles. If the air in the chamber contains particles (smoke or dust), the light is scattered and some of it reaches the sensor, triggering the alarm.|$|E

2500|$|A MNT {{nanosensor}} would {{resemble a}} smart material, involving a small component {{within a larger}} machine that would react to its environment and change in some fundamental, intentional way. [...] A very simple example: a <b>photosensor</b> might passively measure the incident light and discharge its absorbed energy as electricity when the light passes above or below a specified threshold, sending a signal to a larger machine. [...] Such a sensor would supposedly cost less and use less power than a conventional sensor, and yet function usefully in all the same applications [...] for example, turning on parking lot lights when it gets dark.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{difference}} is that more of the photons entering the camera will be detected by the Foveon X3 <b>photosensor</b> than is possible with a mosaic sensor. This is because each of the color filters overlaying each photosite of a mosaic sensor passes {{only one of the}} primary colors, absorbing the other two. The absorption of these colors reduces the total amount of light gathered by the sensor and destroys much of the information about the color of the light impinging on each sensor element. Although the Foveon X3 has greater light gathering ability, the individual layers do not respond as sharply to the respective colours. Thus color-indicating information in the sensor's raw data requires [...] "aggressive" [...] matrixing (essentially, removal of common-mode signals) to produce color data in a standard color space, which can increase color noise in low-light situations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{synchronizer}} acts as {{an external}} trigger for both the camera(s) and the laser. [...] While analogue systems {{in the form of}} a <b>photosensor,</b> rotating aperture and a light source have been used in the past, most systems in use today are digital. [...] Controlled by a computer, the synchronizer can dictate the timing of each frame of the CCD camera's sequence in conjunction with the firing of the laser to within 1 ns precision. [...] Thus the time between each pulse of the laser and the placement of the laser shot in reference to the camera's timing can be accurately controlled. [...] Knowledge of this timing is critical as it is needed to determine the velocity of the fluid in the PIV analysis. Stand-alone electronic synchronizers, called digital delay generators, offer variable resolution timing from as low as 250 ps to as high as several ms. With up to eight channels of synchronized timing, they offer the means to control several flash lamps and Q-switches as well as provide for multiple camera exposures.|$|E
50|$|All {{daylight}} harvesting systems use a {{light level}} sensor, a <b>photosensor,</b> {{to detect the}} prevailing light level, luminance or brightness, in open-loop or closed-loop systems. Photosensors are used to adjust electric lighting based on the available daylight in the space. In an open-loop system, the <b>photosensor</b> detects the amount of available daylight only, and can be positioned on the building's exterior wall or roof, or inside the building facing the window or skylight. In a closed-loop system, the <b>photosensor</b> detects the total photometric amount of light, from both daylight and electric sources in the space. For example, in an office a closed-loop <b>photosensor</b> can be positioned on the ceiling facing the desktops in order to detect the amount {{of light on the}} work surface, as placing the sensor on the desktop itself would be impractical. In both the open- and closed-loop configurations, the signal from the <b>photosensor</b> must be carefully calibrated to accurately indicate the effect of exterior daylight variations on the light level on 'important function' areas in the space.|$|E

The presence of light at night in human dwellings (or for shift workers) makes going to sleep more difficult and reduces the overall level of melatonin in the bloodstream, and exposure to a low-level incandescent bulb for 39 minutes is sufficient to suppress melatonin levels to 50%. Because melatonin is a powerful anti-oxidant, it is hypothesized that this reduction can result in an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer.|$|E
