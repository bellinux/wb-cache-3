500|$|In 1978, Tiger <b>putted</b> against comedian Bob Hope in a {{television}} appearance on The Mike Douglas Show. [...] At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes at the Navy course. [...] At age five, he appeared in Golf Digest and on ABC's That's Incredible. Before turning seven, Tiger won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive, Pitch, and Putt competition, held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress, California. In 1984 {{at the age of}} eight, he won the 9–10 boys' event, the youngest age group available, at the Junior World Golf Championships. He first broke 80 at age eight.

500|$|... "Creep" [...] is {{a rhythm}} and blues song that is also {{influenced}} by funk, jazz, soul and boom bap, all creating a new distinctive sound for the trio since most of their early works are new jack swing. This significant musical re-invention {{was said to have}} formed during the midst nineties' R [...] "renaissance" [...] in music and partially because of Lopes' stint in rehab, which <b>putted</b> a stronger focus on the group's pop elements on the song and on CrazySexyCool. Still, similar to their past works, [...] "Creep" [...] carries hip hop samples—particularly two 1989 singles Slick Rick's [...] "Hey Young World" [...] and Shinehead's [...] "Who the Cap Fits", a heavy beat, [...] "forthright sex talk" [...] lyrics with a kind of [...] "playful sensuality" [...] and [...] "street aggression." [...] They were said to have delivered it in an [...] "empowered" [...] attitude and Prince-style eroticism. Its production was built on a [...] "deep" [...] and [...] "infectious" [...] groove, around a wafting [...] "late night"–style trumpet sample with quietly [...] "jiggling" [...] funk guitar and scratching sounds, all adding depth to the subversively [...] "poppy" [...] vocal chorus and accentuating the song's [...] "slinky" [...] hooks. Michael Arceneaux from Complex called the track a [...] "darker, mellower, and far jazzier" [...] sound than any of its predecessors, which was [...] "perfect" [...] for Watkins' alto voice.|$|E

2500|$|Woods then flew to Ireland {{to play in}} {{a two-day}} charity event, the JP McManus Pro-Am, and then flew home to Florida to [...] "see his kids", before {{preparing}} for The Open Championship just over a week later. He changed his putter for the Open Championship at St Andrews Old Course, saying he always struggled on slow greens and needed this new Nike Method 001 putter to [...] "get the ball rolling faster and better". This was a somewhat surprising statement, considering he had won the previous two Open Championships held at St Andrews, in 2000 and 2005. It was the first time Woods had used any other putter than his Titleist Scotty Cameron since 1999. Woods <b>putted</b> well {{the first day of the}} tournament, shooting a 5-under 67, but wind gusts of over 40mph suspended play for 66 minutes the next day at St Andrews, and Woods was never able to get anything going. It was the same story Saturday. He repeatedly missed short putts. He changed his putter back to his old Scotty Cameron for the final round, but did not putt any better. Woods finished 3-under overall, 13 shots behind winner Louis Oosthuizen (tied for 23rd place).|$|E
2500|$|Woods {{then took}} an {{extended}} break from competition, to refine new techniques with Foley. He returned in early November, {{after more than}} a month off, at the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai, where he had placed 2nd in 2009, but failed to challenge seriously. Next was a visit to Thailand, his mother's birthplace, for a one-day Skins Game, honoring King Bhumibol. At the 2010 JBWere Masters, held near Melbourne, Australia in mid-November, Woods arrived as defending champion and was paid an appearance fee of more than $3million. He charged late on the final day to finish in fourth place. Over his final six holes, Woods made two eagles, two birdies, and two pars, to end with a round of 6-under 65. Three weeks later, resuming his role as host of the elite-field Chevron World Challenge near Los Angeles (he had skipped the 2009 event because of personal crisis; the tournament serves as a primary benefactor of his charitable foundation), Woods put up three straight rounds in the 60s, and led going into the final round {{for the first time in}} 2010. But he struggled with his long-game control in mixed weather conditions on Sunday, and <b>putted</b> much worse than he had in previous rounds, winding up in a tie with Graeme McDowell after 72 holes. McDowell sank a [...] birdie putt on the final green; Woods then sank his own short birdie putt to tie. McDowell again made birdie on the first playoff hole (the 18th) from [...] to take the title, when Woods missed from shorter range. The playoff loss meant that Woods went winless for an entire season, for the first time since turning professional. However, Woods finished the 2010 season ranked #2 in the world. He again used the Nike Method 003 putter for his final two events of 2010.|$|E
60|$|The {{professor}} {{decided to}} take a chance: and he failed miserably. As I was on the green with my third, and, unless I <b>putted</b> extremely poorly, was morally certain to be down in five, which is bogey for the hole, there was not much practical use in his continuing to struggle. But he did in a spirit of pure vindictiveness, {{as if he were trying}} to take it out of the ball. It was a grisly sight to see him, head and shoulders above the ditch, hewing at his obstinate colonel. It was a similar spectacle that once induced a lay spectator of a golf match to observe that he considered hockey a silly game.|$|E

6000|$|He was, however, {{presently}} cheered, {{by finding}} that more importance {{was attached to}} his arrival than his modesty had anticipated. A disputed cast had occurred between the bands of players, and as the gauger favoured the one party, and the schoolmaster the other, the matter might {{be said to be}} taken up by the higher powers. The miller and smith, also, had espoused different sides, and, considering the vivacity of two such disputants, there was reason to doubt whether the strife might be amicably terminated. But the first person who caught a sight of the mendicant exclaimed, [...] "Ah! here comes auld Edie, that kens the rules of a' country games better than ony man that ever drave a bowl, or threw an axle-tree, or <b>putted</b> a stane either;--let's hae nae quarrelling, callants--we'll stand by auld Edie's judgment." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt {{ruthless}} {{towards the}} professor. I cannot plead {{ignorance of the}} golfer's point of view {{as an excuse for}} my plottings. I knew that to one whose soul is in the game as the professor's was, the agony of being just beaten in an important match exceeds in bitterness all other agonies. I knew that, if I scraped through by the smallest possible margin, his appetite would be destroyed, his sleep o' nights broken. He would wake from fitful slumber moaning that if he had only used his iron instead of his mashie at the tenth, all would have been well; that, if he had <b>putted</b> more carefully on the seventh green, life would not be drear and blank; that a more judicious manipulation of his brassey throughout might have given him something to live for. All these things I knew.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Sandys had started, {{and then}} turned piteously from them; but {{when they were done}} she tried to smile, and said, with forced gayety, that she saw they were guisers, and it was a fine night, and would they take a chair. The male {{stranger}} did so at once, but the female said, rather anxiously: [...] "You are sure as you don't know who we is?" [...] Their hostess shook her head, and then he of the poker offered her three guesses, a daring thing to do, but all went well, for her first guess was Shovel and his old girl; second guess, Before and After; third guess, Napoleon Buonaparte and the Auld Licht minister. At each guess the smaller of the intruders clapped her hands gleefully, but when, with the third, she was unmuzzled, she <b>putted</b> with her head at Mrs. Sandys and hugged her, screaming, [...] "It ain't none on them; it's jest me, mother, it's Elspeth!" [...] and even while their astounded hostess was asking could it be true, the male conspirator dropped his poker noisily (to draw attention to himself) and stood revealed as Thomas Sandys.|$|E
