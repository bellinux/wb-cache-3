After she is discharged, Akash realises his love for her, and tries everything to make her happy. The two venture to Las Vegas, as Akash has never gone on a holiday, and they end up in bed together.

5|$|Allen {{was born}} on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia, the second of three {{children}} to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), née Lamb, {{the daughter of a}} Queensland Minister of Lands. Later rumours suggested that Allen's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner, who supported Allen in his cricket career. Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London—hoping that the children would benefit from an English education—where they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages. Finding that they enjoyed England, the family abandoned <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Australia.|$|E

5|$|Meyer is {{challenged}} {{in the general}} election by Southern Senator Bill O'Brien. The election ends in an Electoral College tie, but with Meyer having won the popular vote. After an ambiguous result in Nevada, the Meyer camp successfully campaigns for a recount. The recount backfires, and O'Brien keeps Nevada as a victory, as well as overtakes the popular vote. Congress must then decide who will be the President. After the House of Representatives fails to elect the President, Meyer agrees to be Vice President for her running mate Tom James, however the Senate instead elects O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez as Vice President. Due to the tied vote in the House, the office of the President is left vacant, meaning that now as Vice President, Montez immediately ascends to the presidency. As a result, James makes <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the private sector while Meyer, now completely out of office, contemplates her future.|$|E
5|$|On 25 February 2014, former First Prime Minister of Cambodia Norodom Ranariddh, who {{was ousted}} from FUNCINPEC in 2006, {{announced}} <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> politics {{and lead the}} formation the Community of Royalist People's Party. The Cambodian Interior Ministry reportedly received a request from the party to be formally registered as a political party. In March 2014, Ranariddh hosted the party's official launching ceremony at the Phnom Penh Sunway Hotel, where he revealed the party logo and signed registration papers for the party. In April 2014, the CRPP's registration was officially approved by the Interior Ministry. A month later, CRPP appointed a new chief-of-cabinet Nop Sothearith, and the party also made an in-advance registration with the Interior Ministry to run for general elections scheduled {{to be held in}} 2018. In June 2014, the CRPP held a party to mark its official launch, and opened its headquarters at the Russey Keo District in Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey died in September 1151, and Henry {{postponed}} his <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> England, as {{he first}} {{needed to ensure}} that his succession, particularly in Anjou, was secure. At around this time Henry was also probably secretly planning his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine, then still the wife of Louis. Eleanor was the Duchess of Aquitaine, a land {{in the south of}} France, and was considered beautiful, lively and controversial, but had not borne Louis any sons. Louis had the marriage annulled and Henry married Eleanor eight weeks later on 18 May. The marriage instantly reignited Henry's tensions with Louis: the marriage was considered an insult, it ran counter to feudal practice and it threatened the inheritance of Louis and Eleanor's two daughters, Marie and Alix, who might otherwise have had claims to Aquitaine on Eleanor's death. With his new lands, Henry now possessed a much larger proportion of France than Louis. Louis organised a coalition against Henry, including Stephen, Eustace, Henry the Count of Champagne, and Robert the Count of Perche. Louis's alliance was joined by Henry's younger brother, Geoffrey, who rose in revolt, claiming that Henry had dispossessed him of his inheritance. Geoffrey of Anjou's plans for the inheritance of his lands had been ambiguous, making the veracity of his son Geoffrey's claims hard to assess. Contemporaneous accounts suggest he left the main castles in Poitou to Geoffrey, implying that he may have intended Henry to retain Normandy and Anjou and not Poitou.|$|E
