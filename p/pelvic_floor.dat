25|$|Many {{people with}} FI have a {{generalized}} {{weakness of the}} <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor,</b> especially puborectalis. A weakened puborectalis leads to widening of the anorectal angle, and impaired barrier to stool in the rectum entering the anal canal, and this is associated with incontinence to solids. Abnormal descent of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> {{can also be a}} sign of <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> weakness. Abnormal descent manifests as descending perineum syndrome (>4cm perineal descent). This syndrome initially gives constipation, and later FI. The <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> is innervated by the pudendal nerve and the S3 and S4 branches of the pelvic plexus. With recurrent straining, e.g. during difficult labour or long term constipation, then stretch injury can damage the nerves supplying levator ani. The pudendal nerve is especially vulnerable to irreversible damage, (stretch induced pudendal neuropathy) which can occur with a 12% stretch. If the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> muscles lose their innervation, they cease to contract and their muscle fibres are in time replaced by fibrous tissue, which is associated with <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> weakness and incontinence. Increased pudendal nerve terminal motor latency may indicate <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> weakness. The various types of pelvic organ prolapse (e.g. external rectal prolapse, mucosal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception & solitary rectal ulcer syndrome) may also cause coexisting obstructed defecation.|$|E
25|$|The {{association}} with uterine prolapse (10-25%) and cystocele (35%) {{may suggest that}} there is some underlying abnormality of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> that affects multiple pelvic organs. Proximal bilateral pudendal neuropathy has been demonstrated in patients with rectal prolapse who have fecal incontinence. This finding was shown to be absent in healthy subjects, and may be the cause of denervation-related atrophy of the external anal sphincter. Some authors suggest that pudendal nerve damage is the cause for <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> and anal sphincter weakening, and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> disorders.|$|E
25|$|The role of <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> {{exercises}} and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. While {{there may be}} some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim to increase the strength of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people doing them. This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).|$|E
25|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> {{dysfunction}} is also {{a physical}} and underlying cause of many sexual dysfunctions.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk {{includes}} the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity (the space enclosed by the bony pelvis), the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor,</b> below the pelvic cavity, and the perineum, below the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor.</b> The pelvic skeleton is formed {{in the area of}} the back, by the sacrum and the coccyx and anteriorly and to the left and right sides, by a pair of hip bones.|$|E
25|$|Non {{surgical}} {{measures to}} treat internal intussusception include <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> retraining, a bulking agent (e.g. psyllium), suppositories or enemas to relieve constipation and straining. If there is incontinence (fecal leakage or more severe FI), or paradoxical contraction of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> (anismus), then biofeedback retraining is indicated. Some researchers advise that internal intussusception be managed conservatively, compared to external rectal prolapse which usually requires surgery.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> {{dysfunction}} can be {{an underlying}} cause of sexual dysfunction in both women and men, and is treatable by physical therapy.|$|E
25|$|Stopping {{straining}} during bowel movements, by use {{of correct}} posture, dietary fiber intake (possibly included bulk forming laxatives such as psyllium), stool softeners (e.g. polyethylene glycol, and biofeedback retraining to coordinate <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> during defecation.|$|E
25|$|Head engagement, {{where the}} fetal head descends into cephalic presentation, {{relieves}} {{pressure on the}} upper abdomen with renewed ease in breathing. It also severely reduces bladder capacity, and increases pressure on the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> and the rectum.|$|E
25|$|Outlet {{obstruction}} is a {{sub-type of}} large bowel obstruction and refers to conditions affecting the anorectal region that obstruct defecation, specifically {{conditions of the}} <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> and anal sphincters. Outlet obstruction can be classified into 4 groups.|$|E
25|$|An {{average of}} 55.5% {{of people with}} {{cerebral}} palsy experience lower urinary tract symptoms, more commonly excessive storage issues than voiding issues. Those with voiding issues and <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> overactivity can deteriorate as adults and experience upper urinary tract dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|One can sub-divide the {{prostate}} in two ways: by zone or by lobe. It {{does not have}} a capsule; rather an integral fibromuscular band surrounds it. It is sheathed in the muscles of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor,</b> which contract during the ejaculatory process.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled. One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of {{the muscles of the}} <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction. Another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center, which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.|$|E
25|$|Botulinum toxin A (Botox) {{has been}} {{considered}} as a treatment option, under the idea of temporarily reducing the hypertonicity of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> muscles. Although no random controlled trials have been done with this treatment, experimental studies with small samples have shown it to be effective, with sustained positive results through 10 months. Similar in its mechanism of treatment, lidocaine has also been tried as an experimental option.|$|E
25|$|Repetitive penetrative {{anal sex}} {{may result in}} the anal sphincters {{becoming}} weakened, which may cause rectal prolapse or affect the ability to hold in feces (a condition known as fecal incontinence). Rectal prolapse is relatively uncommon, however, especially in men, and its causes are not well understood. Kegel exercises {{have been used to}} strengthen the anal sphincters and overall <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor,</b> and may help prevent or remedy fecal incontinence.|$|E
25|$|Humans are bipedal with an erect stance. The erect posture {{causes the}} weight of the {{abdominal}} contents to thrust on the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor,</b> a complex structure which must not only support this weight but allow, in women, three channels to pass through it: the urethra, the vagina and the rectum. The infant's head and shoulders must go through a specific sequence of maneuvers in order to pass through the ring of the mother's pelvis.|$|E
25|$|Vaginal {{prolapse}} {{is characterized}} by a portion of the vaginal canal protruding (prolapsing) from the opening of the vagina. It may result in the case of weakened pelvic muscles, which is a common result of childbirth; in the case of this prolapse, the rectum, uterus, or bladder pushes on the vagina, and severe cases result in the vagina protruding out of the body. Kegel exercises have been used to strengthen the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor,</b> and may help prevent or remedy vaginal prolapse.|$|E
25|$|The two hip bones {{connect the}} spine {{with the lower}} limbs. They are {{attached}} to the sacrum posteriorly, connected to each other anteriorly, and joined with the two femurs at the hip joints. The gap enclosed by the bony pelvis, called the pelvic cavity, is the section of the body underneath the abdomen and mainly consists of the reproductive organs (sex organs) and the rectum, while the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> {{at the base of the}} cavity assists in supporting the organs of the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The bladder is {{situated}} below the peritoneal cavity near the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> {{and behind the}} pubic symphysis. In men, it lies {{in front of the}} rectum, separated by the recto-vesical pouch, and is supported by fibres of the levator ani and of the prostate gland. In women, it lies in front of the uterus, separated by the vesico-uterine pouch, and is supported by the elevator ani and {{the upper part of the}} vagina. The wall of the urinary bladder is normally 3â€“5mm thick. When well distended, the wall is normally less than 3mm.|$|E
25|$|This {{investigation}} objectively {{documents the}} functional {{status of the}} sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some. It {{may be used to}} assess for <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> dyssenergia, (anismus is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative biofeedback therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse. Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse. In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence.|$|E
25|$|Potentially painful cancer {{treatments}} include immunotherapy which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, {{which can cause}} skin reactions, enteritis, fibrosis, myelopathy, bone necrosis, neuropathy or plexopathy; chemotherapy, often associated with mucositis, joint pain, muscle pain, peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab and rituximab, which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; angiogenesis inhibitors like bevacizumab, known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> myalgia.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk is {{the lower part of}} the trunk, between the abdomen and the thighs. It {{includes}} several structures: the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity, the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor,</b> and the perineum. The bony pelvis (pelvic skeleton) is the part of the skeleton embedded in the pelvic {{region of the}} trunk. It is subdivided into the pelvic girdle and the pelvic spine. The pelvic girdle is composed of the appendicular hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) oriented in a ring, and connects the pelvic region of the spine to the lower limbs. The pelvic spine consists of the sacrum and coccyx.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a large}} {{defect in}} the {{anterior}} wall of the Lady's torso. The viscera (internal organs) {{were removed from the}} mummy's embalmers, {{with the exception of the}} Lady's heart which is still visible within the body. The heart was apparently never moved. The embalming incision has been located in the left inguinal region. This tissue gap is 56 millimetres in length and 135 millimetres in depth. The torso contains both linen fibers which were mildly smeared with resin, and with linen packs treated with resin. One of the resin-treated linen packs was placed within the pelvis. The <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> has a large defect, possibly used during the mummification process to remove the viscera. This would be an example of perineal evisceration.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} anal sphincters and <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> muscles, inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative. In light of the above, intra-anal electrical stimulation (using an anal probe as electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as electrode). Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted sacral nerve stimulation may be more effective than exercises, and electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves. TENS is also sometimes used to treat FI by transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Vaginismus {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} mention of urinary {{incontinence}} occurs in 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus, the first mention of FI {{in a medical}} context is unknown. For many centuries, colonic irrigation was the only treatment available. Stoma creation was described in 1776, FI associated with rectal prolapse in 1873 and anterior sphincter repair in 1875. During the mid 20th Century, several operations were developed for instances where the sphincters were intact but weakened. Muscle transpositions using the gluteus maximus or the gracilis were devised, but did not become used widely until later. End-to-end sphincteroplasty is shown {{to have a high}} failure rate in 1940. In 1971 Parks and McPartlin first describe an overlapping sphincteroplasty procedure. Biofeedback is first introduced in 1974. In 1975, Parks describes post anal repair, a technique to reinforce the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> and EAS to treat idiopathic cases. Endoanal ultrasound is invented in 1991, which starts to demonstrate the high number of occult sphincter tears following vaginal deliveries. In 1994, the use of an endoanal coil during pelvic MRI shows greater detail of the anal canal than previously. During the last 20 years, dynamic graciliplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, injectable perianal bulking agents and radiofrequency ablation have been devised, mainly due to the relatively poor success rates and high morbidity associated with the earlier procedures.|$|E

500|$|The pudendal nerve can be {{compressed}} or stretched, {{resulting in}} temporary or permanent neuropathy. Irreversible nerve injury may occur when nerves are stretched by 12% {{or more of their}} normal length. If the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> is over-stretched, acutely (e.g. prolonged or difficult childbirth) or chronically (e.g. chronic straining during defecation caused by constipation), the pudendal nerve is vulnerable to stretch-induced neuropathy. Pudendal nerve entrapment, also known as Alcock canal syndrome, is very rare and is associated with professional cycling. Systemic diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis can damage the pudendal nerve via demyelination or other mechanisms. [...] A pelvic tumor (most notably a large sacrococcygeal teratoma), or surgery to remove the tumor, can also cause permanent damage.|$|E
500|$|The {{clitoral}} body extends up {{to several}} centimeters before reversing direction and branching, resulting in an inverted [...] "V" [...] shape that extends {{as a pair of}} crura ("legs"). The crura are the proximal portions of the arms of the wishbone. Ending at the glans of the clitoris, the tip of the body bends anteriorly away from the pubis. Each crus (singular form of crura) is attached to the corresponding ischial ramusâ€“ extensions of the copora beneath the descending pubic rami. Concealed behind the labia minora, the crura end with attachment at or just below the middle of the pubic arch. Associated are the urethral sponge, perineal sponge, a network of nerves and blood vessels, the suspensory ligament of the clitoris, muscles and the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bladder: Symptomatology of the {{urinary tract}} {{is common in}} MS. Treatments for bladder {{problems}} {{vary depending on the}} origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided into treatment of bladder control and incontinence, and of urinary tract infections. Regarding bladder control, some examples of medications used are desmopressin for nocturia and anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin and tolterodine for urinary urgency. Non-pharmacological management includes <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> muscle training, stimulation, pessaries, bladder retraining, changes to daily life habits such as clothing, use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women; [...] and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization. Regarding long term catheterization, it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible. Some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in MS but are general recommendations for those who have neurogenic bladder.|$|E
500|$|The reflexogenic pathway {{activates}} the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} {{in response to the}} sensation of touch. It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord (not to the brain) and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at S2â€“S4. A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 {{may not be able to}} experience psychogenic vaginal lubrication, but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured. Likewise, although a man's ability to get a psychogenic erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher-level SCI, he may still be able to get a reflex or [...] "spontaneous" [...] erection. These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed, e.g. by clothing, but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed. Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI, due to the loss of inhibitory input from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man. Conversely, an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not psychogenic erections. People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a bulbocavernosus reflex (contraction of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> in response to pressure on the clitoris or glans penis) are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication. Like other reflexes, reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from spinal shock.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> has two {{inherently}} conflicting functions: One is {{to close}} the pelvic and abdominal cavities and bear the load of the visceral organs; {{the other is to}} control the openings of the rectum and urogenital organs that pierce the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> and make it weaker. [...] To achieve both these tasks, the <b>pelvic</b> <b>floor</b> is composed of several overlapping sheets of muscles and connective tissues.|$|E
