40|$|In {{this thesis}} we give a new {{approach}} to the classical problems of finite and infinite packings and lattice packings of convex bodies. This approach is based on the introduction of parameterized densities δρ(K,C), ρ ∈ R> 0. The parameterized density of a finite <b>packing</b> <b>set</b> C of a convex bodyK with respect to the parameter ρ is defined by δρ(K,C) = #(C) V (K) V (conv(C) + ρK) where V (·) denotes the volume and #(C) denotes the cardinality of the <b>packing</b> <b>set</b> C. In particular for ρ = 1 we obtain a measure for the quality of finite packings, that is equivalent to the “densities ” used by Rogers, Groemer, Oler and L. Fejes Tóth. For a given convex body K, ρ ∈ R> 0, and an integer n we are asking for a <b>packing</b> <b>set</b> C of cardinality n, that has a maximal parameterized density δρ(K,C). Moreover we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of these max...|$|E
40|$|For a given subset A⊆ F_q^*, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} finding a large <b>packing</b> <b>set</b> B of A, that is, a set B ⊆ F_q^* such that |AB|=|A||B|. We prove the {{existence}} of such a B of size |B|> (q- 1) /|A/A| and show that this bound is in general optimal. The case that q=p is a prime and A={ 1, 2, [...] .,λ} for some positive integer λ is particularly interesting in view of the construction of limited-magnitude error correcting codes. Here we construct a <b>packing</b> <b>set</b> B of size |B|≫ p (λ p) ^- 1 for any λ< c p^ 1 / 2 for some explicitly calcuable constant c. This result is optimal up to the logarithmic factor.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a mixed integer set {{resulting}} from the intersection of a single constrained mixed 0 – 1 set with the vertex <b>packing</b> <b>set</b> is investigated. This set arises as a subproblem of more general mixed integer problems such as inventory routing and facility location problems. Families of strong valid inequalities that {{take into account the}} structure of the simple mixed integer set and that of the vertex <b>packing</b> <b>set</b> simultaneously are introduced. In particular, the well-known mixed integer rounding inequality is generalized to the case where incompatibilities between binary variables are present. Exact and heuristic algorithms are designed to solve the separation problems associated to the proposed valid inequalities. Preliminary computational experiments show that these inequalities can be useful to reduce the integrality gaps and to solve integer programming problems...|$|E
40|$|Many {{combinatorial}} problems, such as bin <b>packing,</b> <b>set</b> covering, and combinatorial design, can be conveniently expressed using set {{variables and}} constraints over these variables [3]. In constraint programming such {{problems can be}} modeled directly in their natural form by means of set variables. This offers a great potential in exploiting the structure captured by set variables during the solution process, for example to break problem symmetry or to improve domain filtering. We present an efficient filtering algorithm, establishing bounds consistency, for the atmost 1 constraint on pairs of set variables with fixed cardinality. Computational results on social golfer benchmark problems demonstrate that with this additional filtering, these problems can be solved up to 50 times faster...|$|E

The quality of the hitting set is shown by comparing it {{to the size of}} a <b>packing</b> (<b>set</b> of pairwise non-intersecting rectangles) that is constructed along, hence, we also obtain a factor 6 approximation for the maximum packing of R.

40|$|Abstract—Many graph- and {{set-theoretic}} problems, {{because of}} their tremendous application potential and theoretical appeal, have been well investigated by the researchers in complexity theory and {{were found to be}} NP-hard. Since the combinato-rial complexity of these problems does not permit exhaustive searches for optimal solutions, only near-optimal solutions can be explored using either various problem-specific heuristic strategies or metaheuristic global-optimization methods, such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, etc. In this paper, we propose a unified evolutionary algorithm (EA) to the problems of maximum clique finding, maximum independent set, minimum vertex cover, subgraph and double subgraph isomorphism, set <b>packing,</b> <b>set</b> partitioning, and set cover. In the proposed approach, we first map these problems onto the maximum clique-finding problem (MCP), which is later solved using an evolutionary strategy. The proposed impatient EA with probabilistic tabu search (IEA-PTS) for the MCP integrates the best features of earlier successful approaches with a number of new heuristics that we developed to yield a performance that advances {{the state of the art}} in EAs for the exploration of the maximum cliques in a graph. Results of exper-imentation with the 37 DIMACS benchmark graphs and compar-ative analyses with six state-of-the-art algorithms, including two from the smaller EA community and four from the larger meta-heuristics community, indicate that the IEA-PTS outperforms the EAs with respect to a Pareto-lexicographic ranking criterion and offers competitive performance on some graph instances when individually compared to the other heuristic algorithms. It has also successfully set a new benchmark on one graph instance. On another benchmark suite called Benchmarks with Hidden Optimal Solutions, IEA-PTS ranks second, after a very recent algorithm called COVER, among its peers that have experimented with this suite.

40|$|Graphical models use the {{intuitive}} and well-studied methods of graph theory to implicitly represent dependencies between variables in large systems. They can model the global behaviour {{of a complex}} system by specifying only local factors. This thesis studies inference in discrete graphical models from an algebraic perspective and the ways inference {{can be used to}} express and approximate NP-hard combinatorial problems. We investigate the complexity and reducibility of various inference problems, in part by organizing them in an inference hierarchy. We then investigate tractable approximations for a subset of these problems using distributive law in the form of message passing. The quality of the resulting message passing procedure, called Belief Propagation (BP), depends on the influence of loops in the graphical model. We contribute to three classes of approximations that improve BP for loopy graphs A) loop correction techniques; B) survey propagation, another message passing technique that surpasses BP in some settings; and C) hybrid methods that interpolate between deterministic message passing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference. We then review the existing message passing solutions and provide novel graphical models and inference techniques for combinatorial problems under three broad classes: A) constraint satisfaction problems such as satisfiability, coloring, <b>packing,</b> <b>set</b> / clique-cover and dominating / independent set and their optimization counterparts; B) clustering problems such as hierarchical clustering, K-median, K-clustering, K-center and modularity optimization; C) problems over permutations including assignment, graph morphisms and alignment, finding symmetries and traveling salesman problem. In many cases we show that message passing is able to find solutions that are either near optimal or favourably compare with today's state-of-the-art approaches. Comment: Ravanbakhsh, S.
