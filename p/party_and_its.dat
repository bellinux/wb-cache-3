5|$|Traditionally, {{political}} leanings in Lethbridge {{have been}} right-wing. Federally, from 1917 to 1930, Lethbridge voters switched between various federal parties, but from 1935 to 1957, they voted Social Credit in each election. Progressive Conservatives held office from 1958 until 1993, when the Reform Party of Canada was formed. The Reform <b>party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> various subsequent incarnations {{such as the}} current Conservative Party of Canada have dominated the polls since.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that the Soviet Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the Soviet Union.|$|E

Han became the minister of education in May 1956 and retained his post as the chairman of the Writers' Union. During his ministerial career, Han initiated a campaign to diminish the importance of Russian language teaching in North Korean colleges in the spring of 1956. He also started to enlist writers with a proletarian background.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour Prime Minister, {{called a}} general election. Dunglass {{was invited to}} stand once again as Unionist {{candidate}} for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele's association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability. Dunglass regained the seat {{with one of the}} smallest majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{three years}} after Malaya's independence, the Emergency was {{declared}} over. However, the Malayan Internal Security Act 1960 ("ISA") was passed {{in place of the}} PPSO with much of the same powers. During parliamentary debates on the Act, Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman stated that the ISA would only be applied against only the remaining Communist insurgents. The Malayan Communist <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> insurgents eventually surrendered in 1989. Nonetheless, the ISA was retained in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{stance of}} the BJP towards foreign policy, like the Jana Sangh, {{was based on}} an aggressive Hindu nationalism combined with economic protectionism. The Jana Sangh was founded with the explicit aim of reversing the partition of India; as a result, its official position was that the existence of Pakistan was illegitimate. This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP's ideology. The <b>party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> affiliates have strongly opposed India's long standing policy of nonalignment, and instead advocate closeness to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} Anschluss (union between Austria and Germany to form a Greater Germany), {{was one of the}} {{principle}} ideas of the Austrian branch of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party. Nazism can be seen as descended from the radical branches of the pan-Germanist movement. In 1933, the Nazis and the Greater German People's Party formed a joint working-group, and eventually merged. During the period while the Nazi <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> symbols were banned in Austria, from 1933 to 1938, Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan-Germanist tradition of wearing a blue cornflower in their buttonhole.|$|E

5|$|After {{months of}} strikes and {{political}} deliberations, {{at the conclusion}} of the 10th plenary session of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR, the Polish communist party), the government agreed to enter into Round Table Negotiations that lasted from February to April 1989. Wałęsa was an informal leader of the non-governmental side in the negotiations. During the talks, he traveled throughout Poland giving speeches in support of the negotiations. At the end of the talks, the government signed an agreement to re-establish the Solidarity Trade Union and to organize semi-free elections to the Polish parliament; in accordance with the Round Table Agreement, only members of the Communist <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> allies could stand for 65 percent of the seats in the lower house, the Sejm.|$|E
5|$|Between 1986 and 1988, {{the demand}} for a {{separate}} state of Gorkhaland and Kamtapur based on ethnic lines grew strong. Riots between the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and the West Bengal government reached a stand-off after a forty-day strike. The town was virtually under siege, and the state government called in the Indian army to maintain law and order. This {{led to the formation}} of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, a body that was given semi-autonomous powers to govern the Darjeeling district, except the area under the Siliguri subdivision. Since 2007, {{the demand for}} a separate Gorkhaland state has been revived by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and its supporters in the Darjeeling hills. The Kamtapur People's <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> supporters' movement for a separate Kamtapur state covering North Bengal have gained momentum.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, who {{aspired to}} be an author, {{obtained}} a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1921. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924, and worked with Gregor Strasser in their northern branch. He was appointed as Gauleiter (district leader) for Berlin in 1926, where he began to {{take an interest in}} the use of propaganda to promote the <b>party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> programme. After the Nazi Seizure of Power in 1933, Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted controlling supervision over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempting to shape morale.|$|E

Examining the Australian Labor <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> wider connection with the Australian labour movement, it reflect Childe's disillusionment with the party, believing that the politicians that it managed to get elected had abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort. Childe's biographer Sally Green noted that How Labour Governs was of particular significance at the time because it was published just as the British Labour Party was emerging as {{a major player in}} British politics, threatening the two-party dominance of the Conservatives and Liberals; in 1924 they were elected to power. Childe had planned a sequel expanding on his ideas, but it was never published.|$|E
5|$|The DAP {{set out a}} seven-point {{manifesto}} {{with the}} theme “Sibu Jom Ubah” or “Sibu4change” for the by-election campaign and {{on the top of}} it is solving the town’s flood woes in two years when the <b>party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> coalition becomes the government at the federal and state levels. Another point in the manifesto stated that DAP would provide all Sarawakians aged above 60 a minimum of RM100 per annum as a gift for their contributions to the state. A minimum wage of RM750 per month for workers in the peninsula and RM830 for workers in Sarawak will be introduced and on education, DAP promised that all schools would be given allocations according to their needs as practised in Penang, Selangor and Kelantan. The three other points in the manifesto concerned oil royalty, land reform, and competency, accountability and transparency in governance.|$|E
5|$|The {{conjugation}} of the {{new field}} colours, especially the use of green, was not traditional in the Portuguese national flag's composition and represented a radical republican-inspired change that broke the bond with the former monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on 31 January 1891, red and green had been established as the colours of the Portuguese Republican <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> associated movements, whose political prominence kept growing until it reached a culmination period following the Republican revolution of 5 October 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandized as representing {{the hope of the}} nation (green) and the blood (red) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment. Although the flag flown from the Oporto city hall in the morning of 31 January 1891, symbol of the republican uprising was red and green. Totally red with a green circle in the center, to which were added the inscriptions referring to the republican center to whom it belonged - the Centro Democrático Federal 15 de Novembro.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the <b>party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for launching and outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to a better position.|$|E
5|$|The power {{struggle}} in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power {{at the expense of}} the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> Central Committee might again become powerful. Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, all rightist {{parties had}} been outlawed, {{and a new}} pro-government Democratic Bloc was formed in 1947 which {{included}} only the Polish Workers' <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the first parliamentary elections took place featuring primarily PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party, whose strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution. Results were adjusted by Stalin himself to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords. The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics. After the referendum dress rehearsal, the vote fraud was much better concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, a NKVD colonel charged with the election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new Sejm, out of 444 seats, 27 were given to Mikołajczyk's party. Stanisław Mikołajczyk, who declared the results to be falsified and was threatened with arrest or worse, fled the country and other opposition leaders also left. Western governments did not act further and the Poles felt abandoned again. In the same year, the new Sejm created the Small Constitution of 1947. Over the next two years, the communists monopolized their political power in Poland.|$|E
