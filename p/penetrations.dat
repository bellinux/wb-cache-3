An intensity fix is any estimate of the storm's intensity. Both location and intensity fixes can be obtained by aircraft flying low-level <b>penetrations</b> through the storm center. Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes.|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans {{were able}} to briefly capture Yongsan from the 2nd Infantry Division, which had been split in half from the <b>penetrations</b> at Naktong Bulge. Lieutenant General Walton Walker, seeing {{the danger of the}} attack, brought in the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to counterattack. In three days of fierce fighting, the Army and Marine forces {{were able to}} push the North Koreans out of the town and destroy the two attacking divisions. The win was a key step toward victory in the fight at the Naktong Bulge.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>penetrations</b> inland, {{confused}} hard-fought individual actions {{pushed the}} foothold out {{two and a}} half kilometers (1.5 mi) deep in the Colleville area to the east, less than that west of St. Laurent, and an isolated penetration in the Vierville area. Pockets of enemy resistance still fought on behind the American front line, and the whole beachhead remained under artillery fire. At 21:00 the landing of the 26th RCT completed the planned landing of infantry, but losses in equipment were high, including 26 artillery pieces, over 50 tanks, about 50 landing craft and 10 larger vessels.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Germans {{had made}} the halt decision, the Soviet Kalinin, Western and Southwestern Fronts {{launched}} a massive counteroffensive, aimed at driving Army Group Centre back from Moscow. The attacks were especially strong against Third Panzer Group, which had made some of the closest <b>penetrations</b> to the city. In three weeks of confused, savage fighting, Reinhardt extricated his troops from potential encirclement and fell back to the Lama River line. Placed in charge of covering the retreat, Model's harsh, almost brutal, style of leadership now paid dividends as panic threatened to infect the German columns. On several occasions, he restored order at a congested crossroads with a drawn pistol, but the retreat never became a rout.|$|E
50|$|Market <b>penetration</b> can {{be defined}} as the {{proportion}} of people in the target who bought (at least once in the period) a specific brand or a category of goods. Two key measures of a product's 'popularity' are <b>penetration</b> rate and <b>penetration</b> share. The <b>penetration</b> rate (also called <b>penetration,</b> brand <b>penetration</b> or market <b>penetration</b> as appropriate) is the percentage of the relevant population that has purchased a given brand or category at least once in the time period under study. A brand's <b>penetration</b> share, in contrast to <b>penetration</b> rate, is determined by comparing that brand's customer population to the number of customers for its category in the relevant market as a whole. Here again, to be considered a customer, one must have purchased the brand or category at least once during the period.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presented}} {{an investigation of}} particle collision and <b>penetration</b> using the discrete element method to understand the motion of particles and improve theoretical treatment in the sieving process. The process progressively was divided into looseness, stratification, collision, and <b>penetration.</b> Particle <b>penetration</b> has a direct effect on the screening performance. The <b>penetration</b> probability was defined, and the mathematical relationships between particle <b>penetration</b> and vibration parameters were established using the least squares method. To obtain the ideal <b>penetration</b> probability for materials the amplitude and frequency should preferably be near 3.0  mm and 25  Hz, respectively. The vibration direction angle has only a slight effect on <b>penetration.</b> The stage of the screening process from 0.1 to 0.7 s is the primary region for collision and <b>penetration.</b> This paper focused on the sieving process to more fully understand how particle collision and <b>penetration</b> influence the screening efficiency.|$|R
5|$|The last-ditched {{effort by}} the Germans {{to win the war}} came to a {{grinding}} halt in mid-July and after that there followed a brief period of lull, during which time the Australians undertook a series of small unit actions aimed at capturing parts of the German line with limited support. These actions became known as Peaceful <b>Penetrations</b> and were essentially a cross between trench raids and patrolling. Their success relied heavily upon the leadership and initiative of junior commanders and the ability of soldiers to employ principles of fire and manouevre. This lull did not last long, however, as the Allies were soon ready to launch their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which would ultimately bring about an end to the war.|$|E
5|$|All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division—the 4th, 17th, and 6th, in {{line from}} north to south—crossed during the night to {{the east side of}} the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector. The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow. The massive North Korean attack had made deep <b>penetrations</b> everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry. The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry; and the NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hyongp'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} <b>penetrations</b> of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E

5|$|Minsk was liberated by the Soviet 1st and 3rd Belorussian Fronts on 3 July, but Model still {{hoped to}} re-establish {{the front to}} the west of the city, with the aid of {{divisions}} from Army Groups North and North Ukraine. However, German strength was unequal to the task, and he had been driven out of Vilnius and Baranovichi by 8 July. At the same time, the 1st Ukrainian Front (now commanded by Ivan Konev) and the 1st Belorussian Front's left wing (which had been uncommitted thus far) opened up a fresh offensive against Army Group North Ukraine. In this battle, the First Panzer Army managed to hold the line east of Lvov using Model's defensive tactics, but was forced to retreat when the Fourth Panzer Army, weakened by the steady flow of units to Army Group Centre, was unable to stem the Soviet <b>penetrations</b> of its front. Model stopped the Red Army's advance just short of Warsaw by 3 August, setting up a continuous front from south of Shaulyay to the right boundary on the Vistula near Pulawy.|$|E
5|$|Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev was {{intended}} as the main Soviet offensive for 1943. Its aim was to destroy the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf, and cut off the extended southern portion of Army Group South. After the heavy losses sustained by the Voronezh Front, during Operation Citadel, the Soviets needed time to regroup and refit, delaying {{the start of the}} offensive until 3 August. Diversionary attacks, launched two weeks earlier across the Donets and Mius Rivers into the Donbass, drew the attention of German reserves and thinned the defending forces that would face the main blow. The offensive was initiated by the Voronezh Front and Steppe Fronts against the northern wing of Army Group South. They drove through the German positions, making broad and deep <b>penetrations.</b> By 5 August, the Soviets had liberated Belgorod.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{offensive}} {{operations for}} the summer of 1943 were planned to begin after {{the strength of the}} German forces had been dissipated by their Kursk offensive. As the German momentum in the north slowed, the Soviets launched Operation Kutusov on 12 July against Army Group Centre in the Orel salient, directly north of the Kursk salient. The Bryansk Front, under the command of Markian Popov, attacked the eastern face of the Orel salient while the Western Front, commanded by Vasily Sokolovsky, attacked from the north. The Western Front's assault was led by the 11th Guards Army, under Lieutenant General Hovhannes Bagramyan, and was supported by the 1st and 5th Tank Corps. The Soviet spearheads sustained heavy casualties, but pushed through and in some areas achieved significant <b>penetrations.</b> These thrusts endangered German supply routes and threatened the 9th Army with encirclement. With this threat, 9th Army was compelled to go over fully to the defensive.|$|E
3000|$|... (Eq.  10) of P. vitreus {{measuring}} as quantity Q {{the amount}} of degraded nutrients given in micrometer.

A <b>penetration</b> capacity of 1.0 10 - 3 ·mm 2 ·d- 1 means that the growth front of the mycelium penetrating 1  mm·d- 1 into the wood degrades 1 micrometer pit membranes in total. We use the same simulation setup as in Figure  4. We observe that the <b>penetration</b> work decreases with increasing hyphal growth rates, whereas the <b>penetration</b> capacity increases with increasing hyphal growth rates.

40|$|A {{device was}} {{constructed}} to study dynamic <b>penetration</b> in crushed rock both in air and a high-vacuum (10 ^(- 5) mm Hg) condition.

5|$|The {{progress}} of the war from September 1939 to the summer of 1941, with a few exceptions, seemed to validate the Luftwaffes pre-war focus on the offensive use of its fighter arm. The success of the Luftwaffe in the Norwegian Campaign and the battles of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece had vindicated this method. The Luftwaffe had defended German airspace by driving away enemy air power from Germany's borders and defeating their enemies in their own skies. The occupation of its opponent's territory denied Germany's enemies the bases to effectively strike at German targets by air. German daylight defences were rarely tested during this time. This run of events, and {{the knowledge that the}} RAF was only capable of short <b>penetrations</b> over France in daylight, led the Luftwaffe to believe Germany was invulnerable to attack. To maintain the offensive on the front line, bomber production dominated the air industry while the production of fighters was given less priority.|$|E
5|$|Very little went {{as planned}} during the landing at Omaha. Difficulties in {{navigation}} caused {{the majority of}} landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing U.S. troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small <b>penetrations</b> were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By {{the end of the}} day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days.|$|E
5|$|Facing the Chinese {{offensive}} were 418,000 UN troops, including 152,000 South Koreans, 245,000 Americans, 11,500 British Commonwealth and 10,000 {{troops from}} other UN countries. However, with the US Eighth Army {{not strong enough}} to prevent large <b>penetrations</b> along its line, masses of Chinese infantry soon swept around its flanks, surrounding entire formations in an attempt to cut off their withdrawal. Standing directly {{in the path of the}} main Chinese attack towards Seoul in the I Corps sector was the 29th British Brigade. The brigade's stand on the Imjin River held off two Chinese divisions for two days and ultimately helped prevent the capture of Seoul, but resulted in heavy casualties in one of the bloodiest British engagements of the war. During the fighting, most of the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment were killed or captured during a stubborn resistance at the Battle of the Imjin River that saw the commanding officer—Lieutenant Colonel James Carne—awarded the Victoria Cross after his battalion was surrounded. Ultimately the 29th Brigade suffered 1,091 casualties in their defence of the Kansas Line, and although they destroyed a large portion of the Chinese 63rd Army and inflicted nearly 10,000 casualties, the loss of the Glosters caused a controversy in Britain and within the United Nations Command. Meanwhile, further east, in the IX Corps sector, the Chinese 118th Division, 40th Army and the 60th Division, 20th Army prepared to attack the South Korean 6th Division on the night of 22 April.|$|E

5|$|In May the {{battalion}} was {{withdrawn from the}} front line for re-organisation and training. It did not return until the Third Battle of Ypres in September and October 1917, when they were committed to the fighting first at Menin Road. The 7th Battalion had 57 men killed in this phase, and then later at Broodseinde another 98 were killed. Following these battles, the 7th Battalion was withdrawn from the front line once more in December. In March 1918, however, following {{the start of the}} German Spring Offensive, {{the battalion}} was called back to help stem the tide of the German advance. As the German offensive ran out of momentum, the battalion kept up the pressure on the German line through a series of peaceful <b>penetrations,</b> before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which was launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. As a part of this offensive, the battalion fought major actions at Lihons on 9–11 August where they captured a number of German mortars and Herleville Woods on 23 August. They continued operations until late September 1918 when they were withdrawn with a strength of just 410 men and it was out of the line when the armistice came into effect in November. Shortly afterwards the demobilisation process began and as the battalion's numbers fell as men were repatriated back to Australia, it was amalgamated with 6th Battalion. This battalion was amalgamated with another, formed from the 5th and 8th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion.|$|E

Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up <b>penetrations</b> rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular.
