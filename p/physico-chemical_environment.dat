50|$|Resilience {{can change}} in stable states when {{environmental}} parameters are shifted. Often, humans influence stable states {{by reducing the}} resilience of basins of attraction. There {{are at least three}} ways in which anthropogenic forces reduce resilience (Folke et al. 2004): (1) Decreasing diversity and functional groups, often by top-down effects (e.g., overfishing); (2) altering the <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environment</b> (e.g., climate change, pollution, fertilization); or (3) modifying disturbance regimes to which organisms are adapted (e.g., bottom trawling, coral mining, etc.). When the resilience is decreased, ecosystems can be pushed into alternative, and often less-desirable, stable states with only minor perturbations. When hysteresis effects are present, the return to a more-desirable state is sometimes impossible or impractical (given management constraints). Shifts to less-desirable states often entail a loss of ecosystem service and function, and have been documented in an array of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments (reviewed in Folke et al. 2004).|$|E

The present investigation proposes two mechanisms to explain the contradictory behaviour of kaolinitic and montmorillonitic soils under undrained conditions.

By following the frequency behaviour of the G and RBM modes {{we have found that}} [10]CPP in the [10]CPP@C 70 complex displays a more “ordered” structure. However, in [11]CPP@C 70, the nanoring gets ovallized with closer contacts with the C 70 poles and less conformational restriction in the flattened region. By mechanical and thermal stresses we are able to modify the lying conformation of [10]CPP@C 70 towards a standing shape. [11]CPP@C 70 resists pressure changes, although it tends to shift from the standing to the lying orientation by heating. As for the crystal cell, the [n]CPPs occupy the residual empty spaces while the main crystallographic positions are reserved to C 70. These are new examples of the impressive adaptability of the [n]CPP molecules to different <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environments,</b> a chameleon-like property which reveals the delicate equilibrium provided by cyclic conjugation and ring strain.

This approach was successfully used to achieve the lysozyme/lactoferrin separation with a high selectivity (lysozyme transmission/lactoferrin transmission) using an anionic membrane of pore diameter close to 28 nm.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{synthesis}} of recent, observed trends in the climate of south-western Western Australia (SWWA) and a summary of future changes that are predicted for the region in coming decades. We then discuss both observed and predicted {{effects of climate change}} on the hydrology and <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environments</b> of the microtidal estuaries of SWWA, and the ecological impacts of these changes on estuarine fish communities. Warming of marine and estuarine waters, sustained reductions in rainfall and changes in the timing, location and magnitude of extreme weather events are predicted. These are likely to cause changes in the timing and decreases in the magnitude of river flows; changes to the mouth status of bar-closed estuaries; ‘marinisation’ and ‘tropicalisation’ of estuarine waters, including increased hypersalinity in estuaries on the south coast; and changes in the extent, timing and persistence of water column stratification and hypoxia. Such changes are likely to have both positive and negative effects on the abundance, species richness and community composition of estuarine fish faunas in SWWA, with potential implications for estuarine and nearshore marine fisheries. We highlight the broad relevance of our predictions for many microtidal estuaries in other regions of the world with a Mediterranean climate, and conclude by briefly outlining some possible adaptation responses to the probable effects of climate change on the estuaries of SWWA...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the marine phototrophic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum and associated bacteria was studied in different <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environments</b> in batch cultures. In stagnant cultures the dinoflagellates aggregated at the surface, while with low shear induced by gentle stirring and turbulent mixing induced by bubbling, the cells were dispersed. Both pH and O 2 concentration eventually increased in the stagnant and stirred cultures {{as a result of}} photosynthesis. Bacterial community dynamics, productivity and composition was monitored by direct cell counts, plate counts, 3 H-leucine incorporation, richness of genomes estimated by PCR-DGGE and frequency of growth rate types on agar plates. Bacterial productivity and diversity was restrained in both stagnant and stirred cultures, compared with bubbled ones. This pattern was observed early, before bulk water was affected by metabolic activity, which suggests that algal aggregation was not a prerequisite for inhibition of bacterial growth. Increased bacterial production during stationary growth phase of the algae in stagnant and stirred cultures suggests that high pH or O 2 concentration were not the most important inhibiting factors. Rather, the need for turbulent mixing suggests that the structure of the extracellular organic material must be modified to make it available to bacteria.

40|$|Late Permian coals {{and coal}} {{measures}} in the Bowen Basin, Australia, are extensively mineralised with carbonates as cleat fillings and veins. The calcites in coal samples exhibit large variations in rare-earth element (REE) patterns and Sm-Nd ratios with some superchondritic values. Samples enriched in heavy REE (HREE) relative to light REE (LREE) define an Sm-Nd isochron corresponding to an age of 235 +/- 15 Ma, {{which is consistent with}} the timing of final contractional phase of the Hunter-Bowen orogeny. The corresponding initial epsilon Nd is + 1. 2 combined with HREE-enriched patterns suggests significant fluid interaction with primitive source rocks, which are consistent with arc-related volcanogenic sediments in the basin. Calcites characterised by HREE depletion relative to LREE are not in Sm-Nd isotopic equilibrium with the former samples that is interpreted to be due to the effect of a later hydrothermal event during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. Vein calcites in mudrocks from the coal measures display more pronounced HREE depletion and significant positive EuCN anomalies, which is related to the later hydrothermal event. REE distributions, together with the basin burial history, suggest that <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environments</b> of fluid-flow events during the two separate major tectonic regimes were significantly different. This study shows that a combined application of Sm-Nd dating and REE geochemical tracing of authigenic carbonate minerals is very useful to constrain the evolution of multiple fluid-flow events in a sedimentary basin with a complex history.

In the tropics, large quantities of agricultural wastes could be potentially useful in agriculture after composting. However, while microbiological processes of composts in general are well established, relatively {{little is known about}} microbial communities that may be unique to these in tropical systems, particularly nitrifiers. The recent discovery of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) has changed the paradigm of nitrification being initiated solely by ammonia oxidizing bacteria. In the present study, AOA abundance and diversity was examined in composts produced from combinations of plant waste materials common in tropical agriculture (rice straw, sugar cane bagasse, coffee hulls), which were mixed with either cow- or sheep-manure. The objective was to determine how AOA abundance and diversity varied as a function of compost system and time, the latter being a contrast between the start of the compost process (mesophilic phase) and the finished product (mature phase). The results showed that AOA were relatively abundant in composts of tropical agricultural wastes, and significantly more so than were the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Furthermore, while the AOA communities in the composts were predominatly group I. 1 b, the communities were diverse and exhibited structures that diverged between compost types and phases. These patterns could be taken as indicators of the ecophysiological diversity in the soil AOA (groub I. 1 b), in that significantly different AOA communties developed when exposed to varying <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environments.</b> Nitrification patterns and levels differed in the composts which, for the mature material, could have signifcant effects on its performanc as a plant growth medium.

40|$|During 1982 benthic and {{floating}} filamentous algal mats {{appeared in the}} maturation ponds of the Grahamstown Sewage Disposal Works. These mats clogged the ponds and reduced the efficiency by which the effluent was purified. As they {{continued to be a}} problem despite numerous efforts to remove them, this study was initiated to investigate the alga, establish why it was successful in the pond environment, and how its growth could be controlled. The <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environment</b> of a representative maturation pond was characterised while laboratory studies were conducted to investigate the growth, photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics in the alga. The alga was identified as Rhizoclonium riparium (Roth) Harv. although its morphological variability was greater than that reported in the literature. Growth and photosynthetic studies indicated that the alga favoured temperatures between 20 and 30 ⁰C and relatively high light intensity (700 μE. m⁻². s⁻¹) and that it was highly productive. In addition, the alga exhibited photoadaptive ability, although it seemed to be sensitive to photoinhibition. Its success in the maturation pond was attributed to the favourable <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environment,</b> particularly the high transparency of the effluent which allowed the penetration of PAR to the pond floor and to the alga's ability to adapt to the change in environment when it floated from the pond floor to its surface. Although the algal mats contribute to the oxidation of the effuent within the maturation pond, they are generally detrimental to the system because they shade the water column and inhibit wind-induced mixing. Recommendations on methods of controlling of the mats are presented. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 53 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|E

Depending on their pigmentation they cause green or red mass blooms during the melt season. This decreases surface albedo and thus further enhances {{snow and ice}} melting. Although the phenomenon of snow algal blooms {{has been known for}} a long time, large aspects of their physiology and ecology sill remain cryptic. This study provides the first in-depth and multi-omics investigation of two very striking adjacent green and red snow fields on a glacier in Svalbard. We have assessed the algal community composition of green and red snow including their associated microbiota, i. e., bacteria and archaea, their metabolic profiles (targeted and non-targeted metabolites) on the bulk and single-cell level, and assessed the feedbacks between the algae and their <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environment</b> including liquid water content, pH, albedo and nutrient availability. We demonstrate that green and red snow clearly vary in their <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environment,</b> their microbial community composition and their metabolic profiles. For the algae this likely reflects both different stages of their life cycles and their adaptation strategies. Green snow represents a wet, carbon and nutrient rich environment and is dominated by the algae Microglena sp. with a metabolic profile that is characterized by key metabolites involved in growth and proliferation. In contrast, the dry and nutrient poor red snow habitat is colonised by various Chloromonas species with a high abundance of storage and reserve metabolites likely to face upcoming severe conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe Bhagirathi-Hugli, a major {{distributor}} of the Ganga river, traverses {{a distance of}} about 550 km in the state of West Bengal, India and falls into the Bay of Bengal. The river is the principle drainage artery of the state, and together with its tributaries forms one of the major river systems in the Indo-Gangetic Delta. The river is non- tidal for about 231 km and tidal over the remaining 319 km. In the tidal part, again, the estuarine portion, i. e. about 180 km from Diamond Harbour downwards is very much dominated by tides and waves. The Hugli estuary has braided itself into a number of channels in its estuarine part where it has fanned in an exponential manner. The estuary is dynamically very much active and complicated because of its continued evolutionary changes. A number of islands and submerged sand –bodies within the flow system create the total flow phenomenon complicated and continually changing. It is observed over a short period that a number of islands and sand- bodies disappeared such as Bedford sand and new ones are coming up at different places where the <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environments</b> are favouring for their formation. The Sagar island is the largest island {{at the mouth of the}} Hugli estuary, dividing the total flow into two parts- the major portion flows along the western part leading to Haldia Dock Complex and Kolkata Dock System and minor one flows along the eastern part which is popularly known as the Muriganga river or the Channel Creek. From hydrological observations, it was observed that about 20 %- 25 % of total flows (Flood+ Ebb) would flow along this channel in early nineties but very recent morphological development clearly depicts that a number of submerged sand bodies have developed alarmingly resulting in a drastic fall of capacity of the channel and a reduction of flows to about 8 %- 10 % of the total flows within a span of about 20 years. This channel has its own importance not only due to serving as the main water way connecting Sagar island with main land but also it plays a very important role in this dynamic estuary. For decades, this channel has undergone many changes, and this changing pattern has been studied using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS). Change Detection Study has been made using supervised classification of yearly satellite imagery. The ground- truth has been acquired by extensive survey works using HYPACK software and by conventional survey method. All these studies lead to reveal the fact that the entire tidal creek, i. e. Creek Channel area is shoaling alarmingly. From the satellite image analysis, growth of several sand bars of this channel are detected. The total areas of zero-contours are increasing very rapidly, and these are clearly indicated by the infamous phenomenon of sedimentation in the main connecting waterways between Sagar Island and main land i. e. Kachuberia and Lot- 8, a lot of bars generated in this very important waterways causing blockage of both the flood and ebb flows in this channel.

Considering both the volume and the effluent composition, the textile industry is rated as the most polluting among the industrial sectors. Important pollutants in textile effluents are mainly recalcitrant organics, dyes, toxicants, inhibitory compounds, surfactants, chlorinated compounds and salts.

Although in vitro transposition reactions require only the transposase, various factors {{depending on the}} host, the <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environment</b> and the transposon sequence can interfere with the MLEs transposition in vivo. Results The transposition of Mos 1, first isolated from drosophila mauritiana, depends of both the nucleic acid sequence of the DNA stuffer (in terms of GC content), and its length. We provide the first in vitro experimental demonstration that MITEs of MLE origin, as small as 80 to 120 -bp, are able to transpose. Excessive temperature down-regulates Mos 1 transposition, yielding excision products unable to re-integrate. Finally, the super-helicity of the DNA transposon donor has a dramatic impact on the transposition efficiency. Conclusion The study highlights how experimental conditions can bias interpretation of mariner excision frequency and quality. In vitro, the auto-integration pathway markedly limits transposition efficiency to new target sites, and this phenomenon may also limit events in the natural host. We propose a model for small transposons transposition that bypasses DNA bending constraints. </p...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has been used}} quantitatively to define the characteristics of two different models of experimental cerebral oedema in cats: vasogenic oedema produced by cortical freezing and cytotoxic oedema induced by triethyl tin. The MRI results have been correlated with the ultrastructural changes. The images accurately delineated the anatomical extent of the oedema in the two lesions, but did not otherwise discriminate between them. The patterns of measured increase in T 1 ' and T 2 ' were, however, characteristic {{for each type of}} oedema, and reflected the protein content. The magnetisation decay characteristics of both normal and oedematous white matter were monoexponential for T 1 but biexponential for T 2 decay. The relative sizes of the two component exponentials of the latter corresponded with the physical sizes of the major tissue water compartments. Quantitative MRI data can provide reliable information about the <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environment</b> of tissue water in normal and oedematous cerebral tissue, and are useful for distinguishing between acute and chronic lesions in multiple sclerosis...|$|E
40|$|In a {{companion}} study to earlier {{work in the}} Indo-Pacific, taphonomic alteration in reef-coral death assemblages was assessed in four distinct reef habitats ranging from 2 - 30 m water depth in the Florida Keys reef tract. Physical and biological taphonomic attributes measured from coral specimens showed great variability with respect to reef <b>environment.</b> <b>Physico-chemical</b> degradation (abrasion and dissolution) was greatest in reef-crest and patch-reef environments. With the exception of encrusting foraminifera, coverage by epi- and endobionts was higher in deep-reef environments (20 m and 30 m). Variability in dissolution and abrasion is likely {{the result of the}} different energy regimes present in the reef habitats examined. Variability in biological attributes results from a combination of increased residence time of coral skeletons on substrates in deep-reef environments, higher overall coral skeletal densities of corals inhabiting deep reef environments, and increased nutrient availability in the deep reefs sampled. Clear gradients in the degree of taphonomic alteration of reef corals with reef habitat indicate the utility of corals as taphofacies indicators in ancient reef settings. In contrast to shallow-water reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, taphonomic alteration of corals in the Florida Keys was equitable across growth forms...|$|R
40|$|Stirred {{tanks are}} devices that {{are widely used}} in various process steps of the {{pharmaceutical}} industry. The performance of these processes (animal cell culture, crystallization, flocculation …) strongly depend on the <b>physico-chemical</b> and hydrodynamic <b>environment</b> present locally in these tanks. To fully describe this local environment, an Eulerian - Lagrangian approach must be adopted {{in order to establish}} history of conditions met by a particle as a cell, a crystal or a floc. This approach implies to determine the trajectory followed by the particle. To this aim, the Chemical Laboratory of Liege University has developed a prototype of optical trajectography device. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the device, developments that were necessary for its use and the results obtained. The device is composed of two cameras modeled by a pinhole model which record the position of a bead that has a size equal to 490 µm and that perfectly follows local flow structures. The measured trajectory has been validated by comparing average time velocity fields deduced from it to those measured, in the same operating conditions, by particle image velocimetry (P. I. V.).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{focussed}} on {{the characterization of}} the reaction center (RC) protein purified from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In particular, we discussed the effects of native and artificial environment on the light-induced electron transfer processes. The native environment consist of the inner antenna LH 1 complex that copurifies with the RC forming the so called core complex, and the lipid phase tightly associated with it. In parallel, we analyzed the role of saccharidic glassy matrices on the interplay between electron transfer processes and internal protein dynamics. As a different artificial matrix, we incorporated the RC protein in a layer-by-layer structure with a twofold aim: to check the behaviour of the protein in such an unusual environment and to test {{the response of the}} system to herbicides. By examining the RC in its native environment, we found that the light-induced charge separated state P+QB - is markedly stabilized (by about 40 meV) in the core complex as compared to the RC-only system over a physiological pH range. We also verified that, as compared to the average composition of the membrane, the core complex copurifies with a tightly bound lipid complement of about 90 phospholipid molecules per RC, which is strongly enriched in cardiolipin. In parallel, a large ubiquinone pool was found in association with the core complex, giving rise to a quinone concentration about ten times larger than the average one in the membrane. Moreover, this quinone pool is fully functional, i. e. it is promptly available at the QB site during multiple turnover excitation of the RC. The latter two observations suggest important heterogeneities and anisotropies in the native membranes which can in principle account for the stabilization of the charge separated state in the core complex. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters obtained in the RC-LH 1 complex are very close to those measured in intact membranes, indicating that the electron transfer properties of the RC in vivo are essentially determined by its local environment. The studies performed by incorporating the RC into saccharidic matrices evidenced the relevance of solvent-protein interactions and dynamical coupling in determining the kinetics of electron transfer processes. The usual approach when studying the interplay between internal motions and protein function consists in freezing the degrees of freedom of the protein at cryogenic temperature. We proved that the “trehalose approach” offers distinct advantages with respect to this traditional methodology. We showed, in fact, that the RC conformational dynamics, coupled to specific electron transfer processes, can be modulated by varying the hydration level of the trehalose matrix at room temperature, thus allowing to disentangle solvent from temperature effects. The comparison between different saccharidic matrices has revealed that the structural and dynamical protein-matrix coupling depends strongly upon the sugar. The analyses performed in RCs embedded in polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) structures have shown that the electron transfer from QA - to QB, a conformationally gated process extremely sensitive to the RC environment, can be strongly modulated by the hydration level of the matrix, confirming analogous results obtained for this electron transfer reaction in sugar matrices. We found that PEM-RCs are a very stable system, particularly suitable to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of herbicide binding to the QB site. These features make PEM-RC structures quite promising in the development of herbicide biosensors. The studies discussed in the present thesis have shown that, although the effects on electron transfer induced by the native and artificial environments tested are markedly different, they can be described {{on the basis of a}} common kinetic model which takes into account the static conformational heterogeneity of the RC and the interconversion between conformational substates. Interestingly, the same distribution of rate constants (i. e. a Gamma distribution function) can describe charge recombination processes in solutions of purified RC, in RC-LH 1 complexes, in wet and dry RC-PEM structures and in glassy saccharidic matrices over a wide range of hydration levels. In conclusion, the results obtained for RCs in different <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>environments</b> emphasize the relevance of the structure/dynamics solvent/protein coupling in determining the energetics and the kinetics of electron transfer processes in a membrane protein complex...|$|R
