Like any {{rechargeable}} battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. User data is not preserved/transferred. The refurbished unit comes with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E

It is 12 metres (39 feet) high and 7 metres (23 feet) in diameter and consists of 9 levels in total. The exterior is built of adobe bricks and is filled with grass and mud mixed with lime. The base {{is in the form}} of an eight-spoked wheel, the 1st level has four sides, while levels 2 to 4 have folding corners, the 5th level is decorated with upturned lotuses, the 6th is in the shape of an overturned bowl, the 7th level is wheel-shaped, while the 8th level has a hexagonal plate at the top of the pagoda with big wind-bells hanging on every corner. Above that are three metal balls surmounted by a trident. Local <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> chime of the bells are an echo of the neighing of the horse.|$|E

500|$|Decades later, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that [...] "there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks," [...] and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that [...] "some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species. These <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> real culprit behind many of the reported incidents—including the famous 1916 shark attacks in New Jersey that may have served as inspiration for Jaws—may be the lesser known bull shark." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{techniques}} used to craft the overall {{sound of the}} album, August Brown of the Los Angeles Times described the band foregoing the use of full chords and verse-chorus-verse structures in favor of [...] "distant guitar effects, crunchy bass grooves and smatterings of percussion." [...] Regarding the songs from the album, Maust said that lead singer Nathan Willett's lyrics were a mixture of folk tales and topical stories, stating that [...] "a lot of <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> last record was more about yesteryear. This [...] has some of that, but it's much more today. The characters are people from today." [...] The thirteen tracks off the album deal {{with a variety of}} philosophies and politics that range from contemplating suicide, crisis of faith, alienation, anonymity, public security and job satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Hindu noted, [...] "The film {{takes off}} as a typical family drama. The {{first half of the}} film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Georgekutty. This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold {{from the end of the}} first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course." [...] When asked whether this change in narrative style post-interval was intentional, Jeethu replied: [...] "I really don't understand when <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> first half lacked pace. A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig-zag away, capturing all the ups and downs of our lives. Right from the start if you accelerate the pace, sooner or later, the story-telling will lose its steam." ...|$|E

In an interview, Freeman said, [...] "About everywhere you go, <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> <b>The</b> Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw [...] " [...] and that such praise [...] "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, [...] "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, {{there are people who}} say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, [...] "If that isn't the best , it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it." [...] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora.

2500|$|Some <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> three saltires (X's) {{represent}} the three dangers of Old Amsterdam: fire, floods, and the Black Death. That theory however has no historical basis. The crosses probably have their {{origin in the}} shield of the noble family Persijn. The knight Jan Persijn was [...] "lord" [...] of Amstelledamme (Amsterdam) from 1280 to 1282. In the escutcheons of Dordrecht and Delft, two other cities in Holland, the pale refers to water. In analogy with this, the black pale in the escutcheon of Amsterdam would refer to the river Amstel. Both the colours and the crosses are also found in the escutcheons of two towns near Amsterdam: the village of Ouder-Amstel {{on the banks of the}} river Amstel to the southeast, and Nieuwer-Amstel (now the suburb Amstelveen) to the southwest. Both villages were also the property of the Persijn family.|$|E

He was an ethnic Hazara and was of Mohammad Khuwaja clan. He was Afghan court chronicler, a skilled calligrapher and secretary to Emir Habib Ullah Khan from 1901 to 1919.

2500|$|Artist Juli Kearns first {{identified}} and created maps of spatial discrepancies {{in the overall}} layout of the Overlook Hotel location, the interiors of which were constructed in studios in England. These spatial discrepancies included windows appearing in impossible places, such as in Stuart Ullman's office which is surrounded by interior hallways, and apartment doorways positioned in places where they cannot possibly lead to apartments. Rob Ager is another proponent of this theory. Jan Harlan, an Executive Producer on The Shining, {{was asked about the}} discontinuity of sets by Xan Brooks of The Guardian and confirmed the discontinuity was intentional, [...] "The set was very deliberately built to be offbeat and off the track, so that the huge ballroom would never actually fit inside. The audience is deliberately made not to know where they're going. <b>People</b> <b>say</b> <b>The</b> Shining doesn't make sense. Well spotted! It's a ghost movie. It's not supposed to make sense." [...] Harlan further elaborated to Kate Abbot for the same newspaper, [...] "Stephen King gave him the go-ahead to change his book, so Stanley agreed – and wrote a much more ambiguous script. It's clear instantly there's something foul going on. At the little hotel, everything is like Disney, all kitsch wood on the outside – but the interiors don't make sense. Those huge corridors and ballrooms couldn't fit inside. In fact, nothing makes sense." ...|$|E
