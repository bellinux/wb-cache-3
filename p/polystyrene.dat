40|$|Craze {{initiation}} {{stress was}} measured in three-point bending isochronal creep tests {{on a series of}} entangled bimodal blends of <b>polystyrenes</b> of narrow dispersity, on three <b>polystyrenes</b> of broad dispersity, and on four blends of <b>polystyrenes</b> of broad dispersity. Crazing stress was found to increase rapidly with small additions of the higher molar mass component, quickly reaching a plateau. A simple model based on the weighted addition of the crazing stress contributions of the individual weight fractions obtained from an established piecewise linear crazing law was able to predict the crazing stress accurately in the bimodal blends using a power law exponent of 2. 59 (90 % CI [1. 75 – 17. 34]). In broad dispersity systems, in particular where short unentangled chains dilute the polymer, it was found necessary to modify the model using dynamic tube dilution theory. Dilution leads to a change in the entanglement length and hence in the molar mass at which transitions to disentanglement and chain scission crazing occur. With the improved model, crazing stress could be predicted even for the broad dispersity polymers with wide and bimodal distributions. This represents an opportunity for the molecular design of polymers by blending to achieve improved resistance to craze initiation...|$|R

40|$|Host-guest {{complexes}} of styrene and randomly methylated β-cyclodextrin (m-β-CD) were polymerized in aqueous medium via the reversible addition fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (RAFT) process. 3 -Benzylsulfanylthiocarbo- nylsulfanylpropionic acid (TTC) {{was used as}} trithiocarbonate-type RAFT agent. The results indicate a controlled character of the polymerization of the styrene complexes as the number-average molecular weight, M̄n, increases linearly with monomer to polymer conversion; however, the molecular weights of the obtained <b>polystyrenes</b> deviate to higher values than those theoretically predicted. Nevertheless, the molecular weights can be controlled by variation of the initial RAFT agent concentration. The <b>polystyrenes</b> produced in this system exhibited narrower polydispersities (1. 23 < M̄W/M̄n < 2. 36) than those produced without RAFT agent (5. 24 <M̄W/M̄n< 9. 21) under similar conditions.

5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, <b>polystyrene,</b> polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and <b>polystyrene</b> plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) simulations {{have been}} used to study the transport properties of oxygen and nitrogen in the para-substituted <b>polystyrenes</b> which possess one to four Si atoms in each substituent. The Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potentials for Atomistic Simulation Studies (COMPASS) force field was used to construct the polymers.

After molecular dynamic simulation, the trajectories of the small molecules in the polymer matrix were obtained.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports the}} {{preparation}} of a MAMA-SG 1 (BlocBuilder™) derived alkoxyamine bearing a N-succinimidyl (NHS) ester group 1, valuable for functional and advanced polymer synthesis. This alkoxyamine was exploited following two strategies: (i) a post-functionalization approach based on the transformation of α-NHS chain ends of polymers previously obtained by nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP) from 1 (path A) and (ii) a pre-functionalization approach based on the functionalization of alkoxyamine 1 prior to NMP (path B).

40|$|Abstract The glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) is a fundamental characteristic of an amorphous polymer. A quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) based on error back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed to predict Tgs of 107 <b>polystyrenes.</b> Stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was adopted to select an optimal subset of molecular descriptors. The chain segments (or motion units) of polymer backbones with 20 carbons in length (10 repeating units) were used to calculate these molecular descriptors reflecting polymer structures. The relative optimal conditions of ANN were obtained by adjusting various network paramters by trial-and-error. Compared to the model already published in the literature, the optimal ANN model with [4 - 7 - 1] network structure in this paper is accurate and acceptable, although our model has more samples in the test set. The results demonstrate the feasibility and powerful ability of the chain segment structures as representative of polymers for developing Tg models of <b>polystyrenes...</b>|$|R
