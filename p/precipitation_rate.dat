5|$|With {{the advent}} of highly {{sensitive}} mass spectrometers, an application of 231Pa as a tracer in geology and paleoceanography has become possible. So, the ratio of protactinium-231 to thorium-230 is used for radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling {{of the formation of}} minerals. In particular, its evaluation in oceanic sediments allowed to reconstruct the movements of North Atlantic water bodies during the last melting of Ice Age glaciers. Some of the protactinium-related dating variations rely on the analysis of the relative concentrations for several long-living members of the uranium decay chain – uranium, protactinium, and thorium, for example. These elements have 6, 5 and 4 valence electrons and thus favor +6, +5 and +4 oxidation states, respectively, and show different physical and chemical properties. So, thorium and protactinium, but not uranium compounds are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, and precipitate into sediments; the <b>precipitation</b> <b>rate</b> is faster for thorium than for protactinium. Besides, the concentration analysis for both protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years) and thorium-230 (half-life 75,380 years) allows to improve the accuracy compared to when only one isotope is measured; this double-isotope method is also weakly sensitive to inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the isotopes and to variations in their <b>precipitation</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the <b>precipitation</b> <b>rate</b> at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Hourly {{precipitation}} data from thirty cooperative stations in Kentucky from 1965 to 1996 {{were used to}} determine the diurnal distribution of <b>precipitation</b> <b>rates.</b> Descriptive summaries for the diurnal distribution for each climate division in Kentucky and for Kentucky as a whole were calculated. In each case, the trends were similar. <b>Precipitation</b> <b>rates</b> increased into the afternoon and then decreased until sunrise. A stochastic model was developed to estimate mean seasonal <b>precipitation</b> <b>rates</b> in Kentucky by using regional and localized parameters. More than half of the variation (r 2 = 0. 57) in <b>precipitation</b> <b>rates</b> {{can be explained by the}} following variables: 1) Distance away from the moisture source, the Gulf of Mexico; 2) Roughness of topography; 3) Degree of urbanization. <b>Precipitation</b> <b>rates</b> decrease in a northeasterly direction across Kentucky as air moves farther away from the Gulf of Mexico along its path of migration. The maritime tropical air mass migrating out of the Gulf of Mexico loses its water vapor over its path of migration. As a result, less water vapor is available for precipitation processes in areas farther away. As a precipitation event moves over rougher terrain and more urbanized areas, <b>precipitation</b> <b>rates</b> decrease as well. A rougher terrain absorbs more solar radiation because it has more surface area. An urbanized area absorbs more solar radiation because of the urban structures (e. g., buildings, asphalt, roofs). As a result, both will radiate more heat causing the air to be buoyant at the surface to either enhance convection or increase vertical air motions. Increased vertical air motions will cause an increase in air resistance acting upon precipitation falling, thereby, causing a decrease in the amount falling to the surface per hour...|$|R

40|$|Global ocean {{precipitation}} is {{an important}} part of the water cycle in the climate system. A number of efforts have been undertaken to acquire reliable estimates of precipitation over the oceans based on remote sensing and reanalysis modelling. However, validation of these data is still a challenging task, mainly due to a lack of suitable in situ measurements of precipitation over the oceans. In this study, validation of the satellite-based Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and fluxes from Satellite data (HOAPS) climatology was conducted with in situ measurements by ship rain gauges over the Baltic Sea from 1995 to 1997. The ship rain gauge data are point-to-area collocated against the HOAPS data. By choosing suitable collocation parameters, a detection rate of up to about 70 % is achieved. Investigation of the influence of the synoptic situation on the detectability shows that HOAPS performs better for stratiform than for convective precipitation. The number of collocated data is not sufficient to validate <b>precipitation</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, <b>precipitation</b> <b>rates</b> were analysed by applying an interpolation scheme based on the Kriging method to both data sets.

In particular, the outstanding increase in runoff contribution, after 1970, for the drainage area between Itaipú and Jupiá of around 96 % is mainly responsible for a positive trend in Paraná flow.
