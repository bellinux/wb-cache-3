40|$|Becoming {{a teacher}} {{involves}} more than the acquisition of {{a new set of}} skills and knowledge. It involves a change in one’s identity, and this change seems affected by tensions experienced during the teaching practicum. This multiple case study explores the points of tension experienced by 18 student teachers during practicum in a <b>TESOL</b> <b>Certificate</b> program in order to better understand transformations in one’s identity when one becomes a teacher. The study aims to address two questions: “What are the points of tension experienced by student teachers during their practicum and what are the discourses they engage in to talk about these tensions?” and “How can curricular and methodological changes in a TESOL program support the emergence of a transformational discourse when experiencing tensions?” The study uses a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the location of becoming a teacher in Bhabha’s (1998; 2008) Third Space, explores and extends Mezirow’s (1990; 1991; 2000; 2012) system of Transformational Education, and makes use of Bakhtin’s (1968; 1981) notions of dialogism and chronotopes of time, space, and threshold as constructs for creating, collecting, and interacting with the data. Freire’s (1970; 1974; 1992) notion of power underlies all aspects of the study from exploring the implications of inhabiting the role of teacher-as-researcher (Zeni, 2001) to the avoidance of prescriptive outcomes in program design. The study involved the collection of written and video data from three cohorts of student teachers throughout their four-month <b>TESOL</b> <b>certificate</b> program. A dialogical approach was applied to the analysis of the data that interweaves the experiences of the teacher-as-researcher with the experiences of the participants. The results indicate that student teachers experienced personal, interpersonal, knowledge, cultural, pedagogical, and methodological tensions, but more significantly, four discourses (blaming, explaining, questioning, problem-solving) were identified and explored for their transformational potential. The outcomes of the study indicate that some of the above discourses are more transformational than others. Suggestions and examples for developing a TESOL teacher education practice that provides time and space for transformational discourse to emerge are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} application of competency-based training to teacher education in Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). This approach to specifying curriculum outcomes emerged in Australia in the early 1980 s and has recently begun to regain ground in terms of significance and impact. This {{is because of the}} requirement for a growing number of <b>TESOL</b> <b>certificate</b> and diploma courses in New South Wales to be accredited within the vocational education and training (VET) sector, a process replicated to varying degrees in other States and Territories. This paper, using evidence from the literature on the development and application of competency-based training in other fields and an exploration of changing teaching practices that have arisen in the transition to a post-method era in TESOL, argues that the narrow view of this approach is fundamentally unsuitable for language teacher education and that a viable alternative approach to course accreditation needs to be found. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Brandt This paper {{considers}} teaching {{practice in}} short, intensive, pre-service <b>TESOL</b> <b>certificate</b> courses, drawing upon outcomes of recent {{research into the}} experiences of participants on courses offered internationally by a UK-based provider. Qualitative methodology led to the identification of 26 critical issues, including several related to the teaching practice component of such courses. It is suggested that the component is used by tutors primarily for assessment purposes while practice and feedback take on a secondary function, leading to an emphasis on assessable performance {{at the expense of}} developmental practice. The implications of this for trainees, tutors, and language students are discussed. An opportunity {{to improve the quality of}} initial TESOL training is identified, through courses designed to account for current conceptions of adult learning and reflective practice, in which a more learner-centred approach to both trainees and language learners is taken, and trainees are guaranteed authentic and developmental practice opportunities.

40|$|This article {{reports a}} study of the {{discourse}} of shared lesson planning sessions {{in the early stages of}} a pre-service <b>TESOL</b> <b>certificate</b> course. The study focuses on ‘lesson planning conferences’ (LPCs), in which a teacher educator and a group of student teachers worked on one student teacher’s lesson plan. It describes the discursive practices through which lesson plans emerged and through which student teachers constructed personal practical knowledge and identity as they negotiated the process of becoming members of the community of practice of English language teachers. The study revealed the LPCs to be a dynamic and recursive process in which problems of instruction emerged and solutions were suggested. While the teacher educators produced more meanings related to personal practical knowledge, the student teachers had a substantial share in the discursive resources with which meanings were exchanged. The analysis also shows how participants engaged with the practice of planning for teaching through such discursive acts as producing directives, proposing actions, evaluating, articulating teaching principles and imagining classroom events. The article argues that – in spite of some limitations – shared lesson planning is a promising strategy for the construction of novice language teachers’ personal practical knowledge and professional identities...|$|R

Using a primarily ethnographic methodology, data {{in the form of}} unstructured and semi-structured interviews, course lectures, teaching practice journals, course documents and field notes were collected and analyzed to offer insight into the design and implementation of short-term teacher education. Course participants were followed for nine months after the course to provide follow-up data, and six experienced ELT teachers were also interviewed to add long-term perspective. The results demonstrated that the length of the Certificate course necessitates a prioritization of practice over theory and a focus on behavioral change at the expense of examination and critique of course participants' pre-existing beliefs. Trainees emerge from short-term teacher training with confidence well in place in most cases but lacking in an understanding of the foundations of informed language teaching, an explicit in-depth knowledge of language, and a view of the field as a profession worthy of long-term commitment. A noteworthy gap was discovered between course participants' lack of desire for further professional development and more experienced teachers' insistence that additional support and training is crucial beyond the short course. The findings of the study point to a need for a radical restructuring of the short course, which takes into account a changing global market and current understanding of teacher change and the significance of teachers' beliefs...|$|R

It provides students online access to traditional face-to-face course offerings. This thesis addresses how to converge face-to-face courses into effective online courses. It examines a variety of components, {{such as the use}} of tools in Blackboard (WebCT) Vista, the roles of instructors and students in a computer-based setting, the use of different strategies and techniques for special need students using the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) paradigm, and the pros and cons of online and face-to-face courses. This study also offers guidelines for a five-hour training session for faculty based on e-learning design, evaluation and netiquette. Twenty-five students in a graduate course participated in an online learning module that included individual and group tasks. A survey was used to evaluate their responses to the module. A Technology and Learning xi Program (TLP) expert extensively evaluated the online course. He offered suggestions for improving the application of e-learning design, and use of the UDL. Results from the survey, the IT???s evaluation, and theory analysis, provided insights and revealed how diverse students react differently to an online setting. Overall, this study presents a framework on how online learning affects students socially, economically and culturally, and how this educational approach enables faculty, students, and institutions to remain competitive.

40|$|In {{order to}} expand the {{institutional}} support base for professional learning and development of {{teachers in the field}} of TESOL and other educational disciplines, a firm resolve is needed to keep extending our intellectual frontiers for a broader understanding of a fundamental question in educational research: How do teachers learn and develop? In light of the TESOL Inc. (2003) position statement on teacher quality, which conceives TESOL to be a professional discipline, the present research was conducted on the learning biographies of those <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> who have already demonstrated their professional competence and earned the title of highly effective <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> at their workplaces. On their supposedly epic journey from being novices to becoming highly effective <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals,</b> they are expected to have developed an advanced level of professional consciousness, which is informed by a blend of propositional, pedagogical and experiential knowledge of the profession and the noble professional and humanistic values reiterated by TESOL Inc. To enhance our understanding of the phenomenon set forth above via research on the learning biographies, the current study was primarily planned to analyse the continuing professional learning and development experience, along with the role of various influential contextual and individual factors, of three highly effective Pakistani <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> working at a Saudi university. More importantly, explanation was sought for the nature of their professional learning and development in light of the social learning theories of Vygotsky and Lave and Wenger, and the established yet evolving construct of reflective practice. With a scope for investigative depth, interpretive adequacy, and illuminative fertility (Shank & Villella, 2004), the study was designed within the ambit of Interpretive Paradigm employing purposive sampling for data collection. Following an intra-paradigm methodological eclecticism, a narrative-biographical inquiry of three <b>TESOL</b> professionals’ lifelong <b>professional</b> learning and development was conducted for fieldwork. The findings of the study have some significant implications that may be of interest to a myriad of people. The findings of these narratives of professional learning and development may be motivating for the TESOL aspirants in Pakistan and the Gulf, enlightening for fellow professionals at different rungs of their career, and thought-provoking for researchers, teacher-trainers and policy-makers in the field of TESOL. First, the findings reinforced with additional evidence that <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> learn {{in a variety of ways}} and their professional learning and development feature idiosyncrasy and complexity rendering all attempts at uniformity of the process of learning as problematic. Whereas, an inclusive, non-dichotomous approach combining a variety of learning theories can help capture the ubiquitous and variegated nature of teachers’ professional learning and development. Secondly, the findings underscored that such learning experiences which tend to effect an epistemological as well as an ontological change in teachers, lead to profound transformation in their professional-self. Thirdly, the participants’ concern for context-specificity and culture-sensitivity in their pedagogical practice, particularly in the event of boundary crossing (job in a different context), significantly contributes to their learning by challenging their existing repertoire and creating new zones of proximal development (ZPDs). Fourthly, the study envisages hope for the vital context-specific professional learning and development through participation in interdependent, synergistic professional learning communities epitomizing the features of mutual empathy and maturity. Fifthly, the analyses of these narratives offer situated understanding of professional learning and development with a scope for readers to identify with (some of) the ideas, themes, and patterns and develop them further for application beyond the research context. Finally, narratives of lifelong professional learning and development of these highly effective Pakistani <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> are a substantial contribution to the extremely deficient body of knowledge about the learning lives of Pakistani <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> working in or outside Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|The central {{research}} question for this dissertation is: How do overseas Christian ESOL teachers describe putting {{their religious beliefs}} into practice in their profession? Specifically, {{the focus is on}} mostly evangelical Christian English language teachers who have earned a <b>TESOL</b> <b>certificate</b> and who {{at the time of this}} project were working overseas in non-religious higher education settings in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. ^ The main rationale for asking this {{research question}} is this dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s claim that personal religious beliefs need to be explored within the professional domain of teacher knowledge, as initially argued in the literature review. Data analysis and interpretation demonstrate that this study 2 ̆ 7 s participants link these categories of beliefs in ways that are complex and illuminating. The connections these overseas teachers make help explain how they know what they know and why they do what they do as TESOL professionals; that is to say, the data demonstrate substantial interrelationships among participants 2 ̆ 7 personal religious beliefs and their professional teacher knowledge. Findings are reported in three ways: (1) qualitative themes, namely professionalism, relationality, and witness; (2) individual case studies of four teacher participants; and (3) issues for cross-case comparisons, namely distinctiveness and witness, applied theology and witness, and professionalism and witness. ^ Finally, three key issues are revisited for additional, open-ended discussion. The first issue is the predominantly inward-focused nature of the findings. This may be a limitation in this project 2 ̆ 7 s data or of the topic itself. The second issue is the controversy over Christian witness in TESOL, initially described in the literature review and highlighted in the findings. The third issue is the larger issue of how beliefs are put into practice.

40|$|It {{has been}} the dilemma of many <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> {{that they have to}} decide whether they should treat ESL/EFL learners’ L 1 -influenced {{features}} as ‘identity-revealing’ accents, or ‘fossilized’ pronunciation errors. This paper explores this issue by presenting findings from a mini-survey about how a group of 16 <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> from a teacher education institute in Hong Kong would classify a list of common Hong Kong English (HKE) accent features as errors or accents, and whether they based their judgements on factors such as ‘social stigmatization’ and/or ‘obstruction to intelligibility’. Results of the survey showed that the majority (66. 7 %) of the HKE-influenced segmental features scored a high error% of 60 or more even though only a minority of them were felt to be intelligibility-obstructing or socially stigmatizing. Findings from follow-up interviews with six voluntary professionals revealed a general tendency for the respondents to practice what Foucault (1988) called technologies of the self since these TESOL professionals’ considerations reflected a strong sense of subjectivation, or self-regulation and re-invention, based on their institutional roles and obligations as educators, and perceptions of own status and power as English users.

40|$|An often-held {{assumption}} is that qualified ESL/EFL teachers are native apeakers of English(NS). Given the fact that nonnative spealers of English (NNS) account for about 42 % MATESOL students in the US, we cannot ignore {{their place in the}} overall TESOL profession. With both NS teachers and NNS teachers in TESOL, the inevitable question of interest to ask is of the respective roles NSs and NNSs play in ESL/EFL instructional settings. As a first step to further investigate the merits and fallout of being NSs or NNSs in English teaching programs, this study examines the perceptions that NS and NNS <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> have od themselves and each other {{in terms of what they}} feel they can offer students. This study, through questionnaires and interviews, reveals different perceptions of NS <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> and identifies skill areas where NNS may have an advantage over NS. Findings from this study indicate that(1) there are differences in subjects' perceived strenghts and weaknesses as teachers depending on the subjects' status as NS/NNS, and(2) difficulties with students caused by cultural differences were observed more often among NSs than in the NNS group. The implications of these findings are that in order to create better classroom for both students and teachers, we have to consider the different qualifications that both NS and NNS teachers have. 優秀なESL/EFL教師はネイティブ（NS) だという昔からの認識が最近変わりつつある。また、アメリカ合衆国内でTESOL修士課程に属する学生のうち実に半分近くがノンテイティブ(NNS) とも言われる。NS/NNS教師の持つアドバンテージを調査し、それぞれの能力を活かす努力を始める時期ではないだろうか。この研究論文では質問票とインタビューを通じ、NS/NNSが教師としてどのように違うのかを研究した。その結果、１）自己評価による長所・短所にはNSグループとNNSグループで大きな違いがあり、また、２）文化の違いによる教師・生徒間の問題は、NNSよりNSグループで頻繁に報告されていることがわかった。NS/NNS教師の違いのより良い認識の助けとなれば幸いである...|$|R

While other TESOL programmes offered by Wintec are for trained teachers and teacher-aides, the new Cert ELT programme is for those {{with little or no}} previous teaching experience. The curriculum development and delivery of Wintec’s TESOL programmes are informed by a constructivist view of learning which has held a prominent focus in educational literature since the late 1980 s. This theory of learning sees learners as active participants in the processes of incorporating, synthesising and constructing knowledge within their previous experience (Arlidge, 2000; Zepke, Nugent & Leach 2003). Of particular relevance within TESOL literature is the social constructivist view which claims that a key element in the learning process is that knowledge is socially constructed through dialogue and interaction with others (Randall & Thornton, 2001; Malderez & Bodoczky, 1999; James, 2001). Also relevant is the reflective model of TESOL teacher education as outlined by Wallace (1993) in which trainees participate in a continuous cycle of teaching, observation, reflection and discussion in order to become reflective practitioners. A lack of information concerning what happens to the Cert ELT students once they graduate from the programme motivated the research discussed in this paper. Data collection included a questionnaire and individual interviews. The questionnaire gathered information concerning the graduates' employment destinations, and the interviews focussed on the graduates' retrospective views of those components of the programme associated with a social constructivist view of learning. These components included experiential learning, reflective practice and collaborative practice. It is expected that insights gained from this project will be of interest to other <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> and teacher educators...|$|R

As a leading professional organization for English language teachers, learners, and researchers, TESOL is {{often called upon to}} identify research priorities for professionals in the field and for other organizations. By examining subfields and foregrounding areas that require additional research, the Research Agenda Task Force (RATF) hopes to provide assistance with the field’s collective research efforts, efforts that extend beyond sponsoring research symposia and other presentations at TESOL conferences. TESOL requires an accessible and flexible research agenda that can be readily consulted, regularly revised, and made easily available to multiple audiences, from graduate students and advisers searching for thesis and dissertation topics to corporations seeking to fund high-priority research and governmental agencies considering major policy decisions.

The paper first examines the rationale for localized classroom practice. The localized classroom practice is ground-up, nonsystematic, and transformative(Canagarajah, 2005 b.). The paper then reviews a broad picture of the classroom practice in outer circle and expanding circle countries, and classroom practice in Japan. The issues for localized classroom practice begin at questioning the implementaion of CLT in local context, especially considering the circumstances of EFL.

Both happenstance and purposeful encounters with discursive faultlines (Menard-Warwick, 2009) around issues of sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation—what Nelson (2009) terms sexual identity inquiry—and, as well, their interrelationships and relationship to cultural relativism were central to the experiences. Such was the case when—{{in the context of a}} “New Cultural Experience” course assignment—one student reported having attended a “drag queen show” performance as her new cultural experience.

I am only able recognise it when I learn, through an autoethnography of my own professionalism, to put aside my own preoccupations with ‘Western TESOL’. The initial objective {{of this study was to}} attempt to gain insights into local perspectives surrounding ELT methodology and teacher education, set against a background of a perceived need for methodological change in the setting. However, once the study had begun, it became clear that my own professional background and experiences, my ‘Western TESOL’ ‘professional baggage’, combined with the fact that I was coming into the setting as an outsider, seeing it through distant eyes, was affecting the ways in which I was viewing the setting and interpreting the events happening within it. As I began to offload some of this ‘professional baggage’, realising that my ‘Western TESOL’ understanding of the setting did not necessarily match local participants’ understandings of it, I began to question and re-evaluate the data I had collected. For example, I realised that I was focusing on what I saw as the negative aspects of what I was observing and being told about ELT in the setting, and comparing these to approaches to ELT in ‘Western TESOL’ settings that I was more familiar with. Over time, I began to look at these same aspects in a more positive light, seeing different perspectives and valuing what I was seeing or being told in different ways. My re-evaluations of the data from the setting over time also thus became a focus of the study. The study as a whole is therefore ethnographic in terms of attempting to understand local perspectives, using open-ended questionnaire, classroom observation, interview and field note data, with an autoethnographic dimension to acknowledge the influence of my own distant eyes perspective in understanding these local perspectives. It brings into focus how I, as a researcher, through re-evaluating my own data and as a result gaining greater insight into my own positioning, was able to give credit to different perspectives on the data collected, particularly the data from classroom observations and teacher accounts of practice, and in the light of this to offer possible ways forward for ELT in the setting. It has implications for local ELT professionals in terms of understanding and appreciating their own professionalism. It also has implications for <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> in unfamiliar settings in terms of the need to understand the complexity of these settings, rather than make hasty judgments about local practices, particularly in the case of ‘Western TESOL’ professionals working in ‘non-Western TESOL’ settings. It may therefore be of interest both to ‘Western’ teachers, teacher trainers and academics working or researching, or intending to work or carry out research, in settings with which they are not familiar, particularly ‘non-Western TESOL’ settings, and to local <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals</b> and academics in the setting for the study...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} <b>professional</b> {{development}} of <b>TESOL</b> teachers during a postgraduate peer-taught course in English Philology at the Pedagogical University in Krakow, Poland. The analysis, {{conducted on the}} basis of a Grounded Theory approach, examines how an ICT CPD course influenced the professional development of forty newly-qualified Polish teachers of English as a Foreign Language, who engaged in peer teaching as a central component of the course. The research uncovers and examines teacher beliefs and knowledge in a setting characterised by a high degree of autonomy. The study proposes that the participants, in order to present themselves as competent and self-assured ELT professionals, acted upon the notion of the ‘good teacher’ through both the tacit and the explicit CMC-based negotiation of a collaboratively structured teaching model consistent with their beliefs. In the process of designing ICT-rich English lessons, the participants, guided by their beliefs, ascribed value to subject-specific pedagogical knowledge and skills, foregrounding pedagogy and normalising the technology. The role of autonomy is confirmed as a prerequisite for the kind of practice which supports and enables the pedagogical development of teachers in such an ICT CPD. The thesis offers an original contribution in its presentation of a new construct for understanding teacher belief in the context of technology-related settings. The Technological Pedagogical and Content Beliefs construct (TPACB) attempts to capture the relationship between different types of teacher beliefs, and complements a parallel knowledge construction model - Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge – by offering a proposition which illuminates the nature of the interplay of the beliefs relevant to the field of TESOL and other areas of education. In addition, the study proposes a model for an ELT CPD practicum which encourages development in pedagogical knowledge and beliefs while promoting the integration of ICT into practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} the cross-linguistic {{dimension}} of second language learning, and hence of L 2 pedagogy, {{appears to have been}} systematically underplayed in epicentric, i. e. flowing from centre to periphery, theories of second language acquisition (SLA). Indeed, following the advent of cognitivism, mainstream SLA theory has frequently sought to marginalize anything suggestive of a contrastive paradigm. SLA conceptions {{of the nature of the}} influence of a learner’s first language on L 2 acquisition and performance have tended to take the form of reductive dichotomies of the interference versus facilitative resource type – a mutually exclusive either/or interpretation. Consciously or otherwise, epicentric theories of L 2 learning and pedagogy have filtered down to the language improvement and language awareness components of TESOL initial teacher education (ITE) and in-service education and training (INSET), where the focus is exclusively monolingual L 2 and necessity all too often masquerades as principle. Against this backdrop, the present inquiry set out to evaluate the perceived benefits of an explicitly cross-linguistic (L 1 /L 2) approach to language awareness on an L 2 ITE program for pre-service trainees from the Japanese EFL context. Based on the evaluative response data from the non-native speaker (NNS) program participants, I invoke the notion of analytic generalization to argue that an explicit focus on selected cross-linguistic aspects of L 2 learning, together with awareness-raising in respect of a range of context-specific ESOL-related issues has the potential to positively contribute both to trainees’ L 2 development and to their development as pre-service <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals.</b> The thesis further argues for a more holistic appreciation of the dynamic, complex nature of cross-linguistic influence viewed within a broader, context-specific conception of the L 2 Teacher Language Awareness (L 2 TLA) construct...|$|R
40|$|Narratives of {{classroom}} life—the type that blend analysis with artistry, {{in the form}} of plays, poems, stories, and the like—remain relatively uncommon within language education research. Yet such narratives have the potential to make a significant and timely contribution to the field, given the ways in which knowledge is being reconceptualised in this postmodern, transglobal era. Here I make a case that incorporating crafted classroom-life narratives into language education’s research repertoire—within a body of work that I propose be called critical narrative studies—can help to address the field’s changing needs by further democratising knowledge production and exchange, illuminating subtle yet vital dimensions {{of classroom}} interactions, and prompting imaginative interpretations and revisionings. My argument draws together relevant strands of applied linguistics research; narrative theories and research from education, sociology, and the arts; and several classroom narratives of mine. I conclude with recommendations for enhancing the rigour and reach of studies that incorporate narratives of classroom life, in light of some important dilemmas and cautions. doi: 10. 5054 /tq. 2011. 256799 Four billion people on this earth, but my imagination is the way it’s always been: bad with large numbers. It is still moved by particularity. Wis awa Szymborska (2001, p. 87) A s a teacher and a lover of the literary arts (especially poetry, plays, novels, memoirs), I have long been drawn to education studies that have a strong focus on narrative: the vivid unfolding of events. As a reader of research, I enjoy work that surprises or intrigues me; that uncovers and jostles assumptions I did not know I had; that has a compelling rhythm, a poetic sensibility, a certain sharpness; that lingers in my mind long after the first reading; that stirs me to think—not just abstractly but also kinesthetically, emotionally, viscerally. Thus I was heartened by Canagarajah’s call, back in 1996, for <b>TESOL’s</b> <b>professional</b> and academic communities to accommodate more writing that i...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of Wisconsin-River Falls, 2013. ii + 173 leaves. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 155 - 173). Comics, in {{the form}} of comic strips, comic books, and single panel cartoons are ubiquitous in classroom materials for teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL). While comics material is widely accepted as a teaching aid in TESOL, there is relatively little research into why comics are popular as a teaching instrument and how the effectiveness of comics can be maximized in TESOL. This thesis is designed {{to bridge the gap between}} conventional wisdom on the use of comics in ESL/EFL instruction and research related to visual aids in learning and language acquisition. The hidden science behind comics use in TESOL is examined to reveal the nature of comics, the psychological impact of the medium on learners, the qualities that make some comics more educational than others, and the most empirically sound ways to use comics in education. The definition of the comics medium itself is explored; characterizations of comics created by <b>TESOL</b> <b>professionals,</b> comic scholars, and psychologists are indexed and analyzed. This definition is followed by a look at the current role of comics in society at large, the teaching community in general, and TESOL specifically. From there, this paper explores the psycholinguistic concepts of construction of meaning and the language faculty. Through an analysis of the evolution of language, art history, and the psychology of perception, comics are revealed to be an innate form of human communication that originated in pre-literate ancient times; this medium continues to be a powerful form of non-verbal communication to this day. Next, educational theories particularly relevant to comics use in TESOL are examined, with a focus Allan Pavio's Dual Coding theory of learning and Stephen Krashen's Input and Affective Filter Hypotheses. Each major section of this thesis contains a subsection of case studies from TESOL fieldwork, followed by an index of the things teachers should know and do to use the information in the section effectively...|$|R
