5|$|GOI and GOLP {{continue}} to sell Gulf-branded lubricants worldwide through {{a network of}} official licensed companies, joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiary companies. Many of these official Gulf distributors carry out local marketing and sponsorship which help to raise the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brand. Of these wholly owned subsidiaries Gulf Oil Corporation India has raised the market <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf brand in the Middle East. GOCL have {{emerged as one of}} leading lubricants brands in India and run many marketing sponsorships targeted at the ever-growing youth sector in the country.|$|E
5|$|Analysts said that, {{in return}} for {{organizational}} support, al-Balawi probably agreed {{to appear in the}} video, and to connect the attack he was planning to the death of Baitullah Mehsud, thus raising the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tehrik-i-Taliban. Most analysts believe, however, that al Qaeda chose the CIA as the target and ran the operation.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machined surface is always the inverse of the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
40|$|Collocated <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reynolds {{stress tensor}} and eddy {{covariance}} fluxes are obtained to derive vertical <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> turbulent momentum and sediment diffusivity in a tidal river, using coupled acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). Shear and normal stresses are obtained {{by combining the}} variances in radial velocities measured by the ADCP beams. The covariances between radial velocities and calibrated acoustic backscatter allow <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three Cartesian components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turbulent flux <b>of</b> suspended sediment. <b>The</b> main advantage <b>of</b> this new approach is that flow velocity and sediment concentration measurements are exactly collocated, and allowing for profiling over longer ranges, in comparison to existing techniques. Results show that vertical <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inverse turbulent Prandtl-Schmidt number are coherent with corresponding <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sediment diffusivity, rather than with <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eddy viscosity...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's proposal that carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper. The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030.

5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene.

As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are {{able to identify the}} killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Mulder and Green {{interview}} {{a witness to}} the bar fire, who tells them of the assailant's apparent ability to will fire into existence. The Marsdens' driver becomes even sicker due to the poisoned cough syrup provided by L'Ively. Because of his illness, L'Ively is recruited to drive the family into Boston that night to attend a party at a luxury hotel. Mulder flies up to Boston to watch over the party with Green, hoping to set a trap for the suspect; Scully continues working on compiling a criminal <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> killer.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, {{after working}} in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow {{returned}} to the US with what they say were three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair {{of male and female}} kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

5|$|In his 13-year, 924-game NBA playing career, Cousy {{finished}} with 16,960 points, 4,786 rebounds and 6,955 assists, translating to averages of 18.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game. He {{was regarded as}} the first great point guard of the NBA, winning eight of the first 11 assist titles in the league, all of them en bloc, and had a highly successful career, winning six NBA titles, one MVP award, 13 All-Star and 12 All-NBA First and Second Team call-ups and two All-Star MVP awards. With his eye-catching dribbling and unorthodox passing, Cousy popularized modern guard play and raised the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boston Celtics and the entire NBA. His fast-paced playing style was later emulated {{by the likes of}} Pete Maravich and Magic Johnson.|$|E

5|$|In this phase, {{water vapor}} {{condenses}} on various nuclei {{present in the}} air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere {{and the presence of}} any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.|$|E
5|$|The West German {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the high <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoners {{and the fact that the}} group had numerous sympathisers, so that terrorist acts aiming at the liberation of the Munich attackers were feared. Aircraft of (then) national airline Lufthansa or its Israeli counterpart El Al were identified as likely targets. On 9 September, an anonymous letter was received claiming that such a hijacking was indeed imminent, which prompted the Federal Ministry of the Interior (then led by Hans-Dietrich Genscher) to consider whether citizens of Arab states should be denied boarding of Lufthansa flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
