40|$|AbstractMacrocyclization {{carried out}} by thioesterase domains of multimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is a key step in the {{biosynthesis}} of many biologically active peptides. The thioesterase excised from tyrocidine synthetase is a versatile macrocyclization catalyst and {{a useful tool for}} chemoenzymatic synthesis of diverse cyclic peptides. However, its utility is limited by its short lifetime of catalytic activity as well as significant flux of the acyl-enzyme intermediate to hydrolysis. The addition of Brij 58, a nonionic detergent, above the critical micelle concentration, has dramatic effects on enzyme activity: catalytic activity is extended to > 60 min and the rate of cyclization (but not hydrolysis) increases 6 -fold, resulting in a net 150 - to 300 -fold increase in cyclic product yields. This enhanced activity allowed enzymatic macrocyclization of a solid <b>phase</b> <b>library</b> of tyrocidine decapeptides to identify acceptable substitutions at the Orn 9 position which had previously been inaccessible for diversification...|$|E

40|$|Parasitic {{protozoa}} {{lack the}} ability to synthesize purine nucleotides de novo, relying instead on purine salvage enzymes for their survival. Guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (GPRT) from the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia is a potential target for rational antiparasitic drug design, based on the experimental evidence, which indicates the lack of interconversion between adenine and guanine nucleotide pools. The present study {{is a continuation of}} our efforts to use three-dimensional structures of parasitic phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTs) to design novel antiparasitic agents. Two micromolar phthalimide-based GPRT inhibitors were identified by screening the in-house phthalimide library. A combination of structure-based scaffold selection using virtual library screening across the PRT gene family and solid <b>phase</b> <b>library</b> synthesis led to identification of smaller (molecular weight, < 300) ligands with moderate to low specificity for GPRT; the best inhibitors, GP 3 and GP 5, had Ki values in the 23 to 25 μM range. These results represent significant progress toward the goal of designing potent inhibitors of purine salvage in Giardia parasites. As a second step in this process, altering the phthalimide moiety to optimize interactions in the guanine-binding pocket of GPRT is expected to lead to compounds with promising activity against G. lamblia PRT...|$|E
40|$|The {{solid phase}} {{combinatorial}} method {{is an excellent}} tool for the modulation of protein-protein interactions through focused library generations. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions with an iodinated template on solid phase has opened a door for easy and pure libraries of 13 - 22 membered medium and macrocyclic peptidomimetics. These peptide mimics showed promising activities for tyrosine kinase receptors. Iodine functionality can then be used to modify the products, on the resin, via Sonogashira and Suzuki couplings and presumably through other organometallic catalysis. The coupled products can have conformational biases that differ from the iodinated macrocycles. These coupling reactions also provide a means to introduce additional pharmacophores and to adjust the solubilities of the products. The fluorinated template also gave libraries of cyclic peptidomimetics on solid phase in good yields and purities. These libraries have improved water solubility over the iodinated libraries. The 3 -fluorinated template yielded better results than the 5 - fluorinated template. Some compounds showed biological activities in cell survival assays providing strong support of our approach to mimic external ????-turn sequences in target proteins. Intrasite dimerization with 1, 5 -hexadiyne gave a homodimer as a byproduct. Solidphase synthesis of bivalent turn mimics with fluorescent tags has been demonstrated. The key feature of this synthetic route is that homo- and hetero-dimers can be formed chemoselectively from unprotected monomeric precursors. The dimerization reaction is very mild and versatile, as only potassium carbonate is required to affect the coupling. Solution <b>phase</b> <b>library</b> synthesis of small molecule mimics is presented. Some monomers of full sequence mimics have been prepared to afford dimer generations. Theses monomers were combined with linker handles to afford diverse length of dimers. Final combination of monomers to make bivalent compounds is in progress...|$|E

40|$|A random pentapeptide library {{composed}} of 14 D-amino acids, including two unusual amino acids, thus representing 537, 824 different peptide sequences anchored on polystyrene beads was created with each bead bearing a single pentapeptide sequence. This library {{was used for}} affinity screening against the fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate aldolase of Trypanosoma brucei labeled with biotin as well as versus the COOH-terminal labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The thus selected peptide beads were identified and the appropriate sequences synthesized as peptide amides and evaluated for enzyme activity inhibition. Screening against the whole enzyme {{did not result in}} selection of an enzyme inhibitor. However, we demonstrate here that screening against a part of the enzyme involved in the catalytic activity may lead to the discovery of an enzyme inhibitor as well as an enzyme activator. Two low affin ity inhibitors, RRVKF-NH 2 and KThiKAR-NH 2, with an IC 50 of approximate to 1 mM and approximate to 0. 2 mM, respectively, were identified. Two other pentapeptides with the sequence SWChaKK-NH 2 and SKChaKM-NH 2 are able to activate the enzyme fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate aldolase. Thus, successful screening of solid <b>phase</b> <b>libraries</b> can be accomplished using selected sequences of the target enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Diploid Ipomoea trifida is an ancestral {{wild species}} of the {{cultivated}} hexaploid sweet potato, and displays a sporophytic self-incompatibility (SI) that is controlled by a single multiallelic S-locus. To characterize the genomic region of the S-locus using a map-based cloning method, a BAC library consisting of approximately 40, 000 clones was constructed from genomic DNA of S 1 -homozygote, and screened using S-linked DNA markers which were mapped in our previous study. We constructed a contig covering the S-locus region with additional screening of fosmid and λ <b>phase</b> <b>libraries.</b> RFLP analysis of recombinant plants using terminal end sequences of the BAC clones as probes indicated that the S-locus region was delimited within a map distance of 0. 57 cM, spanning approximately 300 kb in physical distance. Remarkable suppression of genetic recombination was detected in the S-locus region. From sequence analysis of the 313 -kp region, 43 ORFs, many repetitive sequences and 5 transposable elements were predicted. None of the ORFs, however, showed a high homology with the SI genes reported to date at the S-locus of other plant families, suggesting that a unique molecular mechanism {{is involved in the}} SI system of the Convolvulaceae family...|$|R
