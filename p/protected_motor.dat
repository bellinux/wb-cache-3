40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{have been}} shown to amplify the heat shock response in cell lines by increasing the binding of heat shock transcription factor– 1 to heat shock elements within heat shock gene promoters. Because overexpression of the inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) was neuroprotective in a culture model of motor neuron disease, this study investigated whether NSAIDs induce Hsp 70 and confer cytoprotection in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord cultures exposed to various stresses. Two NSAIDs, sodium salicylate and niflumic acid, lowered the temperature threshold for induction of Hsp 70 in glia but failed to do so in motor neurons. At concentrations that increased Hsp 70 in heat shocked glial cells, sodium salicylate failed to delay death of motor neurons exposed to hyperthermia, paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Neither sodium salicylate nor the cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor, niflumic acid, <b>protected</b> <b>motor</b> neurons from the toxicity of mutated Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD- 1) linked to a familial form of the motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Increased levels of phospho-p 38 MAPK were present in the motor neurons and microglia of the ventral spinal cord. The p 38 MAPK-inhibitor, SB 203580, completely inhibited mutant SOD 1 -induced apoptosis of motor neurons and blocked LPS-induced activation of microglia.

40|$|The {{survival}} promoting and neuroprotective {{actions of}} {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) are well known but under certain circumstances this growth factor can also exacerbate excitotoxic insults to neurons. Prior exploration of the receptor through which BDNF exerts this action on motor neurons deflects attention away from p 75. Here we investigated the possibility that BDNF acts through the receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, to confer on motor neurons sensitivity to excitotoxic challenge. We blocked BDNF activation of TrkB using a dominant negative TrkB mutant or a TrkB function blocking antibody, and found that this <b>protected</b> <b>motor</b> neurons against excitotoxic insult in cultures of mixed spinal cord neurons. Addition of a function blocking antibody to BDNF to mixed spinal cord neuron cultures is also neuroprotective indicating that endogenously produced BDNF participates in vulnerability to excitotoxicity. We next examined the intracellular signaling cascades that are engaged upon TrkB activation. Previously we found that inhibition of the phosphatidylinositide- 3 '-kinase (PI 3 'K) pathway blocks BDNF-induced excitotoxic sensitivity. Here we show that expression of a constitutively active catalytic subunit of PI 3 'K, p 110, confers excitotoxic sensitivity (ES) upon motor neurons not incubated with BDNF. Parallel studies with purified motor neurons confirm that these events {{are likely to be}} occuring specifically within motor neurons.

40|$|M. B. A. According to du Plessis et al., (1994 : 67), {{the history}} of {{protectionism}} in trade goes almost {{as far back as}} that of trade itself. There are various arguments for the numerous benefits, which can be gained from free trade such as, efficiency and welfare gains. But, despite these benefits, governments have had counter arguments as to why protectionism is justified. Examples of these traditional arguments for protection are, the infant industry argument, the terms of trade argument, protection to increase employment in an industry, a tariff to offset foreign dumping and a tariff to improve the balance of payments. All of these arguments have important gains for the protected economy but could be considered beggar-thyneighbour policies since they are {{at the expense of the}} unprotected economy. Various trade instruments are used by governments to intervene in its countries trading activities. These trade instruments are categorised into, tariff, non-tariff barriers and export taxes and subsidies. Both tariff and non-tariff barriers are used to interfere on the import side of trade, whereas export subsidies and taxes are used to interfere with the free flow of exports. Tariff barriers include specific tariffs, ad valorem tariffs, import subsidies, preferential duties, most-favoured nation treatment and offshore assembly provisions. Nontariff barriers include import quotas, "voluntary" export restraints, government procurement provisions, local content provisions, administrative classification and restriction on service trade (du Plessis et al., 1994 : 67 - 70). An example of a protected industry in South Africa is the motor industry. The initial protectionist programmes used by the motor industry were characterised by local content policies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{promising}} {{therapeutic strategy}} for {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) {{is the use of}} cell-based therapies that can <b>protect</b> <b>motor</b> neurons and thereby retard disease progression. We recently showed that a single large dose (25 × 10 ⁶ cells) of mononuclear cells from human umbilical cord blood (MNC hUCB) administered intravenously to pre-symptomatic G 93 A SOD 1 mice is optimal in delaying disease progression and increasing lifespan. However, this single high cell dose is impractical for clinical use. The aim of the present pre-clinical translation study was therefore to evaluate the effects of multiple low dose systemic injections of MNC hUCB cell into G 93 A SOD 1 mice at different disease stages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice received weekly intravenous injections of MNC hUCB or media. Symptomatic mice received 10 ⁶ or 2. 5 × 10 ⁶ cells from 13 weeks of age. A third, pre-symptomatic, group received 10 ⁶ cells from 9 weeks of age. Control groups were media-injected G 93 A and mice carrying the normal hSOD 1 gene. Motor function tests and various assays determined cell effects. Administered cell distribution, motor neuron counts, and glial cell densities were analyzed in mouse spinal cords. Results showed that mice receiving 10 ⁶ cells pre-symptomatically or 2. 5 × 10 ⁶ cells symptomatically significantly delayed functional deterioration, increased lifespan and had higher motor neuron counts than media mice. Astrocytes and microglia were significantly reduced in all cell-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that multiple injections of MNC hUCB cells, even beginning at the symptomatic disease stage, could benefit disease outcomes by <b>protecting</b> <b>motor</b> neurons from inflammatory effectors.

50|$|Starters using {{magnetic}} contactors usually derive {{the power}} supply for the contactor coil {{from the same}} source as the motor supply. An auxiliary contact from the contactor is used to maintain the contactor coil energized after the start command for the motor has been released.

This connection also provides a small degree of protection against low power supply voltage and loss of a phase.

40|$|Persistent {{accumulation}} of misfolded proteins causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a prominent feature in many neurodegenerative diseases including {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS). Here we report the identification of homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK 2) as the essential link that promotes ER-stress-induced cell death via the IRE 1 α-ASK 1 -JNK pathway. ER stress, induced by tunicamycin or SOD 1 (G 93 A), activates HIPK 2 by phosphorylating highly conserved serine and threonine residues (S 359 /T 360) within the activation loop of the HIPK 2 kinase domain. In SOD 1 (G 93 A) mice, loss of HIPK 2 delays disease onset, reduces cell death in spinal motor neurons, mitigates glial pathology, and improves survival. Remarkably, HIPK 2 activation positively correlates with TDP- 43 proteinopathy in NEFH-tTA/tetO-hTDP- 43 ΔNLS mice, sporadic ALS and C 9 ORF 72 ALS, and blocking HIPK 2 kinase activity <b>protects</b> <b>motor</b> neurons from TDP- 43 cytotoxicity.

40|$|Background: Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that RNA oxidation {{is involved in a}} wide variety of neurological diseases and may be associated with neuronal deterioration during the process of neurodegeneration. However, previous studies were done in postmortem tissues or cultured neurons. Here, we used transgenic mice to demonstrate the role of RNA oxidation in the process of neurodegeneration. Methodology/Principal Findings: We demonstrated that messenger RNA (mRNA) oxidation is a common feature in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients as well as in many different transgenic mice expressing familial ALS-linked mutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD 1). In mutant SOD 1 mice, increased mRNA oxidation primarily occurs in the motor neurons and oligodendrocytes of the spinal cord at an early, pre-symptomatic stage. Identification of oxidized mRNA species revealed that some species are more vulnerable to oxidative damage, and importantly, many oxidized mRNA species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. Oxidative modification of mRNA causes reduced protein expression. Reduced mRNA oxidation by vitamin E restores protein expression and partially <b>protects</b> <b>motor</b> neurons.

40|$|Neuroinflammation is a {{pathological}} hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), and is characterized by activated microglia at sites of neuronal injury. In ALS. neurons do not die alone; neuronal injury is noncell- autonomous and depends upon a well-orchestrated dialogue between motor neurons and microglia. Evidence from transgenic models expressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD) suggests that the dialogue between motor neurons and microglia initially <b>protects</b> <b>motor</b> neurons. However, with increasing stress and injury within motor neurons, induced {{by the presence of}} misfolded proteins such as mSOD 1, mitochondrial function and axoplasmic flow are impaired and endoplasmic reticulum stress is induced; misfolded proteins themselves or alternate signals are released from motor neurons and activate microglia. Activated microglia, in turn, switch from anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective to proinflammatory and neurotoxic. Neurotoxic signaling from motor neurons promotes microglial release of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines further enhancing motor neuron stress and cell injury and initiating a self-propagating cycle of motor neuron injury and cell death. A greater understanding of how to restore the imbalance between neuroprotection and cytotoxicity will depend upon a greater understanding of the motor neuron-microglial dialogue...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a devastating}} adult neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron degeneration and death around 3 years from onset. So far, riluzole {{is the only}} treatment available, although it only offers {{a slight increase in}} survival. The complex etiology of ALS, with several genes able to trigger the disease, makes its study difficult. Areas covered: RNA-mediated or protein-mediated toxic gain-of-function leading to motor neuron degeneration appears to be likely common pathogenic mechanisms in ALS.

40|$|Since its {{description}} by Charcot {{more than}} 130 years ago, {{the pathogenesis of}} selective motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains unsolved. Over the years, many pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed.
