The ratio of secondary to primary follicles (S/P ratio) was compared between breeds using the Wilcoxon test. The spatial structure of the follicles was analyzed with Ripleyâs K function and the L function. To detect deviations from Complete Spatial Randomness at different spatial scales simulated confidence envelopes were calculated. The S/P ratio did not differ between Huacaya (7. 1 Â± 0. 52) and Suri (7. 21 Â± 0. 62). There is evidence of statistically significant spatial structure of the follicles in both breeds at small spatial scales. However, at a higher spatial scale, the proportion of samples with a clustered spatial structure of follicles was significantly higher in Huacaya.

The effect of different proportion of chitosan on the powder and particle characteristics was also studied. Solutions containing different proportions of chitosans were prepared and spray dried which produced the microparticles having average particle size of 18 Âµ with the highest production yield of 72 %. The size, shape and morphology of the microparticles were also determined by scanning electron microscope.

40|$|One of {{the first}} European institutes for microelectronics, the Arbeitsstelle fÃ¼r Molekularelektronik Dresden AME, was founded in 1961 by WERNER HARTMANN. The purpose was to develop {{processes}} for fabrication of integrated circuits. Concerning microlithography at first a five-stage mask technique was used since 1965. The artwork original which was called "Vorlage" was cut with a scale of about 200 : 1. Using a reduction camera the artwork original was reduced about 20 times, to get the reticle known as the "Zwischennegativ". This reticle was then further reduced about 10 times by "step and repeat", using a <b>projection</b> <b>microscope,</b> to get a master mask known as the "Originalschablone" whose scale was then 1 : 1. By direct photocopying of the master mask one obtained a working mask which was called the "Arbeitsschablone". Finally, an aligned direct exposure of the working mask on to a wafer created, layer by layer, the micro-pattern of the chip array. Concerning the materials a double layer film {{was used for the}} artwork originals, and 2 inch photographic plates were used for the reticles and masks. In this way the first East German bipolar integrated circuits, NOR gates with 8 transistors, were made in Dresden in 1967. This was done with 4 masking levels on 25 mm Si wafers with 1. 5 mm chip size and 20 Âµm minimal figure width (critical dimensions). In the late 1960 's some improvements were introduced, particularly the 6 -barrel semi-automatic photorepeater, which improved the figure width and gave lower tolerances. The largest chip made in 1969 was a J-K master-slave flipflop, this contained 36 transistors on a chip 1. 6 mm x 1. 8 mm and was done with 9 masking levels and with 10 Âµm minimal figure width...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of micro- and nanostructuring is {{a driving force}} of technical progress in biotechnology, automotive- and computer industries. The variety of materials in these applications demands different methods of structuring, which do not always provide optimal results. Electrochemical microstructuring with ultrashort voltage pulses is a new technique, the possibilities and limitations {{of which will be}} investigated in this thesis. The method is {{based on the fact that}} when a potential pulse is applied, the charging time of the electrochemical double layer regions of tool and workpiece depends on their distance in the electrolyte. Through application of ultrashort voltage pulses, in the range of nanoseconds, effective charging of the double layers will only appear in regions of tool and workpiece in close proximity to each other. Due to the exponential dependence of electrochemical reaction rates on the potential drop in the double layer, occurring reactions are sharply confined to those charged regions. In this thesis it will be shown experimentally and theoretically that a spatial resolution of approximately 10 nm can be achieved by the electrochemical microstructuring with ultrashort voltage pulses. The experimental verification demands a well designed mechanical as well as electrical setup, which can handle the 200 ps voltage pulses, necessary to achieve such spatial resolution. A spatial resolution of 40 nm was experimentally achieved in nickel, and could be improved to 20 nm in gold. In addition to a normally employed sequential structuring by a small cylindrical tool, single-step processing of a complex patterned tool is demonstrated. This even allowed copying of small details in the order of 90 nm. Estimations of the transport of reaction products and educts by diffusion in the electrode gap were made. The maximum size of the tool due to basic electronic limitations was also estimated. In the example of stainless steel, different approaches for microstructuring of passivating metals will be shown. A formation of the passivating oxide layer, which inhibits the machining, can be prevented with an aggressive halogenide electrolyte. Furthermore, the local electrochemical reduction of the oxide by application of short voltage pulses will be presented. A new target for an x-ray <b>projection</b> <b>microscope</b> and a subwavelength structure, for coupling surface plasmons to radiation, are shown as two applications of the electrochemical microstructuring of ultrashort voltage pulses...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has been}} described in which a study was made on the fleece characteristics of Angora Goats kept in Canterbury. Animals that bore twin kids were heavier at tupping than animals that had single kids. The latter were heavier than animals that remained dry. The trial animals showed highly variable fleece characteristics between body positions on an animal and between animals. Responses to environmental and seasonal influences were highly variable. The trial goats had an S/P ratio of around 7, varying between 5 and 10. During spring the mohair fleece showed rudiments of a primitive type double coated fleece by growing kemps, fibres associated with the outer coat of primitive fleeces. The trial goats showed a shedding of the entire fleece by late spring. The trial goats had high fleece yields of around 90 %. The trial animals showed a marked seasonal rhythm of mohair production, with minimum production occurring in winter and maximum production occurring in late spring to early summer. Reproductive activities reduced annual mohair production by about 10 - 14 %. This reduction was brought about by a decrease in fibre diameter, a decrease in fibre length growth rate {{and an increase in}} the number of inactive follicles during winter and early spring. Fleece characteristics changed throughout the year. Average fibre diameter was lowest in winter and highest in spring. Average fibre length growth rate was lowest in winter and highest in summer. The number of growing fibres/unit area was highest in summer and lowest in winter. The degree of medullation (including kemps) was highest in spring and lowest in winter. Relationships between fleece characteristics varied considerably, however: -: average fibre diameter changes occurred prior to average length growth rate changes. -: average fibre diameter and average fibre length correlated positively. -: average fibre diameter and degree of medullation correlated positively. -: average fibre length growth rate and fibre length variation showed an inverse relationship. -: the number of growing fibres/unit area and the degree of medullation showed an inverse relationship. Kemp fibres grew predominantly along the backline and downward over the rump. Kemps grew excessively in spring and to a lesser degree in autumn. Kemps, though relatively few, had a marked influence on average fibre diameter. Angora Goats in Canterbury should be shorn early in spring and early in autumn in order to obtain mohair of high standard. Assessment of the degree of kemp and hairiness of animals should be carried out around late spring to early summer (December). Assessing the average fibre diameter of mohair is best done with a <b>projection</b> <b>microscope</b> on a midside sample, which should be collected in late summer. The C. S. I. R.
