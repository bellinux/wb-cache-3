5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} gunpowder formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a <b>paper</b> <b>container,</b> wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|E

30|$|A typical {{lunch box}} (Fig. 1 a) usually {{consists}} {{of rice and}} dishes distributed in soft <b>paper</b> <b>containers.</b> The <b>paper</b> <b>containers</b> (Fig. 1 b) usually have a frustum shape and highly deformable. Picking and placing such containers filled with food materials is the main task for lunch box packaging. The traditional rigid grippers and vacuum packaging systems, which {{have been widely used}} in food industry, have difficulties to perform such a task because the rigid gripper may damage the food material and the vacuum system needs a flat surface to allow suction. New grasping mechanism providing gentle grasps is required to cope with this task.|$|R

Different image widths are handled using different roll widths, and each width is usually done as a batch process of images all the same size. The light-sensitive paper stock can be contained within light-tight packaging so that the minilab operator only needs to remove the old empty <b>paper</b> <b>container</b> and insert a full one, without needing to darken the room to prevent paper exposure.|$|E
50|$|The term bolu kukus (steamed tart) however, usually {{refer to}} a type of kue mangkuk that mainly only uses wheat flour (without any rice flour and tapioca) with common vanilla, chocolate, or {{strawberry}} flavouring, acquired from food flavouring essence. The term bolu is derived from Dutch to describe Dutch sponge cake. Thus the texture is soft and fluffy just like tart or chiffon cake. As the name imply, bolu kukus is a steamed tart instead of commonly baked cupcakes, and usually the bolu kukus base is covered with corrugated <b>paper</b> <b>container,</b> just like common cupcakes.|$|E

50|$|Goldsmith, {{a reader}} of {{financial}} statements, realised {{that in the}} case of Crown Zellerbach the underlying value of the timberland assets alone, carried at only $12.5m on the balance sheet, was worth more than the target company's total market capitalisation of around $900m. With this insight, Goldsmith began raids that left him with a holding company owning huge tracts of timberland acquired at virtually no net cost. The majority of the pulp and paper assets were sold to James River Corporation in 1986, which in turn became a part of Georgia-Pacific in 2000.

50|$|Although this {{composition}} is fairly insensitive, {{it should be}} treated with care and respect. Hobbyist pyrotechnicians usually use a method called diapering, in which the materials are poured separately onto {{a large piece of}} paper, which is then alternately lifted at each corner to roll the composition over itself and mix the components. Some amateur pyrotechnicians choose to mix the composition by shaking in a closed <b>paper</b> <b>container,</b> as this is much quicker and more effective than diapering. One method of mixing flash is to put the components in the final device and handling the device will mix the flash powder. Paper/cardboard is chosen over other materials such as plastic {{as a result of its}} favorable triboelectric properties.|$|E
50|$|These shrimp dumplings are {{transparent}} and smooth. The prawn dumplings {{first appeared in}} Guangzhou outskirts near the creek bazaar Deli. This dish {{is said to be}} the one that the skill of a dim sum chef is judged on. Traditionally, ha gow should have at least seven and preferably ten or more pleats imprinted on its wrapper. The skin must be thin and translucent, yet be sturdy enough not to break when picked up with chopsticks. It must not stick to the <b>paper,</b> <b>container</b> or the other ha gow in the basket. The shrimp must be cooked well, but not overcooked. The amount of meat should be generous, yet not so much that it cannot be eaten in one bite.|$|E
30|$|Let me give an example. <b>Paper</b> <b>containers</b> of a {{commodity}} for consumption use {{can be easily}} recycled if they are made of brand-new pulp, since the fibres contained in the paper are long and re-usable as an alternative input for brand-new pulp.

50|$|Once {{the crime}} scene has been {{thoroughly}} documented and {{the locations of the}} evidence noted, then the collection process can begin. Most items of evidence will be collected in paper containers such as packets, envelopes, and bags. Liquid items can be transported in non-breakable, leakproof containers. Arson evidence is usually collected in air-tight, clean metal cans. Only large quantities of dry powder should be collected and stored in plastic bags. Moist or wet evidence (blood, plants, etc.) from a crime scene can be collected in plastic containers at the scene and transported back to an evidence receiving area if the storage time in plastic is two hours or less and this is done to prevent contamination of other evidence. Once in a secure location, wet evidence, whether packaged in plastic or paper, must be removed and allowed to completely air dry. That evidence can then be repackaged in a new, dry <b>paper</b> <b>container.</b> Under no circumstances should evidence containing moisture be packaged in plastic or paper containers for more than two hours. Moisture allows the growth of microorganisms which can destroy or alter evidence. Any items which may cross contaminate each other must be packaged separately. The containers should be closed and secured to prevent the mixture of evidence during transportation. Each container should have: the collecting person's initials; the date and time it was collected; a complete description of the evidence and where it was found; and the investigating agency's name and their file number.|$|E
50|$|Pratt joined McKinsey & Co, a {{management}} consulting firm, in 1982 before joining Visy as joint General Manager of its board. In 1988, he became Deputy Chairman of Visy Industries. Three years later, {{he moved to}} the United States to lead the company's expansion there. Over the next 15 years, Pratt Industries grew 15-fold in sales and earnings, through greenfield initiatives and the acquisition of several corrugated manufacturing companies that now form the heart of Pratt Industries. Company revenues grew from 100 million in 1991; and by 2016 revenue was 3 billion. During that time, Pratt Industries grew from the 46th largest corrugated box producer in the U.S. to the 5th largest. It is the only major <b>paper</b> <b>container</b> board company that is 100 percent recycled. In 2013, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg presented Pratt with a proclamation declaring September 17, 2013, Pratt Industries Day. In 2016, Pratt was awarded the RISI North American Packaging CEO of the Year Award. That same year, Pratt opened a 100% recycled paper mill near Chicago, adding about 1 billion to his wealth. It was officially opened by then-Governor Mike Pence. In March, 2017, Pratt opened his 68th factory, a box-making plant, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in Beloit. On May 4th, 2017, Pratt pledged in the presence of President Donald Trump to invest $2 billion to create 5,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs over 10 years mainly in the Midwest.|$|E

50|$|Evidence {{comes in}} many {{different}} forms such as guns, blood on knives, etc. It can be anything from a biological sample like blood, or everyday item like receipts or bank statements. Other types of evidence include: fibers, firearm residue, photographs or videos, and fingerprints. Forensic scientists analyze this evidence so they {{can come up with}} an explanation for why a crime occurred. Ensuring that evidence is collected in an accurate and timely manner helps officers to better understand what happened at the scene and aids in the investigation being completed successfully. Only the appropriate personnel with the proper knowledge and training should be collecting evidence. These individuals include, First Responders, Crime Scene Investigators, and other specialized personnel. Different types of evidence will sometimes need different methods of collection or specific <b>containers.</b> For instance, <b>paper</b> <b>containers,</b> such as bags,envelopes, or boxes, may be optimal for biological samples. <b>Paper</b> <b>containers</b> allow evidence that is not completely dry to continue drying. This type of collection protects those samples from deteriorating. When the evidence is collected properly there is less of a chance that the items collected will be damaged or contaminated.|$|R
