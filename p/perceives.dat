He searches for Rosenthal, who he finds decapitated, along with David communicating with the Neomorph that killed her. Christopher kills the Neomorph and holds David at gunpoint, demanding an explanation for his activities. David leads him to his makeshift laboratory, as well as a hatchery, where he keeps a number of Alien eggs. David goads Christopher into approaching an egg, which results in a Facehugger attacking and impregnating him.

40|$|<b>Perceived</b> {{value is}} {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} focal construct in marketing and often described as a key determinant of sustainable competitive advantage and superior performance. Despite these interests, little research has addressed the <b>perceived</b> value construct, {{and there is no}} well-accepted <b>perceived</b> value measure. This thesis aims at developing, testing, and applying a <b>perceived</b> value measure, while demonstrating its application in management. It also sets out to test a set of antecedent and consequent relationships to explore influences on, and behavioural outcomes of <b>perceived</b> value in the parcel postal industry. <b>Perceived</b> value is defined in this thesis as the judgement by the consumer of the associated <b>perceived</b> benefits offered by (or linked to) a product or service, when the associated sacrifices have been evaluated or assessed (assuming that through the evaluation process one may either reduce, eliminate or ignore any associated sacrifices). Using <b>perceived</b> risk as a focal measure of associated sacrifices to determine <b>perceived</b> value, the various dimensions of <b>perceived</b> value were researched. Data were collected using a questionnaire which assessed the various dimensions of <b>perceived</b> risk. Since these dimensions provide a <b>perceived</b> risk measure, this measure was then used to assess <b>perceived</b> value and other service evaluation constructs. A model is suggested which shows the relationships between <b>perceived</b> risk, <b>perceived</b> value, satisfaction, and behavioural intentions. It was found that there is an average, and direct negative relationship between <b>perceived</b> risk and <b>perceived</b> value. Also, there is a strong, direct and positive relationship between <b>perceived</b> value and satisfaction, and an average, and direct positive relationship between <b>perceived</b> value and behavioural intentions. The relationships between <b>perceived</b> risk and satisfaction, <b>perceived</b> risk and behavioural intentions were found to be partially mediated by <b>perceived</b> value. Also, the effect of <b>perceived</b> value on behavioural intentions was found to be partially mediated by satisfaction. This thesis provides academics with a new conceptualisation and framework for further research into the <b>perceived</b> value concept. It demonstrates to marketing practitioners especially involved in planning, how <b>perceived</b> value can be used in strategic marketing planning. It particularly demonstrates to practitioners involved in control how non financial indicators can be used in control...|$|R
