60|$|But if {{the case}} were quite the contrary, if it were obvious to the casual {{experience}} of the American traveller or sojourner in England, that his nationality was now liked less rather than more there, I should still be sorry to disturb what is at the worst no worse than a fond illusion. The case {{is by no means}} the contrary, and yet in consenting to some reason in the iridescence which the situation wears in the American fancy I should wish to distinguish. For a beginning I should not wish to go farther than to say that the sort of Englishmen who have always liked Americans, because they have liked the American ideal and the kind of character realized from it, now probably like them better than ever. They are indeed less critical of our departure from our old ideal than some Americans, perhaps because they have not foreseen, as such Americans have foreseen, the necessary effect in American character. They can still allow themselves the pleasure which comes from being confirmed in an impression by events, and in that pleasure they may somewhat romance us; but even such Englishmen are not blindly fond of us. The other sort of Englishmen, the sort that never liked our ideal or our character, probably now like us as little as ever, except as they have noted our change of ideal, and expect a change of character. To them we may very well have seemed a sort of civic dissenters, with the implication of some such quality of offence as the notion of dissent suggests to minds like theirs. We had a political religion like their own, with a hierarchy, a ritual, an establishment all complete, and we violently broke with it. But it is safe to conjecture that this sort of Englishman is too old or too old-fashioned to live much longer; he suffers with the decay of certain English interests which the American prosperity imperilled before it began to imperil English ideals, if it has indeed done so. His dying out counts for an increase of favor for us; we enjoy through it a sort of <b>promotion</b> <b>by</b> <b>seniority.</b>|$|E

5000|$|When {{the role}} of {{infantry}} colonel general was abolished in 1661, the mestre de camp took the title of colonel. The cavalry regiments, on the other hand, remained {{under the authority of}} a colonel general, were commanded individually by mestres de camp until the French Revolution. Like the rank of captain, the rank of mestre de camp was [...] "vénale", that is, it could be purchased and/or handed on to another man without hindrance. Consequently, precocious rejects from the high aristocracy could accede to the rank {{at a very young age}} and thus be in a good position to obtain <b>promotions</b> (<b>by</b> <b>seniority)</b> to the rank of brigadier.|$|R

Barrington wished young officers who wanted preferment to buy, or await <b>promotion</b> <b>by</b> <b>seniority.</b> Burgoyne's friend and mentor, Barrington retained office but only until December 1778, when the Rockingham whigs resumed majority control in the Commons. In 1759 Burgoyne had threatened him; Barrington responded [...] "with the House of Commons, in case i am, what you call partial against you...the least courtly letter that was ever written to a Secretary at War." [...] Barrington raised more regiments and increased the places at Old Chelsea Hospital for wounded men. Wages improved slightly, and more compassion was shown after battle; developments that dovetailed with the career of Marquis of Granby. Hospital Board Surgeon Mates were introduced, and an Inspector of Infirmaries was appointed overseer. Ending the practice of in commendam holding every second corps in reserve because it was ruinous to finances exemplified his public policy credentials of saving graces, but critics thought it left England dangerously exposed to invasion from the continent. But more aptly was his fear of domestic unruliness and disorder. Perennial riots was an habitual occurrence on London streets: ...|$|E
500|$|Of the 164 {{graduates}} in the class, 102 (62 percent) served overseas during World War I before the armistice of 11 November 1918, although only 56 (34 percent) saw actual combat. This was not unusual; nearly 60 {{percent of the}} Army's regular officers did not serve overseas. A widespread belief that those who had served overseas would receive preferential treatment, including faster promotion, was not borne out <b>by</b> subsequent events. <b>Promotion</b> was <b>by</b> <b>seniority,</b> and glacially slow. Officers commissioned between November 1916 and November 1918 made up 55.4 percent of the Army's officers in 1926. This [...] "hump" [...] constituted a major personnel problem that was solved only by the Army's rapid expansion after 1940 in response to World War II.

European troops were organized into companies and <b>promotion</b> was fixed <b>by</b> <b>seniority.</b> A judge advocate was appointed for court martial, proper military training was imparted and free rations were sanctioned. He raised the first few companies of Indian soldiers, called ‘Native Sepoys’ trained and equipped in English style. Though drilled and trained in English style, the Native Sepoy however, lived, ate and cooked apart. These sepoys had their own officers called Subedars, though under overall control of English. The first batch of British Royal Troops, which arrived in India in August 1748, had Irish and Scottish troops who were [...] "rebels, deserters and highwayman pardoned on condition of enlistment", with the army and service in India.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of infantry battalion {{commanders in the}} First World War progressed from a pre-war system based mainly on <b>promotion</b> <b>by</b> <b>seniority</b> to one largely based on merit. It remained a weighted process, however, favouring the professional officer, particularly {{during the first two}} years, and biased against the Territorial. The quality of the pre-war officer appears higher than has been estimated. Average command lasted 8. 5 months. Eleven per cent of COs were killed, ten per cent promoted, and 18 per cent invalided. The army practised quality control, removing 38 per cent from command, although reduction in removals as the war progressed indicates a refinement of quality. The army committed itself to professional development, teaching technical aspects of the CO role, as well as command and leadership. Citizens of 1914 with no previous military experience rose to command, this progress taking on average three years. Despite the social opening-up of the officer corps, these men tended to be from the professional class. By The Hundred Days, infantry battalion commanders were a mix of professional soldiers, pre-war auxiliaries and citizens - younger, fitter and richly experienced; many being quick thinkers, self-assured, and endowed with great personal courage and well-developed tactical ability...|$|E
40|$|The 10 th {{anniversary of}} Soeharto's {{resignation}} was coloured by disappointment with the slowness of reform, {{and with the}} government's reluctance to confront blatant religious intolerance. Nevertheless, economic growth is strong and investment spending buoyant. Inflation has risen well above target, suggesting that a more effective approach to monetary policy is needed. The recent surge in global rice prices coincided with bountiful domestic harvests, putting the government under pressure to restrict rice exports rather than imports {{as it has in}} recent years. However, restricting exports has been recognised as a 'starve thy neighbour policy', and the ASEAN trade ministers have jointly agreed 'to continue fair trade practices and to achieve an orderly regional rice trade'. The government has at last increased domestic fuel prices significantly, mind-ful of the waste of valuable resources and the inequity involved in keeping such prices constant in the face of world price increases. It will implement a cash transfer program to compensate the poor for the resulting increase in living costs. The Ministry of Finance is leading reform of the central government bureaucracy. Its most fundamental initiatives are in human resource management, where it is attempting to match remuneration to skill requirements and responsibilities, and to align the pay structure more closely with that in the private sector-with pay rates rising much more rapidly than hitherto as levels of responsibility increase. It is also encouraging competition to fill vacancies by advertising them internally, rather than continuing to rely on <b>promotion</b> <b>by</b> <b>seniority.</b> At local government level, a small number of heads of government have gained a reputation as pioneers of reform. Two interviewed for this survey are exemplars of precisely what it was hoped would result from bringing government closer to the people through decentralisation, and from the switch to direct election of heads of local government. Both have considerable experience in the private sector, and their success seems related to their more entrepreneurial (as distinct from bureaucratic) way of thinking. 'Good corporate governance' has now become the mantra for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). It is recognised that this depends heavily on choosing the right people to manage each firm and to oversee it on behalf of its owner. Accordingly, almost all directors and commissioners of the 11 SOEs indirectly studied here have been replaced in recent months, and there is now a willingness to appoint professionals from private companies and from academia in order to gain access to needed skills. In addition, the initial selection of candidates has been shifted outside the bureaucracy to professional recruitment agencies. ...|$|E

50|$|The brevet conferred {{rank in the}} British Army overall, but importantly, not in the {{regiment}}. Advancement in {{the regiment}} could take place generally only by purchase (until 1871) or <b>by</b> <b>seniority,</b> and {{when there was a}} suitable vacancy (caused by the death, retirement or promotion of a more senior officer). For an officer on duty with his regiment, only regimental rank counted; if the regiment formed part of a larger formation then brevet rank could be used to determine command of temporary units formed for special purposes. In particular brigadier did not become a permanent rank until 1947, so command of brigades was determined <b>by</b> <b>seniority,</b> including <b>by</b> the date of promotion to any brevet rank. Thus it was possible for a regimental major to hold a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy with seniority over the commission of his own commanding officer as lieutenant-colonel and be given command of a brigade (potentially including his own regiment). Similarly, while the officer served in a staff position or as an aide-de-camp, then he could use his brevet rank. Appointment to a brevet also counted towards the requirement to have served for a sufficient time in a lower rank to be eligible for <b>promotion</b> (<b>by</b> purchase) to a more senior one.|$|R

50|$|As {{a senior}} captain, who had {{commanded}} detached squadrons, Wager was a logical {{choice for the}} Jamaica station. Appointed in January 1707, he left Spithead in the Expedition (70 guns) on 28 March and reached Jamaica on 22 June. A French squadron under Admiral Ducasse {{was known to be}} coming from Europe, and Wager's initial deployments were designed to gain intelligence of its arrival and protect trade. He learned in December that Ducasse had gone to Havana, far to leeward; thus the French squadron (ten of the line) could neither surprise Jamaica nor shield the galleons of the Spanish treasure fleet at the isthmus, and if those galleons were to follow their usual practice of returning to Cartagene de Indias before proceeding to Havana, Wager would have a chance to intercept them after they loaded Peruvian silver at Portobelo. The Expedition (70 guns), Kingston (60 guns), and Portland (50 guns) plus a fireship left Port Royal in time to attain, on 23 May 1708, a position about 36 miles west of Cartegena. There followed the action which was later called Wager's Action, in which one treasure ship was destroyed and one was captured, while the others escaped into Cartagena harbour. The proceeds of his capture meant that he returned to England a rich man. He also came home a rear-admiral, the <b>promotion</b> having occurred <b>by</b> <b>seniority</b> on 19 November 1707. His wealth stemmed chiefly from the silver on the captured galleon, its value estimated at over £60,000 in addition to his flag share of other prizes taken in the West Indies. The action against the galleons made him a hero and he was knighted on 8 December 1709. At Portsmouth he was nominated for a by-election to parliament and was elected on 23 January 1710.|$|R
