5000|$|Gas {{carbon arc}} welding (CAW-G) {{no longer has}} {{commercial}} significance. Other processes that use shielding gases have also replaced carbon-arc welding such as tungsten-arc welding (GTAW, or TIG), <b>plasma-arc</b> <b>welding</b> (PAW), and atomic-hydrogen welding (AHAW). Each of these processes, including carbon-arc welding, use a nonconsumable electrode. A filler metal is generally used to aid the bond in the workpieces.|$|E

Swirl ring contains four channels with angled exit holes to force gas to swirl as it flows out of torch past tip of electrode.

NASA technical memorandum recounts progress in art of variable-polarity <b>plasma-arc</b> (VPPA) <b>welding,</b> {{with emphasis on}} welding of aluminum-alloy tanks.

40|$|The {{residual}} stress fields associated with variable-polarity <b>plasma-arc</b> (VPPA) <b>welds</b> in 2024 -T 351 aluminum alloy plates have been measured nondestructively using neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Neutron diffraction allows in-depth {{measurements of the}} full strain tensor {{to be made in}} thick components; synchrotron X-rays allow for rapid measurements of strains inside components, although their penetration is less than that of the neutrons and constraints arising from the diffraction geometry generally lead to only two strain components being easily measurable. Hence, {{a combination of the two}} techniques, applied as described herein, is ideal for a detailed nondestructive evaluation of {{residual stress}}es in plates. The residual stresses in a 12 -mm-thick VPPA-welded aluminum 2024 -T 351 alloy plate have been measured using neutron diffraction. The stresses were then remeasured by a combination of neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction after the plate had been reduced in thickness (or, skimmed) to 7 mm by machining both sides of the weld, mimicking the likely manufacturing operation, should such welds be used in aerospace structures. A strong tensile residual stress field was measured in the longitudinal direction, parallel to the weld, in both the as-welded and skimmed specimens. There was only a slight modification of the residual stress state on skimming...|$|R
40|$|Tool aids in {{alignment}} of oscillator probe on variable-polarity <b>plasma-arc</b> <b>welding</b> torch. Probe magnetically pulls arc {{from side to}} side as it moves along joint. Tensile strength of joint depends on {{alignment of}} weld bead and on alignment of probe. Operator installs new tool on front of torch body, levels it with built-in bubble glass, inserts probe in slot on tool, and locks probe in place. Procedure faster and easier and resulting alignment more accurate and repeatable...|$|E

Simple and lightweight; readily moved along weld path in synchronism with torch. Because it concentrates inert gas where needed, consumes gas at relatively low rate, and not necessary to monitor oxygen content of protective atmosphere. Apparatus does not obscure view of root side of weld. Used for full-penetration <b>plasma-arc</b> <b>welding</b> of such reactive metals as aluminum/lithium alloys and titanium...|$|E
30|$|An {{extended}} {{study of}} the potential of schlieren imaging has been performed by Siewert et al. [93]. The effect of several different solutions, such as different knife-edge orientations and choices of light source, are presented for GTAW, GMAW and <b>plasma-arc</b> <b>welding.</b> A recent work by Bitharas et al. [112] investigated the effect of varying {{the composition of the}} shield gas by an alternating Ar-He supply during a 100 A GTAW process. They adopted a z-type schlieren setup and a 10, 000  lm LED source with a 633  nm bandpass filter and a vertical knife edge.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented on fatigue crack growth behavior and fail safety of integral stringer panels typified by welded aircraft fabrications. The stringer panel {{is made of}} aluminum alloy 2024 -T 351 and fabricated by the variable-polarity <b>plasma-arc</b> <b>welding</b> process. The sample simulates {{a part of the}} lower-wing skin structures. Based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics, numerical simulations are performed for two configurations, two-stringer and nine-stringer panels, and three damage scenarios, in which welding-induced longitudinal residual stresses are taken into account. A typical load spectrum for large transport aircraft is employed for the analysis. For the two-stringer panel life predictions have a reasonably good correlation with the test results. Based on this validation, large-scale nine-stringer panels with three manufacture options, that is, riveted, integrally machined, and welded integral, are simulated for a skin crack under a broken central stringer propagating to two-bay length. Useful comparisons are made among the three variants. Finally, remedies to improve damage tolerance and fail safety of integral stringer panels are explored. The incorporation of crack retarder straps bonded to the inner surface of an integral panel has greatly improved the fail safety behavior of the component with dramatically increased crack growth live...|$|E
