5|$|The {{position}} and rights of Scottish peers {{in relation to}} the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a <b>peer</b> of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a <b>peer</b> of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords unless he was a representative <b>peer,</b> even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish <b>peer</b> or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.|$|E

40|$|The Internet at the {{interdomain}} {{level is}} a complex network of approximately 50, 000 Autonomous Systems (ASes). ASes interconnect through two types of links: (a) transit (customer-provider) and (b) <b>peering</b> links. Recent {{studies have shown that}} despite being optional for most ASes, a rich and dynamic <b>peering</b> fabric exists among ASes. <b>Peering</b> has also grown as one of the main instruments for catching up with asymmetric traffic due to CDNs, online video traffic, performance requirements, etc. Moreover, <b>peering</b> has been in the spotlight recently because of <b>peering</b> conflicts between major ISPs and Content Providers. Such conflicts have led to calls for intervention by communication regulators and legislation {{at the highest levels of}} government. <b>Peering</b> disputes have also sometimes resulted in partitioning of the Internet. Despite the broad interest and intense debate about <b>peering,</b> several fundamental questions remain elusive. The objective of this thesis is to study <b>peering</b> from a techno-economics perspective. We explore the following questions: 1 - What are the main sources of complexity in Internet <b>peering</b> that defy the development of an automated approach to assess <b>peering</b> relationships? 2 - What is the current state of the <b>peering</b> ecosystem, e. g., which categories of ASes are more inclined towards <b>peering?</b> What are the most popular <b>peering</b> strategies among ASes in the Internet? 3 - What can we say about the economics of contemporary <b>peering</b> practices, e. g., what is the impact of using different <b>peering</b> traffic ratios as a strategy to choose <b>peers?</b> Is the general notion that <b>peering</b> saves network costs, always valid? 4 - Can we propose novel methods for <b>peering</b> that result in more stable and fair <b>peering</b> interconnections? We have used game-theoretic modeling, large-scale computational agent-based modeling, and analysis of publicly available <b>peering</b> data to answer the above questions. The main contributions of this thesis include: 1 - Identification of fundamental complexities underlying the evaluation of <b>peers</b> and formation of stable <b>peering</b> links in the interdomain network. 2 - An empirical study of the state of the <b>peering</b> ecosystem from August 2010 to August 2013. 3 - Development of a large-scale agent-based computational model to study the formation and evolution of Internet <b>peering</b> interconnections. 4 - A plausible explanation for the gravitation of Internet transit providers towards Open <b>peering</b> and a prediction of its future consequences. 5 - We propose a variant of the Open <b>peering</b> policy and a new policy based on cost-benefit analysis to replace the contemporary simplistic policies.

It builds on historical research by Gould, Biagioli, Spier, and Rip. The first <b>Peer</b> Review Congress met in 1989. Over time, the fraction of papers devoted to <b>peer</b> review has steadily declined, suggesting that as a field of sociological study, it has been replaced by more systematic studies of bias and errors. In parallel with 'common experience' definitions based on the study of <b>peer</b> review as a 'pre-constructed process', some social scientists have looked at <b>peer</b> review without considering it as pre-constructed. Hirschauer proposed that journal <b>peer</b> review can be understood as reciprocal accountability of judgements among peers.
