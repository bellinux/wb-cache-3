Originally programmed for the Apple II, the Ultima series later became available on several platforms.

By the time he developed Ultima III, Garriott, together with his brother Robert, their father Owen and Chuck Bueche established their own video game publisher, Origin Systems, to handle publishing and distribution, in part due to controversy with Sierra over royalties for the PC port of Ultima II.|$|E
2500|$|The station's famous {{architectural}} {{features are}} the large glass-walled bridge {{that takes the}} station building over Argyle Street, nicknamed the 'Hielanman's Umbrella' (Highlandman's Umbrella) because it {{was used as a}} meeting place for highlanders living in the city; and the former ticket office and information building. This was a large oval building, with the booking office on the ground floor and the train information display for passengers on large <b>printed</b> <b>cloth</b> destination boards placed behind large windows on the first floor by a team of two men. Underneath the [...] "Umbrella" [...] are a number of shops and bars. The former nightclub, theatre, gallery and restaurant complex, The Arches, was also located below the station.|$|E

50|$|The cotton mills of Fall River {{had built}} their {{business}} largely {{on only one}} product: <b>print</b> <b>cloth.</b> About 1910, the city's largest employer, the American Printing Company (APC) employed 6,000 people, and was the largest printer of cotton cloth in the world. Dozens of other city mills solely produced <b>print</b> <b>cloth</b> to be <b>printed</b> at the APC. The city's industry truly had all its eggs in one, very large basket.|$|R
40|$|A novel flame {{retardant}} diethyl 4 -methylpiperazin- 1 -ylphosphoramidate (CN- 3) containing phosphorous and nitrogen was prepared. Its chemical structure {{was confirmed by}} nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-, 13 C-, and 31 P-NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. <b>Print</b> <b>cloth</b> and twill fabrics were treated with CN- 3 to achieve different levels of add-on (7 – 22 wt% add-ons for <b>print</b> <b>cloth</b> and 3 – 18 wt% add-ons for twill). Thermogravimetric analysis, vertical flame test, and limiting oxygen index (LOI) were performed on the treated cotton fabrics and showed promising results. When the treated <b>print</b> <b>cloth</b> and twill fabric samples were tested using the vertical flame test (ASTM D 6413 - 08), we observed that the ignited fabrics self-extinguished and left behind a streak of char. Treated higher add-ons fabrics were neither consumed by flame nor produced glowing ambers upon self-extinguishing. LOI (ASTM 2863 – 09) {{was used to determine}} the effectiveness of the {{flame retardant}} on the treated fabrics. LOI values increased from 18 vol% oxygen in nitrogen for untreated <b>print</b> <b>cloth</b> and twill fabrics to maximum of 28 and 31 wt% for the highest add-ons of <b>print</b> <b>cloth</b> and twill, respectively. The results from cotton fabrics treated with CN- 3 demonstrated a higher LOI value as well as a higher char yield because of the effectiveness of phosphorus and nitrogen as a flame retardant for cotton fabrics. Furthermore, FT-IR and SEM were used to characterize the chemical structure on the treated fabrics as well as the surface morphology of char areas of treated and untreated fabrics...|$|R

50|$|Starch always {{leaves the}} <b>printed</b> <b>cloth</b> {{somewhat}} harsh in feeling (unless modified carboxymethylated starches are used), but very dark colours can be obtained. Gum Senegal, gum arabic or modified guar gum thickening yield clearer and more even tints than does starch, suitable for lighter colours but less suited for very dark colours. (The gums apparently prevent the colours from combining fully with the fibers.) A printing stock solution {{is mostly a}} combination of modified starch and gum stock solutions.|$|E

50|$|The yellow jersey {{was made}} for decades, like all other cycling jerseys, from wool. No {{synthetic}} fibres existed which had both the warmth and the absorption of wool.

Riders added the name of the team for which they were riding or the professional team for which they normally rode (in the years when the Tour was for national rather than sponsored teams) by attaching a panel of <b>printed</b> <b>cloth</b> {{to the front of the}} jersey by pins.|$|E
5000|$|The Calico Printers' Association Ltd was a British textile company {{founded in}} 1899, from the {{amalgamation}} of 46 textile printing companies and 13 textile merchants.

Most of the leading companies in the industry decided to amalgamate in order [...] "to preserve the tradition and standing of calico printing and to produce textiles of a high standard at reasonable prices."

During colonization, the French {{did not attempt}} to supplant Islamic practices and were careful to respect the precedents of sharia as interpreted by the Shafi'i school of thought. All Muslim holidays are observed, including Id al-Adha, Muharram, Ashura, Mawlid, Laylat al-Mi'raj and Ramadan. Mawlid is marked by celebrations culminating in a feast prepared for the ulama. Many women wear the chirumani, a <b>printed</b> <b>cloth</b> worn around the body. Comorians often consult mwalimus or [...] and marabouts for healing and protection from jinn.

According to one tradition, Parvati is believed have performed her penance here. It used to be a place of worship for the followers of the Natha sect.
