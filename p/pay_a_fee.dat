5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1749, Benning Wentworth, New Hampshire's governor, was selling land grants {{in the area}} west of the Connecticut River, to which New Hampshire had always laid {{somewhat}} dubious claim. Many of these grants were sold at relatively low prices to land speculators, with some land kicked back to Wentworth. In 1764, King George issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York. New York, which had also issued land grants that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> to New York to have their grants validated. As this fee approached the original purchase price, {{and many of the}} holders were land-rich and cash-poor, {{there was a great deal}} of resistance to this demand. By 1769 the situation in the Grants had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.|$|E
40|$|Agents {{with more}} {{experience}} make better choices. We measure learning dynamics using a panel with four million monthly credit card statements. We study add-on fees, specifically cash advance, late payment, and overlimit fees. New credit card accounts generate fee payments of $ 15 per month. Through negative feedback — i. e. <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> — consumers learn to avoid triggering future <b>fees.</b> <b>Paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> last month reduces {{the likelihood of}} <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> in the current month by about 40 %. Controlling for account fixed effects, monthly fee payments fall by 75 % {{during the first three}} years of account life. We find that learning is not monotonic. Knowledge effectively depreciates about 10 % per month, implying that learning displays a strong recency effect...|$|R
