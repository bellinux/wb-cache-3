40|$|The thesis {{targeted}} on {{the area}} of modernization of customs clearance in the EU and the Czech Republic {{is focused on the}} specification of the systems and procedures used in the modernization of customs clearance when the electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> is used. Mainly about the status of transition from the paper declaration to the electronic paperless <b>customs</b> <b>declaration,</b> not only in the Czech Republic but throughout the European Union. Assessment data is carried out primarily for the period between the years 2012 to 2014, in some cases, for better assessments, in the period between the years 2009 to 2014. The thesis is focused on the evaluation of the situation with modernisation the customs clearance in the Czech Republic and comparing the results between chosen EU member states and the Czech Republic. The usage of the electronic Entry Summary Declarations and Exit Summary Declarations have increased several times in last two years. Implementation of systems for lodgement and processing of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> for more effective and efficient control of goods within the EU member states has also very fast growing trend with very low error rate. The rate of electronically lodged <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> is reaching in most of the EU member states almost 100 %. Numbers of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> lodged within the simplified procedures in chosen EU member states is more or less stable.

If the member's irises are not on file, or the NEXUS machines are not working, NEXUS members may use the Special Services desk. NEXUS members entering Canada must still fill out a <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> card. NEXUS allows travelers flying from many Canadian airports, even on domestic flights, to bypass the regular security screening line and use an expedited trusted traveler line.|$|R

40|$|Government {{involvement}} {{is the main}} cause for the EDI acceptance in Southeast Asian countries (United Nation of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific - UNESCAP, 1996). This is {{significantly different from the}} EDI developments in the western countries in which private sector involvement in EDI is substantial (UNESCAP, 1996). As an initial step to spur EDI implementation in private sector, the Malaysian Government has imposed all companies that engage in international trade to implement EDI by doing electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> through CIS (<b>Customs</b> Information System) DagangNet. For this, the Government also spent over RM 300 million to fully implement EDI nationwide (Star, 2003 December 3). Nevertheless, such implementation is not successful and it has been claimed that “EDI is not yet fully implemented even though it had been initiated since late 1990 s, besides electronic data is also still not recognized for legal <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> purposes even if it was meant for paperless and electronic customs declarations” (Star, 2003 December 3). To date, there are dual <b>customs</b> <b>declarations,</b> both electronic and manual, in practices where the sole typical electronic transaction is registration of the customs form (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11). This is in contrast with electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> by other countries such as Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore where there is a full electronic declaration including electronic payment for declarations charges (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11; Chau, 2001) ...|$|R

5000|$|The USPS treats mail to {{and from}} the {{associated}} states as domestic mail, (as of November 19, 2007, after a 23-month period of being treated as international mail). Incoming mail does require <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> because, like some U.S. territories, the associated states are outside the main customs territory of the United States.|$|R
5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an import declaration form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and <b>customs</b> <b>declaration.</b> For example, the form many require an Hs code (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage to clear goods through customs.|$|R

Almost half of the border follows the rivers Anarjohka and Tana.|$|R
