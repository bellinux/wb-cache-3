5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American <b>Plate</b> <b>is</b> accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda <b>Plate</b> <b>is</b> converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E
5|$|Because it hardens {{platinum}} and palladium alloys, ruthenium is used {{in electrical}} contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability. With similar properties and lower cost than rhodium, electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium. The <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> applied to the base by electroplating or sputtering.|$|E
5|$|In {{physics and}} fluid mechanics, a Blasius {{boundary}} layer (named after Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius) describes the steady two-dimensional {{laminar boundary layer}} that forms on a semi-infinite plate which is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow. Falkner and Skan later generalized Blasius' solution to wedge flow (Falkner–Skan boundary layer), i.e. flows in which the <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> not parallel to the flow.|$|E

Using the apparatus of Figure 1, the potential across the charged plates of the rotary capacitor is observed to decrease as the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> overlapped (or increase as the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> separated), indicating that the capacitance increases as the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> overlapped and decreases as the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> separated...|$|R

5|$|Other {{volcanic}} activity {{occurred in the}} region farther east, on Hardy Peninsula and some surrounding capes and islands during the Miocene; potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 18 and 21 million years ago. These volcanic systems may indicate that the Antarctic <b>Plate</b> <b>is</b> subducting beneath the Scotia Plate.|$|E

5|$|The humeral <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> {{usually a}} small {{sclerite}} on the anterior {{margin of the}} wing base, movable and articulated with {{the base of the}} costal vein.

5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the ventral scales. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales are twice {{as wide as the}} ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E

5|$|Preceding {{an atomic}} line filter {{may be a}} collimator, which {{straightens}} incident light rays for passing {{through the rest of}} the filter consistently; however, collimated light is not always necessary. After the collimator, a high-pass filter blocks almost half of the incoming light (that of too long a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first polarizing <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> used here to block light.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide {{is used in}} {{carborundum}} printmaking – a collagraph printmaking technique. Carborundum grit {{is applied}} in a paste {{to the surface of}} an aluminium plate. When the paste is dry, ink is applied and trapped in its granular surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. The ink <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for intaglio printmaking. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.|$|E
5|$|Subduction of the Nazca Plate {{beneath the}} South America <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} for most of the volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone. After activity in the western Maricunga Belt volcanic arc ceased six million years ago, volcanism started up in the Incapillo region, forming the high volcanoes Monte Pissis, Cerro Bonete Chico and Sierra de Veladero. Later, a number of lava domes formed between these volcanoes.|$|E

5|$|The interorbital {{region is}} 4.14mm {{long and the}} {{zygomatic}} <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> 2.38mm. The diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars is 6.39mm long. The incisive foramina are 5.25mm long and 1.77mm broad. The palatal bridge (the portion of the palate between the incisive foramina and the mesopterygoid fossa behind {{the back end of}} the palate) is 4.29mm long and 2.75mm broad at the first molars. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long and M1 is 1.19mm broad. These measurements make J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Java {{is the most}} densely {{populated}} island on earth, and is vulnerable to both large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, due to its location near the Sunda Trench, a convergent plate boundary where the Australian tectonic <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> subducting beneath Indonesia. Three great earthquakes occurred {{in the span of}} three years to the northwest on the Sumatra portion of the trench. The 2004 M9.15 Sumatra–Andaman, the 2005 M8.7 Nias–Simeulue, and the 2007 M8.4 Mentawai earthquakes produced the largest release of elastic strain energy since the 1957/1964 series of shocks on the Aleutian/Alaska Trench.|$|E

50|$|Industrial {{hot plates}} which {{incorporate}} a porous heated <b>plate</b> <b>are</b> {{referred to as}} heated chucks.

5|$|The next {{component}} in an atomic line filter is the vapor cell; this {{is common to}} all atomic line filters. It either absorbs and re-emits the incident light, or rotates its polarization by the Faraday or Voigt effect. Following the vapor cell is a low-pass filter, designed to block all of the light that the first filter did not, except the designated frequency of light which came from the fluorescence. In Faraday and Voigt filters, a second polarizing <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> used here.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic <b>plate,</b> <b>is</b> small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the motor end <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> depleted. In LEMS, this decrease {{is larger than}} observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E

50|$|At this point, the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> {{covered in}} scale and {{therefore}} must be pickled. This involves dipping the plates in sulfuric acid for five minutes.
