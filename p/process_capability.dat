The evaluation of knowledge management infrastructure capabilities and knowledge management <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> has become important since it provides a reference for directing the private higher education institutions to enhance their organizational performance. The Islamic work ethics may have a moderating effect {{on the relationship between}} knowledge management infrastructure <b>capabilities,</b> knowledge management <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> and organizational performance. This paper provides an understanding of relationship between knowledge management infrastructure <b>capabilities,</b> knowledge management <b>process</b> <b>capabilities,</b> organizational performance and the Islamic work ethics. Additionally, it provides a new framework that helps the private higher education institutions to assess their knowledge management infrastructure <b>capabilities,</b> knowledge management <b>process</b> <b>capabilities,</b> organizational performance and the Islamic work ethics. The research findings showed that the level of knowledge management infrastructure and <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> at the private higher education institutions was high, and indicated that the knowledge management <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> had a positive significant causal effect relationship with organizational performance, however the research findings showed that the relationship between knowledge management infrastructure capabilities with organizational performance had a non-significant causal effect.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that effective KM requires both infrastructural and <b>process</b> <b>capabilities.</b> However, very {{little research has}} been conducted to understand how either kind of capabilities are developed. In this paper, we focus on KM <b>process</b> <b>capabilities,</b> identify and empirically examine the important factors in that influence the development of KM <b>process</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Particularly, relying on the institutional theory and technology-task fit theory, we propose that KM <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> are driven by both organizational, i. e., leadership and organizational culture, and technological factors i. e., technology fit. An empirical study was then conducted with KM practitioners to validate the hypotheses. On the theoretical side, this study entangles the relationship between two KM capabilities proposed in (Gold, Malhotra, 2 ̆ 6 Segars, 2001). On the practical side, the results provide valuable guidelines for developing KM <b>process</b> <b>capabilities,</b> with a balance between both managerial and technical infrastructures...|$|R
5000|$|In process {{improvement}} efforts, the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> index or <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> ratio is a statistical measure of process capability: {{the ability of}} a process to produce output within specification limits. [...] The concept of <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> only holds meaning for processes that {{are in a state of}} statistical control. <b>Process</b> <b>capability</b> indices measure how much [...] "natural variation" [...] a process experiences relative to its specification limits and allows different processes to be compared with respect to how well an organization controls them.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> is a {{function}} of the specification, the <b>Process</b> <b>Capability</b> Index is only as good as the specification. For instance, if the specification came from an engineering guideline without considering the function and criticality of the part, a discussion around <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> is useless, and would have more benefits if focused on what are the real risks of having a part borderline out of specification. The loss function of Taguchi better illustrates this concept.|$|E

40|$|Inadequate cash {{resources}} resulting from poor cash flows {{have been among}} the fundamental causes of construction project failures. Despite the panoply of cash flow forecasting (CFF) tools, the cash flow performance of many construction firms have been reported to be poor due weak Cash flow forecasting (CFF) <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> influenced by a couple of organisational characteristics. Although these organisational characteristics have been reported to significantly influence firms’ CFF <b>process</b> <b>capabilities,</b> the underlying mechanisms of how these organisational features and characteristics exhibit their specific influences on the cash flow forecasting capabilities of construction firms still remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aims at empirically exploring the influence of some organisation characteristics on the CFF <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> of construction firms. Best practices in CFF identified from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Cash Flow Forecasting (CFF) guide were used to develop an assessment criteria used to assess the CFF capabilities of construction firms. The assessment was conducted through a questionnaire survey involving contracting organisations involved in both building and civil engineering works in Nigeria. The key best practices in CFF were ranked based on arithmetic mean value scores and averages were also determined {{for each of the four}} CFF components assessed (Knowledge and understanding CFF concepts and principles, Practical application, Practical considerations, and other Managerial issues). Hierarchical regression analysis was then used to examine the relationships between contractors’’ CFF <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> and some organisational characteristics. Results of the study reveals that organisational characteristics are strongly associated to firms’ abilities to prudently manage cash flows. The results of this study could serve as a basis for the strategic planning and improvement of Cash Flow Forecasting process by contractors in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} investigating digitally-enabled process innovations {{and their impact on}} business network performance. The key features of the model are its focus on innovation across business networks and the assumption that benefits of investments in IT are most likely to occur when mediated by innovations in related business <b>process</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The paper presents the model and its underlying rationale. In addition, it details how the model is being applied to a longitudinal examination of a digitally-enabled transformation within NMSDC- a business network for minorityowned suppliers in the U. S. Minority business enterprises (MBEs) face challenges and misconceptions regarding their size, owner ambition and sophistication, and business potential. These significant economic and social challenges continue to limit opportunities for MBE growth. The NMSDC, through its affiliated regional councils, exists to promote and coordinate MBEs supplying corporate members. Previously, these matchmaking opportunities were coordinated in non-standard fashion by the regional councils with little transparency. The ongoing investigation is situated within Open Systems, Inc. and its development of a standardized IT platform (called the National Affiliate Portal – or NAP) sponsored by the NMSDC and implemented in the 39 regional councils across the US. The paper shows how the proposed model is applied to answer the following research questions in the context of NMSDC: a) How are <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> of regional councils impacted by information technology (IT) use? b) How do <b>process</b> <b>capabilities</b> impact business network performance in terms of matchmaking opportunities...|$|R
