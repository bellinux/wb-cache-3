5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral <b>patterning.</b> Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic <b>patterning,</b> toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive <b>patterning</b> is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive <b>patterning,</b> however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E

5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive <b>patterning)</b> {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern.

It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of {{the most}} reliable dates, due to the use of radiocarbon dating on volcanic ash deposits, as well as {{some of the}} earliest MSA sites.

Central Africa reflects similar <b>patterning</b> to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region is certainly required.|$|E

40|$|The <b>patterns</b> {{that are}} here {{are part of the}} larger {{collection}} of <b>patterns</b> by many authors on <b>Pattern</b> Mining. These are <b>patterns</b> that I’ve used repeatedly.

Also thanks to Michael Weiss for shepherding these <b>patterns.</b> Background Many of the <b>patterns</b> here are related to building a “language”. What I mean in this paper by “language ” is a group of <b>patterns</b> that work together to solve a larger problem. They work together by a <b>pattern</b> B resolving the new problems introduced by applying the solution to problem A. For example the <b>patterns</b> from <b>Patterns</b> for Fault Tolerant Software [Han 07] Riding over Transients and Leaky Bucket Counter work together {{to solve the problem of}} dealing with transient faults. Riding Over Transients offers the general strategy but leaves the problem “how do I implement that ” which Leaky Bucket counter then solves. Because many of the <b>patterns</b> here talk about the relationship between <b>patterns,</b> I find it useful to talk about the upper <b>pattern</b> and the lower <b>pattern.</b> An upper <b>pattern</b> will have a lower letter (A<B<…<Z) than the lower <b>pattern.</b> The upper <b>pattern</b> is the first <b>pattern</b> that you encounter when using the set of <b>patterns,</b> ultimately it leaves some force unresolved which leads to the need for the lower <b>pattern.</b> Lower <b>patterns</b> resolve issues left by the upper <b>patterns.</b> The lower <b>pattern</b> “follows ” the upper <b>pattern.</b> I’ll draw this relationship like this: At the boundaries of the language there are <b>patterns</b> that are one sided.

5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; rather, it is a two-way street. The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on the ER membrane facilitate feedback regulation coordinated by MAM function. In particular, the clearance of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal <b>patterning</b> of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to reload the ER with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ efflux at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; rather it helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E
