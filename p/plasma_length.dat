30|$|The {{effect of}} the signal {{frequency}} on the <b>plasma</b> jet <b>length</b> and shape {{can be explained by}} the variation of the spatiotemporal distribution of ions. As ions are heavier than electrons, when the signal frequency increases over 20  kHz, they cannot follow the signal variation and then become more static. They concentrate in the middle of the discharge area and the gas flow can project them farther, inducing an increase of the <b>plasma</b> jet <b>length.</b> This expansion of the <b>plasma</b> jet <b>length</b> is mainly due to an increase of the core length and in a smaller amount to that of the tail zone.|$|R

This energy doubling occurred in a plasma only 85 �cm-long with a density of � 2. 6 x 10 17 �e- /cm- 3. This milestone {{is the result of}} systematic measurements that show the scaling of the energy gain with <b>plasma</b> <b>length</b> and density, and show the reproducibility and the stability of the acceleration process. We show that the energy gain increases linearly with <b>plasma</b> <b>length</b> from 13 to 31 �cm. These are key steps toward the application of beamdriven plasma accelerators or plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) to doubling the energy of a future linear collider without doubling its length...|$|E

40|$|A {{plasma source}} was {{developed}} at UCLA for planned underdense plasma lens experiments, where the plasma density {{is less than}} the electron beam density. The argon plasma, produced by a discharge between a LaB 6 cathode at 1330 C and a tantalum anode, is conned by a solenoidal magnetic eld and ows transversely across the electron beam path. Extensive test of the plasma source is under way for various conditions before it is assembled with the UCLA photocathode-based electron linac. In particular, dierent longitudinal (with respect to the electron beam) plasma proles and eective <b>plasma</b> <b>lengths</b> can be obtained by adjusting the moveable sliding door between the plasma source and the transverse beamline.

40|$|Stimulated Brillouin {{backscattering}} (SBBS) from a short-pulse laser, {{where the}} pulse length is short {{compared to the}} <b>plasma</b> <b>length,</b> {{is found to be}} qualitatively different than in the long pulse regime, where the pulse length is long compared to the <b>plasma</b> <b>length.</b> We find that after an initial transient of order the laser pulse length transit time, the instability reaches a steady state in the variables x{prime} = x {minus} V{sub g}t, t{prime} = t, where V{sub g} is the pulse group velocity. In contrast, SBBS in a long pulse can be absolutely unstable and grows indefinitely, or until nonlinearities intervene. We find that the motion of the laser pulse induces Doppler related effects that substantially modify the backscattered spectrum at higher intensities, where the instability is strongly coupled (i. e., has a growth rate large compared to the ion acoustic frequency) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Plasma sources with {{multiple}} electrodes {{have been developed}} and characterized in this research for atomic emission spectroscopy. Multi-electrode plasma sources use electrodes to shape the plasma in order to continuously entrain a sample stream {{in the center of}} hot plasma, {{in a manner similar to}} an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source. By changing the electrode spacings, the residence time can be readily adjusted even during plasma operation. Fora 25 -mm <b>plasma</b> <b>length,</b> a relatively long residence time of the analyte species (23 msec) in the plasma was calculated, indicating sufficient time for desolvation, vaporization, and atomization of the sample. For a 30 -mm <b>plasma</b> <b>length,</b> the interference effect of either phosphate or aluminum on calcium emission at 393. 37 nm is insignificant over the entire vertical region of the plasma. The effect of an easily ionized element (EIE) is to generally enchance Ca(II) emission in the lower regions, and to depress the emission in the higher regions in the plasma, which is in general agreement with observations in an ICP. Under an assumption of local thermal equilibrium (LTE), the Fe excitation temperature and the electron number density in the center of the plasma at 8 mm above the top of the quartz tube are 5000 K and 1. 0 x 10 ¹⁵ cm⁻³ for a 30 -mm plasma. When current, gas flow rate, and <b>plasma</b> <b>length</b> are varied, the spatial emission profiles reflect many of the characteristics associated with an ICP.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model for laser-plasma interaction during the oblique incidence by an ultrashort ultraintense p-polarized laser on a solid-density plasma is proposed. Both the resonant absorption and not-so-resonant absorption are self-consistently included. Different {{from the previous}} theoretical works, the physics of resonant absorption {{is found to be}} valid in more general conditions as the steepening of the electron density profile is considered. Even for a relativistic intensity laser, resonant absorption can still exist under certain <b>plasma</b> scale <b>length.</b> For shorter <b>plasma</b> scale <b>length</b> or higher laser intensity, the not-so-resonant absorption tends to be dominant, since the electron density is steepened to a critical level by the ponderomotive force. The laser energy absorption rates for both mechanisms are discussed in detail, and the difference and transition between these two mechanisms are presented. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

Analysis, aided by particle-in-cell simulations, as well as experiments with various <b>plasma</b> <b>lengths</b> and densities, indicate that tailoring {{the length of the}} accelerator, together with loading of the accelerating structure with beam, is the key to production of mono-energetic electron beams. Increasing the energy towards a GeV and beyond will require reducing the plasma density and design criteria are discussed for an optimized accelerator module.

Recent results on laser guiding of relativistically intense beams in preformed plasma channels are discussed. The observation of mono-energetic beams in the 100 MeV energy range, produced by a channel guided LWFA at LBNL, is described and compared to results obtained in the unguided case at LOA, RAL and LBNL.

This question is addressed by numerical simulations. The optimum shape of the beams, required <b>plasma</b> <b>length,</b> achievable energy gain, and energy spread are found as functions of the plasma density and parent beam characteristics.

40|$|A {{series of}} laser wake field {{accelerator}} experiments leading to electron energy exceeding 1 GeV are described. Theoretical concepts and experimental methods developed while conducting experiments using the 10 TW Ti:Sapphire laser at UCLA were implemented and transferred successfully to the 100 TW Callisto Laser System at the Jupiter Laser Facility at LLNL. To reach electron energies greater than 1 GeV with current laser systems, {{it is necessary}} to inject and trap electrons into the wake and to guide the laser for more than 1 cm of plasma. Using the 10 TW laser, the physics of self-guiding and the limitations in regards to pump depletion over cm-scale plasmas were demonstrated. Furthermore, a novel injection mechanism was explored which allows injection by ionization at conditions necessary for generating electron energies greater than a GeV. The 10 TW results were followed by self-guiding at the 100 TW scale over cm <b>plasma</b> <b>lengths.</b> The energy of the self-injected electrons, at 3 x 10 {sup 18 } cm{sup - 3 } plasma density, was limited by dephasing to 720 MeV.
