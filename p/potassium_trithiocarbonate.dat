40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} research {{to determine the}} effects of <b>potassium</b> <b>trithiocarbonate</b> (KTTC), a degradation product of potassium ethylxanthate (KEX), on flotation of chalcopyrite and molybdenite. Small amounts of KTTC were identified in fresh and aged solutions of KEX using thin-layer chromotography. Hallimond tube flotation tests on pure minerals showed that KTTC acts as a weak collector for chalcopyrite. Both KEX and KTTC tend to depress molybdenite, but the depression effect is easily overcome by addition of a small quantity of fuel oil. The results of the Hallimond tube tests were confirmed in batch flotation tests using a porphyry copper ore...|$|E
