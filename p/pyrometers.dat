2500|$|In {{determining}} melting {{points of}} a refractory substance by this method, {{it is necessary}} to either have black body conditions or to know the emissivity of the material being measured. The containment of the high melting material in the liquid state may introduce experimental difficulties. Melting temperatures of some refractory metals have thus been measured by observing the radiation from a black body cavity in solid metal specimens that were much longer than they were wide. To form such a [...] cavity, a hole is drilled perpendicular to the long axis {{at the center of a}} rod of the material. These rods are then heated by passing a very large current through them, and the radiation emitted from the hole is observed with an optical pyrometer. The point of melting is indicated by the darkening of the hole when the liquid phase appears, destroying the black body conditions. Today, containerless laser heating techniques, combined with fast <b>pyrometers</b> and spectro-pyrometers, are employed to allow for precise control of the time for which the sample is kept at extreme temperatures. Such experiments of sub-second duration address several of the challenges associated with more traditional melting point measurements made at very high temperatures, such as sample vaporization and reaction with the container.|$|E
50|$|To {{get around}} these difficulties, the ratio or two-color {{pyrometer}} was developed. They {{rely on the}} fact that Planck's law, which relates temperature to the intensity of radiation emitted at individual wavelengths, can be solved for temperature if Planck's statement of the intensities at two different wavelengths is divided. This solution assumes that the emissivity is the same at both wavelengths and cancels out in the division. This is known as the gray body assumption. Ratio <b>pyrometers</b> are essentially two brightness <b>pyrometers</b> in a single instrument. The operational principles of the ratio <b>pyrometers</b> were developed in the 1920s and 1930s, and they were commercially available in 1939.|$|E

40|$|A multiwavelength <b>pyrometer</b> was {{developed}} for applications unique to aerospace environments. It was {{shown to be a}} useful and versatile technique for measuring temperature, even when the emissivity is unknown. It has also been used to measure the surface temperatures of ceramic zircomia thermal barrier coatings and alumina. The close agreement between <b>pyrometer</b> and thin film thermocouple temperatures provided an independent check. Other applications of the multiwavelength <b>pyrometer</b> are simultaneous surface and bulk temperature measurements of a transparent material, and combustion gas temperature measurement using a special probe interfaced to the multiwavelength <b>pyrometer</b> via an optical fiber. The multiwavelength <b>pyrometer</b> determined temperature by transforming the radiation spectrum in a broad wavelength region to produce a straight line (in a certain spectral region), whose intercept in the vertical axis gives the temperature. Implicit in a two-color <b>pyrometer</b> is the assumption of wavelength independent emissivity. Though the two data points of a two-color <b>pyrometer</b> similarly processed would result immediately in a similar straight line to give the unknown temperature, the two-color <b>pyrometer</b> lacks the greater data redundancy of the multiwavelength <b>pyrometer,</b> which enables it to do so with improved accuracy. It also confirms that emissivity is indeed wavelength independent, as evidenced by a multitude of the data lying on a simple straight line. The multiwavelength <b>pyrometer</b> was also used to study the optical transmission properties of a nanostructured material from which a quadratic exponential functional frequency dependence of its spectral transmission was determined. Finally, by operating the multiwavelength <b>pyrometer</b> in a very wide field of view mode, the surface temperature distribution of a large hot surface was obtained through measurement of just a single radiation spectrum...|$|R
25|$|Consider {{the case}} of using gold as the source (mp = 1063°C). In this technique, the current through the {{filament}} of the <b>pyrometer</b> is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the primary calibration temperature and can be {{expressed in terms of}} current through the <b>pyrometer</b> lamp. With the same current setting, the <b>pyrometer</b> is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An absorbing medium of known transmission is inserted between the <b>pyrometer</b> and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the <b>pyrometer</b> filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck's Law. The absorbing medium is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the <b>pyrometer.</b> This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding <b>pyrometer</b> filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.|$|R

Application of the <b>pyrometer</b> has also included simultaneous surface and bulk temperature measurement in a transparent material, the measurement of combustion gas temperatures in the flames of an atmospheric burner, the measurement of the temperature distribution appearing on a large surface from the recording of just a single radiation spectrum emitted from this nonuniform temperature surface, and the measurement of some optical properties for special aeronautical materials-such as nanostructured layers.
