The adsorptive behavior of S. mutans JBP to <b>pellicles</b> formed from saliva or saliva-GTF mixtures was strikingly {{different from that of}} S. sobrinus 6715. S. mutans JBP adsorbed in higher numbers to <b>pellicles</b> formed from whole or submandibular saliva than to buffer-treated hydroxyapatite under the assay conditions used, in which blocking with albumin was used. In contrast, S. sobrinus 6715 attached in lower numbers and did not show enhanced adsorption to <b>pellicles</b> prepared from saliva. <b>Pellicles</b> prepared from the high-molecular-weight mucin fraction of submandibular saliva effectively promoted adsorption of S. mutans JBP, but none of the saliva fractions tested enhanced the attachment of S. sobrinus 6715 above the levels of buffer controls. Exposure of <b>pellicles</b> which contained GTF to sucrose to permit in situ synthesis of glucan markedly enhanced attachment of S. sobrinus 6715 but not attachment of S. mutans JBP. Also, the presence of sucrose throughout the adsorption period did not enhance attachment of S. mutans JBP. Both organisms possessed cell-associated GTF, and GTF preparations derived from S. sobrinus 6715 and Streptococcus sanguis FC- 1 behaved like GTF derived from S. mutans JBP. S. sobrinus 6715 attached in high numbers to dextran-treated hydroxyapatite, whereas S. mutans JBP did not. These observations suggest that S. mutans JBP cells possess an adhesin which binds to salivary components in the <b>pellicles.</b> In contrast, S. sobrinus 6715 cells appear to possess an adhesin which binds to glucan in the <b>pellicles.</b> Four additional strains of S. mutans and four additional strains of S. sobrinus behaved qualitatively like strains JBP and 6715, respectively, and thus the differences observed appear to be representative of these species.

40|$|A new {{procedure}} for mass isolation of pure <b>pellicles</b> containing intact basal bodies of Tetrahymena pyriformis is reported.

Adsorption of LY 7 cells was promoted by two groups of fractions. Each group was rechromatographed on DEAE-agarose. Fractions which promoted adsorption of LY 7 cells were found by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to contain the acidic proline-rich proteins (PRPs) and statherin. <b>Pellicles</b> prepared from 12 -micrograms/ml solutions of pure PRP- 1, PRP- 2, or parotid isoelectric focusing (PIF-slow) variant promoted maximal adsorption of A. viscosus LY 7 cells. Somewhat higher concentrations of PRP- 3 and PRP- 4 were required for maximal adsorption, indicating that the 44 -residue carboxy-terminal segment of PRP- 1, PRP- 2, and PIF-slow enhances LY 7 binding but is not essential. Much higher concentrations of statherin were required to promote LY 7 adsorption. Adsorption of LY 7 cells to <b>pellicles</b> prepared from PRP- 1 was not affected over the range of pH 5 to 8. Adsorption was also not inhibited by 50 mM lactose, which is consistent with the notion that type 1 fimbriae, rather than type 2 fimbriae, were responsible.

However, LY 7 cells adsorbed to [3 H]PRP- 1 <b>pellicles.</b> These data suggest that hidden molecular segments of PRP become exposed when the protein adsorbs to HA; these segments then react with adhesins of LY 7 cells.

[20] reported a post-processing immersion method to fabricate BC-CNT nanocomposites by immersing BC <b>pellicles</b> in CNT solutions. However, this method cannot work when the BC <b>pellicles</b> are thick. More importantly, {{in the case of}} GO, the post-processing immersion method might not be feasible for the preparation of BC/GO nanocomposites, since GO is much larger than CNT and thus cannot enter the inner structure of BC <b>pellicles.</b> In our previous studies, a one-pot in situ biosynthesis approach was developed, and a BC/GO nanocomposite with homogeneous GO nanosheets in a BC matrix was successfully fabricated [21]. The BC/GO nanocomposite (in a dry state) showed high mechanical properties and improved electrical conductivity, compared to those of the pristine BC. Unfortunately, neither post-processing immersion nor in situ biosynthesis could enable GO to penetrate the internal area of the BC network when the BC/GO hydrogel was thicker than 2  mm. Therefore, a great deal of effort is required to improve the uniform dispersion of GO in a 3 D integrated BC matrix, particularly when thick BC/GO products are required.|$|R
30|$|BC <b>pellicles</b> were cultured by Acetobacter xylinum BRC 5 in a Hestrin and Schramm {{medium for}} 14  days. The {{prepared}} BC hydrogel was purified {{in an aqueous}} 0.25  M NaOH (97.0 %, Daejung, Korea) solution and rinsed several times with pure distilled water. The neutralized BC hydrogel was then immersed in tert-butanol for 12  h at 60  °C. After freezing at −[*] 20  °C for 5  h, the BC <b>pellicles</b> were lyophilized at −[*] 45  °C and 4.5  Pa for 3  days. The resulting BC cryogels were treated thermally at 800 or 2400  °C in a graphite furnace under an Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 5  °C min− 1. The product HM-GNWs or HM-CNWs were stored in a vacuum oven at 30  °C.|$|R
