S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction analyses, with the <b>pressure</b> <b>fields</b> of the European for Medium Range Weather Forecasting and with the special analyses of the Gulf of Alaska Experiment One of the methods we use to derive the <b>pressure</b> <b>fields</b> utilizes a two-layer planetary boundary layer model iterative scheme that relates the wind vector to the surface wind vector, surface roughness, humidity, and effects and secondary flow. A second method involves the assumption of zero dimensional divergence, leading to a Poisson equation (the `balance equation') in pressure, with the wind field serving as a forcing function. The <b>pressure</b> <b>fields</b> computed from the SASS winds a two-layer PBL model closely approximate the and ECMWF fields. In some cases, the derived <b>pressure</b> <b>fields</b> can detect features not resolved in either the or ECMWF analyses. Balanced-pressure fields are much smoother and less well resolved than the PBL-model-derived or fields. Systematic differences between balanced <b>pressure</b> <b>fields</b> and the fields are attributed to the neglect of. horizontal divergence in the balance equation. The effect of stratification is found to produce a larger impact than secondary flow or thermal wind effects on the derived <b>pressure</b> <b>fields.</b> Inclusion of secondary flow tends to weaken both low and high pressure 2 centers whereas inclusion of stratification intensifies low centers and weakens high centers. 3 1.

500|$|Low-pressure systems, {{also known}} as cyclones, are located in minima in the <b>pressure</b> <b>field.</b> [...] Rotation is inward at the surface and {{counterclockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to inward and clockwise in the southern hemisphere due to the Coriolis force. Weather is normally unsettled {{in the vicinity of}} a cyclone, with increased cloudiness, increased winds, increased temperatures, and upward motion in the atmosphere, which leads to an increased chance of precipitation. Polar lows can form over relatively mild ocean waters when cold air sweeps in from the ice cap. The relatively warmer water leads to upward convection, causing a low to form, and precipitation usually in the form of snow. Tropical cyclones and winter storms are intense varieties of low pressure. Over land, thermal lows are indicative of hot weather during the summer.|$|E

[...] At Mach 3 cruising speed, the shock wave attached along the wing leading edge, preventing the high pressure behind the shock front from leaking up over the wing. The compression lift provided five percent of the total lift. The wing included inboard camber to more effectively use the higher <b>pressure</b> <b>field</b> behind the strong shock wave. Unique among aircraft of its size, the outer portions of the wings were hinged, and could be pivoted downward by up to 65 degrees, acting almost as a type of variable-geometry wingtip device. This increased the aircraft's directional stability at supersonic speeds, shifted the center of lift to a more favorable position at high speeds, and strengthened the compression lift effect. With the wingtips drooped downwards, the compression lift shock wave would be further trapped under the wings.|$|E

It was found in these, studies that oscillating <b>pressure</b> <b>fields</b> could reach extremely high pressure peaks. Pressure peaks that were two to three orders of mag-nitude larger than the ambient pressure were obtained {{in some of these}} studies.

2500|$|During {{the first}} {{experiments}} using diamond anvils, {{the sample was}} placed on the flat tip of the diamond, the culet, and pressed between the diamond faces. As the diamond faces were pushed closer together, the sample would be pressed and extrude out from the center. Using a microscope to view the sample, it could be seen that a smooth pressure gradient existed across the sample with the outer most portions of the sample acting as a kind of gasket. The sample was not evenly distributed across the diamond culet but localized in the center due to the [...] "cupping" [...] of the diamond at higher pressures. This cupping phenomenon is the elastic stretching of the edges of the diamond culet, commonly referred to as the [...] "shoulder height". Many diamonds were broken during the first stages of producing a new cell or any time an experiment is pushed to higher pressure. The NBS group was in a unique position where almost endless supplies of diamonds were available to them. Custom officials occasionally confiscated diamonds from people attempting to smuggle them into the country. Disposing of such valuable confiscated materials could be problematic given rules and regulations.
