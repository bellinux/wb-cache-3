5|$|Dannatt was {{nominated}} for a life <b>peerage</b> by David Cameron while Cameron was Leader of the Opposition. Although nominated for a political <b>peerage</b> on the Conservative Party benches, he opted to sit as a crossbencher and was ennobled as Baron Dannatt in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{representative}} peers {{were those}} peers {{elected by the}} members of the <b>Peerage</b> of Scotland and the <b>Peerage</b> of Ireland to sit in the British House of Lords. Until 1999, all members of the <b>Peerage</b> of England held the right to sit in the House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives. All peers who were created after 1707 as Peers of Great Britain and after 1801 as Peers of the United Kingdom held the same right to sit in the House of Lords.|$|E

50|$|The rate of {{creation}} of life <b>peerages</b> under the Life <b>Peerages</b> Act has not shown a consistent pattern. David Cameron and Tony Blair have created life <b>peerages</b> {{at the highest}} rate, at 41 and 36 <b>peerages</b> per year respectively. Conservative Prime Ministers have created on average 20 life peers per year in office, Labour Prime Ministers an average of 27.2 per year. In absolute terms, Labour (in 24 years) created 1.2 {{times the number of}} life <b>peerages</b> created by the Conservatives (in 29 years). On the other hand, Conservative Prime Ministers (especially Macmillan) created {{the vast majority of the}} about 50 hereditary <b>peerages</b> created since 1958.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Peerage</b> Act 1963 allowed all Scottish {{peers to}} sit in the House of Lords; it also {{permitted}} all Irish peers {{to sit in}} the House of Commons for any constituency in the United Kingdom, as well as to vote in parliamentary elections, without being deprived of the remaining privileges of <b>peerage.</b>|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{hereditary}} <b>peerages</b> {{were awarded}} {{to members of}} the landowning aristocracy and royal favourites. In the late 19th century, <b>peerages</b> began to be awarded to industrialists with increasing frequency. Well-substantiated allegations that titles were sold during David Lloyd George's premiership led to the passing of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century the granting of hereditary <b>peerages,</b> other than {{to members of the}} Royal Family, virtually ceased, giving way to life <b>peerages,</b> which have been granted since the passing of the Life <b>Peerages</b> Act 1958. They are given to a wide range of individuals on the recommendation of the leaders of the major British political parties, including opposition parties.|$|R
5|$|The {{privilege}} of <b>peerage</b> extends to all temporal peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the {{privilege of}} <b>peerage.</b> From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of <b>peerage</b> for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of <b>peerage</b> is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the <b>Peerage</b> Act 1963 loses all privileges of <b>peerage.</b> The privilege of <b>peerage</b> also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of <b>peerage</b> as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|E
5|$|Benn's {{father had}} been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill {{increased}} the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a <b>peerage.</b> However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the <b>peerage.</b> He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.|$|E

50|$|On the {{accession}} of James I, the Scotsman {{found himself}} short of money, and, his predecessors having disposed {{of all the}} Abbey and Church lands, he ingeniously started selling <b>peerages.</b> Eight years later James created baronetcies, and sold them instead of the <b>peerages.</b> By 1615, James was selling <b>peerages</b> at £100,000 each, just over £11 million today).|$|R
50|$|There is {{no limit}} {{on the number of}} <b>peerages</b> the Sovereign may create under the Life <b>Peerages</b> Act. Normally life <b>peerages</b> are granted to {{individuals}} nominated by political parties or by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, and to honour important public figures such as the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Prime Minister on their retirement.|$|R
50|$|The Lords Temporal greatly outnumber the Lords Spiritual, {{there being}} nearly 800 {{of the former}} and only 26 of the latter. As of December 2016, 92 Lords Temporal sit in the House in right of {{hereditary}} <b>peerages</b> and 19 sit in right of judicial life <b>peerages</b> under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. The rest are life peers under the Life <b>Peerages</b> Act 1958.|$|R

5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very concerned {{at the loss of}} a good Attorney General. In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a <b>peerage.</b> It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a <b>peerage,</b> and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a <b>peerage.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1204 the Duchy of Normandy {{was absorbed}} by the French crown, {{and later in the}} 13th century two more of the lay <b>peerages</b> were {{absorbed by the}} crown (Toulouse 1271, Champagne 1284), so in 1297 three new <b>peerages</b> were created, the County of Artois, the County of Anjou and the Duchy of Brittany, to {{compensate}} for the three <b>peerages</b> that had disappeared.|$|R

5|$|The {{privilege}} of <b>peerage</b> {{is the body}} of special privileges belonging {{to members of the}} British <b>peerage.</b> It is distinct from parliamentary privilege, which applies only to those peers serving in the House of Lords {{and the members of the}} House of Commons, while Parliament is in session and forty days before and after a Parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|A staunch {{republican who}} deplored {{all forms of}} social privilege, {{including}} hereditary peerages, he accepted Kinnock's offer of {{a seat in the}} House of Lords with some reluctance, receiving a life <b>peerage</b> as Baron Dormand of Easington, of Easington in the County of Durham on 13 October 1987.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War I, Byng {{was raised}} to the <b>peerage</b> as Baron Byng of Vimy, of Thorpe-le-Soken in the County of Essex, on 7 October 1919. The next month, {{he retired from the}} {{military}} and moved to Thorpe Hall.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} ranks of {{hereditary}} peerage: Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron. Until the mid 20th century, <b>peerages</b> were usually hereditary (bar legal <b>peerages</b> - see below) and, {{until the end}} of the 20th century, English, Scottish, British and UK <b>peerages</b> (except, until very recent times, those for the time being held by women) carried the right to a seat in the House of Lords.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, the Life <b>Peerages</b> Act enabled (non-hereditary) life {{peers to}} sit in the House of Lords, and from then on the {{creation}} of hereditary <b>peerages</b> rapidly became obsolete, almost ceasing after 1964. This, however, is only a convention and was not observed by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who asked the Queen to create three hereditary <b>peerages</b> (two of them, however, to men who had no heirs). Until changes in the twentieth century, only a proportion of those holding Scottish and Irish <b>peerages</b> were entitled by that title {{to sit in}} the House of Lords; these were nominated by their peers.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 13th century, the King {{elevated}} some counties into duchies, {{a practice}} that increased through the early modern period until the French Revolution. Many of this duchies were also <b>peerages,</b> so-called new <b>peerages.</b>|$|R
5|$|Disliking honours, Pick {{declined}} {{offers of}} a knighthood and a <b>peerage.</b> He did accept, in 1932, the Soviet Union's Honorary Badge of Merit for his {{advice on the}} construction of the Moscow Metro. He was an honorary member of the Royal Institute of British Architects.|$|E
5|$|In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn {{automatically}} {{became a}} peer, preventing him from {{sitting in the}} House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his <b>peerage,</b> Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, {{who was at the}} time also the heir presumptive to a <b>peerage.</b>|$|E

50|$|The earldom of Stockton and viscountcy of Macmillan of Ovenden {{were the}} most recent {{hereditary}} <b>peerages</b> created for someone other than {{a member of the}} Royal Family, and they are the only surviving non-royal hereditary <b>peerages</b> created since 1965.|$|R
25|$|Australians {{themselves}} were previously eligible to receive British Imperial Honours. Such honours, in appropriate cases, included <b>peerages</b> and baronetcies. In other cases, already-extant <b>peerages</b> and baronetcies devolved upon persons who emigrated to Australia, or whose ancestors had emigrated to Australia.|$|R
50|$|The Life <b>Peerages</b> Act {{sanctions}} {{the regular}} granting of life <b>peerages,</b> {{but the power}} to appoint Lords of Appeal in Ordinary under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act was not derogated. No limits {{were placed on the}} number of <b>peerages</b> that the Sovereign may award, as was done by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act. A peer created under the Life <b>Peerages</b> Act has the right to sit in the House of Lords, provided he or she is at least 21 years of age, is not suffering punishment upon conviction for treason and is a citizen of the United Kingdom, or the Republic of Ireland or of a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, and is resident in the UK for tax purposes.|$|R
