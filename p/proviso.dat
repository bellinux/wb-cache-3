5|$|As {{the country}} {{continued}} to expand, {{the issue of}} slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot <b>Proviso</b> was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican–American War; the <b>Proviso</b> repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.|$|E
5|$|Prof. Freedman {{has argued}} that Bollman erred in {{applying}} § 14's <b>proviso</b> to both courts and individual judges (as opposed to only individual judges) and thus that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did confer federal courts the power to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners. The Reconstruction-era Congress granted federal courts this power in 1867.|$|E

5|$|Greyhound racing was {{introduced}} to Belle Vue in 1926, in the UK's first purpose-built greyhound stadium, constructed {{at a cost of}} £22,000. It was built on land leased by Belle Vue to the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA), a company chaired by Sir William Gentle, who was also the chairman of Belle Vue (Manchester) Ltd. The site was sold to the GRA in 1937, with the <b>proviso</b> {{that it had to be}} used for greyhound racing.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He argues {{that there is a}} duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean <b>proviso,</b> should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the classic}} {{oscillator}} design methods are reviewed, and {{their strengths and}} weaknesses are shown. <b>Provisos</b> for avoiding the misuse of classic methods are also proposed. If the required <b>provisos</b> are satisfied, the solutions provided by the classic methods (oscillator start-up linear approximation) will be correct. The <b>provisos</b> verification needs to use the NDF (Network Determinant Function). The use of the NDF or the most suitable RRT (Return Relation Transponse), which {{is directly related to}} the NDF, as a tool to analyze oscillators leads to a new oscillator design method. The RRT is the "true" loop-gain of oscillators. The use of the new method is demonstrated with examples. Finally, a comparison of NDF/RRT results with the HB (Harmonic Balance) simulation and practical implementation measurements prove the universal use of the new methods...|$|R

These first two boats, which comprised one-third of the six submarines under construction in 1916, were followed by orders for U-58 and U-59 before the war's end.|$|E
5|$|The only {{freshman}} on the <b>Proviso</b> High School varsity baseball team, Grove's pitching ability {{attracted the}} attention of the White Sox. After signing with the team in 1937, Grove moved between the major leagues and minor leagues for a few seasons until 1943, when he found a solid place in the White Sox's pitching rotation. Grove had a career-year in 1943, finishing the season with career-bests in ERA, wins, and complete games; in 1944, he made his only All-Star appearance.|$|E
5|$|Wilson was a {{delegate}} to the 1848 Whig National Convention, but left the party after it nominated slave owner Zachary Taylor for president and took no position on the Wilmot <b>Proviso,</b> which would have prohibited slavery in territory acquired from Mexico in the Mexican-American War. Wilson and Charles Allen, another Massachusetts delegate, withdrew from the convention, {{and called for a}} new meeting of anti-slavery advocates in Buffalo, which launched the Free Soil Party.|$|E

5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could accommodate a fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout of track and tunnels {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by the Great Hall and the Arch. Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that the Arch and the Great Hall would be demolished, which was granted on the <b>proviso</b> that the Arch would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|For {{three months}} Braham {{remained}} inactive. In February 1944 he was posted to No. 2 Group RAF as 'wing commander night operations' {{attached to the}} 2nd Light Bomber Group, RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Although a staff officer at HQ, Braham was able, with persistence, to persuade his commanding officer, Air Vice Marshal Basil Embry {{to allow him to}} 'free-lance' intruder operations using a De Havilland Mosquito loaned from one of the various squadrons in the group on the <b>proviso</b> he asked his permission beforehand. Braham also had his former radar operators transferred to the group's headquarters so he could fly with them. He frequently borrowed aircraft from No. 613 Squadron RAF.|$|E

As his first minor league season drew to a close, Grove planned on returning to <b>Proviso</b> High School to complete his education. At the end of the season, the St. Paul Saints purchased Grove's contract to replenish their pitching staff.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} {{flexible}} learning, as is prevailing among Australasian higher education institutions in recent years, is not without a price. Through a review of literature, we try to uncover <b>provisos</b> underpinning flexible learning. That is, all flexibilities come with <b>provisos,</b> pre-conditions, and commitments (or even inflexibilities). In order to make {{one aspect of the}} instruction flexible, usually other aspects have to be made more structured. Eight aspects of flexibility are analysed and discussed. We conclude this paper with a call for more rigorous investigations into issues related to flexible learning...|$|R
5|$|In the 1840s, {{tensions}} {{were growing}} between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot <b>Proviso,</b> introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, {{it would have}} banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary respite, but the Dred Scott case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that African Americans had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union.|$|E
5|$|Leicester having {{returned}} to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, with the <b>proviso</b> {{that it be}} not carried out until she gave her approval. As {{there was no sign}} of her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.|$|E
5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, with the <b>proviso</b> that $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E

5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a counter-argument, based on {{the doctrine of the}} retroversion of the sovereignty of the people that he had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had no authority to decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A congress of deputies called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that it should be a Junta. Castelli bowed to Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but with the <b>proviso</b> that the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this <b>proviso,</b> Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} {{must be made}} at a treaty, as {{in other}} cases. This insures publicity, and affords a protection against fraud.

It is sufficient if the purchase is made at a treaty held ‘under {{the authority of the}} United States,’ and in the ‘presence and with the approbation of the commissioner or commissioners of the United States,’ etc.|$|E
5|$|The {{seat of the}} Prince of Monaco was {{established}} on the Rocher de Monaco (Illustration 5) as a fortress in 1191 when the harbour, that is today lined by Monte Carlo, was acquired by the Republic of Genoa.

Further territory was ceded to the new owners by the Council of Peille and the Abbaye de Saint Pons. In 1215 work began on a new fortress, comprising four towers connected by ramparts protected by a curtain wall. This forms the core of the present palace.|$|E
