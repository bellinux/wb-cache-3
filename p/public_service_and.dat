5|$|During the 2003-04 NBA season, Webber {{was on the}} {{disabled}} list until February. When he returned, the NBA suspended him for three games for his guilty plea. In September 2005, Judge Edmunds ruled that the conviction should be treated as a misdemeanor and that Webber should pay the maximum fine for such an offense, which was $100,000. This ruling came after Webber served 330 hours of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> accumulated $78,000 of related out-of-pocket expenses.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his service}} in Cuba, Magoon retired from <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> vacationed {{for a year}} in Europe before {{returning}} to the United States. Speculation at the time pointed to him taking a position as ambassador to China, a special commission on stability in Central America, or a Cabinet position. Ultimately Magoon did not take up any of those new responsibilities and formally entered retirement. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1920 after complications from surgery for acute appendicitis.|$|E

5|$|In {{a country}} where {{demographic}} surveys estimated the Buddhist majority to be between 70 and 90 percent, President Ngô Đình Diệm's policies generated claims of religious bias. A member of the Roman Catholic minority in Vietnam, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists. Specifically, historians regard the government as being biased towards Catholics in <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> military promotions, {{as well as in}} the allocation of land, business favors, and tax concessions.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{budget was}} {{delivered}} by Finance Minister Marshall on April 24, 2012, {{and was a}} stark contrast from the austerity budget that Dunderdale and her ministers had been warning of for months. Only 45 temporary positions were cut from the <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> a review of programs found $38.8 million in savings, {{much lower than the}} $100 million Dunderdale had previously mentioned. Government spending actually increased in the budget by 1.7 per cent, though this was below the rate of inflation.|$|E

5|$|After Dunstan's {{resignation}} from parliament, deputy Des Corcoran {{took his}} place as party leader and Premier. At the subsequent Norwood by-election, Dunstan's seat was retained by Labor. Corcoran soon called the 1979 election. Corcoran's lack of media savvy, the Advertisers bias towards the Liberals at this election, and the public's widespread dissatisfaction with the economy and bus strikes, brought about an 8.4 percent two-party swing against Labor, leaving the party with only 19 seats against the Liberals on 25 seats. The Tonkin Liberal Government came to power and began reducing {{the size of the}} <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> abandoned the Monarto project. Dunstan took a trip to Europe after being released from hospital, staying in Perugia for five months and pursuing Italian studies. He subsequently returned home and lived quietly in Adelaide for three years without finding work that appealed to him, such as that related to the shaping of public policy.|$|E
5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Nash {{formed the}} Steve Nash Foundation.

It focuses its resources on communities in Phoenix, Arizona, and British Columbia, Canada. It was given charitable status in 2004. This foundation was awarded the Steve Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports Philanthropy in 2008.

5|$|Initially, the Ngô family {{claimed that}} the army had carried out the raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E
5|$|This {{bridge is}} {{named in honor}} and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, let us not forget the lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E
5|$|From 1944-1947 he was {{director}} of research and publications for The Council of State Governments in Chicago. In 1947 he was appointed {{professor of political science}} at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. In 1952 and 1953 he was part of U.N. sponsored missions in public administration in Colombia, the Philippines, and Japan. His next one-year U.N. appointment was as co-Director of the Public Administration Institute for Turkey and the Middle East in Ankara, Turkey. Indiana University then appointed him director of the Institute of Training for <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> <b>and</b> Coordinator of Indonesian and Thailand Public Administration Programs. By the time of his retirement, further appointments, research and lecture tours and vacations had enabled him to visit nearly one hundred countries around the world as well as every state in the union. In 1956, after a year as visiting professor of government at the University of California, Berkeley, he returned to Bloomington as Professor of Government at Indiana University, where he remained until his retirement. In the course of his career he secured 21 National Science Foundation grants to support his research.|$|E
