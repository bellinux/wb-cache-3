40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans, five <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>gland</b> cells {{reside in}} the {{terminal}} bulb of the pharynx and extend anterior processes to five contact points in the pharyngeal lumen. <b>Pharyngeal</b> <b>gland</b> cells secrete mucin-like proteins thought to facilitate digestion, hatching, molting and assembly of the surface coat of the cuticle, but supporting evidence has been sparse. Here we show <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>gland</b> cell expression of PQN- 75, a unique protein containing an N-terminal signal peptide, nucleoporin (Nup) -like phenylalanine/glycine (FG) repeats, and an extensive polyproline repeat domain with similarities to human basic salivary proline-rich pre-protein PRB 2. Imaging of C-terminal tagged PQN- 75 shows localization throughout <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>gland</b> cell processes but not the pharyngeal lumen; instead, aggregates of PQN- 75 are occasionally found throughout the pharynx, suggesting secretion from <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>gland</b> cells into the surrounding pharyngeal muscle.

40|$|AbstractThe Caenorhabditis elegans gene hlh- 6 is {{expressed}} specifically in <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands,</b> {{one of five}} distinct pharyngeal cell types. Expression of hlh- 6 is controlled by a discrete set of cis-regulatory elements, including a negative element called HRL 1. Here we demonstrate that HRL 1 is a functional binding site for LAG- 1, the CSL transcriptional effector of Notch in C. elegans, and that regulation of hlh- 6 by LAG- 1 is direct. Regulation of hlh- 6 by LAG- 1 is strictly negative: removal of HRL 1 or LAG- 1 regulation results in ectopic expression of hlh- 6, but does not affect expression in <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands.</b> Furthermore, direct regulation of hlh- 6 expression {{does not appear to}} involve Notch signaling, contrary to the canonical mechanism by which CSL factors regulate target genes. We also identify an additional cis-regulatory element in the hlh- 6 promoter that, together with previously identified elements, is sufficient to overcome repression by LAG- 1 and activate hlh- 6 expression in <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands</b> of Caenorhabditis elegans {{are one of}} five cell {{types in}} the pharynx. The {{transcription}} factor HLH- 6 is required for gland development and function, and is specifically expressed in <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands.</b> As a first step to understanding specification of <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands,</b> we analyzed the promoter of hlh- 6 to identify the elements required for gland-specific expression. Our experiments identified three distinct regulatory elements required for hlh- 6 expression: a PHA- 4 -binding site and two new elements, HRL 1 and HRL 2 (for hlh- 6 regulatory elements 1 and 2). The three elements employ a simple logic for producing cell-type-specific expression: the PHA- 4 site restricts expression to the pharynx, HRL 2 restricts expression in both a position and lineage-dependent manner, and HRL 1 restricts expression to a subset of cell types. In isolation, these three elements {{have little or no}} enhancer activity but in combination they produce robust, gland-specific expression. These findings describe a combinatorial code for gland-specific expression and suggest that similar codes may be employed for specification of other pharyngeal cell types...|$|R

40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans pharynx (or foregut) {{functions}} as a pump that draws in food (bacteria) from the environment. While the "organ identity factor" PHA- 4 is critical for formation of the C. elegans pharynx as a whole, {{little is known about}} the specification of distinct cell types within the pharynx. Here, we use a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and genetics to identify a helix-loop-helix transcription factor (HLH- 6) as a critical regulator of <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>gland</b> development. HLH- 6 is required for expression of a number of gland-specific genes, acting through a discrete cis-regulatory element named PGM 1 (<b>Pharyngeal</b> <b>Gland</b> Motif 1). hlh- 6 mutants exhibit a frequent loss of a subset of glands, while the remaining glands have impaired activity, indicating a role for hlh- 6 in both gland development and function. Interestingly, hlh- 6 mutants are also feeding defective, ascribing a biological function for the glands. Pharyngeal pumping in hlh- 6 mutants is normal, but hlh- 6 mutants lack expression of a class of mucin-related proteins that are normally secreted by pharyngeal glands and line the pharyngeal cuticle. An interesting possibility is that one function of pharyngeal glands is to secrete a pharyngeal lining that ensures efficient transport of food along the pharyngeal lumen...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the biological value for the honey bee of pollen substitute formulations the chemical makeup of which was supplemented with DL and L isomers of synthetic amino acids and thus upgraded to the standard of natural pollen from pollen loads. The following feed component made up the pollen substitute: potato protein 32 %, soybean cake 18 %, rapeseed cake 6 %, yeast Candida utilis 6 %, wheat flour 14, 8 %, maize grits 17. 5 %, soybean oil 3. 3 %, lecithin 0. 5 % polfamix W 1. 4 %, Vitazol AD 3 EC 0. 2 %, glucose with vitamin C 0. 1 %. Prior to be fed to bees, the pollen substitute and pollen loads were mixed with powder sugar to bring protein level in all feeds to 21 %. Biological methods were used as the measure of the nutritional value of the feed to test the condition of bees. The condition of bees was expressed in terms of the size of <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands,</b> the size of the fat body and the number of haemocytes in haemolymph. The poorest developed <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands</b> and fat body were recorded in bees which were fed a non-supplemented pollen substitute. The highest number of haemocytes in haemolymph was recorded in bees which received pollen substitute supplemented with all lacking L amino acids, the number being slightly lower when the amino acids were fed as DL isomers. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Bringing the amino acid composition of pollen substitutes with essential amino acids up to their level in natural pollen favourably influenced the nutritional value of the protein in terms of fat body size but the effect was weaker in terms of the development of <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>glands.</b> As the nutritional value of the pollen substitute protein increased there was an increase in the number of haemocytes in honeybee haemolymph.

40|$|Nematodes of {{the genus}} Heterorhabditis are insect parasites that are widely used as {{biological}} control agents.
