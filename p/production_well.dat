5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} show human use of ivory to date {{back more than}} 35,000 years. It has been exported to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age of Exploration and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, {{at the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass <b>production,</b> <b>well</b> over 1000 tons of ivory were exported to Europe yearly. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported 180 tons just for cutlery handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.|$|E
25|$|This is an {{experimental}} method that employs {{a number of}} vertical air injection wells above a horizontal <b>production</b> <b>well</b> located {{at the base of}} the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for ignition and mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (through heating) the lower bitumen to flow into the <b>production</b> <b>well.</b> It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Hartford Courant, Malcolm Johnson stated, [...] "Against all odds, this long-delayed {{film version}} {{turns out to}} be a labor of love for {{director}} Alan Parker and for his stars, the reborn Madonna, the new superstar Antonio Banderas, the protean veteran Jonathan Pryce." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing [...] "Parker's visuals enliven the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it passion. By the end of the film we feel like we've had our money's worth, and we're sure Evita has." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel & Ebert & the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, in his review for the Chicago Tribune, wrote, [...] "Director Alan Parker has mounted this <b>production</b> <b>well,</b> which is more successful as spectacle than anything else." [...] According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, [...] "This Evita is not just a long, complex music video; it works and breathes like a real movie, with characters worthy of our affection and deepest suspicions." [...] Critic Zach Conner commented, [...] "It's a relief to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well-cast, and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than just a bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|Billboard {{magazine}} called the song [...] "a Pussycat Dolls-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment <b>production.</b> <b>Well</b> done, {{if in the}} most generic sense." [...] About.com's Bill Lamb gave the song 4/5 stars, saying that with [...] "Say It Right", [...] "many pop music fans are likely {{to take a second}} look at purchasing [...] ". He described the song as [...] "the foundation of Loose" [...] and [...] "a welcomed presence in the pop top 40". IGN Music calls the song [...] "...one of the brightest moments on the album" [...] and [...] "another throwback to the '80s" [...] which [...] "...lets loose with the most hypnotic chorus". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered the song [...] "a dark meditative piece that would have fit on [...] previous records". The New York Times described the song as [...] "building a groove from hard drums and ghostly, multitracked voices, and Ms. Furtado sings a melancholy chorus she doesn't quite believe", comparing the coda, with music getting louder and then slowly fading, [...] "the way the best — and worst — nights out often do". Also, DJ Z's reviewed the song as [...] "the only single in the world to work at both a club in Manhattan, and on a safari through the natives land of (fill in the blank)." [...] The song received a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab". It was also nominated for two MuchMusic Video Awards.|$|E
30|$|Fractures are {{the main}} factors that affect the gas {{channeling}} of an oil well. Due to the combined action of natural fractures and artificial fractures, a well-connected channel will be formed between the gas injection <b>wells</b> and the <b>production</b> <b>wells,</b> so that the <b>production</b> <b>wells</b> will be gas channeling quickly.|$|R
50|$|To achieve maximum oil recovery, {{waterflooding}} {{is often}} implemented, in which water is {{injected into the}} reservoirs to help force the oil to the <b>production</b> <b>wells.</b> The injected water eventually reaches the <b>production</b> <b>wells,</b> and so in the later stages of waterflooding, the produced water proportion ("cut") of the total production increases.|$|R
30|$|From the oil {{saturation}} {{at the end}} of scenario 1, it {{is found}} that there are few blocks surrounding the <b>production</b> <b>wells</b> U 3, U 4 and U 5, where the oil saturation is still high, therefore in the next scenario, the position of these oil <b>production</b> <b>wells</b> is shifted to achieve the maximum sweep.|$|R
2500|$|This is a {{very new}} and {{experimental}} method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal <b>production</b> <b>well.</b> The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the [...] "toe" [...] of the horizontal well toward the [...] "heel", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and {{have the advantage of}} not requiring energy to create steam.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, the SLCC placed F-M [...] {{engines in}} six {{streamlined}} railcars, which are {{known today as}} the FM OP800. In 1944, F-M began production of its own [...] yard switcher, the H-10-44. Milwaukee Road #760 (originally delivered as #1802), the first Fairbanks-Morse locomotive constructed in their own plant, is now preserved and {{on display at the}} Illinois Railway Museum. F-M had yet to produce a railroad road locomotive, or any locomotive prior to the 1944 switcher which was built several years after its conception; all other locomotive producers, except for General Motors (and a few others who manufactured small industrial locomotives), were forced by the government to continue to build reciprocating steam locomotives during much of the war. [...] All national locomotive production [...] was subject to strict wartime restrictions regarding the number and type of railroad-related products they could manufacture (the U.S. Government {{in the name of the}} Navy commandeered all F-M O-P <b>production</b> <b>well</b> into 1944). Following World War II, North American railways began phasing out their aging steam locomotives and sought to replace them with state-of-the-art diesel locomotives at an ever-increasing rate due to the impossible economics of steam propulsion. [...] Fairbanks-Morse, along with its competing firms, sought to capitalize on this new market opportunity.|$|E

40|$|The El Rio Spreading Grounds, {{an area of}} {{artificial}} recharge, lies within a regional groundwater depression. It consists of ten small ponds surrounded by eight <b>production</b> <b>wells.</b> A deliberate tracer experiment using sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) was conducted to determine ground water flow. The tracer was continuously injected into one pond for one week prior to a ~ 50 day period of no recharge. Tracer breakthrough curves from the <b>production</b> <b>wells</b> indicate that the plume remained near (within 500 m) the injection site during the 18 month experiment. Its movement was influenced {{by a number of}} factors. First, variable groundwater production in the <b>production</b> <b>wells</b> cause frequent changes in the water level, and thus, rates and direction of the plume flow respond to local groundwater cones of depression. Second, additional recharge events, which were free of tracer, create groundwater mounds that block the transport of the tracer to specific <b>production</b> <b>wells.</b> The nearly instantaneous arrival of the tracer at El Rio # 6, suggests that water recharge rapidly through the local high permeable beds...|$|R
40|$|Early {{shutting}} time in <b>production</b> <b>wells</b> due {{to water}} production performs {{an important role}} to determine production efficiency and useful life of the reservoir. In this study, in order to postpone the shut-in time of producing wells, increase oil displacement, and enhance production efficiency, <b>production</b> and injection <b>wells</b> capabilities with respect to their position in the reservoir were studied by using the concept of streamline. In the oil reservoirs, increasing injection flow rate does not necessarily enhance oil displacement and recovery. Therefore, suitable injection rates according to injection and <b>production</b> <b>wells</b> position have to be optimized. Also, <b>production</b> <b>wells</b> flow rate can affect sweep efficiency optimization extremely and increase the efficiency of injection wells. In this study, according to the position of <b>production</b> and injection <b>wells</b> and water <b>production</b> rates resulting from injection wells, four scenarios with different injection and production rates were investigated.
