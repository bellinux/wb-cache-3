In 1813, the liberal deputies of the Cortes of Cádiz also obtained its abolition, {{largely as a result}} of the Holy Office's condemnation of the popular revolt against French invasion. But the Inquisition was reconstituted when Ferdinand VII recovered the throne on 1 July 1814.

25|$|Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial {{issue that}} reason remains {{operative}} in some actions, that if I want {{to arrive at}} the next block, for example, I can assume a Newtonian universe (common sense), plan a course of action (to walk straight for Xmeters), carry out the action, and finally fulfill my goal by arriving at the point in question. What is in doubt is that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard, it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives, deprives the rational subject of its <b>privileged</b> <b>access</b> to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens, eager to maximise their civil rights, nor proletarians, anticipating the onset of communism.

25|$|Beginning with Life on Earth in 1979, Attenborough {{set about}} {{creating}} {{a body of work}} which became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers. The series also established many of the hallmarks of the BBC's natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes. In Rwanda, for example, Attenborough and his crew were granted <b>privileged</b> <b>access</b> to film Dian Fossey's research group of mountain gorillas. Innovation was another factor in Life on Earths success: new film-making techniques were devised to get the shots Attenborough wanted, with a focus on events and animals that were hitherto unfilmed. Computerised airline schedules, which had only recently been introduced, enabled the series to be elaborately devised so that Attenborough visited several locations around the globe in each episode, sometimes even changing continents mid-sentence. Although appearing as the on-screen presenter, he consciously restricted his time on camera to give his subjects top billing.|$|E
25|$|Both hemispheres of {{the brain}} make a {{contribution}} to the McGurk effect. They work together to integrate speech information that is received through the auditory and visual senses. A McGurk response is more likely to occur in right-handed individuals for whom the face has <b>privileged</b> <b>access</b> to the right hemisphere and words to the left hemisphere. In people that have had callosotomies done, the McGurk effect is still present but significantly slower. In people with lesions to the left hemisphere {{of the brain}}, visual features often {{play a critical role in}} speech and language therapy. People with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain show a greater McGurk effect than normal controls. Visual information strongly influences speech perception in these people. There is a lack of susceptibility to the McGurk illusion if left hemisphere damage resulted in a deficit to visual segmental speech perception. In people with right hemisphere damage, impairment on both visual-only and audio-visual integration tasks is exhibited, although they are still able to integrate the information to produce a McGurk effect. Integration only appears if visual stimuli is used to improve performance when the auditory signal is impoverished but audible. Therefore, there is a McGurk effect exhibited in people with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain but the effect is not as strong as a normal group.|$|E
25|$|When, on 3 June 1947, United Kingdom {{accepted}} {{demands for}} a partition and announced its intention to quit India within a short period, the Maharaja of Travancore desired to declare himself independent. Supported by the Diwan, C. P., Chithira Thirunal issued a declaration of independence on 18 June 1947. As Travancore's declaration of independence was unacceptable to India, negotiations were started with the Diwan by the Government of India. Family sources indicate that C. P. himself was not in favour of independence but only greater autonomy, and that a favourable agreement had been reached between C. P. and the Indian representatives by 23 July 1947 but accession to the Indian Union could not be carried out only because it was pending approval by the Raja. On the other hand, noted historian Ramachandra Guha has written about how C. P., egged on by Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had established secret ties with senior Ministers of the British Government, who encouraged him {{in the hope that}} he would give them <b>privileged</b> <b>access</b> to monazite, a material Travancore was rich in and which could give the British a lead in the nuclear arms race. Nevertheless, an assassination attempt was made on C. P. on 25 July 1947 during a concert commemorating the anniversary of Swati Thirunal. C. P. survived with multiple stab wounds and hastened the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union soon after his recovery.|$|E

500|$|Pennant met and corresponded widely {{over many}} years with other naturalists. This gave him <b>privileged</b> <b>access</b> to manuscripts and specimens, and his {{writings}} sometimes provide information about otherwise lost discoveries. For example, he visited the botanist Joseph Banks in September 1771 on his return from Captain James Cook's four-year voyage of exploration; Banks appears to have passed his bird specimens on to Pennant. Pennant's manuscripts describe the birds that Banks saw on the voyage; and when he read John Latham's A General Synopsis of Birds (1781–1785), Pennant saw that Latham had omitted some of the land birds from Eastern Australia that Banks had collected, and wrote to Latham {{to fill in the}} gaps.

500|$|Descartes' {{argument}} crucially {{depends on}} the premise that what Seth believes to be [...] "clear and distinct" [...] ideas in his mind are necessarily true. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this. For example, Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of <b>privileged</b> <b>access</b> to one's own ideas. Freud claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.|$|E

500|$|After the queen's death, Sophia {{lived in}} Kensington Palace during her final years, {{next to her}} niece Princess Victoria of Kent, the future Queen Victoria. As a result, Princess Sophia {{was one of the}} few {{paternal}} relatives that Victoria saw often. Like her sister-in-law the Duchess of Kent, Sophia fell under the spell of Victoria's comptroller Sir John Conroy and let him manage her money. The princess became a part of the Duchess of Kent's social circle and, in return, Sophia spied for Conroy when he was absent from Kensington Palace. Sophia also reported to Conroy on what she heard at St. James's Palace, as she had <b>privileged</b> <b>access</b> to courtiers as well as to her two elder brothers. Gossipmongers speculated that Conroy's successful ability to deal with the [...] "bullying inopportunities" [...] of Sophia's illegitimate son endeared her to him, [...] while some historians write that Conroy took advantage of Sophia, who in her last years had become [...] "dizzy, easily muddled... mourning her fading looks" [...] and a [...] "confused, nearly blind aunt." [...] Sophia often dined with the household, but the Duchess of Kent despised her. Princess Victoria was aware her aunt was a spy and the two never became close. Sophia's wealth allowed Conroy to live a rich lifestyle, acquiring for himself a house in Kensington for £4000, as well as two other estates for £18,000. Sophia was also responsible for certain members of Victoria's household gaining higher statuses; Victoria's governess Louise Lehzen, for instance, was made a Hanoverian baroness on the orders of George IV, and Conroy was named a Knight Commander of the Hanoverian Order.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Johnson and Chinn shows the contradictions within slavery at the time. For one, {{not only does}} it indicate that even then that [...] "kin could also be property," [...] but it is an interesting case because Johnson was open about his relationship with Chinn, calling her [...] "my bride" [...] on at least one occasion, with both of them acting like a married couple, and oral tradition recalling that other slaves at Great Crossings worked on their wedding. As part of their relationship, Chinn gained more responsibilities. As she spent much of her time in the [...] "plantation's big house," [...] a two-story brick home, she managed Johnson's estate for at least half of each year, with her purview later expanding to all of his property, even acting as [...] "Richard's representative" [...] and allowing her to handle money. This gave, as historical scholar Christina Snyder argues, some independence, since Johnson told his white employees that Chinn's authority must be respected, and her role allowing her children's lives to be different from [...] "others of African descent at Great Crossings," [...] giving them levels of <b>privileged</b> <b>access</b> within the plantation. This was further {{complicated by the fact that}} Chinn was still enslaved but supervised the work of slaves, with the Chinn family never sold or mortgaged off, but she did not have the power to [...] "challenge the institution of slavery or overturn the government that supported it," [...] she only had the power to gain some personal autonomy, with Johnson never legally emancipating her. This may have been because, as Snyder says, liberating her from human bondage would erode [...] "ties that bound her to him" [...] and keeping her enslaved supported his idea of being a [...] "benevolent patriarch." ...|$|E
