40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that <b>projection</b> <b>imaging</b> of first-pass myocardial perfusion is robust {{to a major}} cause of the so-called subendocardial dark-rim artifact (DRA); thereby proposing radial k-space sampling as the preferred acquisition scheme for DRA-free perfusion imaging. Background Current methods for clinical myocardial perfusion (MP) imaging suffer from image artifacts, specifically the socalled subendocardial dark-rim artifact (DRA) [1 - 3]. DRAs are especially limiting since they can reduce the sensitivity/specificity of detecting subendocardial MP deficits; hence, eliminating such artifacts remains an active area of research [1]. In this work, we {{demonstrate that}} <b>projection</b> <b>imaging</b> of MP is free of Gibbs ringing [2], {{a major cause of}} DRAs for conventional schemes. Methods In Cartesian MP MR, Gibbs ringing along the phaseencode (PE) direction leads to DRAs due to an inherent property of the Fourier transform (FT) at sharp signal intensity transitions [2]. However, in <b>projection</b> <b>imaging,</b> the underlying data transform is the Radon transform [4], which does not exhibit the Gibbs ringing in the sameformasFT.

With the new approach the image is reconstructed and visualized from random projections of the input object. The random projections are implemented within a single exposure by using a random phase mask which can be placed on a lens. For objects that have sparse representation in some known domain (eg. Fourier or wavelet) the novel imaging systems has larger effective space-bandwidthproduct than conventional imaging systems. This implies, for example, that more object pixels may be reconstructed and visualized than the number of pixels of the image sensor. We present simulation results on the utility of the new approach. The proposed approach can have broad applications in efficient imaging capture, visualization, and display given ever increasing demands for larger and higher resolution images, faster image communications, and multi dimensional image communications such as 3 D TV and display.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the higher}} and higher demand for image {{definition}} of flat-panel display (FPD), the minimum linewidth of pixel electrode, {{which is based on}} the Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) glass, has become narrower and narrower. The feature size of sub-pixel electrode has been narrowed from about 60 ~ 100 µm to below 20 µm in recent years. Hence the lithography technology has played a more and more important role in the fabrication of FPD. The laser <b>projection</b> <b>imaging</b> (LPI) technology can solve the problems obviously.
