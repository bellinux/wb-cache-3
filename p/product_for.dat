5000|$|According to the DCA study, across five {{industries}} (toys and accessories, children's clothing, adult clothing, {{home health}} care <b>products</b> <b>for</b> seniors, and personal care products), personal care had the highest disparities for women. Personal care <b>products</b> <b>for</b> women cost 13 percent more than personal care <b>products</b> <b>for</b> men. Additionally, the DCA found that personal care <b>products</b> <b>for</b> women were purchased more often than other consumer goods. Therefore, a 13 percent difference in pricing leads to a [...] "significant financial burden" [...] for women over a lifetime. The largest price disparity was found in hair products. Hair care <b>products</b> <b>for</b> women cost 48 percent more than for men. While the second largest price disparity was in razor cartridges, costing women 11 percent more.|$|R

5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy.

He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to water storage and regulation, {{the system has}} a hydroelectric capacity of over 2,000 megawatts, and provides recreation and flood control with its twenty dams and reservoirs. It has allowed major cities to grow along Valley rivers which previously would flood each spring, and transformed the semi-arid desert environment of the San Joaquin Valley into productive farmland. Freshwater stored in Sacramento River reservoirs and released downriver during dry periods prevents salt water from intruding into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta during high tide. There are eight divisions {{of the project and}} ten corresponding units, many of which operate in conjunction, while others are independent {{of the rest of the}} network.

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD <b>product,</b> <b>for</b> Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E

5|$|The central {{government}} soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right {{of several of}} the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit. By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s the {{central government}} officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing). Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In that year of 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region. However, the government still needed masses of paper <b>product</b> <b>for</b> the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of 3-year's time. The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency of paper money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver. The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. In later dynasties, the use and enforcement of paper currency was a method undertaken by the government {{as a response to the}} counterfeiting of copper coins.|$|E
