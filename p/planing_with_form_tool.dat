40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} motivates {{the development of}} energy-saving and low-polluting production processes. A sheet metal forming process without usage of lubricants is considered as one of these green production technologies. Forming processes {{without the need for}} traditional lubricants save process steps and additional costs to remove the remaining lubrication from the workpiece after forming. In order to realize such a dry forming process and to adjust the material flow effectively, tool surfaces were modified by amorphous carbon coatings and different surface finishing processes for roughness adjustment. To verify the general feasibility of the lubricant-free metal forming process, deep drawing of rectangular cups with and without lubrication <b>with</b> conventional <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> was investigated. The dry deep drawing process was modelled numerically to analyze process parameters and identify critical contact conditions. By strip drawing tests, the tribological behavior of ta-C and a-C:H coated tools with different surface treatments was investigated. The deposition process and resulting properties of a-C:H coatings were further analyzed to improve their tribological performance. The effects of the process parameters - deposition temperature and bias voltage in the deposition chamber - were investigated using the one-factor-at-a-time method. The strip drawing tests revealed a high influence of the surface roughness of coated tools on the tribological behavior. Therefore, laser based smoothing was further investigated in this study. Laser radiation at 355 nm wavelength was applied as an effective and minimum heatgenerating technique to remove the roughness asperities on ta-C coatings which are built during its growth. Finally, ta-C and a-C:H coatings were applied on tool surfaces and tested in a drawing process of strip profiles.

40|$|Abstract. A {{promising}} {{approach to}} control the material flow within deep drawing and working-media based forming processes is the structuring of the tool surfaces in the contact zones between workpiece and die. In order to obtain a sufficient and an optimised material flow respectively – especially for non-symmetric or non-uniform workpiece geometries – a locally adapted distribution of surface structures is a practicable solution. The macroscopic, and also the microscopic surface structures can be manufactured sufficiently {{by means of a}} high-speed cutting process. The shape of the tool surface structure has a significant influence on the tribological conditions between workpiece and die. To adjust the surface structure distribution to the required material flow distribution, detailed knowledge about the correlation of the material flow from the tribological conditions between sheet and the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> is required. A further innovative approach, particularly for decreasing the friction coefficient, is the use of an innovative hydrostatic pressure system using fluid ducts. Its functional principle is based on the reduction of the contact shear stress at the sheet surface in the contact zone <b>with</b> the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> by means of locally applying a hydrostatic fluid pressure. To obtain information about the correlation of the material flow from the tool surface structures and from the parameters of the hydrostatic pressure system respectively...|$|R

Moreover, a three-dimensional transient heat transfer model was formulated to identify optimum process parameters for the heating process. FE modeling results have been validated by temperature field measurements obtained from IR camera observations and a good agreement between the experimental data and the model has been observed. Based on the selected process parameters different relative positioning strategies between the tool position and the dynamically heated spot have been selected.

40|$|Metal/polymer/metal {{sandwich}} laminates show {{a rising}} rate {{in a variety}} of applications, for instance in automotive and aircraft industry. Due to the dissimilarity between the metal skin sheets and the polymer core, characterizing the forming potential of such laminates is a necessity. In this study, steel skin sheets and polypropylene-polyethylene copolymer as core sheet – called sandwich laminates - were used. They were produced in a roll bonding process using an adhesive agent. One major research point in IMET is investigating the effect of core and skin thicknesses on the forming behavior and mechanical properties of the sandwich laminates. Forming behavior is evaluated using deep drawing in addition to determining the forming limit curves (FLC). Bonding strength is evaluated by lap shear tests. More-over, the durability of the steel/polymer joints are evaluated under hydrothermal ageing conditions following heating/cooling regime cycles. Basically, the mechanical properties were determined using tensile testing. The adhesion test results show good adhesion strength and a cohesive failure mode. The lap shear strength after ageing shows no remarkable deterioration. The deep drawability of the sandwich laminates depends on the thicknesses of the layers and their volume fraction. With increasing the core thickness, the limiting drawing ratio (LDR) decreases and the probability of wrinkling in the flange area and cracking is higher as well. In case of different skin thicknesses in one sandwich, the best setting condition is to position the thinner skin in contact <b>with</b> the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> (punch) if acceptable by design...|$|R

We highlight the advantage of the hierarchical Bayesian method over frequentist “stacking” of spectra, and illustrate how our measured distribution parameters can be adopted as informative priors for velocity-dispersion measurements from individual noisy spectra...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to {{ecological}} and economic challenges {{there is a}} rising demand on closely-tolerated complex functional components. Regarding short process chains and improved mechanical properties conventional forming processes are often limited. A promising approach to meet these requirements {{can be seen in}} the combination of traditional sheet and bulk metal forming processes, to form sheet metals out of the sheet <b>plane</b> <b>with</b> typical bulk <b>forming</b> operations. The challenge of applying conventional bulk forming operations on sheet metal is the interaction between regions of high and low deformation, which is largely unknown in literature. To analyze this topic fundamentally, a process combination of deep drawing and upsetting is developed for manufacturing tooth-like elements at pre-drawn cups. To fully understand material flow out of the sheet plane into the tooth cavity and to identify and qualify process factors depending on the functional elements ´ geometry and friction, a single upsetting stage forming a simplified model of the blank is virtually analyzed with finite-element simulation. By inhibiting the forming history of the pre-drawn blank, the upsetting process can be investigated without interactions with a previous deep drawing operation...|$|R
