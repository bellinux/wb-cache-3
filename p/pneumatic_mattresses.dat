40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: to {{determine}} the nursing care missed as perceived by the nursing staff and its relation with the nursing care missed identified {{in the assessment of}} patients at risk of or having pressur ulcers. Method: descriptive correlation study. The participants were 161 nurses and 483 patients from a public hospital. The MISSCARE survey was used in combination with a Nursing Care Assessment Form for Patients at Risk of or having pressure ulcers. For the analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used. Results: the nursing staff indicated greater omission in skin care (38. 5 %), position change (31. 1 %) and the registration of risk factors for the development of pressure ulcers (33. 5 %). The nursing care missed identified in the assessment related to the use of pressure relief on bony prominences and drainage tubes interfering in the patient's movements (both with 58. 6 %) and the use of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>mattresses</b> (57. 6 %). Conclusion: a high percentage of nursing care missed was found according to the staff's perception. Nevertheless, the assessment of the nursing care missed was much higher. No significant relation was found between both. Therefore, it is a priority to reflect on the importance of objective patient assessments...|$|E
40|$|Contract NBy- 3143 was {{established}} to devise and investigate new schemes suitable {{for the development of}} mobile breakwaters. Mobile breakwaters are to be capable of attenuating various ocean waves sufficiently to provide a calm area for cargo-handling facilities. The devices investigated under this contract consisted of floatingplate absorbers, floating membranes, viscous blankets, and <b>pneumatic</b> wave <b>mattresses.</b> Results of tests on floating plate absorbers and membranes are not encouraging whereas the viscous blanket and <b>pneumatic</b> wave <b>mattress</b> seem promising. The viscous blanket gave satisfactory attenuation for wave lengths up to about twice the blanket length. The performance of the <b>pneumatic</b> wave <b>mattress</b> was slightly below that of the viscous blanket in this range, but exceeded the viscous blanket for wave lengths greater than twice the absorber length. Both units operated satisfactorily for a considerable range of wave lengths. it is felt that the preliminary results warrant further tests on both devices. A test program is recommended that would study effects of a variation of the various dimensional configurations of each of these two devices. Larger scale tests are also recommended, especially on the viscous blanket, {{in order to determine the}} significance of scale effects. Prepared for U. S.
