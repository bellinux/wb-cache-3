40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} of the mining industry is to determine ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limits.</b> Final <b>pit</b> {{is a collection of}} blocks, which can be removed with maximum profit while following restrictions on the slope of the mine’s walls. The size, location and final shape of an open-pit are very important in designing the location of waste dumps, stockpiles, processing plants, access roads and other surface facilities as well as in developing a production program. There are numerous methods for designing ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limits.</b> Some of these methods, such as floating cone algorithm, are heuristic and do not guarantee to generate optimum <b>pit</b> <b>limits.</b> Other methods, like Lerchs–Grossmann algorithm, are rigorous and always generate the true optimum <b>pit</b> <b>limits.</b> In this paper, a new rigorous algorithm is introduced. The main logic in this method is that only positive blocks, which can pay costs of their overlying non-positive blocks, are able to appear in the final pit. Those costs may be paid either by positive block itself or jointly with other positive blocks, which have the same overlying negative blocks. This logic is formulated using a network model as a Linear Programming (LP) problem. This algorithm can be applied to two- and three-dimension block models. Since there are many commercial programs available for solving LP problems, <b>pit</b> <b>limits</b> in large block models can be determined easily by using this method...|$|R
40|$|Ultimate {{limits of}} an open pit, which define its size and shape {{at the end of}} the mine’s life, is the pit with the highest profit value. A number of {{algorithms}} such as floating or moving cone method, floating cone method II and the corrected forms of this method, the Korobov algorithm and the corrected form of this method, dynamic programming and the Lerchs and Grossmann algorithm based on graph theory have been developed to find out the optimum final <b>pit</b> <b>limits.</b> Each of these methods has special advantages and disadvantages. Among these methods, the floating cone method is the simplest and fastest technique to determine optimum ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limits</b> to which variable slope angle can be easily applied. In contrast, this method fails to find out optimum final <b>pit</b> <b>limits</b> for all the cases. Therefore, other techniques such as floating cone method II and the corrected forms of this method have been developed to overcome this shortcoming. Nevertheless, these methods are not always able to yield the true optimum pit. To overcome this problem, in this paper a new algorithm called floating cone method III has been introduced to determine optimum ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limits.</b> The results show that this method is able to produce good outcome...|$|R
40|$|A {{graph theory}} {{oriented}} algorithm for optimal ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limit</b> design is developed. Mathematical proofs of optimality and convergence are given. The algorithm {{works on a}} 3 -D block mine model and formulates the model into a directed graph consisting many trees. The vertices in the graph are identified with the blocks in the model and the imposed arcs in the graph represent pit slope constraints. The formation of each directed tree is based more on the ore-waste support concept than geometric constraints alone. The algorithm efficiently handles the joint support and re-allocation problems. The theoretical proof shows that the new algorithm is consistently faster than the well known Lerchs-Grossmann's (LG) algorithm, {{which is the only}} algorithm developed in the past one-quarter century capable of producing a true optimum <b>pit</b> <b>limit.</b> The case study results show that the new algorithm is able to generate the optimal ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limit</b> for a model with 80 columns x 80 rows x 40 levels on an IBM PC AT 80286 microcomputer in 115 minutes. The indirect comparison was made between the results of the new algorithm and the results obtained by P. Huttagosol (1988, 1989) using the LG algorithm. P. Huttagosol optimized a smaller mine model than the one optimized by the new algorithm in 535 minutes of VAX 8600 CPU time. The comparison between 535 minutes of VAX 8600 CPU time for a smaller model with 115 minutes PC AT processing time for a bigger model clearly indicates that the new algorithm is significantly faster than the LG algorithm. This study also investigates both proposed mathematical optimization approaches and the popular trial and error "pushback" approach to long range mine planning. Both the theoretical analysis and numerical examples demonstrate it is impossible to obtain the optimal solution to mine production scheduling by the approach combining the Lagrangian relaxation with the ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limit</b> algorithm. The non-convergence due to redundant optimal solutions and the non-convergence due to the requirement of advanced stripping are identified with the proposed approach. The investigation clarifies the long-time misunderstood concept and proves the impossibility of such a research direction itself. Finally, some problem solving techniques which play important roles in the computerized mine planning and grade control are developed and discussed. Specifically, they are: (1) point-in-polygon algorithm, (2) polygon area algorithm, (3) polygon clipping algorithm, (4) blast hole data collection, validation and database maintenance, and (5) the interactive graphics ore-waste delineation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the mining}} {{optimisation}} literature, most researchers focused on two strategic-level and tactical-level open-pit mine optimisation problems, which are respectively termed ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limit</b> (UPIT) or constrained <b>pit</b> <b>limit</b> (CPIT). However, many researchers {{indicate that the}} substantial numbers of variables and constraints in real-world instances (e. g., with 50 - 1000 thousand blocks) make the CPIT’s mixed integer programming (MIP) model intractable for use. Thus, it becomes a considerable challenge to solve the large scale CPIT instances without relying on exact MIP optimiser {{as well as the}} complicated MIP relaxation/decomposition methods. To take this challenge, two new graph-based algorithms based on network flow graph and conjunctive graph theory are developed by taking advantage of problem properties. The performance of our proposed algorithms is validated by testing recent large scale benchmark UPIT and CPIT instances’ datasets of MineLib in 2013. In comparison to best known results from MineLib, it is shown that the proposed algorithms outperform other CPIT solution approaches existing in the literature. The proposed graph-based algorithms leads to a more competent mine scheduling optimisation expert system because the third-party MIP optimiser is no longer indispensable and random neighbourhood search is not necessary...|$|R

40|$|Similar to the mixed-integer {{programming}} library (MIPLIB), {{we present}} a library of publicly available test problem instances for three classical types of open pit mining problems: the ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limit</b> problem and two variants of open pit production scheduling problems. The ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limit</b> problem determines a set of notional three-dimensional blocks containing ore and/or waste material to extract to maximize value subject to geospatial precedence constraints. Open pit production scheduling problems seek to determine when, if ever, a block is extracted from an open pit mine. A typical objective is to maximize the net present value of the extracted ore; constraints include precedence and upper bounds on operational resource usage. Extensions of this problem can include (i) lower bounds on operational resource usage, (ii) the determination of whether a block is sent to a waste dump, i. e., discarded, or to a processing plant, i. e., to a facility that derives salable mineral from the block, (iii) average grade constraints at the processing plant, and (iv) inventories of extracted but unprocessed material. Although open pit mining problems have appeared in academic literature {{dating back to the}} 1960 s, no standard representations exist, and there are no commonly available corresponding data sets. We describe some representative open pit mining problems, briefly mention related literature, and provide a library consisting of mathematical models and sets of instances, available on the Internet. We conclude with directions for use of this newly established mining library. The library serves not only as a suggestion of standard expressions of and available data for open pit mining problems, but also as encouragement for the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms...|$|R

In this technique, production costs and different recoveries of heap leaching method directed into modeling different annual cash flows in copper mines. Considering the governing constraints, the Lagrange multiplier method is practiced to optimize the cut-off grades in which the objective function is supposed to maximize Net Present Value.

It has an ongoing program of coal resource assessment to optimise future mines within this 20 year period, using a six step resource and mine planning process. Desktop review and conceptual study at preliminary Levels 1 and 2 are based on general coal resource information. Further coal resource investigations are carried out for the more detailed evaluations in secondary assessment, prefeasibility study, feasibility study and detailed engineering from Levels 3 to 6. At Levels 1 and 2, completing conceptual planning, including preliminary resource evaluation and economic appraisal to the target cost uncertainty level of ± 33 per cent, is challenging in New Zealand’s highly variable geological and geographical conditions. Where coal deposit geometries are relatively simple, approximate methods for determining <b>pit</b> <b>limits</b> using overburden strip ratios, seam thickness, physical boundaries, and quality cut-offs may be sufficient. Many New Zealand coalfields are however complicated structurally, with multiple seams and extensive folding and faulting. Coal seams are characterised by variable dip, thickness, and quality over relatively short distances. In the North Island’s Waikato coalfields, coal is typically overlain by weak sediments and clay rich strata that necessitate very flat cut and fill slope angles. The proximity of these deposits to major infrastructure (including towns, highways and rail lines), significant environmental features such as the Waikato river and lakes, and valuable dairy farmland, add further complexity. Traditional preliminary mine planning techniques applied in these conditions are insufficient. Pit optimisation software, widely used in the metalliferous mining industry since the 1980 s, offers the ability to analyse many more specific factors affecting <b>pit</b> <b>limits,</b> mine layouts, and economics, with more rigour and for a much larger number of scenarios, than traditional methods allow.

40|$|The {{speed and}} {{complexity}} of globalisation and reduction of natural resources on the one hand, and interests of large multinational corporations on the other, necessitates proper management of mineral resources and consumption. The need for scientific research and application of new methodologies and approaches to maximise Net Present Value (NPV) within mining operations is essential. In some cases, drill core logging in the field may result in an inadequate level of information and subsequent poor diagnosis of geological phenomenon which may undermine the delineation or separation of mineralised zones. This is because the interpretation of individual loggers is subjective. However, modelling based on logging data is absolutely essential to determine the architecture of an orebody including ore distribution and geomechanical features. For instance, ore grades, density and RQD values {{are not included in}} conventional geological models whilst variations in a mineral deposit are an obvious and salient feature. Given the problems mentioned above, a series of new mathematical methods have been developed, based on fractal modelling, which provide a more objective approach. These have been established and tested in a case study of the Kahang Cu-Mo porphyry deposit, central Iran. Recognition of different types of mineralised zone in an ore deposit is important for mine planning. As a result, it is felt that the most important outcome of this thesis is the development of an innovative approach to the delineation of major mineralised (supergene and hypogene) zones from ‘barren’ host rock. This is based on subsurface data and the utilisation of the Concentration-Volume (C-V) fractal model, proposed by Afzal et al. (2011), to optimise a Cu-Mo block model for better determination of an ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limit.</b> Drawing on this, new approaches, referred to Density–Volume (D–V) and RQD-Volume (RQD-V) fractal modelling, have been developed and used to delineate rock characteristics in terms of density and RQD within the Kahang deposit (Yasrebi et al., 2013 b; Yasrebi et al., 2014). From the results of this modelling, the density and RQD populations of rock types from the studied deposit showed a relationship between density and rock quality based on RQD values, which can be used to predict final pit slope. Finally, the study introduces a Present Value-Volume (PV-V) fractal model in order to identify an accurate excavation orientation with respect to economic principals and ore grades of all determined voxels within the obtained ultimate <b>pit</b> <b>limit</b> in order to achieve an earlier pay-back period.
