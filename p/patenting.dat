5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from <b>patenting</b> the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum tubes or computer games.|$|E
5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular diagnostics {{has become more}} important, so has the debate about <b>patenting</b> of the genetic discoveries at its heart. In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with breast cancer. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that a naturally occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Kempelen, the Turk {{remained}} unexhibited until some time before 1804 when Kempelen's son decided {{to sell it to}} Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included <b>patenting</b> a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E

50|$|Europe {{does not}} {{comprise}} a unitary <b>patent</b> system.

5|$|Modern {{reference}} books about aviation history represent the Coandă-1910 in various ways, if they mention the machine or the inventor at all.

5|$|Dreyfuss {{announced}} that unlike established wooden ballparks {{such as the}} Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity—the {{first of its kind}} in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design. Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium's design, giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and <b>patenting</b> a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain.|$|E
5|$|She {{was known}} for her honesty and {{moderate}} life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 {{as soon as she}} began earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from <b>patenting</b> the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after leaving}} the Edison company, Tesla was working on <b>patenting</b> an arc {{lighting}} system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. Tesla worked {{for the rest of}} the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of <b>patent</b> {{citations}} on <b>patent</b> renewal behaviour? <b>Patent</b> citations are commonly used as an indicator of technology spillovers.

On the one hand, <b>patent</b> citations may indicate a scientific breakthrough, a high value of the cited <b>patent</b> and therefore a long survival period. On the other hand, <b>patent</b> citations may indicate competing innovations that render the cited <b>patent</b> obsolete. By discriminating <b>patents</b> by technology field, it is demonstrated that <b>patents</b> that receive citations across technology fields survive longer than other <b>patents.</b> <b>Patents</b> that receive citations within the same technology field lapse earlier...|$|R
