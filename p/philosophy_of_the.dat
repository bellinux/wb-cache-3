5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist.

40|$|The {{relatively}} recent trend {{seems to be}} to move away from General <b>Philosophy</b> <b>of</b> Science (GPoS) and towards <b>the</b> <b>philosophies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual sciences and to relocate whatever content GPoS is supposed to have to <b>the</b> <b>philosophies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sciences. I argue that scepticism or pessimism about <b>the</b> prospects <b>of</b> GPoS is unwarranted. I also argue {{that there can be no}} <b>philosophies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various sciences without GPoS. Defending these two claims is <b>the</b> main target <b>of</b> this chapter. I will show, however, that there is osmosis between GPoS and <b>the</b> Philosphies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sciences and that this osmosis is grounded on what I will call‘Science in general’ and the two important functions GPoS plays vis-à-vis Science-in-general: an explicative function and a critical function...|$|R

5|$|The Sex Party was a {{political}} party based in British Columbia, Canada. The party was guided by the <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sex-positive movement.

They advocated for the repeal of laws that promote antisexualism, such as prostitution laws and censorship. They also supported making Valentine's Day a statutory holiday and renaming Victoria Day to Eros Day.|$|E

5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or the <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski {{finding a way to}} retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{while working}} long hours on his {{definitive}} book on gear cutting machinery, his energy gave {{out and he}} suffered a “nervous breakdown.” He had {{to take time off}} to recover.

He continued to write on technical and other matters throughout his life and would develop a broader <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role of industry in society. In 1938, he received a Worcester Reed Warner Medal in recognition of his technical writing.|$|E
5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensations, which {{argued that the}} senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E

5|$|Many {{teachers}} at Sabha were Egyptian, {{and for the}} first time Gaddafi had access to pan-Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, most notably the Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs. Growing up, Gaddafi witnessed significant events rock the Arab world, including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic between 1958 and 1961. Gaddafi admired the political changes implemented in the Arab Republic of Egypt under his hero, President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser argued for Arab nationalism; the rejection of Western colonialism, neo-colonialism, and Zionism; and a transition from capitalism to socialism. Gaddafi was influenced by Nasser's book, <b>Philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolution, which outlined how to initiate a coup.|$|E

These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original.|$|E

It {{is one of the}} earliest American works of science fiction, and was relatively successful, earning Tucker $100 from the sale of 1000 copies. It received positive reviews from the American Quarterly Review and the Western Monthly Review. Tucker uses The Voyage to ridicule the social manners, religion and professions of some of his colleagues, and to criticize some erroneous scientific methods and results apparent to him at the time.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Han, I Ching {{scholarship}} was no longer organized into systematic schools. The most influential writer of this period was Wang Bi, who discarded the numerology of Han commentators and integrated the <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ten Wings directly into the central text of the I Ching, creating such a persuasive narrative that Han commentators were no longer considered significant. A century later Han Kangbo added commentaries on the Ten Wings to Wang Bi's book, creating a text called the Zhouyi zhu. The principal rival interpretation was a practical text on divination by the soothsayer Guan Lu.|$|E
5|$|Development of System Shock 2 {{began in}} 1997 when Looking Glass Studios {{approached}} Irrational Games {{with an idea}} to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans of System Shock and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella Heart of Darkness. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, according to its pitch document, was Junction Point. The <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design was to continue to develop {{the concept of a}} dungeon crawler, like , in a science fiction setting, the basis for System Shock. However, the press mistook System Shock to be closer to a Doom clone which was cited for poor financial success of System Shock. With Junction Point, the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from Doom.|$|E
