40|$|In Germany it is {{intended}} that each insurant in the compulsory health insurance will get a <b>Patient</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Card</b> by 2006 - 01 - 01. This project report characterizes {{the present state of}} the system architecture for the telematics infrastructure elaborated by the self-administration of German health care. The introduction of the <b>Patient</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Card</b> aims at increasing the quality in medical care as well as improvement of cost effectiveness and transparency of health care output. The great deal of actors and the high amount of requirements concerning law including data privacy, and engineering including security and reliability cause a highly complex project. The overall system architecture is based on legacy systems which are connected to the telematics infrastructure and its new services by special modules...|$|E
40|$|Health {{information}} systems supporting shared care {{are going to}} be distributed and interoperable. Dealing with sensitive personal medical information, such {{information systems}} have to provide appropriate security services, allowing only authorised users restricted access rights to the patients’ data according to the ‘need to know’ principle. Especially in healthcare, chip card based information systems occur in the shape of patient data cards providing informational self determination and mobility of the users as well as quality, integrity, accountability, and availability of the data stored on the card, thus improving the shared care of patients. The DIABCARD 1 project aims at the implementation and evaluation of a chip card based medical information system (CCMIS) for facilitating communication and co-operation between health professionals in different organisations or departments caring the same patient with diabetes as an example. In co-operation with the EC-funded TrustHealth 2 project, communication and application security services needed are provided like strong authentication as well as the derived services such as authorisation, access control, accountability, confidentiality, etc. The solution is based on Health Professional Cards and Trusted Third Party services. In addition to the secure handling of the patient's chip card and data in DIABCARD workstations, the secure communication between these workstations and related departmental systems has been implemented. Based on the results of this feasibility study, an enhanced security services specification for the DIABCARD example of a CCMIS is provided which will be implemented in the framework of a health network being established in the German federal state Bavaria. Beside the preferred solution of a combination of Patient Identification Card and <b>Patient</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Card,</b> lower level alternatives using card-verifiable certificates are explained in some details. Finally, a few legal issues, future trends like the XML standard set and their implications for the solution presented as well as for distributed health information systems in general are shortly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Communication and {{co-operation}} {{processes in}} healthcare and welfare require {{the involvement of}} all parties involved, including health professionals as well as patients. Generally, professionals can and will easily communicate via trusted health networks. To enforce both communication and co-operation between professionals and patients and to guarantee the required degree of involvement of patients in shared care environments, smart cards are widely used. They serve as person identifiers {{on the one hand}} and as security token on the other hand. Acting as storage media and portable application systems, <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> <b>cards</b> enable patient-controlled exchange and the use of personal health data for specific purposes such as prescription and disease management. Additionally, <b>patient</b> status <b>data</b> such as the emergency data or the immunisation record may be stored in and communicated by <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R
40|$|Communication and {{co-operation}} {{processes in}} the healthcare and welfare domain require a security infrastructure based on set-vices describing status and relation of communicating principals as well as corresponding keys and attributes. Additional services provide trustworthy information on dynamic issues of communication and co-operation such as time and location of processes, workflow relations, integrity of archives and record systems, and system behaviour. To provide this communication and co-operation in a shared care, environment, smart cards are widely used. Serving as storage media and portable application systems, <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> <b>cards</b> enable patient-controlled exchange and use of personal health data bound to specific purposes such as prescription and disease management. Additionally <b>patient</b> status <b>data</b> such as the emergency data set or immunization may be stored in, and communicated by, <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> <b>cards.</b> Another deployment field of smart cards is their token functionality within a security framework supporting basic security services such as identification, authentication, integrity, confidentiality, or accountability using cryptographic algorithms. In that context, keys, certificates, and card holder's attributes might be stored in the card as well. As an example, the German activity of introducing patient health cards and health professional cards is presented. Specification and enrolment aspects are on-going processes...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{explore the}} nature of managed-care hassles in primary care physicians' offices and to {{determine}} the feasibility of practice-based research methods to study the problem. Methods 16 internists and 10 family physicians volunteered to collect data about managed-care hassles during or shortly after the office visit for 15 consecutive <b>patients</b> using preprinted <b>data</b> <b>cards.</b> Outcome measures Number of hassles, time required for hassles, and interference with quality of care and doctor-patient relationship. Results Physicians adapted easily to using <b>data</b> <b>cards.</b> Before the pilot study, participants estimated a hassle rate of 10 % and thought that interference with quality of care and the doctor-patient relationship was infrequent. Of 376 total visits for which the physicians completed <b>data</b> <b>cards,</b> 23 % of visits generated 1 or more hassles. On average, a physician who saw 22 patients daily experienced 1 hassle lasting 10 minutes for every 4 to 5 patients. More than 40 % of hassles were reported as interfering with quality of care, the doctor-patient relationship, or both. Conclusions The high hassle rate, {{in addition to the}} interference of hassles with quality of care and the doctor-patient relationship, suggests the need for further investigation into managed-care hassles using practice-based research methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} and investigation of medical applications require <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> from various Electronic Health Records (EHRs) or Clinical Records (CRs). However, in practice, <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> is {{and should be}} protected to avoid unauthorized access or publicity, because of many reasons including privacy, security, ethics, and confidentiality. Thus, many researchers and developers encounter the problem to access required <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> for their research or to make <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> available for example to demonstrate the reproducibility of their results. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based approach of synthesizing large scale <b>patient</b> <b>data.</b> Our main {{goal is to make}} the generated <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> as realistic as possible, by using domain knowledge to control the data generation process. Such domain knowledge can be collected from biomedical publications such as those included in PubMed, from medical textbooks, or web resources (e. g. Wikipedia and medical websites). Collected knowledge is formalized in the <b>Patient</b> <b>Data</b> Definition Language (PDDL) for the <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> generation. We have implemented the proposed approach in our Advanced <b>Patient</b> <b>Data</b> Generator (APDG). We have used APDG to generate large scale data for breast cancer patients in the experiments of SemanticCT, a semantically-enabled system for clinical trials. The results show that the generated <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> is useful for various tests in the system. 1...|$|R
