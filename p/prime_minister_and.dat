5|$|As a young woman, Razafindrahety {{married an}} Andriana (nobleman) named Ratrimo (Ratrimoarivony).

According to rumor, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony may have arranged to have Ratrimo poisoned for political reasons. The Aristocratic Revolution of 1863, which had been orchestrated by Rainilaiarivony's older brother, Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, had replaced the absolute rule of the Andriana with a constitutional monarchy in which power was shared between an Andriana monarch and a Hova (freeman) prime minister. This arrangement was to be cemented by a political marriage between the <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>and</b> a ruling queen effectively selected by him. As Queen Ranavalona II neared death {{and the search for}} her successor began, Rainilaiarivony may have had Ratrimo deliberately poisoned so that Razafindrahety, the most eligible successor, would be free to marry the <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>and</b> succeed to the throne.|$|E
