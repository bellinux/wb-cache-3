Yashima struck a mine off <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> in May and capsized while under tow several hours later. Fuji fought in the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima and was lightly damaged in the latter action. She was reclassified as a coast defence ship in 1910 {{and served as a}} training ship {{for the rest of her}} active career. The ship was hulked in 1922 and converted into a barracks ship fitted with classrooms. Fuji was finally broken up for scrap in 1948.|$|E

Of the surviving Chinese warships from the battle, the Jiyuan was the least damaged. As the other surviving ships from the battle arrived in <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur,</b> their guns were dressed in red. Jiyuan was the exception, with no decoration and was docked away from the other vessels.|$|E

5|$|Petropavlovsk was {{the first}} of the three ships to enter service; she {{departed}} Kronstadt on 17 October 1899 and reached <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> on 10 May 1900. She became flagship of the Pacific Squadron commander, Vice Admiral Nikolai I. Skrydlov, upon her arrival. The ship supported international efforts to suppress the Boxer Rebellion in mid-1900. Poltava and Sevastopol departed for <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> on 15 October 1900 and arrived on 12 and 13 April 1901 respectively. Petropavlovsk was the flagship of Vice Admiral Oskar Victorovich Stark at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904.|$|E

500|$|After <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur's</b> Hotel Sabine {{burned to}} the ground in 1904, Gates decided that the city needed a good hotel to replace it. [...] In 1909, he {{proposed}} to build another, called the Plaza, on the site the Hotel Sabine had once occupied. [...] Gates could have easily afforded to finance the entire cost of the new hotel, but he wanted <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur's</b> residents to have an equal share in the venture. [...] Gates held local meetings and was happy to discuss the project or take pledges for the building fund at any time. After the pledges of local businessmen had reached US$150,000, Gates donated the remaining US$150,000, and the project began to be built by United States Realty Company.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to hockey, Wilson played baseball {{and served as}} a volunteer and executive in both sports.

5|$|Along {{with the}} evacuations, {{multiple}} watches and warnings were issued {{in accordance with}} Tropical Storm Chris. The first was on September9, when a gale warning was released for the Louisiana area east of <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur,</b> Texas. Fifteen hours afterwords, a gale warning was released for <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> to Port O'Connor, Texas. The next day, the gale warnings in Texas were extended {{as far south as}} Brownsville. A hurricane watch was released at 2200UTC on September10 for Morgan City, Louisiana to Port O'Connor, Texas. All watches and warnings were discontinued by 2200UTC on September11, which was about 10hours after Chris made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} {{blockade}} or bottle up the Russian squadron at <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> by sinking blockships in the harbor's channel, the Japanese under Admiral Togo formulated a new plan. Ships were to mine the entrance from {{the harbor and}} then lure the Russians into the minefield {{in the hopes of}} sinking a number of Russian warships. Under cover of four detachments of torpedo boat destroyers, the minelayer Koru-Maru began to lay mines near the entrance to <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> on the night of 31 March. The Japanese were observed by Admiral Makarov, who believed that they were Russian destroyers whom he had ordered to patrol that area.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Charles MacNaughton, {{minister}} of the Department of Highways, announced plans for the Lakehead Expressway to be built on {{the western edge of}} the twin cities of <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> and Fort William (which amalgamated in 1970 to form Thunder Bay).|$|E
500|$|Pattillo Higgins {{had begun}} a well on Spindletop in 1900, but {{ran out of}} money to {{continue}} drilling for oil. [...] Higgins went to Gates for funds to continue; Gates obliged and founded The Texas Company, later known as Texaco. His investment entitled Gates to 46 percent of the company's stock. When Spindletop came in the next year, Gates was already in control of <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur's</b> docks, its refinery and the railroad needed to get the oil to market.|$|R
50|$|The {{newspaper}} has not {{missed an}} issue since March 17, 1897, when the Stump family, leaving Missouri, printed the first weekly edition in a baggage car {{of a train}} {{on the way to}} their new home. The News went daily (except Sunday) in 1901, and a Sunday edition was added in 1916 (although it was later abandoned, and then reintroduced). By 1920, all of <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur's</b> other newspapers had either folded or been bought out by The News.|$|R
5|$|However, the Japanese retreated beyond <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur's</b> gunfire support range, and {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by main forces of six battleships. At 0850, Makarov turned around {{to head back to}} the harbor and join with three other battleships that had just left. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, about two miles from the shore, on 9.42 Petropavlosk detonated a Japanese-laid mine on her port side. Petropavlovsk sank, taking 27 officers and 652 men, including Admiral Makarov and war artist Vasily Vereshchagin with her. A monument was constructed in Saint Petersburg in 1913 to honor Stephan Makarov after Japanese divers identified his remains inside the wreck of Petropavlovsk and gave him a burial at sea.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the tropical cyclone watches and warnings, several other actions were taken as Chantal approached. More than 600oil workers were moved inland, though a man drowned while attempting to evacuate a rig south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mayor of <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> Malcolm Grant asked 800residents to evacuate Sabine Pass, due to potential coastal flooding isolating the area. Shelters were opened at various schools in <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> and Beaumont. In nearby Orange, crews at emergency centers distributed sand bags. About 8,500residents of Cameron Parish, Louisiana evacuated, with at least 67people taking shelter at a school in Lake Charles. An additional 2,500people fled Grand Isle, as {{the threat of the}} only road to the island flooding loomed.|$|E
5|$|No {{impact was}} {{reported}} in the Florida Keys. Strong winds in southwestern Louisiana damaged crops and toppled windmills. Offshore, boats and schooners suffered severe damage from wind-driven waves. Severe damage occurred in eastern Texas, with strong winds and storm surge damaging or destroying numerous buildings, houses, and crops in several cities, including Beaumont, New Sabine Pass, Orange, Sabine Pass, and <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur.</b> The storm was considered the worst in Orange since 1875. Overall, the storm caused at least 29fatalities in Texas, with six died at <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur,</b> three offshore, four in Sabine Pass, and sixteen others at Beaumont. Damage in the state reached approximately $150,000.|$|E
5|$|Sevastopol {{began her}} sea trials on 16 October 1899, and was {{commissioned}} after their conclusion into the Imperial Russian Navy. She {{and her sister}} ships were transferred to <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur,</b> which was then the port of the First Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet. In September 1900, Popov radios were installed on Sevastopol and her sister Poltava, the first Russian battleships to have them. They were also painted white, {{the same color as}} the other ships in the First Pacific Squadron. She then left for <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> and arrived at on 13 April 1901. As Russia was not at war with any Far East countries at that time, Sevastopol stayed in port, inactive.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{permanently}} eliminate <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur's</b> battle squadron, the IJN initiated three operations. The {{first was a}} surprise destroyer torpedo attack inside the harbor in early February 1904. This was quickly followed up with an attempt to block the harbor's entrance by sinking old steam ships (block ships) in the channel. The third and final attempt of permanently bottling up the fleet was the mining of the waters surrounding the harbor's entrance. [...] Although this last attempt also failed, it had the unintended consequence of robbing the Russian Navy {{of one of its}} most brilliant naval officers, Admiral Stepan Makarov. When his flagship, the battleship Petropavlovsk, struck one of those mines she sank almost immediately, drowning Makarov with the crew.|$|R
5000|$|The {{scale and}} nature of the killing {{continues}} to be debated. Japanese participants reported mountains of corpses, yet the number of dead was difficult to calculate; Cowan said it was difficult to tell if the corpses numbered in the hundreds or thousands. Creelman asserted up to 60,000 were killed, with only 36 spared, and even some late-20th century Japanese sources repeat the figure of 60,000. According to Stewart Lone, {{it is unlikely that the}} Japanese has so massacred the population that only 36 remained, citing [...] "the speed with which <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur's</b> streets again filled after the Japanese occupation", because [...] "had the civilian population been literally decimated or destroyed, it is unlikely that others would have ventured to trade and work under Japanese occupation".|$|R

5|$|Sevastopol saw {{service in}} the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. Slightly damaged during a {{surprise}} attack on <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> in early February, the ship later participated in several attempts to break out from the besieged port. The most notable of these was the Battle of the Yellow Sea, where she was damaged by several shells but managed {{to make it back}} to port with the remnants of the Russian Fleet, leaving one crewman dead and 62 wounded. Immediately after the surrender of <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur,</b> Sevastopol was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese never raised her. The remains of the ship still lie outside the entrance to the port.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Russo-Japanese War the sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet, although Asama was attached to the 4th Division of Rear Admiral Uryū Sotokichi for operations near Seoul, Korea. Just before the war began, the ship escorted Japanese troop convoys to Chemulpo, Seoul's port on the west coast, and helped to sink the two Russian warships stationed there {{on the first day of}} the war. Tokiwa participated in the Battle of <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> that same day, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur.</b> Tōgō had expected the earlier surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1910–11, the NHA {{contracted}} {{and imposed}} a salary cap, leading {{many of the}} Ottawa players to threaten to form a competing league. However, team owners controlled the rinks and the players accepted the new conditions. For Ottawa players, conditions did not deteriorate much as the club provided bonuses after the season. Ottawa gained revenge for the previous loss to Renfrew by defeating Renfrew 19–5. The team went 13–3 to win the NHA and inherit the Stanley Cup; Marty Walsh and Dubby Kerr led the goal scoring with 37 and 32 goals in 16 games. After the season Ottawa played two challenges, against Galt, winning 7–4, and against <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur,</b> winning 13–4. In the <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> game Marty Walsh came close to matching Frank McGee's total, scoring ten goals. 1910–11 was the debut season of right winger Jack Darragh who scored 18 goals in 16 games.|$|E

5|$|In early March, Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō was tasked to {{take the}} {{reinforced}} 2nd Division north and make a diversion off Vladivostok. While scouting for Russian ships in the area, the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect. Upon their return to Japan a few days later, the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the Imperial Guards Division to Korea and then to join the ships blockading <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur.</b> Yakumo was then transferred to Rear Admiral Dewa Shigetō's 3rd Division. On 23 June, the ship was Dewa's flagship when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to <b>Port</b> <b>Arthur</b> when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he {{did not wish to}} engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.|$|E
