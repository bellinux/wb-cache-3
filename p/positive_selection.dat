5|$|The CD155 gene {{appears to}} have been subject to <b>positive</b> <b>selection.</b> The protein has several domains of which domain D1 {{contains}} the polio virus binding site. Within this domain, 37 amino acids are responsible for binding the virus.|$|E
5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as <b>positive</b> <b>selection</b> vectors.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{analysis}} combining sites across genes {{shows that}} while both HA and NA undergo substantial <b>positive</b> <b>selection,</b> internal genes show {{low rates of}} amino acid fixation relative to levels of polymorphism, suggesting an absence of <b>positive</b> <b>selection.</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an allele exchange system for shuttling sequences of DNA to and from their original chromosomal loci. Cloned segments of the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium and the lactose operon of Escherichia coli served as target sequences and were used to develop the system. Replacement and retrieval of target sequences used the phage M 13 mp vectors and proceeded through an M 13 lysogen intermediate. The intermediates and products of allele exchange were characterized by genetic and hybridization analyses. Several unique properties of M 13 lysogens were exploited to devise <b>positive</b> <b>selections</b> to detect integration and excision. These <b>positive</b> <b>selections</b> were used to manipulate phenotypically silent alleles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As a {{protein-encoding}} gene evolves, dif-ferent selective pressures act on {{the gene}} temporally and spatially. An examination of the ratio of non-synonymous-to-synonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratios (Ka/Ks) {{has proven to be}} a valuable method to examine selective pressures on protein encoding genes, including detecting <b>positive</b> diversi-fying <b>selection.</b> To gain power over averaging all sites in a gene together, examination of sites in primary sequence windows has frequently been employed. However, selection acts on folded proteins and sites that are close in tertiary space may not be close in primary sequence. A new method for the examination of Ka/Ks ratios based upon windows in tertiary structure is introduced and applied to the leptin gene family in mammals. Tertiary sequence windowing detects new sites under <b>positive</b> diversifying <b>selection</b> and detects <b>positive</b> diversifying <b>selection</b> with a more significant signal along various branches of the leptin gene family tree. Key words: <b>Positive</b> diversifying <b>selection</b> — Sub-stitution rate — Protein structure — Lepti...|$|R
25|$|MHC {{restriction}} {{occurs during}} lymphocyte {{development in the}} thymus through {{a process known as}} <b>positive</b> <b>selection.</b> T cells that do not receive a positive survival signal — mediated mainly by thymic epithelial cells presenting self peptides bound to MHC molecules — to their TCR undergo apoptosis. <b>Positive</b> <b>selection</b> ensures that mature T cells can functionally recognize MHC molecules in the periphery (i.e. elsewhere in the body).|$|E
25|$|About 98% of thymocytes die {{during the}} {{development}} processes in the thymus by failing either <b>positive</b> <b>selection</b> or negative selection, whereas the other 2% survive and leave the thymus to become mature immunocompetent T cells. Increasing evidence indicates microRNAs, which are small noncoding regulatory RNAs, could impact the clonal selection process during thymic development. For example, miR-181a was found {{to play a role}} in the <b>positive</b> <b>selection</b> of T lymphocytes.|$|E

25|$|Comparative {{genomics}} approaches {{were used}} to predict the function-relevant variants {{under the assumption that}} the functional genetic locus should be conserved across different species at an extensive phylogenetic distance. On the other hand, some adaptive traits and the population differences are driven by <b>positive</b> <b>selections</b> of advantageous variants, and these genetic mutations are functionally relevant to population specific phenotypes. Functional prediction of variants’ effect in different biological processes is pivotal to pinpoint the molecular mechanism of diseases/traits and direct the experimental validation.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} design {{thermostable}} proteins offers enormous {{potential for the}} development of novel protein bioreagents. In this work, a combined computational and experimental method was developed to increase the T m of the flavin mononucleotide based fluorescent protein Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain by 31 Celsius, thus extending its applicability in thermophilic systems. Briefly, the method includes five steps, the single mutant computer screening to identify thermostable mutant candidates, the experimental evaluation to confirm the <b>positive</b> <b>selections,</b> the computational redesign around the thermostable mutation regions, the experimental reevaluation and finally the multiple mutations combination. The adopted method is simple and effective, can be applied to other important proteins where other methods have difficulties, and therefore provides a new tool to improve protein thermostability...|$|R

40|$|Kimura (1983) deservedly {{stands as}} a {{statement}} of consensus among molecular evolutionists. It asserts {{that the overwhelming majority}} of fixations of mu-tations are selectively neutral. Selection (negative Dar-winian selection) relentlessly weeds out the strongly deleterious mutations. <b>Positive</b> Darwinian <b>selection</b> is rare. We agree with this theory, but we note that it deals with what happens most of the time. We believe that a minority of proteins are species specific and frequently exhibit <b>positive</b> Darwinian <b>selection.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present some evidence that protein inhibitors of serine proteinases exhibit in their evolution characteristics a sociated with <b>positive</b> Dar-winian <b>selection.</b> Although the "neutral theory " is now widely believed, there are still many "selectionists" who oppose it. However, the theory is based on or supported by five phenomenological generalizations, which are almost universally believed and which are explicitly or implicitly stated in most elementary bio-chemistry texts. As we point out later, the belief in these is so strong that it may in fact serve to thwart investigations that may challenge that belief. The five phenomenological generalizations are based on Kimura (1983), but they are not direct quotes, in order to make them as "theory free " as possible. We first acquaint the reader briefly with protein inhibitors of serine protein-ases and then show cases where their evolution seems to conflict with the generalization of the neutral theory...|$|R

The differences only show up in terms of the (minimal) restricted and sparse eigenvalues, favoring thresholding over the adaptive Lasso. As regards prediction and estimation, the difference is virtually negligible, but our bound for the number of false positives is larger for the adaptive Lasso than for thresholding. Moreover, both these two-stage methods add value to the one-stage Lasso in the sense that, under appropriate restricted and sparse eigenvalue conditions, they have similar prediction and estimation error as the one-stage Lasso, but substantially less false positives.
