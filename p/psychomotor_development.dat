25|$|Microcephalic osteodysplastic {{primordial}} dwarfism (MOPD) type II is an autosomal multisystem disorder including severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly with Seckel syndrome-like facial appearance, {{and distinctive}} skeletal alterations. Usually those affected have {{mild to moderate}} mental retardation. This female child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents at 35 weeks gestation through a cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation. She had a retarded <b>psychomotor</b> <b>development</b> and was repeatedly hospitalized during her {{first six months of}} life due to recurring respiratory infections. Her electroencephalography, auditory brainstem response evaluation, and chromosomal analysis were relatively normal. A brain MRI revealed thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri prominently in the frontal and posterior temporal regions, incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures, and dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly). Usually only mild brain malformations are associated with MOPD type II. The imaging findings of this child’s brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria, a mild form of lissencephaly. This child’s neurodevelopmental findings were mild when compared to previous reports of a well-defined chromosome 17-linked and X-linked lissencephaly in a bedridden patient with severe developmental delays.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether prenatal mercury exposure, including potential releases from the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster, adversely affects fetal growth and child development. METHODS: We determined maternal and umbilical cord blood total mercury of nonsmoking women who delivered at term in lower Manhattan after 11 September 2001, and measured birth outcomes and child development. RESULTS: Levels of total mercury in cord and maternal blood were not significantly higher for women who resided or worked within 1 or 2 miles of the WTC in the month after 11 September, compared with women who lived and worked farther away. Average cord mercury levels were more than twice maternal levels, and both were elevated in women who reported eating fish/seafood during pregnancy.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} somatic, <b>psychomotor,</b> and {{intellectual}} <b>development</b> of children conceived through intracytoplasmic single sperm injection (ICSI) {{over the whole}} preschool period. Design: Prospective, controlled, cohort study. Setting: Fertility clinic in Brussels, Belgium. Patient(s) : Sixty-six ICSI-conceived children prospectively compared with 52 IVF-conceived and 59 spontaneously conceived children. All children were full-term singletons. Intervention(s) : Home visits by a trained psychologist. Standardized interviews. Assessments using the revised Brunet-Lézine scale and the revised Wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Physical growth and general health. Formal developmental and intellectual assessments. Result(s) : Children conceived by ICSI were healthy: no significant differences appeared {{in the incidence of}} combined congenital malformations (11. 3 %), health problems (44. 1 %), surgical interventions (18. 6 %), and hospitalizations (6. 8 %), nor for the developmental assessments (mean developmental quotient at 9 months: 93. 9; at 18 months: 102. 0). For the intellectual assessments, the between-group differences disappeared when adjusted for levels of parental education (mean intelligence quotient at 3 years: 97. 0; at 5 years: 103. 3). Conclusion(s) : This pilot study shows that throughout the preschool period, ICSI-conceived children have <b>psychomotor</b> and intellectual <b>development</b> similar to that of IVF-conceived and spontaneously conceived children.

Intervention: a sustained and structured nurse home visiting antenatal and postnatal parenting education and support programme. Control: usual universal care. Main outcome measures: the quality of the home environment for child development (12 – 24 months), parent–child interaction and child mental, <b>psychomotor</b> and behavioural <b>development</b> at 18 months. Results: mothers receiving the intervention were more emotionally and verbally responsive (HOME observation) during the first 2 years of their child's life than comparison group mothers (mean difference 0. 5; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 9). Duration of breastfeeding was longer for intervention mothers than comparison mothers (mean difference 7. 9 weeks; 95 % CI 2. 9 to 12. 9).
