5|$|People with {{schizophrenia}} {{may have}} {{a high rate of}} irritable bowel syndrome but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked. Psychogenic <b>polydipsia,</b> or excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological reasons to drink, is relatively common in people with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (<b>polydipsia),</b> as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of weight loss, appetite loss, vomiting, polyuria, and <b>polydipsia</b> to the aforementioned symptoms {{may indicate that}} OFC {{is the result of}} parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma, an uncommon cancer of the parathyroid glands, is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual, even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents with. Symptoms are also often more severe. Generally, the presence of a palpable neck mass is also indicative of the cancer, occurring in approximately 50% of sufferers, but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin.|$|E
25|$|Habit {{drinking}} (in its severest form termed psychogenic <b>polydipsia)</b> is {{the most}} common imitator of diabetes insipidus at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most patients with habit <b>polydipsia</b> have no other detectable disease. The distinction is made during the water deprivation test, as some degree of urinary concentration above isoosmolar is usually obtained before the patient becomes dehydrated.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} MODY produce {{significant}} hyperglycemia and the typical signs and : increased thirst and urination (<b>polydipsia</b> and polyuria).|$|E
25|$|Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Nocturnal {{enuresis}} {{could be}} the presenting symptom of type 1 diabetes mellitus, classically associated with polyuria, <b>polydipsia,</b> and polyphagia; weight loss, lethargy, and diaper candidiasis may also be present in those with new-onset disease.|$|E
25|$|Decreased AVP release (neurogenic— i.e. due {{to alcohol}} {{intoxication}} or tumour) or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic, i.e. by mutation of V2 receptor or AQP) leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium concentration), polyuria (excess urine production), and <b>polydipsia</b> (thirst).|$|E
25|$|Dipsogenic DI or primary <b>polydipsia</b> {{results from}} {{excessive}} intake of fluids {{as opposed to}} deficiency of arginine vasopressin. It {{may be due to}} a defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, located in the hypothalamus; or due to mental illness. Treatment with DDAVP may lead to water intoxication.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors {{may also}} be used to help {{decrease}} excessive water consumption in people with schizophrenia resulting in psychogenic <b>polydipsia.</b> A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, enalapril lead to decreased consumption (determined by urine output and osmality) in 60% of people; the same effect has been demonstrated in other ACE inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and {{hemorrhage}} in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal symptoms quickly {{progress to}} severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Hemorrhage causes bloody feces (melena) and vomiting blood (hematemesis). The low blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss {{can lead to}} organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and GI tract and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (<b>polydipsia),</b> low urine production (oliguria), and bloody urine (hematuria).|$|E
25|$|The acute {{stage of}} the disease, {{occurring}} most often {{in the spring and}} summer, begins one to three weeks after infection and lasts for two to four weeks. Clinical signs include a fever, petechiae, bleeding disorders, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, discharge from the nose and eyes, and edema of the legs and scrotum. There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. Clinical signs of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, coughing, polyuria, <b>polydipsia,</b> lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as retinal hemorrhage and anterior uveitis, and neurological disease. Dogs that are severely affected can die from this disease.|$|E
25|$|Precautions {{should be}} taken in {{patients}} with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics along with other medications that affect blood sugar levels and should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. The liquid form (oral solution) of this medication may contain up to 15 grams of sugar per dose. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing {{at the beginning of}} treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including <b>polydipsia</b> (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (increased appetite), and weakness.|$|E
25|$|Since the glucose that {{normally}} enters the cells {{is unable to}} do so without insulin, it begins to build up in the blood where it can be seen as hyperglycemia or high blood glucose levels. The tubules of the kidneys are normally able to re-absorb glucose, but they are unable to handle and process the amount of glucose they are being presented with. At this point, which is called the renal threshold, the excess glucose spills into the urine (glycosuria), where it can be seen in urine glucose testing. It is the polyuria, or over-frequent urination, which causes <b>polydipsia,</b> or excessive water consumption, through an osmotic process. Even though there is an overabundance of glucose, the lack of insulin does not allow it to enter the cells. As a result, they are not able to receive nourishment from their normal glucose source. The body begins using fat for this purpose, causing weight loss; the process {{is similar to that of}} starvation.|$|E
500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and <b>polydipsia.</b> The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst {{diabetes}} insipidus usually occurs with <b>polydipsia,</b> {{it can also}} rarely occur {{not only in the}} absence of <b>polydipsia</b> but in the presence of its opposite, adipsia (or hypodipsia). [...] "Adipsic {{diabetes insipidus}}" [...] is recognised as a marked absence of thirst even in response to hyperosmolality. In some cases of adipsic DI, the patient may also fail to respond to desmopressin.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{symptoms}} of vitamin D overdose which {{are those of}} hypercalcemia including anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. [...] These may be followed by polyuria, <b>polydipsia,</b> weakness, insomnia, nervousness, pruritus and ultimately renal failure. [...] Furthermore, proteinuria, urinary casts, azotemia, and metastatic calcification (especially in the kidneys) may develop. [...] Other {{symptoms of}} vitamin D toxicity include mental retardation in young children, abnormal bone growth and formation, diarrhea, irritability, weight loss, and severe depression.|$|E
2500|$|When the glucose {{concentration}} in the blood remains high over time, the kidneys will reach a threshold of reabsorption, and glucose will be excreted in the urine (glycosuria). [...] This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production (polyuria) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume will be replaced osmotically from water held in body cells and other body compartments, causing dehydration and increased thirst (<b>polydipsia).</b>|$|E
2500|$|This test {{measures}} {{the changes in}} body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld to induce dehydration. [...] The body's normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. [...] Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In primary <b>polydipsia,</b> the urine osmolality should increase and stabilize at above 280 Osm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus. Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour {{for at least three}} hours. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time consuming to perform.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{behavioral}} {{psychologists have}} disputed Skinner's [...] "superstition" [...] {{explanation for the}} behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's [...] "adventitious reinforcement" [...] explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the terminal response, which occurred in anticipation of food, and interim responses, that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food. Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their [...] "autoshaping" [...] procedures. The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced <b>polydipsia</b> seen {{in a similar situation}} with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).|$|E
2500|$|Thin Sow Syndrome (TSS) is a {{behavior}} observed in stalled sows {{that is similar}} to AA where some sows after early pregnancy are extremely active, eat little and waste away, resulting very often in death. They suffer from emaciation, hypothermia, a depraved appetite, restlessness and hyperactivity. [...] The syndrome may mainly be related to social and environmental stressors. [...] Stress in stalled sows is often perceived as the consequence of the restraint of animals that happens in intensive production units. The sows that suffer the most restraining conditions are those lactating or pregnant as they have very little room to move around because they are kept in barred gestation crates or tethered for the 16 weeks of pregnancy which prevents natural and social behaviors. [...] However, increased movement and freedom is also stressful for adult sows, which is usually the case after weaning. When placed into groups they fight vigorously, with one dominant sow emerging that eats voraciously. It is also likely that two subordinate sows make up part of the group who actively avoid competitive feeding situations and are bullied by the dominant sow. Affected sows have poor appetite but often show pica, excessive water intake (<b>polydipsia)</b> and are anemic.|$|E
5000|$|Primary <b>polydipsia</b> {{is a form}} of <b>polydipsia</b> characterised by {{excessive}} {{fluid intake}} in the absence of physiological stimuli to drink. This includes psychogenic <b>polydipsia</b> (PPD), which is caused by psychiatric disorders, often schizophrenia, and often accompanied by the sensation of dry mouth. Some forms of primary <b>polydipsia</b> are explicitly non-psychogenic. Primary <b>polydipsia</b> is a diagnosis of exclusion.|$|E
50|$|Primary <b>polydipsia</b> {{describes}} excessive thirst {{and water}} intake caused {{in the absence}} of physiological stimuli to drink. This includes both psychogenic primary <b>polydipsia</b> and non-psychogenic primary <b>polydipsia,</b> such as in patients with autoimmune chronic hepatitis with severely elevated globulin levels.|$|E
5000|$|The terms primary <b>polydipsia</b> and {{psychogenic}} <b>polydipsia</b> {{are sometimes}} incorrectly used interchangeably - {{to be considered}} psychogenic, the patient needs to have some other psychiatric symptoms, such as delusions involving fluid intake or other unusual behaviours. Primary <b>polydipsia</b> may have physiological causes, such as autoimmune hepatitis.|$|E
5000|$|In waterfowl, <b>polydipsia</b> can be {{a symptom}} of duck virus enteritis. [...] <b>Polydipsia</b> has also been listed as a symptom of many diseases, {{including}} ...|$|E
50|$|Since primary <b>polydipsia</b> is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion, the diagnosis may be made for patients who have medically unexplained excessive thirst, and this is sometimes incorrectly referred to as psychogenic rather than primary <b>polydipsia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polydipsia</b> can be {{the result}} of a bird having {{ingested}} a toxin, or overconsumption of natural substances. For example, in pet birds, crackers, snack items, chips, fast foods, and canned vegetables (unrinsed) if eaten in sufficient quantities may cause a mild salt toxicity (5-10 times requirement) and subsequent <b>polydipsia.</b> [...] <b>Polydipsia</b> can result from zinc poisoning to which caged birds may be particularly susceptible because of the zinc coating often used on birdcage bars.|$|E
50|$|Another {{cause is}} {{psychogenic}} <b>polydipsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under {{experimental}} conditions where birds receive reinforcements on a strict schedule, for example receiving one pellet of food each minute often indicated by a tone or other stimulus, the birds may develop <b>polydipsia.</b> Under these {{conditions it is}} called schedule induced <b>polydipsia</b> or sometimes, adjunctive drinking.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Polydipsia</b> is {{excessive}} thirst or excess drinking. The word {{derives from}} the Greek [...] (...) [...] "very thirsty", which is derived from [...] ( [...] , [...] "much, many") + [...] ( [...] , [...] "thirst"). <b>Polydipsia</b> is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals, such as in birds.|$|E
5000|$|While {{psychogenic}} <b>polydipsia</b> {{is generally}} not found outside the population of serious mental disorders, there is some anecdotal evidence of a milder form (typically called 'habit polydipsia' or 'habit drinking') {{that can be found}} in the absence of psychosis or other mental conditions. The excessive levels of fluid intake may result in a false diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, since the chronic ingestion of excessive water can produce diagnostic results that closely mimic those of mild diabetes insipidus. As discussed in the entry on diabetes insipidus, [...] "Habit drinking (in its severest form termed psychogenic <b>polydipsia)</b> is the most common imitator of diabetes insipidus at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most patients with habit <b>polydipsia</b> have no other detectable disease.
