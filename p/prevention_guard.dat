50|$|The {{fire started}} when {{lightning}} struck {{the south side}} of Mann Gulch at the Gates of the Mountains, a canyon over five miles long that cuts through a series of 1,200 foot cliffs. The place was noted and named by Lewis and Clark on their journey west in 1805. The fire was spotted by forest ranger James O. Harrison around noon on August 5, 1949. Harrison, a college student at Montana State University, was working the summer as recreation and fire <b>prevention</b> <b>guard</b> for the Meriwether Canyon Campground. He had been a smokejumper the previous year but had given it up because of the danger. As a ranger, he still had a responsibility to watch for and help fight fires, but it was not his primary role. On this day, he fought the fire on his own for four hours before he met the crew of smokejumpers who had been dispatched from Hale Field, Missoula, Montana, in a C-47.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, some {{stores such as}} JB Hi-Fi, BestBuy and Costco {{take this}} to the extreme and an {{additional}} further measure and process of conducting receipt inspection {{to make sure the}} customer is purchasing the correct item. There is another theft scheme, in which people can conceal items and then only pay for one item. Normally this is either done by customers or employees. Loss <b>prevention</b> /security <b>guard</b> would normally only ask for a bag check. The purpose is to reduce and decrease retail theft and shoplifting.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{new design}} concept named as active guard ring and related circuit {{implementation}} {{to improve the}} latch-up immunity of ICs are proposed. Using additional sensing circuit and active buffer to turn ON the electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection transistors, the large-dimensional ESD (or I/O) devices can provide or receive extra compensation current to the negative or positive current perturbation during the latch-up current test. The new proposed solution has been verified in 0. 6 -µm 5 V process to have much higher latch-up resistance compared with the conventional <b>prevention</b> method of <b>guard</b> ring in CMOS technology.

40|$|This Alert {{described}} five {{cases in}} which persons were scalped when their hair became entangled around inadequately guarded rotating drivelines or shafts of farm equipment driven by power take offs. Four cases involved women who were baling hay. In the fifth case, a 12 year old girl was asked by her father to check the bale counter. All five of the incidents involved inadequately guarded drivelines and victims who were standing or walking near rotating drivelines. The drivelines involved were guarded by inverted U-shaped tunnel guards that did not completely enclose the drivelines. The drivelines were located about 4 feet above the ground, limiting visibility of the hazard. The drivelines concerned were associated with Models 54 A, 54 B, 58, and 62 of a bale thrower manufactured by New Holland prior to 1976. A retrofit safety shield kit has been available since 1976 for these older models. To prevent accidents, the power take off should be disengaged and the tractor turned off before leaving the tractor seat or approaching a driveline. Power take off driven machinery should be examined for U-shaped tunnel guards; all such guards should be replace with retrofit <b>guards.</b> <b>Prevention</b> and ControlOccupational Healt...|$|R
40|$|Even a {{modestly}} effective HIV- 1 vaccine {{would be}} highly useful in India and could avoid millions of deaths. How should such a vaccine be introduced? Based on evidence of adoption of other vaccines in India, current levels of spending on them and coverage of prevention programs targeting both high- and low-risk groups, Seshadri, Subramaniyam, and Jha assess the potential demand for and strategic use of an HIV- 1 vaccine in the four southern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. The authors also discuss potential strategies for delivery of the vaccine, prioritization for vaccination, and the political economyof such a vaccine in India. Assuming a vaccine cost of $ 10 a dose and including estimated delivery costs, {{the total cost of}} vaccinating 21. 6 million adolescents 11 - 14 years of age and 1 percent of adults would be Rs. 12. 25 billion (US$ 245 million). To maintain the vaccination rate in the 11 - 14 year old cohort, an additional 6. 77 million in that age range would have to be vaccinated each year, at a vaccine cost of Rs. 3. 39 billion (US$ 67. 5 million). An HIV- 1 vaccine will greatly reduce HIV/AIDS in India, but it will not be a panacea. There will be a continued need for effective <b>prevention</b> programs to <b>guard</b> against behavior reversals or an imperfect vaccine. Key inputs for prevention, immunization, and treatment programs such as identification of various groups that could be immunized (vulnerable groups or general populations), strengthened surveillance, capacity building, operations research, and evaluation at local levels will continue to require intensive support.

40|$|This {{study was}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the influence of socio-cultural factors on HIV prevention strategies among HIV discordant couples in Harare, Zimbabwe. HIV sero-discordance is a scenario whereby one partner is HIV-positive and the other is HIV-negative. HIV sero-discordant couples are a unique and vulnerable population that encounters many peculiar challenges. When dealing with this population, researchers have to deal with contradictory ideas and perceptions presented by each partner making up the couples and also understand the relationship in the context of cultural values, norms and the dynamic of power and oppression. In addition to this, the concept of HIV sero-discordance and the frequency of its occurrence are poorly understood in most African communities. Despite the growing evidence of HIV discordance, HIV prevention strategies have largely focused on clinical aspects at the expense of socio-cultural issues that impact on HIV prevention strategies targeted at HIV sero- discordant couples. The study seeks to contribute to the conceptualization and design of intervention programs dealing with sero-discordance. The study is underpinned by the symbolic interactionism theory and was qualitative in design involving 13 HIV discordant couples in heterosexual relationships enrolled in the HIV Preventions Trials Network 052 Study (HPTN 052 Study) being undertaken by the University of Zimbabwe’s department of medicine. The study utilized 2 Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and 10 in-depth interviews (IDI) to collect data. The study’s findings indicate that discordant couples are in fact critical stakeholders in the uptake of all the available HIV prevention strategies. Failure to acknowledge this tenet is self-defeating as evidenced by the perception of viewing condom use within a marriage as humiliating for a woman. The study further noted that practitioners in the HIV <b>prevention</b> domain must <b>guard</b> against over-relying on the scientifically demonstrated efficacy of the strategies. The study recommends that HIV prevention strategies must be socially and culturally acceptable and embedded for them to be more efficacious. SociologyM. A.
