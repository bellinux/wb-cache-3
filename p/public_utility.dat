5|$|Eleven {{interchanges}} {{were built}} along the turnpike, {{most of which}} were trumpet interchanges where all ramps merge at the toll booths; only the New Stanton, Carlisle and Middlesex interchanges did not follow this design.

Large exit signs were used, and road signs had cat's-eye reflectors to increase visibility at night; billboards were prohibited.

5|$|In 1948 floods {{swept through}} the Columbia watershed, {{destroying}} Vanport, then the second largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities {{as far north as}} Trail, British Columbia. The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the Flood Control Act of 1950, authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other flood control mechanisms. By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> district in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.|$|E

5|$|In Belgium, the {{religion}} was organized as an association without lucrative purpose (asbl) in 1922 {{and was immediately}} registered as organism of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> on a request of the Department of Justice.

It was published in the Journal Officiel de la République Française of 9 February 1924, and the last modification of the statutes appeared in the JO of 3 August 1988.

5|$|Power remains {{relatively}} inexpensive along the Columbia, {{and in recent}} years high-tech companies like Google have begun to move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power. Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E

5|$|The larger US dams {{are owned}} and {{operated}} by the federal government (some by the Army Corps of Engineers and some by the Bureau of Reclamation), while the smaller dams are operated by <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> districts, and private power companies. The federally operated system is known as the Federal Columbia River Power System, which includes 31dams on the Columbia and its tributaries. The system has altered the seasonal flow of the river in order to meet higher electricity demands during the winter. At the beginning of the 20thcentury, roughly 75percent of the Columbia's flow occurred in the summer, between April and September. By 1980, the summer proportion had been lowered to about 50percent, essentially eliminating the seasonal pattern.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the {{railroad}} was {{brought before the}} New Jersey Board of <b>Public</b> <b>Utility</b> Commissioners due to an accident on November 28, 1916, at Kingsland station. Passenger train No. 582, a special train for employees of the Canadian Car Company, had near stopped at Kingsland station. The train never left at any defined time, although averaged around 6:30 in the evening. However, around 6:30that evening, Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at {{a high rate of}} speed, and as a result could not slow down fast enough to avoid hitting passengers. At that time, the station had no inter-track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks, and because of this, people could board trains from either platform. That day the engineer of Train No. 479 was unable to see the platform or the special train, and {{due to the lack of}} signals, had no information until the train knowing anything until the train left the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel. However, signals were set for west-bound trains if problems were to occur. After the accident, the Board requested the Lackawanna to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents, while the Canadian Car Company moved its boarding to the company's rail siding.|$|E

40|$|Most <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> {{depend on}} {{electric}} power to function, so it is paramount that a constant power source is available. These <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> get their supply from the public mains {{and in the case}} where the public mains fails a back-up power source is necessary to ensure the continuous operation of the <b>public</b> <b>utilities.</b> Switching the <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> from the mains to the back-up power creates a period of time when the utilities will be without power and the longer the time delay the lesser the efficiency of the <b>public</b> <b>utilities.</b> The stress of manual switching also makes the utilities inefficient. Examples of these <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> are street lights, traffic lights, water pumps and traffic sign indicators. A device that completely eliminates the stress of manually switching <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> from the mains supply to the back-up supply is the Automatic Mains and Phase Changer (AMPC). It also greatly reduces the power outage time delay experience during the switching. This paper reports a research that evaluates the relationship between the stress levels during manual load switching and the stress levels using the AMPC for automatic load switching. It also evaluates the relationship between the time lag experienced {{with the use of the}} AMPC and the time lag experienced when the switching is done manually...|$|R
