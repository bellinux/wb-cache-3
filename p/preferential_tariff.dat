5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E

2500|$|There was, however, one cargo {{that the}} ship-owners {{did not have}} to worry about finding a market for in the sparsely {{populated}} New World: people. [...] Many of the timber ships turned to carrying immigrants for the return voyage from the British Isles to fill this unused capacity. [...] Timber ships would unload their cargo and sell passage to those desiring to emigrate. During the early nineteenth century, with the <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> in full effect, the timber ships were among the oldest and most dilapidated in the British merchant fleet, and travelling as a passenger upon them was extremely unpleasant and dangerous. It was, however, very cheap. [...] Since timber exports would peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, such as the Napoleonic Wars, a great mass of refugees sought this cheap passage across the Atlantic.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the {{maquiladora}} program {{was in place}} far before NAFTA, in some sense dating {{all the way back}} to 1965. [...] A maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into Mexico either tariff free (NAFTA) or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis (18 months) and then using Mexico's relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export. [...] Prior to NAFTA maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> rates by the Mexican government so long as the finished good was for export. [...] The US, prior to NAFTA, allowed Maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the US with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non US raw materials used to produce the good, thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries. [...] NAFTA has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries, but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of NAFTA.|$|E

60|$|A {{vote of censure}} is a {{very serious}} thing. When it is moved with great {{formality}} on behalf of the official Opposition, it is intended always to raise a plain and decisive issue. I must, however, observe that of all the votes of censure which have been proposed in recent times in this House, the one we are now discussing is surely the most curious. The last Government was broken up three years ago on this very question of Imperial preference. After the Government had been broken up, a continuous debate proceeded in the country for two years and a half, and it was terminated by the general election. This Parliament is the result of that election, and {{there is not a single}} gentleman on this Ministerial Bench who is not pledged, in the most specific terms, not to grant a <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> to the Colonies. Now, because we have kept that promise, because we are opposed to preferential tariffs, because we have declined to grant preferential tariffs, and because we have done what all along we declared we were going to do, and were returned to do, we are made the object of this vote of censure.|$|E
60|$|It is {{perfectly}} impossible to discuss colonial preference {{apart from the}} schedule of duties on which {{it is to be}} based. It is idle to attempt to discuss it without a definite proposal as to the subjects of taxation and as to the degree to which those different subjects are to be taxed. And the right hon. gentleman the Member for West Birmingham, when he dealt with this question, felt that in common fairness he must be precise and definite. We know what he proposed in the way of taxation on corn, meat, fruit, and dairy produce. What we want to know is this. Is that tariff before us now? Do the Opposition stand by the right hon. Member for West Birmingham, or do they abandon him? That is what the House and the Government want to know--and that is what the Colonies want to know. It is indispensable to the discussion of this question {{that there should be a}} clear statement from the Leader of the Opposition whether or not we are to regard the Glasgow <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> of the right hon. Member for West Birmingham as still current as a practical policy.|$|E

60|$|I am {{speaking}} of the men visitors; the intellectual light of the women visitors, whatever it was, was much dispersed and intercepted by the screen behind which they were placed. I {{do not know why}} the women should be thus obscured, for, if the minds of members were in danger of being distracted by their presence, I should think they would be still more distracted when the element of mystery was added to it by the grille. Seen across the whole length of the House from the men's gallery the women looked as if tightly pressed against the grille, and had a curiously thin, phantasmal effect, or the effect of frescoed figures done very flat. To the imaginative spectator their state might have symbolized the relation of women to Parliamentary politics, of which we read much in English novels, and even English newspapers. Women take much more interest in political affairs in England than with us; that is well known; {{but it may not be}} so well known that they are in much greater enjoyment of the franchise, if the franchise is indeed a pleasure. I do not know whether they vote for school-committeemen, or whether there are school-committeemen for them to vote for; but they may vote for guardians of the poor, and may themselves be voted for to that office; and they may vote for members of the Urban Councils and the County Councils if they have property to be taxed by those bodies. This is the right for which our Revolution was made, though we continue, with regard to women, the Georgian heresy of taxation without representation; but it is doubtful to the barbarian whether good can come of women's mixing in parliamentary elections at which they have no vote. Of course, with us a like interference would be taken jocosely, ironically; it would, at the bottom, be a good joke, amusing from the tendency of the feminine temperament to acts of circus in moments of high excitement; but whether the Englishmen regard it so, the English, alone know. They are much more serious than we, and perhaps they take it as a fit manifestation of the family principle which is the underlying force of the British Constitution. One heard of ladies who were stumping (or whatever is the English equivalent of stumping) the country on the <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> question and the other questions which divide Conservatives and Liberals; but in spite of these examples of their proficiency the doubt remained whether those who have not the suffrage can profitably attempt to influence it. Till women can make up their minds to demand and accept its responsibilities, possibly they will do best to let it alone.|$|E

40|$|Many {{development}} experts {{worry that}} continuing reductions of tariff levels in high-income countries will limit trade flows from developing countries that benefit from preferential trade programs because of “preference erosion. ” Using {{a panel of}} U. S. import data between the years of 1997 and 2005, I find that reductions in preference margins will significantly diminish imports of some products, particularly from lowermiddle and low income countries; for example, a one percent reduction in the U. S. tariff on a product that is currently imported duty-free from developing countries will decrease imports of that product from lowermiddle countries {{by an average of}} 2. 6 percent. However, many products produced by developing countries fail to qualify for <b>preferential</b> <b>tariffs,</b> thus a gradual reduction in all U.
