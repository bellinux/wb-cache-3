5|$|Banksia ilicifolia is a {{component}} of the critically endangered Assemblage of Tumulus Springs (organic mound springs) of the Swan Coastal Plain community north of Perth, which is characterised by a permanently moist <b>peaty</b> soil. The dominant trees include M. preissiana, swamp banksia (B. littoralis) and flooded gum (Eucalyptus rudis), with understorey ferns such as bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and Cyclosorus interruptus, and shrubs swamp peppermint (Taxandria linearifolia) and Astartea fascicularis.|$|E
5|$|Plant life {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by the salt spray, strong winds and acidic <b>peaty</b> soils. No trees grow on the archipelago, although {{there are more than}} 130 different flowering plants, 162 species of fungi and 160 bryophytes. Several rarities exist amongst the 194 lichen species. Kelp thrives in the surrounding seas, which contain a diversity of unusual marine invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} and industrial waste dumped on Chat Moss resulted in {{very high levels}} of heavy metals such as lead and copper in the soil, raising concerns that crops grown there may pose a health risk. The high pH of the <b>peaty</b> soil limits the mobility of the metals however, and prevents them being taken up by crops.|$|E
5|$|Chatteris is {{situated}} between Huntingdon, St Ives, Peterborough, March and Ely, {{in the middle}} of The Fens—the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdom—with most of the land surrounding the town being below sea level, although the highest point in the Fens (36 feet above sea level) is within Chatteris's parish boundaries. The <b>peaty</b> land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous ditches and dykes, and there are two large drainage rivers near the town – the Forty Foot Drain, also known as Vermuyden's Drain, and the Sixteen Foot Drain.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{altitude}} {{site where}} D.regia is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of a gravel bench formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a <b>peaty</b> quartzite sand, {{often with a}} gravel cover. Rhizomes of mature plants grow above ground and among associated grasses and sedges when gravel is absent and below ground {{when there is a}} gravel cover present. Associated vegetation included species of Leucadendron and members of the families Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, and Restionaceae. The habitat of D.regia depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from choking out D.regia. Frost occurs infrequently in the valley.|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} the circle is located slopes down from east to west. The topsoil {{in and around the}} site is <b>peaty</b> and has heather growing across it. From the circle, a range of {{different}} Bronze Age round barrows, or tumuli, are visible at different points in the surrounding landscape. 261.5 meters (286 yards) to the north-east of the circle, atop the summit of Withypool Hill, is a lone tumulus, although this can no longer be seen from Withypool Stone Circle itself. The three Brightworthy Barrows {{can be seen from the}} circle in a north-west direction. Other Bronze Age barrows visible from the circle are the Green Barrow, the Old Barrow, the Twitchen Barrows, the three Wam Barrows of Winsford Hill, and the barrow atop Sherdon.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or <b>peaty.</b> If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E
25|$|Islay malts have a {{reputation}} for being the most <b>peaty.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} of the borough, small pockets of valley graavels, London clay, Brickearth and Alluvium can be found, {{although}} these have mainly been built over {{with the exception of the}} Alluvium, which forms <b>peaty</b> soils around the floodplain of the River Itchen.|$|E
25|$|The only {{practicable}} {{line of ascent}} for walkers is {{along the}} ridge, either from the end at Deepdale Bridge, or cutting up the southern side from Cow Bridge and Brothers Water. A path follows the crest and continues across <b>peaty</b> ground toward the rocky top of Hart Crag.|$|E
25|$|Costelytra zealandica is {{endemic to}} and are found {{throughout}} New Zealand. There are, however similar species, {{found in other}} countries like Acrossidius tasmaniae, Tasmanian grass grub found in Tasmania, Australia. Grass grubs prefer altitudes below 1200m, with favored soil types being free-draining loam soils, {{but they are also}} found in <b>peaty</b> or sandy soils.|$|E
25|$|Sugarcane can {{be grown}} on many soils ranging from highly fertile well-drained mollisols, through heavy {{cracking}} vertisols, infertile acid oxisols, <b>peaty</b> histosols, to rocky andisols. Both plentiful sunshine and water supplies increase cane production. This has made desert countries with good irrigation facilities such as Egypt some of the highest-yielding sugarcane-cultivating regions.|$|E
25|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Carboniferous coal measures, {{which are}} capped by glacial deposits of varying thickness. Spring-lines are prominent {{on the lower}} valley slopes and {{have a significant effect}} on the vegetation. The soils are predominantly gley and acidic, well-drained and covered with a thin <b>peaty</b> layer on the higher ground, wetter and with a deeper layer of peat in less well-drained areas.|$|E
25|$|Upland {{lakes and}} reservoirs: Typically {{located in the}} {{headwaters}} of river systems, upland reservoirs are usually sited above any human habitation and may be surrounded by a protective zone to restrict the opportunities for contamination. Bacteria and pathogen levels are usually low, but some bacteria, protozoa or algae will be present. Where uplands are forested or <b>peaty,</b> humic acids can colour the water. Many upland sources have low pH which require adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Where the Tongue River now {{flows in}} Montana and Wyoming, the {{sedimentary}} rock formation that is today {{known as the}} Tongue River sandstone began to form about 60 million years ago, when mountain uplifts began rising from a shallow sea. The Black Hills uplift on the east, the Hartville uplift on the southeast, and the Big Horn Block on the west created a flat, swampy low lying plain, with slow moving rivers flowing northwest to deltas along a shallow sea. At this time the climate in the area was subtropical, averaging about 120inches (3,000mm) of rainfall a year. For some 25 million years, the floor of this plain {{was made up of}} thick deposits of sandy silt from the surrounding mountains, with many rivers, deltas, backwaters and swamps, all covered by forests and vegetation. At that time, from 35 to 60 million years ago, the area where the Tongue River now flows would have appeared as a dense swampy jungle. Over long periods of time, the heavy plant growth died and accumulated as <b>peaty</b> layers in the large backwaters and swamps all across the basin. Periodically more sandy silt deposits would wash in from the mountains, completely burying the layers of organic <b>peaty</b> materials. Eventually the climate became drier and cooler. The area passed through more long periods of geologic time, during which new sedimentary layers buried this entire sandy silty layer along with its deposits of peat, under thousands of feet of newer sediments, compressing the sandy silty deposits into the Tongue River sandstone of today, and also compressing and changing the layers of <b>peaty</b> organic material into thinner layers of lignite coal. Over the last several million years, much of the overlying sediment has eroded away, bringing the sandstone layer with its seams of coal to the surface again in the Tongue River area.|$|E
25|$|Robert <b>Peaty</b> (1903–1989), a British Major in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, was {{the senior}} ranking allied officer. During this time, {{he kept a}} secret diary. A copy of his entire diary exists in the NARA archives. An extract of the diary is {{available}} at the UK National Archives at Kew. He was interviewed by the Imperial War Museum in 1981, and the audio recording tape reels are in the IWM's archives.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Clark was {{informed}} about a Mesolithic flint scatter {{that had been}} found in <b>peaty</b> deposits at Seamer Carr in North Yorkshire by an amateur archaeologist, John Moore. Clark visited this site, known as Star Carr, and realised that it may provide further evidence of a Mesolithic settlement. He oversaw three seasons of excavation at the site, in the summers of 1949, 1950, and 1951. The project was carried out on a shoestring budget under the auspices of Cambridge University and the Prehistoric Society.|$|E
25|$|The Sow {{has several}} {{interesting}} biological specimens on its surface. Phyllodoce caerulea (Norwegian blue heather) {{is to be}} found growing on its slopes, this is a subarctic plant which requires steep, partially stabilised block scree slopes and <b>peaty</b> soil. At one time The Sow of Atholl was thought to be only site in the British Isles where Phyllodoce caerulea grew but it has now been located growing in the Ben Alder range as well. Other plants native to subarctic regions such as Cornus suecica (Eurasian dwarf cornel) and Sibbaldia procumbens are to be found on the hill.|$|E
25|$|The West Siberian Plain {{consists}} {{mostly of}} Cenozoic alluvial deposits and is somewhat flat. Many deposits on this plain result from ice dams which produced a large glacial lake. This mid- to late-Pleistocene lake blocked the northward {{flow of the}} Ob and Yenisei rivers, resulting in a redirection southwest into the Caspian and Aral seas via the Turgai Valley. The area is very swampy, and soils are mostly <b>peaty</b> histosols and, in the treeless northern part, histels. In {{the south of the}} plain, where permafrost is largely absent, rich grasslands that are an extension of the Kazakh Steppe formed the original vegetation, most of which is not visible anymore.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was first}} operated on 5 August 1865. Within {{a year of}} its construction, {{it was noted that}} the tower oscillated in high winds much more than other towers. Due to weak <b>peaty</b> subsoils, the tower took on a slight lean. During storms, the tower leaked severely and it was feared that this would strengthen the mortar between the stones. Weak mortar was scraped out in 1867 and replaced with Portland cement. At the same time, the tower was painted with a large white stripe in the middle, with the remainder painted in black, both to make the tower more visible during daylight, but also to further waterproof the structure. This colour scheme has remained ever since.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper part}} of the fell, in excess of a mile square, is soft, <b>peaty</b> and drab. The {{exception}} is the ridge itself, which is considerably wetter. A fence runs along the ridge, a useful guide in mist and occasionally necessary for bog bouncing. The summit is set on a small rock platform with an Ordnance Survey column. A rocky knoll (called Man) stands {{on the other side of}} the fence. The views are extensive due to the central location and a lack of higher neighbours. The Helvellyn range is seen end to end, together with a panorama of high fells on the other side of the ridge from Crinkle Crags in the south to Blencathra in the north.|$|E
25|$|Directly beneath Glossop lie {{areas of}} Carboniferous Millstone Grit, shales and sandstone. Glossop {{is on the}} edge of the Peak District Dome, at the {{southern}} edge of the Pennine anticline. The Variscan uplift has caused much faulting and Glossopdale was the product of glacial action in the last glaciation period that exploited the weakened rocks. The steep-sided valleys of the cloughs cause significant erosion and deposition. The layers of sandstone, mudstones and shale in the bedrock act as an aquifer to feed the springs. The valley bottoms have a thin deposit of boulder clay. The brooks are fed by the <b>peaty</b> soils of the moors thus are acid (pH5.5–7.0); this means the instream wildlife is dependent on food sources from outside the channel.|$|E
25|$|P. praelongus is not {{in general}} cultivation, though it is an {{attractive}} plant. Unlike many other pondweeds it remains wintergreen. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Its preference for relatively deep water and intolerance of turbid conditions may make it unsuitable for many garden ponds. If possible it should be grown in water at least 70cm deep on a sandy, <b>peaty</b> or silty substrate. Good water quality is needed {{to reduce the risk}} of turbid water or growth of blanket weed. Seed can be encouraged to germinate by immersing dried seed in water for at least a month, exposing them to a cold period, or by scarifying them.|$|E
25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{this is one}} of the commonest pondweeds, {{occurring}} in almost any wet or semi-wet oligotrophic and / or acidic habitat so long as flow is not too rapid. It may be found in lakes, slow-flowing rivers, ponds, ditches, seeps and among bog mosses (Sphagnum). As its name suggests, it is common in areas of blanket bog but may also occur in secondary habitats such as unshaded drainage ditches in bogs and forest plantations. In British rivers it typically grows with other soft-water species such as Ranunculus flammula, Carex nigra, C. rostrata, Scapania undulata and Equisetum fluviatile. In lakes it tends to occur in base-poor, oligotrophic waters with species such as Littorella uniflora, Sphagnum spp., Lobelia dortmanna and Isoetes lacustris especially with a <b>peaty</b> substrate.|$|E
25|$|Gwelup is {{bounded by}} Lake Gwelup, the Mitchell Freeway to the east, Old Balcatta Road {{to the north}} (Reid Highway, {{accessible}} via Duffy Road, is located {{just a few hundred}} metres further north) and Karrinyup Road to the south. Due to Gwelup's swampy nature and the Lake Gwelup Reserve, considerable tracts of land remain undeveloped. <b>Peaty</b> soils around the lake region that have been reclaimed, now feature the highest concentrations of dissolved arsenic in the world - some 25000ug/L (some 400 times higher than that identified as safe levels for drinking water). It is well known among scientific communities that disturbance of acid sulphate soils causes the release of As, iron sulfides and other chemicals. In the previous 32 years prior to 2000, the lake was recorded to dry out twice, since that year the lake barely remained wet once over the summer in 2005/2006. The lowered water tables can be blamed on reduced rainfall and over consumption of regional scheme waters.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, James <b>Peaty</b> {{succeeded in}} {{temporarily}} returning Anarky to publication, writing Green Arrow No.51, Anarky in the USA. Although {{the front cover}} of the issue advertised the comic as the [...] "return" [...] of the character, Anarky failed to make any further appearances. This was despite comments by <b>Peaty</b> that he had further plans to write stories for the character.|$|E
500|$|The site {{yielded a}} number of wooden objects {{preserved}} in the <b>peaty</b> soil including five wheel spokes and an unfinished nave {{to be used as}} the hub of a wheel. Woven baskets recovered from the site provided evidence of woven baskets up to [...] in width and [...] in height. A wooden frame for stretching animal skins were also recovered along with a shaker and dice made from antlers.|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} in 2005 {{of an issue}} of Green Arrow in which Anarky guest-starred, writer James <b>Peaty</b> juxtaposed Anarky's radical philosophy with the liberal progressive beliefs of Green Arrow: [...] "Everyone always goes on about what a radical Ollie is and I wanted to show that maybe that isn't the case... especially as Ollie's radical credentials are pretty antiquated... Anarky as a character—and as a broader idea—is much more radical than Ollie." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{creating}} stories involving Anarky, {{other writers}} have played off this anti-heroic and anti-villainous tension. James <b>Peaty</b> made the heroic and political comparisons between Lonnie Machin and Oliver Queen {{the central theme}} of his 2005 Green Arrow story, [...] "Anarky in the USA": [...] "Anarky comes to find Ollie because of his reputation and is quite disappointed in Ollie's reaction towards him. However, as the story unfolds, Ollie has to re-assess his initial reaction to Anarky and his own much vaunted 'radical' credentials." ...|$|E
500|$|Banksia marginata {{grows on}} a variety of soil types, from clay loams, shale and <b>peaty</b> loams to sandy or rocky soils {{composed}} of quartzite, sandstone, limestone or granite, although sandier soils predominate. It is restricted to sandy soils in the Adelaide region. The soil types are {{of a wide range of}} pH, from highly acidic soils in the Grampians to alkaline soils in South Australia. Plants have been recorded at altitudes ranging from sea level to as high as [...] AHD at Mount Field National Park.|$|E
500|$|The Somerset Levels {{run from}} the coast up to [...] inland. These {{wetlands}} cover , most of which is no higher than [...] above sea level. There are coastal marine clay deposits, and further inland there are many <b>peaty</b> areas. Dotted within this wetland landscape are slightly raised inter-glacial [...] "islands" [...] called burtles. These have been settled from the Mesolithic onward, with wooden causeways linking them to higher ground. There are also rocky outcrops, such as Brent Knoll and Glastonbury Tor which have also housed ancient settlements.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{defended the}} scene as {{appropriate}} for Bond's character development. While HuffPost's Daniel Wood felt that the Sévérine was killed {{too early in the}} film, he associated her death with the removal of the [...] "harmless chauvinism" [...] starting from Casino Royale, and better connected with Bond's emotionally deficient character. Wood acknowledged that the representation of female characters as [...] "commodities" [...] was negative, but argued it suited Bond's characterization. James <b>Peaty</b> of Den of Geek! interpreted the moment as purposefully [...] "brutal and shocking" [...] in order show the audience [...] "how out of sorts Bond has become and that perhaps the greatest threat he faces this time out is his own inertia and ineptitude" [...] and shift the film's focus to M (Judi Dench).|$|E
500|$|Leigh is low-lying; land to {{the south}} and east, close to Chat Moss, is [...] above mean sea level. [...] The highest land, to the north and west, rises gently to [...] Astley and Bedford Mosses are {{fragments}} of the raised bog that once covered a large area north of the River Mersey and along with Holcroft and Risley Mosses are part of Manchester Mosses, a European Union designated Special Area of Conservation. The area is in the River Mersey Basin; drained into the Mersey by several streams, including the Westleigh and Pennington Brooks that join others flowing through Bedford to form the Glaze Brook. The southeast of the town has alluvial and <b>peaty</b> soils, but the rest is loam overlaying sandstone, or coal measures in the north. magnesian limestone occurs in Bedford and neighbouring Astley. Mining subsidence and flooding have caused the formation of [...] "flashes" [...] {{to the south and}} west of the town, the largest of which is south of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Pennington. Pennington Flash Country Park is a [...] country park and nature reserve with a [...] flash or lake.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} {{drainage}} {{on the light}} <b>peaty</b> soils was that further shrinkage occurred, and land levels continued to fall. By the late 1920s, gravity discharge alone {{could no longer be}} relied upon to provide an adequate level of flood protection, and a change to pumped drainage began. A new sluice and pumping station were constructed at St Germans, which was completed in 1934. The sluice was built in the centre of the old syphon sluice channel, with a pumping station on either side of it. Three pump sets were installed, with space for a fourth. Each consisted of a [...] Crossley diesel engine coupled to an [...] Gwynnes pump, which could pump 840 tons per minute (1,234 megalitres per day [...] ). Once completed, the syphon sluice was demolished, while Hawkshaw's replacement sluice and its channel were abandoned. The new works were paid for by a grant, given on condition that three quarters of the workforce were from the local area. The capacity of the station was increased in 1951, when a [...] Crossley diesel engine was fitted into the spare bay, and again in 1969–70, when the two pumps {{on the north side of}} the sluice were rebuilt, and the engines replaced by [...] electric motors.|$|E
500|$|Several global {{events of}} the early 2010s {{included}} the rise of hacktivist groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec; large scale protest movements, including the Arab Spring, Occupy movement, and Quebec student protests; the crypto-anarchist activity {{on the part of}} Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson; and the various information leaks to WikiLeaks by Chelsea Manning, the Stratfor email leak by Anonymous and Jeremy Hammond, and the global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden. The rapid succession of these events led some media commentators to insist that Anarky's relevance as a character had dramatically increased, and recommended that the character receive a higher profile in media. This sentiment led the creative team that developed Batman: Arkham Origins to include Anarky in the game. Describing Anarky's anti-government and anti-corporate agenda, Holmes acknowledged the relevance of anarchism in the contemporary protest movements of the time as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game, and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement. Holmes stressed in one interview, [...] "In the real world, this is Anarky's moment. Right now. Today." [...] Even as early as 2005, James <b>Peaty</b> recommended that Anarky should be included in more publications {{in the midst of the}} ongoing War on Terror, stating [...] "Anarky is a terrorist! How can that not be interesting in the modern climate?" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the land}} dried, the <b>peaty</b> soils shrank, causing the land surface to drop. Much of the Middle Levels was flooded in 1841-2, and this led the Commissioners {{to obtain an}} Act of Parliament in 1844, which {{authorised}} {{the construction of a}} new main drain, [...] long, in order that water could flow by gravity to Wiggenhall St Germans, where the levels of the tidal river were about [...] lower than at Salters Lode. The work was completed in 1848, and the sluice at Marmount Priory was also built at this time, in order to allow boats with a deeper draught to navigate through Upwell and Outwell. A railway line from [...] to [...] passed through the port of March from 1846, which soon became a railway hub, with branch lines to Wisbech and St Ives. Traffic transferred from the waterways, which made the drainage responsibilities of the Commissioners easier. The new main drain enabled Whittlesey Mere to be drained. A pumping station with an Appold centrifugal pump was used to achieve this, rather than the more traditional scoop wheel. The pump had been shown for the first time at the Great Exhibition in 1851, where it amazed visitors, and its inventor was commissioned to design a pump for the draining of the mere. It was [...] in diameter, and powered by a [...] steam engine, could raise 101 tons of water per minute by [...] In 1862 an Act of Parliament created the Middle Level Commissioners as a separate body to the Bedford Level Corporation, although they had been almost independent since 1810, and they embarked on a series of improvements. Drainage was always the primary function, but navigation was also important, and the new body had powers to charge tolls for the use of the waterways.|$|E
