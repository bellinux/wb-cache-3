American Bryan Berard, who had competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics, tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone.

Theodore did not face any punishment from the NHL as he had applied and received approval for a therapeutic use exception.

Finasteride decreases mean serum level of DHT by 71% after 6 months, and was shown in vitro to inhibit 5α-R3 at a similar potency to 5α-R2 in transfected cell lines. Long term side effects can occur after discontinuation of the drug.|$|E
5000|$|Finasteride (<b>Propecia)</b> {{is used in}} male-pattern {{hair loss}} in a pill form, taken 1 {{milligram}} per day. It is not indicated for women and is not recommended in pregnant women.

Side effects in about 2% of males, include decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Treatment should be continued as long as positive results occur. Once treatment is stopped, hair loss resumes.|$|E

40|$|Antiretroviral {{medications}} {{are known}} inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome p 450 enzymes and can affect levels of non-HIV medications. Finasteride 1 mg (<b>Propecia),</b> which prevents {{the conversion of}} testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is commonly prescribed for prevention of hair loss. This medication is a substrate of p 450 3 A 4. Its efficacy may therefore be affected by HIV medications which induce or inhibit this enzyme. Levels of DHT to prevent hair loss are not well established, but likely need to be&# 60; 15 &#x 2013; 20 ng/dl, or a DHT/T ratio of&# 60; 0. 02. Observational analysis in a private practice, measuring DHT and T levels in patients on finasteride and various antiretrovirals 21 patients were identified. 7 patients were taking protease inhibitors and had DHT levels&# 60; 12 ng/dL; DHT/T&# 60; 0. 20. Three of these patients decreased their finasteride dose to 1 mg every-other-day and still have DHT &# 60; 10. 8 patients were taking potent p 450 inducers (efavirenz or etravirine) and had DHT levels between &#x 003 E; 20; DHT/T&#x 003 E; 0. 025. Two of these patients increased the dose of finasteride to 2 mg/day and subsequently decreased DHT to 14 and 17. Two additional patients on efavirenz, however, had DHT levels of&# 60; 15 without dose adjustment. Four patients taking nevirapine, a less potent inducer of p 450 had DHT levels of&# 60; 15, as did one patient on raltegravir, which does not affect CYP 450. Antiretrovirals that affect CYP 3 A 4 may interact with finasteride. While {{it is unlikely that}} this interaction is dangerous, it may affect its efficacy of the finasteride.
