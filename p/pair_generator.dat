This is particularly useful for under-resourced languages where parallel corpora are not readily available. Our approach {{consists of a}} phrase <b>pair</b> <b>generator</b> that automatically generates candidate parallel phrases and a binary SVM classifier that classifies the candidate phrase pairs as parallel or non-parallel. The phrase <b>pair</b> <b>generator</b> {{is also used to}} automatically create training and testing data for the SVM classifier from parallel corpora. We evaluate our approach using English-German, English-Greek and English-Latvian language pairs. The performance of our classifier on the test sets is above 80 % precision and 97 % accuracy for all language pairs. We also perform an SMT evaluation by measuring the impact of phrases extracted from comparable corpora on SMT quality using BLEU.

40|$|International audiencePeriodically poled {{lithium niobate}} waveguides (PPLN/W) are {{nowadays}} {{considered to be}} one of the most useful toolboxes for quantum communication experiments. Thanks to the high optical confinement over longer lengths than in bulk configurations (a few cm in our case), such structures provide highly efficient non-linear interactions, both in down- and up-conversion regimes. Within the framework of long-distance quantum communication at telecom wavelength, PPLN/Ws have therefore been proved to be a key ingredient for building ultra-bright sources of energy-time, time-bin, as well as polarization entangled pairs of photons, up-conversion based detectors for telecom photon detection and photonic quantum interfaces for coherent wavelength conversion, as well as quantum relays in the entanglement swapping configuration. During the presentation, we will discuss some recent experimental advances regarding two quantum relay scenarios employed to extend the maximum achievable distance of quantum communication. Based on picosecond regime operation, the first relies on the entanglement swapping configuration, and the other on single qubit teleportation using a telecom oriented chip dedicated to one-way quantum communication. In the first realization, we demonstrate that the utilization of PPLN/Ws and standard components available from the telecommunications industry, associated with the picosecond operation regime enables reaching near-perfect two-photon interference (or coalescence) while maintaining high effective photon pair rates. Using pairs of photons emitted around 1550 nm and appropriate filtering stages, we obtain the highest coalescence net visibility, i. e., of 99 %, ever reported. As coalescence is seen a major step towards entanglement swapping, we believe that our picosecond guided-wave scheme provides an efficient trade-off between CW and femtosecond regimes, and emphasize why it should lead to realistic quantum relay and repeater schemes, namely by offering an reduced-constraint solution to the synchronization issue when two completely independent lasers are employed. We shall focus on our experimental demonstration and detail a comparative study of performance with similar reported experiments. As a second realization, we will give further directions towards the integration of several functions on a single optical chip, such as a photon <b>pair</b> <b>generator</b> and electro-optically controllable couplers. The idea is to realize a telecom-like quantum relay chip on lithium niobate through which teleportation of single qubits can be done so as to provide the necessary relay function in a compact, stable, efficient, and user-friendly fashion. We will discuss preliminary results obtained with this device for fully fiber-based one-way quantum communication systems. We will conclude by emphasizing the large potential of what we call "guided-wave quantum communication" developed in our laboratory...|$|E

By cascading n multi-phase voltage doublers (MPVD), the resulting charge pump has the voltage gain equal to 2 n. It needs n clock pairs to control the pumping process. MPVD is a minimum capacitance realization of the switched-capacitor based voltage doubler. An n-stage MPVD needs n+ 1 capacitors and 2 n switches. To avoid the short circuit during switching, a clock <b>pairs</b> <b>generator</b> is used to achieve multi-phase non-overlapping clock pairs. A frequency regulator is designed to lower the charging frequency when the load becomes lighter, thus reducing the power loss during switching.
