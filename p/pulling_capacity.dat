40|$|ABSTRACT: Most of the {{theories}} developed for the estimation of <b>pull</b> out <b>capacity</b> of anchors are based on assumptions on the shape of rupture surface. The failure surfaces have been simplified by the researchers to simplify the computation of <b>pull</b> out <b>capacity.</b> Hence, {{there is a wide}} deviation between theoretical and experimental results. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are data driven modeling techniques which are extremely effective in handling dynamic, uncertain and non-linear data especially when the underlying physical relationship is not fully understood. The conventional back propagation networks employs the gradient descent optimization technique which may get stuck in local minima and parameters determined based on that may not be optimal whereas Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm {{is one of the most}} efficient higher order adaptive algorithms and often find better optima. This study explores the potential of ANN trained using LM algorithm for the estimation of <b>pull</b> out <b>capacity</b> of circular anchors embedded in cohesionless soils. Bayesian regularization technique has been used to avoid over fitting. The results are highly encouraging as the model is able to explain more than 99 % of the variance. The performance of ANN model is compared with that of the four theoretical methods. The trained ANN and the theoretical models were extensively evaluated for performance based on various statistical indices. The root-mean- square error, coefficient of efficiency and Mean bias error values for the ANN model for test data are 3. 758 kN, 0. 997 and 0. 132 kN respectively, while these values for the theoretical methods ranged from 14. 2...|$|R

The non-coaxial model is developed based on the non-coaxial yield vertex theory, and the elastic and conventional coaxial plastic deformations are simulated by using elasto-perfectly plastic Drucker-Prager yield function according to the original yield vertex theory. Both the horizontal and vertical anchors with various embedment depths are considered. Different anchor shapes and soil friction and dilation angles are also taken into account. The predictions indicate that the use of non-coaxial models leads to softer responses, compared with those using conventional coaxial models. Besides, the predicted ultimate <b>pulling</b> <b>capacities</b> are the same for both coaxial and non-coaxial models. The non-coaxial influences increase with the increasing embedment depths, and circular anchors lead to larger non-coaxial influences than strip anchors.

At both sites, fuelwood was harvested from the boles of hard-wood trees 10 to 36 cm (4 to 14 inches) in dbh. The volume of pieces yarded 3 3 ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 63 m (0. 2 to 22. 4 ft). With a crew of four on a 3 small clearcut block and piece volumes averaging 0. 14 m 3 (5. 1 ft), yarding costs were $ 12. 03 per m 3 ($ 33. 70 per cunit).

40|$|To {{meet the}} growing demand for energy, the {{petroleum}} industry is looking in places previously thought to be unreachable. The continued search is causing {{the oil and gas}} industry to drill more advanced wells than ever. With the increased challenges of drilling, non-productive time (NPT) is a rising concern for the industry. During drilling, NPT annually amounts to as much as 35 % of the costs of the operation. Therefore, identifying and understanding variations in the drilling parameters during drilling operations is important. Recognizing well signals and signatures will enable early problem detection, thereby reduce NPT, and enhance safety. This thesis concentrates on initial investigations into hook load variations during tripping out of hole and thereafter make a laboratory model for hook load simulation. This in order to contribute to the understanding of the signals given by variations in hook load values. A hook load rig is developed based on the theory presented and previous hook load models built at NTNU. The apparatus consisted of elements representing the drilling rig hoisting system, low-pressure mud circulation system, the drillstring including bottom hole assembly, the borehole and relevant controls and instrumentation. Detailed procedures for use of the hook load rig are established and presented. A program to monitor and control the experiments was made in LabVIEW. The model encompasses large <b>pulling</b> force <b>capacity</b> and safety features to safeguard its operation, as well as flexibility with respect to key parameter variations. Several experiments have been performed in the laboratory order to qualify the rig. Tests with restrictions and without restrictions were conducted in order to identify hook load signatures.

The aim was to formulate ergonomics criteria {{to assist in the}} design and evaluation of various commonly used packages so that they are well adapted to the needs, capabilities and limitations of consumers. The consumers used in the study included male and female able-bodied subjects, some of whom were elderly; and the disabled, who suffered from arthritis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, or one-handed function (hemiplegics or amputees). The design criteria took the form of normative data. These were derived, by experiment, with subjects handling specially designed apparatus which closely simulated the characteristics of real packages. The norms were the torques and forces that the weak, average and strong subjects could exert on a range of packages. The norms were related to the breaking torques and breaking forces of packages found in the market place. It was shown that many of these packages require opening torques and forces which are well beyond the capabilities of the weaker sections of the sample. New methods for representing the torques which people can exert were derived, involving the calculation of ratios of centiles between and within groups for comfortable and maximum exertions of torque. It is suggested that this method, which has considerable promise, be further validated in future studies involving not only the description of forces and torques, but also that of the reaches, carrying and lifting capacity, the articulation, pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>capacity,</b> and physical endurance of human subjects. The promise lies in the short-hand derivation of the capabilities of weaker segments of the population, who are difficult to obtain in large numbers, from studies involving small samples from the fit and able population...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of animal drawn implements should {{be within the}} range of the <b>pulling</b> <b>capacity</b> of draught animals. The effects of design and operational parameters such as tail angle, side rake angle and radius of curvature of a curved soil tillage implement on horizontal and vertical forces have been investigated under laboratory conditions. Seven different wings of different radii of curvature (150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 mm) were designed. The range of tail angle used was between 32 ° and 54 ° and the range of side angle was between 40 ° and 65 °. The effect of curvature on the horizontal force showed anomalous behaviour for different tail angles. For smaller tail angles (about 30 ° to 40 °) the horizontal force decreased significantly with an increase of radius. For a tail angle of about 45 °, the horizontal force decreased first with the increase of radius of curvature and then increased with further increase of radius. For tail angles greater than 50 ° the horizontal force increased with an increase of radius. The variation of the behaviour of radius and force relation is presumably due to the edge rake angle, since it varies with the radius. For larger radii, the effect of edge rake angle on the horizontal force is much more pronounced than the effect of radius on the horizontal force. For the vertical force (directed downward), it was observed that, for all tail angles used, the force increased significantly with a decrease of radius and this relation was described well by a third order polynomial equation. Variation of tail angle showed a significant effect on both horizontal and vertical forces. This is mainly due to an increase of normal compression forces and gravitational force when the tail angle is increased. For the range of tail angle used the horizontal force could be described by a trigonometric model. The effect of variation of side rake angle on the resulting forces for different speeds and radii was also investigated. Experimental investigation showed that variation of speed and radius affects the of side rake angle and force relation. The study recommends a combination of larger radius and smaller side rake angles for high speed operations to achieve a good penetration performance and reduced horizontal force. From the analysis made, a radius of about 275 mm was found to be an optimum for a curved implement.

Among the improvement techniques, preloading and radial preloading using prefabricated vertical drainage are two popular methods in order to improve soft soils. Recently, a new concept of radial preloading has been presented under the name of expanded piers or expanded piles. In this method, an expandable membrane is expanded by means of an injection of air pressure to make an expanded cylindrical cavity, and is filled with a suitable material such as concrete or sand. Thus, the expanded element and the surrounding soil provide a stiffer component compared to the untreated soil. The main focus of this study was an evaluation of the effect of the diameter ratio (DR= final diameter of membrane after expansion / initial diameter of membrane before expansion) on the load capacity of the pile under upward and downward loading. To achieve these aims, 18 physical modelling tests on white Kaolinite were carried out to determine the pile <b>pull</b> out <b>capacity</b> and bearing capacity of the piles. Hence, the diameter ratios of 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5 times the initial diameter of the cylindrical cavity were selected. In this study, two methods were used to perform the expanded piles, radial expansion and radial expansion with surcharge. A series of physical modelling was designed to assess the different behavior of these two methods. In addition, a series of numerical modelling, based on the soft soil and Mohr-coulomb model, were conducted to simulate the pile behaviour and verification of the laboratory results. Based on the obtained results in the pull out tests, a significant increase was observed in the load capacity equal to 86 %, 132 % and 153 %, for diameter ratios equal to 1. 5, 2, and 2. 5, respectively, in the soft clay for expansion method. The increase in load capacity were equal to 170 %, 175 % and 183 % for the same diameter ratios, performed by means of expansion with surcharge method. Similarly, in the cases of compressive loading, the load ratios were increased equal to 40 %, 47 % and 53 %, for diameter ratios equal to 1. 5, 2, and 2. 5, respectively, for expansion method. The increase in load capacity were 99 %, 82 % and 69 % for the same diameter ratios, performed by means of expansion with surcharge method. Moreover, results showed that with increase in the piles diameter equal to 33 % and 66 %, the load ratios were increased up to 46 % and 86 %, for expansion method in case of pull out tests. Meanwhile, the load capacities were increased up to 63 % and 144 % for the expansion method in case of compressive tests. Furthermore, the soft soil model can be considered to have good agreement to simulate pile behaviour under vertical loading with the effect of radial preloadin...|$|R
