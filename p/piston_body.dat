50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{basis for}} induced voltage in {{a magnetic field}} comes from Faraday's law describing an induced electromotive force (EMF) as follows:Emf = -N (∆Φb / ∆t)(Nave, C. R. 2011).This implies that {{as the number of}} magnetic flux lines increase or decrease there is a subsequent induced voltage of negative or positive polarity. However the relationship of electric forces and magnetic forces were summed up in Lorentz Force Law as F as follows:F = qE + qv x BHere all three forces were found to be perpendicular to each other (Nave, a, 2011). Thus Lorentz gave specially oriented direction to each of the forces allowing us to predict the direction of forces within the inductive pump architecture. Salamey further investigated the relationship of magnetic flux to circumferential area about the magnetic field where most of the magnetic forces were found to create mechanical forces used to direct the motion of the piston. Salamey further describes in his second patent the incorporation of a magnetic field gap. The gap is defined as a region of non-magnetic conduction circumferentially located {{at either end of the}} piston bore. The magnetic gap allows for increased propagation of magnetic flux through the magnetic <b>piston</b> <b>body</b> causing an increased force pulling the piston towards the magnetic end-pole (Salamey, 1999).|$|E

40|$|In control {{hydraulic}} components (servo valves, LS regulators, etc.) {{there is}} a need for precise mathematical description of fluid flow through radial clearances between the control <b>piston</b> and <b>body</b> of component at zero overlap, small valve opening and small lengths of overlap.

The existing formulas in the literature do not take into account the change of the physical properties of the fluid with a change of thermodynamic state of the fluid to determine the flow rate through radial clearances in hydraulic components at zero overlap, a small opening, and a small overlap lengths, which leads to the formation of insufficiently precise mathematical models. In this paper model description of fluid flow through radial clearances at zero overlap is developed, taking into account the changes of physical properties of hydraulic fluid as a function of pressure and temperature.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{improvement}} of operation characteristics and emissions reduction by means of creating an air-cell inside the <b>piston</b> <b>body,</b> exhaust gases recirculating and insulating combustion chamber in a direct injection diesel engine simultaneously. The engine considered is a caterpillar 3401 which was modeled with an air-cell included {{as part of the}} piston geometry. This air-cell demonstrates that air injection in late combustion period can be effective in a significant reduction of Soot emission while cold EGR can be effective in reduction of NOx emission. Also for increasing of performance parameters, combustion chamber with air-cell is insulated. The analyses are carried out at part (75 % of full load) and full load conditions at the same engine speed 1600 rpm. The obtained results indicate that creating the air-cell has a slight effect on improvement of performance parameters and it has significantly effect on Soot reduction. The air-cell decreases the Soot pollutant as a factor of two at both part and full load conditions. Also, the adding 5 % of cold EGR in inlet air decreases NOx by about half and insulating the engine increases the power and IMEP by about 7. 7 % and 8. 5 % and decreases the ISFC by about 7. 5 % at part load and increases power and IMEP by 8. 5 %, 8. 5 % and decreases ISFC by 8 % at full load condition, respectively. Using this method, it was possible to control emissions formation and increase performance parameters simultaneously. The predicted results for mean in-cylinder pressure and emissions are compared to the corresponding experimental results and show good agreements...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the effect that floaters' hydrodynamics has on the performance characteristics of tightly moored vertical axisymmetric wave energy converters. Several geometries of WECs floaters have been examined by assuming mat they have constant displacement. Specifically, a cylindrical body with and without vertical and horizontal skirts at its bottom, a cone and a two - <b>body,</b> <b>piston</b> - like arrangement, which consists of an internal cone and an exterior torus, have been investigated and comparatively assessed. The WECs first-order hydrodynamic characteristics, i. e. their exciting wave forces and the correspondent hydrodynamic parameters, are evaluated using a linearized diffraction - radiation semi-analytical method. A dynamical model for evaluating of the floaters' performance in time domain is developed that properly accounts for the floaters hydrodynamic behavior, the modeling of the hydraulic system and of the power take - off mechanism. The effect of the floaters geometry on the efficiency of the converter is analyzed through the results for the power absorption, under the excitation of several sea states.

40|$|Abstract:- Pumps {{are often}} used in both {{industrial}} applications and mobile hydraulic machinery. In variable displacement pumps, the flow rate is dictated by the system requirements. The electro-hydraulic pump is a new integrated product, which comprise {{the combination of a}} pump and motor as a unit replacing the traditional connection with a shaft coupling. The pump is actuated without a rotating shaft utilizing a piston pump embedded in the motor. This brings with it some added advantages such as easy installation, reduction of noise in the system and decrease in power loss. In operation, the <b>piston</b> pump <b>body</b> is placed in the motor rotor, the air gap between the rotor and motor stator is filled with hydraulic oil, the rotor is directly rotated in the hydraulic oil and the control of the pressure and flow is achieved by means of the mechanical adjustment at the pressure valve. Electro-hydraulic systems with volumetric control offer a lot of advantages for pumping, due to the use of axial pistons with variable displacements possibilities. Several researchers have tried to describe the performance structure of these pumps in relation to efficiency; energy loss etc. without needed success. Previous studies have shown that using single loop suppress the steady state vibration, causes relatively good valve performance and reduces the impact on the control piston at the ends of a system’s strokes. The use of single feedback control loop reduces the pump production cost whilst maintaining reasonable performance useful for many different and acceptable commercial applications. In our research work we carried out some engineering studies of the control structures of these systems by investigating the characteristics, the convenience and dependence on control scheme and power operation. This paper focuses particularly on the automation of the control systems of these pumps. A system that enhanced the control of flow, pressure and hydraulic power without modifying the structure of the pump was designed, fabricated, tested and is hereby presented. We report on the relationship an...|$|R

The 2 D model is made up with main features of engine including combustion chamber, valves, manifold, cylinder <b>body,</b> <b>piston</b> head and cooling jacket, all projected at the {{cross section of the}} cylinder. The model was discretized with 2 D thermal elements of global length 0. 001. The fuel type is gasoline. Internal nodal temperature of cylinder body is defined as 2100 degrees C to represent occurrence of gasoline combustion. The presence of cooling is modeled by assigning convection coefficient on cooling jacket. Material information and isotropic material properties are taken from published report. The transient heat transfer analysis is done for the instant of combustion. The model is validated by comparing the computed maximum temperature at the piston surface with the published result. The computed temperature gradient at the crucial parts are plotted and discussed. It has been found that the critical component likely suffered from thermal fatigue was the exhaust port near the cylinder head and the materials used to construct the engine parts strongly influenced the temperature distribution in the engine.

40|$|Ceramics {{represent}} a unique class of {{materials that are}} distinguished from common metals and plastics by their: (1) high hardness, stiffness, and good wear properties (i. e., abrasion resistance); (2) ability to withstand high temperatures (i. e., refractoriness); (3) chemical durability; and (4) electrical properties {{that allow them to}} be electrical insulators, semiconductors, or ionic conductors. Ceramics can be broken down into two general categories, traditional and advanced ceramics. Traditional ceramics include common household products such as clay pots, tiles, pipe, and bricks, porcelain china, sinks, and electrical insulators, and thermally insulating refractory bricks for ovens and fireplaces. Advanced ceramics, also referred to as ''high-tech'' ceramics, include products such as spark plug <b>bodies,</b> <b>piston</b> rings, catalyst supports, and water pump seals for automobiles, thermally insulating tiles for the space shuttle, sodium vapor lamp tubes in streetlights, and the capacitors, resistors, transducers, and varistors in the solid-state electronics we use daily. The major differences between traditional and advanced ceramics are in the processing tolerances and cost. Traditional ceramics are manufactured with inexpensive raw materials, are relatively tolerant of minor process deviations, and are relatively inexpensive. Advanced ceramics are typically made with more refined raw materials and processing to optimize a given property or combination of properties (e. g., mechanical, electrical, dielectric, optical, thermal, physical, and/or magnetic) for a given application. Advanced ceramics generally have improved performance and reliability over traditional ceramics, but are typically more expensive. Additionally, advanced ceramics are typically more sensitive to the chemical and physical defects present in the starting raw materials, or those that are introduced during manufacturing...|$|R
