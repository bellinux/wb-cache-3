5000|$|There {{were many}} forms of {{fastening}} in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or <b>pin</b> <b>bolts,</b> and [...] "clinch bolts" [...] (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{decisions}} made by the Marine Accidents Inquiry Agency during the period from 1950 to 1964, investigaion was carried out on the broken parts of engine and their causes. 1. In diesel engines, principal broken parts were propeller shaft, crank arm, crank pin bolt and main bearing. The crack or breakage of crank arm was caused mostly by the deviation of center line of main bearings. The breakage of crank <b>pin</b> <b>bolts</b> was due mostly to excessive or unbalanced tightening. 2. In hot balb engines, nearly one half of damaged engines were due to the breakage of crank arm. When start engine, neglect about exhaust remaining oil in cylinder caused the engine to rapid rotation, and so crank case, piston, cylinder or cylinder cover to damage. 1. 漁船機関損傷の部位とその原因を,デイーゼル機関. 焼玉機関別に海難審判庁の裁決より考察した. 2. 主軸受中心線偏移によるクランク アームのき裂又は折損が最も多く,殊に焼玉機関に於て著しく,早期の開放点検整備が強く要望される. 3. デイーゼル機関に於ては,更に主軸受の焼損及びクランク ピン. ボルトの折損が多く,之等は他の部分の損傷に直接影響のある所で,潤滑油系に対する充分な注意と,ボルト締め付けに際しての細心の留意が肝要である. 4. 焼玉機関の始動時の急回転による損傷が各部に見出され,特に始動失敗の折の慎重な処置が望まれる. 機関損傷の殆どが,極めて基本的な事項の不注意,不処置に起因し,取扱者の充分な点検整備の実行が遂行されるならば,著しく軽減される海難である...|$|E

In 1995 its replacement the Barrett M95, which is currently being used by multiple armies, was made after thorough technological advancements in Barrett Firearm’s weapon systems. The Barrett M95 is the much more improved variant in regards to the Barrett M90. The Barrett M95 is similar to the Barrett M90, but it hs some improvements. The Barrett M95 has better magazine clearance because the pistol grip and trigger have been moved forward on the gun. Also, there were minor changes to the firing <b>pin,</b> <b>bolt</b> handle, and the barrel chamber is plated in chrome. The Barrett M90 still remains very popular because of its bullpup design and light weight. Its popularity not only comes from its large caliber, but its features as well. The Barrett M90's popularity is based on its sales. The Barrett M90 was bought at a slow pace and sometimes in bulk. By now, the Barrett M90 is found for sale through firearm collectors and is sold online.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 50 CrV 4 {{spring steel}} is a tough, shock resisting, shallow {{hardening}} chromium vanadium steel having high fatigue and impact {{resistance in the}} heat treated condition. It is used extensively in gears, pinions, springs, shafts, axles, <b>pins,</b> <b>bolts,</b> etc., which require high modulus of resilience. The alloy was realised through conventional melt route of electric arc furnace (EAF) followed by ESR. The application of the alloy {{is limited to a}} section thickness of 15 mm [1]. Hence obtaining optimum mechanical properties becomes a challenging task. In this study, the hardening as well as tempering operations were limited to 15 mm thickness. The samples from the alloy were subjected to hardening at 860 °C for 1. 25 h. and oil quenching to room temperature followed by tempering at four different temperatures of 250, 300, 370 & 450 °C for 3 h. each with oil quenching to room temperature. It was found that the alloy exhibited good combination of strength and ductility when tempered at 450 °C. Microstructural study revealed the presence of fine tempered lath martensite along with the presence of a very small amount of delta ferrite along prior austenitic grain boundaries. The AFNOR 50 CrV 4 / AISI- 6150 steel is widely used in the manufacturing of valve springs...|$|R

50|$|A shackle, {{also known}} as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with a clevis <b>pin</b> or <b>bolt</b> across the opening, or a hinged metal loop secured with a {{quick-release}} locking pin mechanism.

Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks.|$|R

50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the screw bolt, with its nut and washer, {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of <b>bolt</b> is the <b>pin</b> <b>bolt</b> or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the larger}} M-10, the M-11 has open sights with the rear pinhole sight welded to the receiver. These sights are {{for use with}} the folding stock, as using them without the stock is nearly useless because of the initial jump of the weapon due to its heavy, open-bolt design. The M-11A1 also has two safety {{features}} which are also found on the Model 10A1. The charging handle rotates to 90 degrees to lock the bolt in the forward position thus preventing the weapon from being cocked. The second safety is a slider which is pushed forward to lock the trigger, which in turn <b>pins</b> the <b>bolt</b> to the rear (cocked) position. This prevents the weapon from discharging even when dropped, which is not uncommon with an open-bolt design.|$|R
