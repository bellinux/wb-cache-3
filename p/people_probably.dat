5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Scotland includes {{all aspects of}} population history {{in what is now}} Scotland. Scotland may have been first occupied in the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE), but the earliest surviving archaeological evidence of human settlement is of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer encampments. These suggest a highly mobile boat-using <b>people,</b> <b>probably</b> with a very low density of population. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements dating from 3500 BCE, and greater concentrations of population. Evidence of hillforts and other buildings suggest a growing settled population. Changes in the scale of woodland indicates that the Roman invasions from the first century CE had a negative impact on the native population.|$|E
25|$|For Irish <b>people,</b> <b>probably</b> {{the most}} celebrated {{sporting}} events are the annual finals of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship and the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. These matches, normally held around the middle of September, are normally fully sold out, with well over 80,000 people packed into Croke Park, the largest stadium in Europe not used primarily for Soccer.|$|E
25|$|To {{what extent}} the various {{individuals}} were involved with Soviet intelligence is a topic of dispute. While a number of academics and historians assert {{that most of the}} individuals mentioned in the Venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of Soviet intelligence agents, others argue that many of those <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes.|$|E
50|$|The Romans {{knew the}} Celts then living in what became present-day France as Gauls. The {{territory}} of these <b>peoples</b> <b>probably</b> included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.|$|R
50|$|Native American <b>peoples,</b> <b>probably</b> the Chumash and Tongva, {{occupied}} Santa Barbara Island periodically for millennia. Archaeological sites {{dating to}} as much as 4,000 years ago have been documented on the island, which may have served as a stopover or refuge point for voyagers between the mainland and the other Channel Islands.|$|R
50|$|The site {{now known}} as Nemacolin's Castle in Brownsville {{may well have been}} visited by Chief Nemacolin, for a {{fireplace}} dates from the late 18th century, and the site had been inhabited by Native American <b>peoples</b> (<b>probably</b> the south Algonkian-speaking Shawnee who may have had mounds there). However, that building was long known as Bowman's castle, after three generations of merchant-industrialists.|$|R
25|$|An anti-Soviet guerrilla {{movement}} {{known as}} the Metsavennad ("Forest Brothers") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946–48. It {{is hard to tell}} how many people were in the ranks of the Metsavennad; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000–35,000 <b>people.</b> <b>Probably</b> the last Forest Brother was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.|$|E
25|$|Tibeto-Burman-speaking <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> {{lived in}} Nepal 2500 years ago. However, {{there is no}} archaeologic {{evidence}} of the Gopal Bansa or Kirati rulers, only mention by the later Licchavi and Malla eras. The first inhabitants of Nepal were properly of Dravidian origin whose history predates {{the onset of the}} Bronze Age in South Asia (around 3300 BCE), before the coming of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.|$|E
25|$|Folk festivals {{began to}} be {{organised}} by the EFDSS from about 1950, usually as local or regional event {{with an emphasis on}} dance, like the Sidmouth Festival (from 1955) and the Keele Festival (1965), which was abandoned in 1981 but reinstituted three years later as the National Folk Festival. The EFDSS gave up its organizing role in these festivals in the 1980s and most are locally run and financed. One {{of the largest and most}} prestigious English folk festivals at Cambridge was founded in 1965 and attracts about 10,000 <b>people.</b> <b>Probably</b> the largest is Fairport's Cropredy Convention, which since 1979 has provided a venue for folk, British folk rock, and rock artists; it now attracts up to 20,000 people a year as well as performances for Fairport Convention and their friends. Like rock festivals, folk festivals have begun to multiply since the 1990s and there are over a hundred folk festivals or varying sizes held in England every year.|$|E
50|$|Between the 8th and 5th centuries BC, {{tribes of}} Celtic <b>peoples,</b> <b>probably</b> coming from Central Europe, also began moving into Provence. They had weapons made of iron, which {{allowed them to}} easily defeat the local tribes, who were still armed with bronze weapons. One tribe, called the Segobriga, settled near modern-day Marseille. The Caturiges, Tricastins, and Cavares settled {{to the west of}} the Durance river.|$|R

50|$|Lycia {{covered the}} region lying between the modern cities of Antalya and Fethiye in {{southern}} Turkey, especially the mountainous headland between Fethiye Bay and the Gulf of Antalya. The Lukka, {{as they were}} referred to in ancient Egyptian sources, which mention them among the Sea <b>Peoples,</b> <b>probably</b> also inhabited the region called Lycaonia, located along the next headland to the east, also mountainous, between the modern cities of Antalya and Mersin.|$|R
25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E
25|$|The ritual {{was usually}} {{conducted}} approximately every 10–12 years for all girls, including infants, within a tharavad {{who had not}} previously {{been the subject of}} it. Higher-ranked groups within the caste, however, would perform the ritual more frequently than this and in consequence the age range at which it occurred was narrower, being roughly between age 10 and 13. This increased frequency would reduce the likelihood of girls from two generations being involved in the same ceremony, which was forbidden. The karnavan organised the elaborate ritual after taking advice from prominent villagers and also from a traditional astrologer, known as a Kaniyan. A pandal was constructed for the ceremony and the girls wore ornaments specifically used only on those occasions, as well as taking a ritual bath in oil. The ornaments were often loaned as only a few villagers would possess them. The person who tied the thali would be transported on an elephant. The higher the rank of that person then the greater the prestige reflected on to the tharavad, and also vice versa since some <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> would refuse to act as tier in order to disassociate themselves from a group and thereby bolster their claims to be members of a higher group. Although information is far from complete, those who tied the thali for girls of the aristocratic Nair families of Cochin in Central Kerala appear to have been usually Samantans, who were of higher rank, or occasionally the Kshatriyas, who were still higher. The Nambudiri Brahmins of Central Kerala acted in that role for the royal house of Cochin (who were Kshatriyas), but whether they did so for other Kshatriyas is less certain. The Kshatriyas would tie for the Samantans. Having the thali of each girl tied by a different man was more prestigious than having one tier perform the rite for several girls. The thali tying was followed by four days of feasting, and on the fourth day the marriage was dissolved.|$|E
500|$|The first {{recorded}} instance {{of a black}} person in the Omaha area occurred in 1804. [...] "York" [...] was a slave belonging to William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition. The presence of several black <b>people,</b> <b>probably</b> slaves, was recorded in the area comprising North Omaha today when Major Stephen H. Long's expedition arrived at Fort Lisa in September 1819. They reportedly lived at the post and in neighboring farmsteads.|$|E

5000|$|Swazis {{and other}} {{pastoral}} <b>peoples</b> <b>probably</b> grazed their livestock there, {{but not in}} large numbers, until the arrival of European settlers in the 1860s. Gold was discovered near Kaapsehoop in 1875, {{but it was the}} find by George Barber and his cousins Fred and Harry Barber that triggered a gold rush in 1884, leading to the founding of the town of Barberton. It was later overshadowed by the 1886 Witwatersrand Gold Rush.|$|R

500|$|... 6000 BCE {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of the Archaic period in North America. Archaeologists differ as to the origin of the Mesa Verde Archaic population; some believe they developed exclusively from local Paleo-Indians, called the Foothills Mountain Complex, but others suggest that the variety of projectile points found in Mesa Verde indicates influence from surrounding areas, including the Great Basin, the San Juan Basin, and the Rio Grande Valley. The Archaic <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> developed locally, but were also influenced by contact, trade, and intermarriage with immigrants from these outlying areas.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} the final episode, [...] "These Are The Voyages..." [...] was mostly negative. For example, the Wisconsin State Journal described it as [...] "hands down the worst series finale ever". The episode featured a holodeck simulation on the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) from [...] during {{the events of the}} episode [...] "" [...] and the return of Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). It was written by Berman and Braga, who responded to negative criticism of the episode by saying [...] "You have to remember that under normal circumstances most <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> would have thought this was a very cool episode because it has a great concept driving it". Berman later said that [...] "I would have never done it if I had known how people were going to react." ...|$|E
500|$|The Franciscan missionary John of Montecorvino (Giovanni da Montecorvino) {{was ordered}} to China by Pope Nicholas III in 1279. Montecorvino arrived in China {{at the end of}} 1293, where he later {{translated}} the New Testament into the Mongol tongue, and converted 6,000 <b>people</b> (<b>probably</b> mostly Alans, Turks and Mongols rather than Chinese). He was joined by three bishops (Andre de Perouse, Gerard Albuini and Peregrino de Castello) and ordained archbishop of Beijing by Pope Clement V in 1307. A community of Armenians in China sprang up during this period. They were converted to Catholicism by John of Montecorvino. Following the death of John of Montecorvino, Giovanni de Marignolli was dispatched to Beijing to become the new archbishop from 1342 to 1346 in an effort to maintain a Christian influence in the region. Marignolli, although not mentioned by name in the History of Yuan, is noted in that historical text as the [...] "Frank" [...] (Fulang) who provided the Yuan imperial court with an impressive war horse as a tributary gift.|$|E

2500|$|People {{first arrived}} in Malta around 5200 BC. These first Neolithic <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> arrived from Sicily (about [...] north), and were mainly farming and fishing communities, with some {{evidence}} of hunting activities. They apparently lived in caves and open dwellings. During the centuries that followed {{there is evidence of}} further contacts with other cultures, which left their influence on the local communities, evidenced by their pottery designs and colours.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of {{the video}} to MTV, Reynolds said [...] "We read through a ton of scripts from really talented directors, and we came across one that stood out to us in particular, because it put into visuals the general theme of the song, {{which is kind of}} an {{empowering}} song about an awakening, but it did {{it in a way that}} was very different". [...] "A lot of <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> see a post-apocalyptic world when they hear 'Radioactive', understandably, but we wanted to deliver something that was maybe a little different from that ... a lot different from that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... agriculture, {{prone to}} drought {{and with the}} bulk of the 16–20inches annual {{rainfall}} coming in a few thunderstorms that cause flooding. [...] Thus, the Antelope Creek <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> practiced water harvesting or “Ak-Chin” dryland farming techniques. [...] Crops were planted in arroyos or other depressions which caught runoff from thunderstorms and preserved enough moisture to permit crops to grow and mature. [...] Given the unpredictability of rainfall, a family probably planted small fields – as did other Southwestern peoples – in several different micro-environments with the objective of maximizing the possibility that some of their fields would be productive. [...] In their farming, the Antelope Creek people used bone-tipped digging sticks and bison scapulas as shovels and hoes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of <b>people,</b> <b>probably</b> well {{in excess of}} 90%, have arbitrary name signs. [...] These are initialized signs: [...] The hand shape is the initial {{of one of the}} English names of the person, usually the first. [...] The sign may occur in neutral space, with a tremble; with a double-tap (as a noun) at one of a limited number of specific locations, such as the side of the chin, the temple, or the elbow; or moving across a location or between two locations, with a single tap at each. [...] Single-location signs are simpler in connotation, like English [...] "Vee"; double-location signs are fancier, like English [...] "Veronica". [...] Sam Supalla (1992) collected 525 simple arbitrary name signs like these.|$|E
2500|$|Māori {{occupied}} the Westland coastal area for several centuries before Europeans began to colonize New Zealand. Māori refer to West Coast, New Zealand as Te Tai Poutini. [...] Population numbers probably never reached very high, {{no more than}} several hundred <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> lived in the area at any given time. Their settlements consisted mostly of small villages on the coast. Food sources were abundant in this area. Seafood was especially important to the Māori who smoked eels and seafish, dried whitebait, and often collected seaweed and mussels. Other local food sources included birds such as duck and pigeon. Stone working was also common among the Māori who had access to greenstone, a nephrite jade that was most often gathered near the Arahura River but was also collected from areas much farther away, including the Haast River and Lake Wakatipu.|$|E
2500|$|The {{end of the}} Shang hegemony {{probably}} left {{a political}} vacuum in the middle Yangtze region behind. Archaeological findings show no cultural unity in the region after the Erligang period, making {{the existence of a}} larger, centralized power unlikely. In place of northern inflence, the powerful Wucheng culture began to expand from Jiangxi into the middle Yangtze area, though the Wucheng <b>people</b> <b>probably</b> never politically dominated the region as the Shang dynasty had. Nevertheless, the end of central authority did not led to a cultural or technological breakdown in the area. Instead, the end of Shang rule allowed several small but highly developed native centers to emerge, which possibly led to [...] "a flowering of civilization at this stage". Largely freed from foreign dominance, these polities became economically, technologically, and politically highly advanced, while also growing in military strength. Against the late Shang dynasty, the Yangtze peoples showed great resilience and martial strength.|$|E
