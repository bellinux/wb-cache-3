25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the <b>Peepul</b> <b>tree</b> and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and {{the only way they can}} be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E
2500|$|On Lt. Col. Mark Wood’s map of 1784, {{the portion}} of the eastward road from Lal Bazar to what was {{known for a long time}} as Circular Road - which ran along the filled-in Mahratta Ditch and is now Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Road - was shown as Boytaconnah Street, which {{received}} its name from the Baithakkana, or [...] "resting place", where merchants formed and dispersed their caravans, sheltered by an old banyan tree (called a <b>peepul</b> <b>tree</b> in Cotton), at the road's eastern extremity, beyond which, to the northeast, were salt lakes and marshes. Job Charnock is said to have chosen the site of Kolkata for a city, in consequence of the pleasure he found in sitting and smoking under the shade of a large tree. Posterity loved to connect his name with the Baithakkhana tree, which is shown in Aaron Upjohn’s map of 1794, on land subsequently appropriated by Sealdah station. However, the tree is not on Wood’s map.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{introduction}} to an album of Bijapur published in 1866, Philip Meadows Taylor wrote: “Palaces, arches, tombs, cisterns, gateways, minarets, ...all carved from the rich basalt rock of the locality, garlanded by creepers, broken and disjointed by <b>peepul</b> <b>trees,</b> each in its turn is a gem {{of art and the}} whole a treasury.” ...|$|R
50|$|Pali Hill has {{an expanse}} of trees forming arches over the roads. Originally an area of mildly {{cultivated}} orchards, fields and untamed forests, over the period of forty years it has been deforested and made suitable for large scale residential habitation. A few of those giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the gulmohar tree. Also abundant are large (and rare in Mumbai) banyan <b>trees,</b> <b>peepul</b> <b>trees,</b> mango trees, ashoka trees, wild almond trees, wild neem trees {{as well as a}} variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the papaya, jackfruit, custard-apple, and guava.|$|R
60|$|The site of Maddaobund, {{elevated}} 1230 feet, in {{a clearance}} of the forest, {{and the appearance}} of the snow-white domes and bannerets of its temples through the fine trees by which it is surrounded, are very beautiful. Though several hundred feet above any point we had hitherto reached, the situation is so sheltered that the tamarind, <b>peepul,</b> and banyan <b>trees</b> are superb. A fine specimen of the latter stands {{at the entrance to the}} village, not a broadheaded tree, as is usual in the prime of its existence, but a mass of trunks irregularly throwing out immense branches in a most picturesque manner; the original trunk is apparently gone, and the principal mass of root stems is fenced in. This, with two magnificent tamarinds, forms a grand clump. The ascent of the mountain is immediately from the village up a pathway worn by the feet of many a pilgrim from the most remote parts of India.|$|R

He is at {{the bottom}} of a stone cistern in the temple of Dalbhyeswar, under the shade of a noble <b>peepul</b> <b>tree</b> on the bluff {{overlooking}} the Ganges, so you must go back to the river. The Poor Man's Friend is the god of material prosperity in general, and the god of the rain in particular. You will secure material prosperity, or both, by worshiping him. He is Shiva, under a new alias, and he abides in the bottom of that cistern, in the form of a stone lingam. You pour Ganges water over him, and in return for this homage you get the promised benefits. If there is any delay about the rain, you must pour water in until the cistern is full; the rain will then be sure to come.|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder if}} the 'dorian', {{if that is the}} name of it, is another superstition, like the <b>peepul</b> <b>tree.</b> There was a great {{abundance}} and variety of tropical fruits, but the dorian was never in evidence. It was never the season for the dorian. It was always going to arrive from Burma sometime or other, but it never did. By all accounts it was a most strange fruit, and incomparably delicious to the taste, but not to the smell. Its rind was said to exude a stench of so atrocious a nature that when a dorian was in the room even the presence of a polecat was a refreshment. We found many who had eaten the dorian, and they all spoke of it with a sort of rapture. They said that if you could hold your nose until the fruit was in your mouth a sacred joy would suffuse you from head to foot that would make you oblivious to the smell of the rind, but that if your grip slipped and you caught the smell of the rind before the fruit was in your mouth, you would faint. There is a fortune in that rind. Some day somebody will import it into Europe and sell it for cheese.|$|E

50|$|The next day, Bahadur Shah {{held his}} first formal court for many years. It was {{attended}} by many excited sepoys. The King was alarmed by the turn events had taken, but eventually accepted the sepoys' allegiance and agreed to give his countenance to the rebellion. On 16 May, up to 50 Europeans who had been held prisoner in the palace or had been discovered hiding in the city were killed {{by some of the}} King's servants under a <b>peepul</b> <b>tree</b> in a courtyard outside the palace.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{accounts}} say that, around 589 BCE, Siddhartha Gautama, a young prince who saw {{the suffering}} of the world and wanted to end it, reached the forested banks of the Phalgu river, near the city of Gaya, India. There he sat in meditation under a <b>peepul</b> <b>tree</b> (Ficus religiosa or Sacred Fig) which later became known as the Bodhi tree. According to Buddhist scriptures, after three days and three nights, Siddharta attained enlightenment and the answers that he had sought. In that location, Mahabodhi Temple was built by Emperor Ashoka in around 260 BCE.|$|E
5000|$|The parish {{church of}} Catfield is called All Saints. Most of the {{building}} dates from the 14th century. On the rood screen there are sixteen paintings of kings. On the north wall of the sanctuary there is a tablet by the sculptor William Groves depicting a <b>peepul</b> <b>tree</b> {{at the top and}} a sheathed sword below dedicated to Lt Thomas Cubitt who died in 1848. Cubitt, who was a soldier died in his country’s cause before Multan, a town in the Punjab, India. The church is a Grade I listed building ...|$|E
50|$|On 12 May, Bahadur Shah {{held his}} first formal {{audience}} for several years. It {{was attended by}} several excited sepoys who treated him familiarly or even disrespectfully. Although Bahadur Shah was dismayed by the looting and disorder, he gave his public support to the rebellion. On 16 May, sepoys and palace servants killed 52 British who had been held prisoner within the palace or who had been discovered hiding in the city. The killings took place under a <b>peepul</b> <b>tree</b> {{in front of the}} palace, despite Bahadur Shah's protests. The avowed aim of the killers was to implicate Bahadur Shah in the killings, making it impossible for him to seek any compromise with the Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{school has}} a number of buildings, one of the newest among them being the William Carey block. This block has several of the classrooms, the laboratories, the {{physical}} education department, the music room and faces the playground field. The Coates library houses 9 000 books. There are a number of laboratories for the various science subjects (Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Computers). The Flack Memorial Assembly Hall can house around a thousand people. The kindergarten students have a separate block (KG Block) and playground. The Stewards Block, a building for the Special Needs Department, has a large clock on top which is visible from the roads adjacent to the school campus. The campus has several trees, the most prominent among them being a Christmas tree and a <b>Peepul</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Thirumullappulli Siva {{temple of}} Karalmanna is quite {{unique in that}} its prathishta has but few {{parallels}} anywhere around. He is Aghora Siva, the fierce Lord sitting pre-occupied and hell-bent on avenging Daksha and worshipped in His Roudra bhava, in a posture that is awe-inspiringly ascetic. To the multifarious devotees of Karalmanna, Lord Siva of Thirumullappulli is both a protector and benefactor. He is their sole prop, a dependable deity in times of all their hardship and misery. They would willingly attribute the causes of their sufferings to the aghora aspect of the Lord of Thirumullappully, if not as the direct outcome of his curses, evidently as result of their inability to win over His other milder attributes like the valsalya bhava, which {{is the object of}} adoration in some other Mahadeva temples of Kerala [...]The most significant festival in Thirumullapulli is the Yearly Temple Festival which commences exactly eight days before the Thiruvathira Nakshathtra Varam in the Kumbha masa. The Pallivetta, the ritualistic royal hunt of the Lord to drive off the evil spirits, was originally conducted on the seventh day of the festival under the huge <b>peepul</b> <b>tree</b> that once stood in the east nada of the temple. This is now being conducted under the peepul near the Moorkkath temple [...]The festival culminates with the Aarattu, the holy bath of the Lord for purification at the Holy Ghat of Perandamanna kadavu of Thootha Puzha, where it suddenly changes its usual south-north course to westward.|$|E
