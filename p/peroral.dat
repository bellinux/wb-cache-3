5000|$|The {{toxicity}} of SWNHs {{is a critical}} issue relating to their biomedical application, which has been investigated in vitro and in vivo extensively. [...] The SWNHs {{were found to be}} a nonirritant and a nondermal sensitizer through skin primary and conjunctival irritation tests and skin sensitization test. Negative mutagenic and clastogenic potentials suggest that SWNHs are not carcinogenic. The acute <b>peroral</b> {{toxicity of}} SWNHs was found to be quite low—the lethal dosage for rats was more than 2000 mg/kg of body weight. Intratracheal instillation tests revealed that SWNHs rarely damaged rat lung tissue for a 90-day test period, although black pigmentation due to accumulated nanohorns was observed. While further toxicological assessments, including chronic (repeated dose), reproductive, and developmental toxicity studies, are still needed, yet the present results strongly suggest that as-grown SWNHs have low acute toxicities.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{delivery}} technologies modify drug release profile, absorption, distribution and elimination {{for the benefit}} of improving product efficacy and safety, as well as patient convenience and compliance. Drug release is from: diffusion, degradation, swelling, and affinity-based mechanisms. Most common routes of administration include the preferred non-invasive <b>peroral</b> (through the mouth), topical (skin), transmucosal (nasal, buccal/sublingual, vaginal, ocular and rectal) and inhalation routes. Many medications such as peptide and protein, antibody, vaccine and gene based drugs, in general may not be delivered using these routes because they might be susceptible to enzymatic degradation or can not be absorbed into the systemic circulation efficiently due to molecular size and charge issues to be therapeutically effective. For this reason many protein and peptide drugs have to be delivered by injection or a nanoneedle array. For example, many immunizations are based on the delivery of protein drugs and are often done by injection.|$|E
50|$|Current {{efforts in}} the area of drug {{delivery}} include the development of targeted delivery in which the drug is only active in the target area of the body (for example, in cancerous tissues), sustained release formulations in which the drug is released {{over a period of time}} in a controlled manner from a formulation, and methods to increase survival of <b>peroral</b> agents which must pass through the stomach's acidic environment. In order to achieve efficient targeted delivery, the designed system must avoid the host's defense mechanisms and circulate to its intended site of action. Types of sustained release formulations include liposomes, drug loaded biodegradable microspheres and drug polymer conjugates. Survival of agents as they pass through the stomach typically is an issue for agents which cannot be encased in a solid tablet; one research area has been around the utilization of lipid isolates from the acid-resistant archaea Sulfolobus islandicus, which confers on the order of 10% survival of liposome-encapsulated agents.|$|E

50|$|The first {{successful}} {{delivery of a}} drug across the BBB occurred in 1995. The drug used was hexapeptide dalargin, an anti-nociceptive peptide that cannot cross the BBB alone. It was encapsulated in polysorbate 80 coated nanoparticles and intravenously injected. This was a huge breakthrough in the nanoparticle drug delivery field, and it helped advance research and development toward clinical trials of nanoparticle delivery systems. Nanoparticles {{range in size from}} 10 - 1000 nm (or 1 µm) and they can be made from natural or artificial polymers, lipids, dendrimers, and micelles. Most polymers used for nanoparticle drug delivery systems are natural, biocompatible, and biodegradable, which helps prevent contamination in the CNS. Several current methods for drug delivery to the brain include the use of liposomes, prodrugs, and carrier-mediated transporters. Many different delivery methods exist to transport these drugs into the body, such as <b>peroral,</b> intranasal, intravenous, and intracranial. For nanoparticles, most studies have shown increasing progression with intravenous delivery. Along with delivery and transport methods, there are several means of functionalizing, or activating, the nanoparticle carriers. These means include dissolving or absorbing a drug throughout the nanoparticle, encapsulating a drug inside the particle, or attaching a drug {{on the surface of the}} particle.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Peroral</b> {{endoscopic}} myotomy {{has been}} developed to provide a less invasive treatment for oesophageal achalasia compared to surgical cardiomyotomy. AIMS: To report our initial experience on feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy of <b>peroral</b> endoscopic myotomy. METHODS: Eleven patients (eight women, mean age 32, range 24 - 58) underwent an attempt at <b>peroral</b> endoscopic myotomy under general anaesthesia. After submucosal injection, a mucosal entry into the oesophageal submucosa, and a tunnel extending to the oesophagogastric junction and beyond into the stomach were created (total mean length: 15 ± 1. 7 cm). Myotomy of the circular oesophageal and gastric muscle bundles was then achieved under direct vision (total mean length: 10. 2 ± 2. 8 cm). Haemostatic clips were used to close the mucosal entry. The Eckardt Score and manometry were {{used to evaluate the}} results. RESULTS: <b>Peroral</b> endoscopic myotomy could be completed in 10 out of 11 patients (91 %).

Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure decreased from 45. 1 to 16. 9 mmHg (p= 0).

Advanced cholangioscopy and NBI are expected to be useful for precise evaluation and correct diagnosis of biliary tract diseases. However, the diagnostic value of advanced bile duct imaging with cholangioscopy requires further evaluation.

40|$|The {{transnasal}} {{endoscopic examination}} using an ultraslim upper endoscope {{may be more}} comfortable and less stressful than the <b>peroral</b> approach. Transnasal endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic nasobiliary drainage, and direct <b>peroral</b> cholangioscopy using an ultraslim upper endoscope have recently been reported. An 82 -year-old woman with a previous history of endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone removal was admitted with acute cholangitis. Instead of conventional ERCP, we performed direct transnasal cholangioscopy (TNC) using an ultraslim upper endoscope for biliary decompression and stone removal because of her unstable vital signs.

40|$|Specific serum and mucosal {{antitoxin}} {{levels were}} determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in rats immunized with Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). Immunization {{by means of a}} parenteral prime followed by <b>peroral</b> boosts was the only approach that aroused titers of both serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antitoxin and mucosal secretory IgA antitoxin that were increased fourfold or more over control values. Primary parenteral immunization was effective when given either intraperitoneally or subcutaneously with either Freund complete adjuvant or alum as the adjuvant. The magnitude of the nucosal secretory IgA antitoxin response and the degree of protection against challenge with either LT or viable LT-producing organisms were related to the number and dosage of <b>peroral</b> boosts. LT antigenicity, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was progressively reduced by toxoiding it with increasing amounts of glutaraldehyde or a carbodiimide; when LT antigenicity was reduced by greater than 50 %, the effectiveness of the toxoid in stimulating mucosal antitoxin and providing protection was compromised. Strong protection extended for more than 6 weeks only in rats immunized with a sufficient <b>peroral</b> dosage of LT to arouse mucosal secretory IgA antitoxin titers at least fourfold greater than those of controls. These observations indicate that the ability of LT to stimulate a mucosal secretory IgA antitoxin response is dependent on the antigenicity, route, and dosage of this immunogen; they suggest that the duration of protection in animals immunized by the <b>peroral</b> route is related to the extent of arousal of mucosal secretory IgA antitoxin...|$|E
