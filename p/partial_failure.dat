He stated {{that it was impossible to}} state that the engine had suffered a <b>partial</b> <b>failure</b> due to the partial obstruction of the petrol pipe. In the week before the crash, the aircraft had been away from Croydon for six days, having landed at Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Ostend, Belgium and Lympne, Kent, before returning to Croydon on the morning of 24 December. No licensed engineer was available at any of the airports away from Croydon. On arrival at Croydon, the engine was reported to be running rough. Routine servicing was carried out and the oil tank drained and refilled with fresh oil. The engine had then been ground tested, including being run for 20 minutes. Major Cooper opined that further investigation should have been undertaken given the report of rough running. It was revealed that a chart recording engine speeds during a flight from Ostend to Lympne was available, but Major Cooper had chosen not to analyse it. Sir Arthur Colefax stated that he would arrange for the document to be analysed to see if it would reveal any rough running in the engine. Evidence was given in respect of the petrol pipe. Major Cooper stated that it would not have been passed as fit for use in military aircraft, due to its construction. The inquiry was adjourned until 27 January.|$|E

2500|$|Discussing sexual perversion, Scruton {{argues that}} its [...] "major {{structural}} feature" [...] is the [...] "complete or <b>partial</b> <b>failure</b> to recognise, {{in and through}} desire, the personal existence of the other", {{which in turn is}} [...] "an affront, both to him and oneself." [...] Scruton calls perversion, [...] "narcissistic, often solipsistic". In his chapter on perversion, Scruton considers masturbation, bestiality, necrophilia, pedophilia, sado-masochism, homosexuality, incest, and fetishism. Scruton argues that there are two forms of masturbation, and only one is perverted. Scruton argues that homosexuality is significantly different from heterosexuality, and that this helps to explain the traditional judgment that homosexuality is a perversion. Heterosexuality involves dealing with the different and complementary nature of the opposite sex, whereas homosexuality does not: [...] "Desire directed towards the other gender elicits not its simulacrum but its complement." [...] Scruton writes that, [...] "In the heterosexual act, it might be said, I move out from my body towards the other, whose flesh is unknown to me; while in the homosexual act I remain locked within my body narcissistically contemplating in the other an excitement that is the mirror of my own." [...] Scruton dismisses the classical scholar Kenneth Dover's Greek Homosexuality (1978) as [...] "trivialising" [...] and faults Michael Levin's arguments for the abnormality of homosexuality, calling them absurd. In Scruton's view, normal sexuality involves not only giving recognition to the other's person in and through desire for him or her, but also according them accountability and care in the process. Scruton argues that sex is morally permissible only if it involves love and intimacy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) many <b>partial</b> <b>failures</b> are {{the result}} of temporary network partitions due to the intermittent connectivity of mobile devices. Some of these failures will be permanent and require application-level failure handling. However, it is impossible to distinguish a permanent from a transient failure. Leasing provides a solution to this problem based on the temporal restriction of resources. But to date no leasing model has been designed specifically for MANETs. In this paper, we identify three characteristics required for a leasing model to be usable in a MANET, discuss the issues with existing leasing models and then propose the leased object references model, which integrates leasing with remote object references. In addition, we describe an implementation of the model in the programming language AmbientTalk. Leased object references provide an extensible framework that allows programmers to express their own leasing patterns and enables both lease holders (clients) and lease grantors (services) to deal with permanent failures. Key words: mobile ad hoc networks, <b>partial</b> <b>failures,</b> leasing, remote object references, language design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 1 A gap {{exists between}} the socket-level Quality of Service (QoS) offered by {{communications}} researchers and the object-oriented programming being done at the application level. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework for handling system properties such as QoS and <b>partial</b> <b>failures.</b> This framework extends the CORBA functional Interface Description Language (IDL) with a QoS Description Language (QDL). QDL specifies an application’s expected usage patterns and QoS requirements for a connection to an object. The QoS and usage specifications are at the object level (e. g., methods per second) and not at the communication level (e. g., bits per second). An application can have many connections to the same object, each with different system properties. QDL allows the object designer to specify system states, which represent {{the status of the}} QoS agreement for an object connection. The application can adapt to changing resources and <b>partial</b> <b>failures</b> by changing its behavior based on the system state of its object connections. Many hooks are provided for measuring and enforcing QoS agreements and for dispatching handlers when the agreements are violated. 1...|$|R
