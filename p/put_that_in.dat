Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the back of my head.|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{production}} of bottle fermented sparkling wines from grapes grown in England {{started in the}} 1960s, {{although there has been}} a longer history of sparkling wines made in the UK from imported grapes. In the 1980s, some English winemakers started to grow the grape varieties as used in Champagne – Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier – and in the ensuing decades availability of English sparkling wines made from these varieties increased. Today, there are over 100 vineyards in England producing sparkling wines with Nyetimber, Ridgeview and Chapel Down being some of the largest producers. In 2010, Chardonnay and Pinot noir were the two most commonly planted grape varieties in English vineyards. Along with Pinot Meunier, the three varieties combined accounted for around 40% of vines planted, which appears to reflect a significant growth in interest in English sparkling wines. Other varietals used are Auxerrois, Seyval blanc, Müller-Thurgau, Reichensteiner, and Bacchus. To <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> context, the current yield for all types of English wine averages to around 2 million bottles annually.|$|E

A bootleg recording from that informal session shows that [...] "Revolution" [...] had two of its three verses intact. The line referencing Mao Zedong was added to the lyrics in the studio. During filming of a promotional clip later that year, Lennon told the director that it was the most important lyric of the song. Lennon had changed his mind by 1972, saying [...] "I should have never <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> about Chairman Mao".|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that Pratchett had an experience {{which he described}} as: [...] "It is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, {{on the other side}} of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows" [...] and [...] "I don't actually believe in anyone who could have <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> my head". He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, [...] "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make."

500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was holding my gun and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, and the way you hold yourself, the way you look at things. I tried to <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E
500|$|On 31 December 2008, it was {{announced}} that Pratchett was to be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen's 2009 New Year Honours. He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, [...] "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it I touched, handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me." ...|$|E
500|$|The role {{of adult}} Gretel, whom Wirkola {{wanted to be}} [...] "a really, really strong and fun female character," [...] was {{originally}} planned for Noomi Rapace, {{who dropped out of}} consideration for the part prior to early January 2011. [...] Diane Kruger and Eva Green were reported to also be in talks for the role. English actress Gemma Arterton was ultimately cast in the role. She impressed Wirkola with her performance in The Disappearance of Alice Creed, and, after they have met, with her [...] "really filthy sense of humour" [...] as [...] "the humour is essential to this film." [...] Arterton said she was attracted to Wirkola's [...] "strong vision" [...] for the film, calling it [...] "very, very dark, and bloodthirsty and there’s a lot of cursing. It’s kind of got a Tarantino feel, really." [...] Arterton described her character as [...] "much more in tune with her spiritual side. Hansel is a typical action hero, cheeky, funny, a womanizer. She’s much more of a thinker, intense, internal and bit more open-minded than he is." [...] She said that Gretel is [...] "a sexual character but she's not having sex with anybody, which is a change for me because usually in my films I'm sleeping with somebody!" [...] She further explained the characters: [...] "Hansel & Gretel have this unstoppable bond but they’re also so different from each other. She’s the brains of the operation. He’s the brawn. He’s the joker and the show-off. She’s more the watcher, the researcher, the one who tries to really understand witchcraft." [...] Arterton added, [...] "Jeremy [...] and I found within the script moments where we showed the vulnerable side of them. Often in action movies, people are scared to <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in.</b> I think it was important." [...] She said that she [...] "loved every minute" [...] of the production and did not want it to end, also crediting it for helping her overcome her fear of getting hurt.|$|E

2500|$|Be the Twilight was {{recorded}} in Los Angeles with producer Paul Fox (XTC, Björk, The Sugarcubes, They Might Be Giants). The band wrote 45 songs for the album before traveling to Los Angeles, where they trimmed this down to 12. The songs were influenced by the band's surroundings {{at the time of}} recording, with Hudson stating [...] "here's a whole directness that exists in L.A. and I kind of feel that we <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the record". Hudson said that after [...] "putting all the things you've ever experienced" [...] into Addicted Romantic, the band were able to record Be the Twilight [...] "more in the moment."

2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E
