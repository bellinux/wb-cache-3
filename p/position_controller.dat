We study on the design of the structure of the linear actuator and the <b>positioning</b> <b>controller</b> for the EMV in order to realize the EMV.

But, the mechanical and the electrical characteristics of the EMV are changing over a long time.

50|$|An {{electric}} {{command signal}} (flow rate set point) {{is applied to}} the integrated <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> which drives the pilot stage. The thereby deflected nozzle flapper system produces a pressure difference across the drive areas of the spool and affects its movement. The position transducer (LVDT) which is excited via an oscillator measures the position of the spool (actual value, position voltage). This signal is then demodulated and fed back to the controller where it is compared with the command signal. The controller drives the pilot stage until the error between command signal and feedback signal will be zero. Thus the position of the spool is proportional to the electric command signal.|$|E

50|$|The newest {{version of}} the Mandala, mk2.9, is a {{standard}} class-compliant USB MIDI controller (no special drivers required) which uses a computer as its sound source. When the pad is struck it sends a MIDI trigger note with velocity {{as well as a}} position value (in the form of a MIDI continuous controller) across a USB cable into a computer. A Virtual Brain program is included with mk2.9 and has a set of included instrument samples and multiple effects (filters, delay, distortion, etc.) which can be applied to individual zones or to the overall surface. Unlimited user samples can also be added to the included sound library. Any parameter of any effect can be controlled by the position (0-127) or velocity (0-127) of a surface strike, resulting in effects such as bending pitch, changing delay time, or increasing reverb as the pad is played from center to edge. The <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> and velocity controller can be scaled to the player's liking. Factory preset sound configurations are included with the Virtual Brain as well as unlimited empty slots for user created presets. Drummers can also modify panning and note settings for each zone. The Virtual Brain program is not required to play the Mandala because the pad is a MIDI controller that can trigger any software that accepts MIDI input.|$|E

Using rotor position information {{in conjunction with the}} proposed fuzzy <b>position</b> <b>controller,</b> the motor can be electronically commutated and driven, i. e., the proposed fuzzy <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> is eliminating the need for an electronic commutator between the phases. Moreover, the proposed fuzzy <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> is not limited to a certain number of stator coils or rotor poles.

Additional simulations investigate the robustness of the proposed fuzzy <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> to change in motor parameters.

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, an {{intelligent}} robust <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> for permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) servo drives is proposed. The intelligent robust <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> {{consists of a}} two-degrees-of-freedom integral plus proportional & rate feedback (2 DOF I-PD) controller {{in addition to an}} on-line trained neural-network model-following controller (NNMFC). This controller, 2 DOF I-PD NNMFC, combines the merits of the 2 DOF I-PD controller and the NNMF controller for PMSM servo drives position control. A systematic mathematical procedure is derived to find the parameters of the 2 DOF I-PD <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> according to the required specifications for the PMSM servo drive system. Then, the resulting closed loop transfer function of the servo drive system including the current control, speed control and position control loops is used as the reference model. In addition to the 2 DOF I-PD <b>position</b> <b>controller,</b> a neural-network model-following controller whose weights are trained on-line is designed to realize high dynamic performance in disturbance rejection and tracking characteristics. According to the model-following error between the outputs of the reference model and the PMSM servo drive system, the NNMFC generates two adaptive control signal which are added to the 2 DOF I-PD speed controller output to attain robust model-following characteristics under different operating conditions regardless of parameter variations and load disturbances. A computer simulation is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 2 DOF I-PD NNMF <b>position</b> <b>controller.</b> The results confirm that the proposed 2 DOF I-PD NNMF <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> produces robust performance, rapid and accurate response to the reference model regardless of load disturbances or PMSM parameter variations...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{aerospace}} community {{has seen a}} rise in the popularity of multirotor unmanned aircraft. This increase in popularity is in part due to the ability of a multirotor aircraft to hover, its simple dynamics, and its mechanical simplicity. Operating these unmanned aircraft indoors or outdoors is a well understood challenge, however these aircraft have predominantly been operated in an unconstrained area. This thesis investigates how to control a multirotor aircraft in a constrained environment, such as {{on the end of a}} tether. A <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> is presented for a multirotor UAV operating on the end of a fixed length, tensioned tether in spherical coordinates, which utilizes the vehicles relative position and tether dynamics to calculate control inputs and ensure flight stability. The proposed <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> was put through a series of verification and validation tests using both a simulated tether-aircraft system, as well as a quadrotor flown in the RAVEN indoor flight space in the MIT Aerospace Controls Laboratory. During simulated flight testing the spherical <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> showed a 35. 7 % decrease in tether tension, and during indoor flight testing the spherical <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> exhibited an 8. 4 % decrease in power consumption over the traditional Cartesian <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> while operating on the end of a fixed length tether. by Michael R.

40|$|Adequate {{control of}} the {{position}} of the plasma column within the STOR-M tokamak is a chief requirement in order for experimental quality discharges to be obtained. Optimal control over tokamak discharge parameters, including the plasma position, is very difficult to achieve. This is {{due in large part to}} the difficulty in modelling the tokamak discharge parameters, as they are highly nonlinear and time varying in nature. The difficulty of modelling the tokamak discharge parameters suggests that a control system, such as a fuzzy logic based controller, which does not require a system model may be well suited to the control of fusion plasma. In order to improve the quality of control over the plasma position within the STOR-M tokamak, the existing analog PID controller was modified. These modifications facilitate the application of a digital controller by a personal computer via the Advantech PCL- 711 B data acquisition card. The performance of the modified plasma <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> and an Arbitrary Signal Generator developed by the author was evaluated. This modified plasma <b>position</b> <b>controller</b> was applied successfully to the STOR-M tokamak during both normal mode and A. C. mode operation.
