5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E

25|$|Enders Walter and Todd Sandler theorized in a 2006 {{book on the}} <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> {{terrorism}} that it provided {{a model for the}} terrorist bombings of the 1980s.

He went on to compare the aftermath of the bombing to that of Carlos Marighella's campaign with the Brazilian Communist Party.|$|E
