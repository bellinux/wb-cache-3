50|$|In {{economic}} theory, specifically Keynesian economics, precautionary {{demand is}} one of the determinants of demand for money (and credit), the others being transactions demand and speculative demand.The precautionary demand for money refers to real balances held for use in a contingency. As receipts and payments cannot be perfectly foreseen, people hold <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> to minimize the potential loss arising from a contingency.|$|E
50|$|The precautionary {{demand is}} {{dependent}} on the size of income, the availability of credit, and the rate of interest. With more income the precautionary demand will increase because there {{are more likely to be}} surprises in the timing or size of the correspondingly high expenditures. On the other hand, the more readily available is credit (e.g., the larger is the untapped portion of a credit card's line of credit), the less of a need there is to hold <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> of money. A higher rate of interest represents a higher opportunity cost of holding money for any reason, including the precautionary reason, and so leads to lower precautionary holdings.|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} intermediary {{is shown to}} result from a market imperfection related to the costly monitoring {{of the actions of}} consumers. In such an environment complete insurance is not obtainable and consumers respond by holding some of their wealth as <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> in order to self-insure. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> are those financial vehicles which permit one to invest and then liquidate with the smallest amount of loss because of the "sunk costs" associated with the transaction. An economy of N identical consumers is created and it is shown that a {{financial intermediary}} which collects the <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> of the community can then implement risk sharing and liberate social resources for greater investment.

We {{argue that it}} should fall under lending regulations only if consumers use the program to get intentional loans. In contrast, if the program primarily applies to checking account activity then it should fall under checking account regulations. A model of <b>precautionary</b> <b>balance</b> holding and checking account customer data are used to estimate the likelihood of overdrafting. Predicted overdrafts are compared to actual overdrafts to conclude that 79 % are explained by the model and thus thought to be mistakes due to the stochastic nature of household expenditures.

40|$|Uncertainty {{about the}} export {{earnings}} accruing {{to a country}} (sometimes referred to as export instability) is {{an important source of}} macroeconomic uncertainty in many developing countries. Theory predicts that countries should react to increases in this form of uncertainty by increasing their level of savings. The resulting asset accumulations would then act as the country’s insurance against the greater riskiness in its income stream. The paper tests this implication for a large sample of developing countries. In general, the results suggest that developing countries have indeed responded to increases in export instability by building up <b>precautionary</b> savings <b>balances.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} we examine the {{relation}} between firm’s financial structure and family ownership. We develop a theoretical model of the precautionary cash holdings. Our empirical {{results show that the}} fraction of a company’s shares that are held by the founding family members or their descendants influences the use of cash and equivalents, dividend policy and debt structure of a firm. Our results are robust to different estimation methods and alternative model specifications.

40|$|The {{observed}} low {{velocity of}} circulation of money implies that households hold {{more money than}} they normally spend. A natural explanation for this behavior is that households face uncertain expenditure needs, {{so they have a}} precautionary motive for holding money. We investigate the precautionary demand for money in a search model where households are subject to preference shocks. The model predicts that the velocity of circulation of money is not only low but also interest elastic. The model closely fits United States data on the velocity of circulation of money and interest rates that span the period 1892 - 2003. The empirical analysis reveals a dramatic reduction in <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> towards the end of our sample, probably linked to innovations in the information technology. This drop in <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> is crucial for important issues of monetary economics such as the elasticity of the demand for money and the welfare cost of inflation...|$|E

40|$|Firms hold {{cash for}} a variety of {{different}} reasons. Generally, cash balances held in a firm can be called considered, precautionary, speculative, transactional and intentional. The first are the result of management anxieties. Managers fear the negative part of the risk and hold cash to hedge against it. Second, cash balances are held to use chances that are created by the positive part of the risk equation. Next, cash balances are the result of the operating needs of the firm. In this article, we analyze the relation between these types of cash balances and risk. This article also contains propositions for marking levels of <b>precautionary</b> cash <b>balances</b> and speculative cash balances. Current models for determining cash management, assign no minimal cash level, or their minimal cash level is based on the manager's intuition.

Recent reductions in reserve requirements have not been accompanied by significant reductions in vault cash. This situation suggests that banks may be managing vault cash reserves primarily as <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> to satisfy daily fluctuations in deposits and withdrawals, rather then part of total reserve management. In 1997, some larger banks instituted formal management of vault currency. If this practice spreads, it will have implications for monetary policy and cash operations.

40|$|Abstract—Not {{properly}} {{accounting for}} differences between business owners and nonbusiness owners {{in studies of}} household wealth can lead to erroneous conclusions {{about the significance of}} different saving motives. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics from the 1980 s and 1990 s, we show that within samples of both business owners and non– business owners, the amount of precautionary savings with respect to labor income risk is modest and accounts for less than 10 % of total household wealth. Previous large estimates of the size of <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> resulted from pooling these two groups together.

40|$|This paper explores econometric and {{theoretical}} interpretations for {{the relatively high}} demand for international reserves by countries in the Far East and the relatively low demand by some other developing countries. Using a sample of about 125 developing countries, we show that reserve holdings over 1980 – 1996 {{seem to be the}} predictable outcome of a few key factors, such as the size of international transactions, their volatility, the exchange-rate arrangement, and political considerations. The estimating equation does a good job of predicting reserve holdings in Asia before the 1997 financial crisis. After the crisis, the estimating equation significantly underpredicts the reserve holdings of several key Far East countries, as one might expect from the Lucas Critique. This underprediction is consistent with models explaining reserve demand in developing countries. Specifically, we show that sovereign risk and costly tax collection to cover fiscal liabilities lead to a relatively large precautionary demand for international reserves. In the aftermath of a crisis, countries that have to deal with higher perceived sovereign risk and higher fiscal liabilities (both funded and unfunded) will opt to increase their demand for reserves. The models also help us understand why some developing countries do not hold large <b>precautionary</b> reserve <b>balances</b> in the aftermath of crises. Countries with high discount rates, political instability or political corruption find it optimal to hol...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} design of optimal {{monetary}} policy rules for emerging economies confronted to sharp capital outflows and speculative attacks. We extend Taylor type monetary policy rules by allowing the central bank to give some weight {{to the level of}} <b>precautionary</b> foreign reserve <b>balances</b> as one of its targets. We show that a currency crisis scenario can easily occur when the weight is zero, and that it can be avoided when the weight is positive. The impacts of the central bank's monetary control on the output level, the infla-tion rate, the exchange rate, and the foreign reserve level are investigated as well. By applying both the Hamiltonian as well as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation (the latter leading to a dynamic programming formulation of the problem), we can explore safe domains of attractions in a variety of compli-cated model variants. Given the uncertainties the central banks faces, we also show of how central banks can enlarge safe domains of attraction...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{inflation}} in a competitive search model where each buyer’s utility is private information, and money is essential. The equilibrium is efficient at the Friedman rule, but inflation creates an inefficiency in the terms of trade. Buyers experience a preference shock after they are matched with a seller, and thus they have a precautionary motive for holding money. Sellers, who compete to attract buyers, post non-linear price schedules. As inflation rises, sellers post relatively flat price schedules, which reduce the need for <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances.</b> These price schedules induce buyers with a low desire to consume to purchase inefficiently high quantities because of the low marginal cost of purchasing goods. In contrast, buyers with a high desire to consume purchase inefficiently low quantities as they face binding liquidity constraints.

40|$|Public {{authorities}} often {{invoke the}} precautionary principle to ban or postpone {{the development of}} innovative projects with uncertain but potentially harmful irreversible impacts on the environment or health. As stated in the Rio declaration, the <b>precautionary</b> principle suggests <b>balancing</b> costs and benefits associated with irreversible decisions while taking account of the perspective to acquire better but costly information in the future. Though the real option theory {{seems to be an}} appropriate tool to deal with the precautionary principle it has two important limits with this respect. First it focuses on Markovian processes rather than on Bayesian learning. Second, it disregards the role of preferences whereas preferences are {{at the core of the}} seemingly linked concept of precautionary saving. The article is an attempt to circumvent these two limits. A canonical model of Bayesian real option expressed in terms of intertemporal utility maximisation is presented and solved. The optimal decision rule is discussed in the light of the precautionary principle. It is then shown how to switch consistently to an equivalent problem expressed in terms of costs and benefits.

40|$|Inflation, {{as a tax}} on money, gives buyers an {{incentive}} to reduce money balances. Sellers are aware of this incentive and try to attract buyers by announcing price offers that {{reduce the need for}} buyers to carry <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances.</b> We examine the effect of inflation on equilibrium price offers and associated trades in a competitive search environment where buyers experience preference shocks after they are already matched with a seller. With full information, the equilibrium price structure consist of a single flat fee applied equally to all buyers. If buyer preferences are private information, incentive compatibility forces sellers to charge more to buyers who purchase larger quantities. However, as inflation rises, price schedules become relatively flat. The equilibrium is efficient at the Friedman rule and inflation reduces welfare both with full and private information. With full information, inflation reduces output for all buyer types. With private information, inflation reallocates output from buyers with a high desire to consume to buyers with a low desire to do so...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} welfare under one-money and two-money regimes in a Lagos and Wright (2005) type of {{monetary}} search model where heterogeneous buyers experience preference shocks {{after they are}} matched with sellers, and where the buyers ’ preferences are private information. When the terms of trade in the decentralized market is determined by competitive search, using a second money improves welfare over the one-money regime if the in‡ation rate is above the Friedman rule. The reason is that with a single money, buyers need to hold costly <b>precautionary</b> <b>balances</b> to signal their preferences. In the two-money regime, buyers can signal their preferences by {{the composition of the}} two monies in their monetary portfolios, which eliminates the need for holding costly precautionary money balances. The welfare gap between the two regimes diminishes when in‡ation approaches the Friedman rule. We also show that we‡are is the same across the two monetary regimes when the terms of trade in the decentralized market is determined by competitive pricing. This is because agents cannot discriminate against the two monies when they act as price takers...|$|E
