25|$|Artificially {{acquired}} {{passive immunity}} is a short-term immunization {{induced by the}} transfer of antibodies, which can be administered in several forms; as human or animal blood plasma, as pooled human immunoglobulin for intravenous (IVIG) or intramuscular (IG) use, and {{in the form of}} monoclonal antibodies (MAb). <b>Passive</b> <b>transfer</b> is used prophylactically in the case of immunodeficiency diseases, such as hypogammaglobulinemia.

[...] They receive no <b>passive</b> <b>transfer</b> of {{immunity}} via the placenta before birth, so any antibodies that they need have to be ingested (unless supplied by injection or other artificial means).

2500|$|Artificially {{acquired}} {{passive immunity}} is a short-term immunization {{achieved by the}} transfer of antibodies, which can be administered in several forms; as human or animal blood plasma or serum, as pooled human immunoglobulin for intravenous (IVIG) or intramuscular (IG) use, as high-titer human IVIG or IG from immunized donors or from donors recovering from the disease, and as monoclonal antibodies (MAb). <b>Passive</b> <b>transfer</b> is used [...] to prevent disease or used prophylactically {{in the case of}} immunodeficiency diseases, such as hypogammaglobulinemia.

There is also a potential risk for hypersensitivity reactions, and serum sickness, especially from gamma globulin of non-human origin. Passive immunity provides immediate protection, but the body does not develop memory, therefore the patient is at risk of being infected by the same pathogen later unless they acquire active immunity or vaccination.|$|E
2500|$|Only a {{few other}} species besides humans {{transfer}} maternal antibodies before birth, including primates and lagomorphs (which includes rabbits and hares). In some of these species IgM can be transferred across the placenta as well as IgG. All other mammalian species predominantly or solely transfer maternal antibodies after birth through milk. In these species, the neonatal gut is able to absorb IgG for hours to days after birth. However, {{after a period of}} time the neonate can no longer absorb maternal IgG through their gut, an event that is referred to as [...] "gut closure". If a neonatal animal does not receive adequate amounts of colostrum prior to gut closure, is does not have a sufficient amount of maternal IgG in its blood to fight off common diseases. This condition is referred to as failure of <b>passive</b> <b>transfer.</b> It can be diagnosed by measuring the amount of IgG in a newborn's blood, and is treated with intravenous administration of immunoglobulins. If not treated, it can be fatal.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The term solar {{air heating}} is a {{technology}} {{in which the}} radiant energy emitted by the sun is captured in an absorber and is used for space heating. Needless {{to say it is}} a renewable and pollution free method to produce space heating and when is used in commercial buildings or industries could be very cost effective. Improvement in the thermo hydraulic performance of a solar air heater can be done by enhancing the heat transfer. In general, heat transfer enhancement techniques are divided into two groups: active and passive techniques. Providing an artificial roughness on a heat transferring surface is an effective <b>passive</b> heat <b>transfer</b> technique to enhance the rate of heat transfer to fluid flow. In this paper, reviews of various artificial roughness elements used as <b>passive</b> heat <b>transfer</b> techniques, in order to improve thermo hydrauli...|$|R

50|$|Aldosterone receptors {{are present}} on the {{epithelial}} cells of the distal nephron in the kidney. Aldosterone activates sodium channels that result in sodium resorption from the urine. Increased sodium and water retention results in systemic arterial hypertension. This increase in active sodium reabsorption generates an electrochemical gradient that leads to <b>passive</b> <b>transfer</b> of potassium from the tubular cells into the urine. This causes a lower total body concentration of potassium and potentially, hypokalemia. Hypokalemia affects polarization of nerve and muscle membranes, which causes episodic muscle weakness.|$|E

There are two forms: peracute, and subacute. The peracute form is {{characterized}} by recumbency, tachypnea, dyspnea, myalgia, cardiac arrhythmias, and rapid death.
