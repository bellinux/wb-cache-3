25|$|The amendment's proponents {{argued that}} the fixing of a time limit and the {{extending}} of it were powers committed exclusively to Congress under the political question doctrine and that in any event Congress had power to extend. It was argued that inasmuch as the fixing of a reasonable time was within Congress' power and that Congress could fix the time either in advance or at some later point, based upon its evaluation {{of the social and}} other bases of the necessities of the amendment, Congress did not do violence to the Constitution when, once having fixed the time, it subsequently extended the time. Proponents recognized that if the time limit was fixed in the text of the amendment Congress could not alter it because the time limit as well as the substantive provisions of the proposal had been subject to ratification by a number of States, making it unalterable by Congress except through the amending process again. Opponents argued that Congress, having by a two-thirds vote sent the amendment and its authorizing resolution to the states, had put the matter beyond changing by passage of a simple resolution, that states had either acted upon the entire package or at least that they had or could have acted affirmatively upon the promise of Congress that if the amendment had not been ratified within the <b>prescribed</b> <b>period</b> it would expire and their assent would not be compelled for longer than they had intended.|$|E

Widowers were expected to mourn for a mere three months, whereas the proper mourning period expected for widows was up to four years.

2500|$|Academic {{performance}} is rated from 1.00 being excellent to 5.00 as failed. Grades from 1.00 to 3.00 {{are separated by}} increments of 0.25, while 3.00 is followed immediately by 4.00 and then 5.00. Some professors use 0.50 as increments instead, and some colleges, particularly the College of Engineering do not give 4.00 grades. A grade of four (4.00) is a conditional grade and a student needs to remove the grade of 4.00 during a <b>prescribed</b> <b>period</b> (usually determined by the college where he/she is enrolled) or else it will become 5.00 once the period has lapsed. A conditional grade can only be removed by a removal exam; if the student passes the exam, he/she will obtain a grade of 3.00, otherwise it is 5.00. An alternative for 4.00 is the rating of [...] "INC", which means incomplete, and is given to students who have unfinished requirements for a particular subject.

2500|$|The first 19 or so Africans {{to reach}} the English colonies arrived in Jamestown, Virginia in 1619, brought by Dutch traders who had seized them from a {{captured}} Spanish slave ship. The Spanish usually baptized slaves in Africa before embarking them. As English custom then considered baptized Christians exempt from slavery, colonists treated these Africans as indentured servants, and they joined about 1,000 English indentured servants already in the colony. The Africans were freed after a <b>prescribed</b> <b>period</b> and given the use of land and supplies by their former masters. The historian Ira Berlin noted that {{what he called the}} [...] "charter generation" [...] in the colonies was sometimes made up of mixed-race men (Atlantic Creoles) who were indentured servants, and whose ancestry was African and Iberian. They were descendants of African women and Portuguese or Spanish men who worked in African ports as traders or facilitators in the slave trade. For example, Anthony Johnson arrived in Virginia in 1621 from Angola as an indentured servant; he became free and a property owner, eventually buying and owning slaves himself. The transformation of the social status of Africans, from indentured servitude to slaves in a racial caste which they could not leave or escape, happened gradually.|$|E
