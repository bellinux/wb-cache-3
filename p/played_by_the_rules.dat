500|$|According to Christopher John Farley, Prince {{had been}} [...] "carrying a torch for neo soul for decades, refusing to make R that <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> or fit into {{comfortable}} formats.

American artists during the early 1990s included Zhané, Groove Theory, Joi, Tony Rich, and Me'Shell NdegéOcello.|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} scene, Sloane, Cameron, and Ferris {{are in the}} left field stands inside Wrigley. Ferris flexes his hand in pain after {{supposedly}} catching the foul ball. During this scene, the characters enjoy the game and joke about what they would be doing if they had <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> All these [...] "in the park" [...] shots, including the one from the previous scene where Ferris catches the foul ball on TV, were filmed on September 24, 1985, at a game between the Montreal Expos and the Cubs. During the 1985 season, the Braves and the Expos both wore powder blue uniforms during their road games. And so, with seamless editing by Hughes, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish that the game being seen and described in the pizza joint is not only a different game but also a different Cubs' opponent than the one filmed inside the stadium.|$|E

But you know the United States government ordered the inspectors {{to withdraw from the}} modalities without conferring with the Security Council. It took Iraqis by surprise. Iraqis were saying, [...] "We're <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> why aren't you? If you're not going <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> then it's a game that we don't want to participate in." [...] Bill Clinton ordered the inspectors out.

500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E
500|$|Although often a {{candidate}} in the press to captain England, Fender was never chosen to do so. Rumours circulated at the time about the reasons. One suggestion {{was that he was}} overlooked because he was Jewish, but Fender said he was not Jewish and in any case did not believe this would have been a problem. Other purported reasons included that he had not been to Oxford or Cambridge, and {{that he was in the}} wine trade, which was considered an unsuitable career for a gentleman, but in later life Fender dismissed these as potential factors. In fact, not everyone approved of Fender's captaincy. He was sometimes accused of gamesmanship, for example by persuading umpires that conditions were unfit for play until they favoured his team. He occasionally used negative tactics when he was unhappy with the approach of the opposition—in one game where the opposition had not declared, he slowed down play to the extent that one over took 12 minutes to bowl. Opponents recalled other uses of time-wasting tactics, deliberate damaging of the pitch by Surrey players to assist their bowlers, and intimidation of both the opposition and umpires. The cricket writer Martin Williamson suggests that [...] "in an era where gentlemen <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> Fender was adroit at stretching the Laws to snapping point." [...] Fender's attitude towards amateurs also brought him into opposition with others. His disinclination to play amateurs in the Surrey team unless they were talented enough was opposed by the Surrey committee—the Surrey president, H. D. G. Leveson Gower, wished Fender to include friends and contacts whom Fender did not consider worth a place in the team. According to E. W. Swanton: [...] "While always highly popular with the teams he led, his relations with the Surrey authorities were also apt to be difficult." [...] Fender attempted to unite the amateurs and professionals in the team through using one gate to enter the field, and stopped the practice of separate lunches and teas. He planned to end the tradition of using separate changing rooms, until stopped by the professional Hobbs. Fender's proposals shocked senior cricket figures, and caused another clash with the influential Lord Harris; allied to other disagreements between the pair, it may have ended his England career. The deeply conservative cricket establishment may also have resented Fender's unorthodoxy on the cricket pitch. Fender made himself more unacceptable by mocking establishment figures such as Leveson Gower; a teammate later remarked that Fender [...] "was often his own worst enemy". Fender also believed that the controversy over his journalism in 1921 counted against him with the MCC committee. According to Wisden, Fender's limited success at Test level [...] "may have saved the selectors, who were thought never to favour him as a captain of England, an embarrassing problem". His Wisden obituary concluded: [...] "He was one of the most colourful figures in the cricket world for many years... and was widely regarded as the shrewdest county captain of his generation".|$|E

[...] The Sooners won the appeal to get back their wins from the 2005 season.|$|E

50|$|The {{player on}} {{the left of the}} winner of the bid ('declarer' is hardly used; in fact many refer to 'tricks' as 'sets') will begin the game. The only {{exception}} - {{and this is not a}} universal rule - is in no-trump games, the winner of the bid will begin the game. <b>The</b> other less-agreed-upon <b>rule</b> is <b>the</b> drawing of trumps. Some people <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that <b>the</b> drawing of trumps can only begin when the player drawing trumps already has a void suit or when trump has been broken (i.e. a trump card has already been <b>played),</b> some <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that drawing can be done at any point in the game, while most <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that trumps can only be drawn when the trump suit has been broken. At the end of the game, players remain in the same seats but due to the nature of partner determination, everyone could begin with new partners in the next round.|$|R
2500|$|The boom in rail {{transport}} in Britain during the 1840s meant {{that people were}} able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, {{it was difficult for}} schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the host [...] "home" [...] school, and the other half by the visiting [...] "away" [...] school.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1873, {{the failure}} of Jay Cooke & Co. precipitated first the Panic of 1873 and in its wake the worst U.S. {{financial}} depression up to that time, which resonated with the concurrent transatlantic Long Depression. Initially, northeastern U.S. anthracite markets were not badly affected, largely due to controls put in place by Gowen's coal pool. In 1874, in addition to shoring up this coal pool's internal checks {{to make sure all}} members <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> Gowen also organized Schuylkill County's independent coal operators into the Schuylkill Coal Exchange. By autumn 1874 it was common knowledge that these operators (including the Coal & Iron Co.) were intent upon precipitating a ruinous miners' strike by which to destroy the WBA (by this time renamed the Miners and Laborers Benevolent Association, or M&LBA). [...] Such a strike was indeed brought about by severe slashes in wages offered to miners (20% cut) and mine laborers (10% cut). Known as the [...] "Long Strike", the work stoppage lasted through June 1875, ending in the collapse of the union.|$|E
