50|$|Sonchus arvensis, {{the field}} milk thistle, field sowthistle, <b>perennial</b> <b>sow-thistle,</b> corn sow thistle, dindle, gutweed, swine thistle, or tree sow thistle, is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. S. arvensis often occurs in annual crops in the northern parts of Europe and may cause substantial yield losses.|$|E
40|$|<b>Perennial</b> <b>sow-thistle</b> (Sonchus arvensis L.) {{represents}} an increasing problem in Finland. Options for mechanical and cultural control of S. arvensis were studied {{in a field}} experiment on clay soil under organic production. The experiment consisted of different crop sequences: spring cereal (barley, Hordeum vulgare L., in 2001, oats, Avena sativa L., in 2002) with or without inter-row hoeing and/or stubble cultivation, bare fallow, fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), and ley with mowing. In 2003 the entire field was sown to spring wheat. Crop plant and Sonchus shoot density and dry mass prior to cereal harvest and crop yield were assessed. The control effect was rated: bare fallow > ley > cereal with or without inter-row hoeing > poor growth fibre hemp. Bare fallow was an effective but costly way to reduce S. arvensis infestation. Introduction of a regularly mown green fallow or silage ley in the crop rotation is advisable. Mechanical weed control by inter-row hoeing in cereals limits S. arvensis growth. Infestation might also be reduced by stubble cultivation in autumn. When managing S. arvensis using mechanical and cultural methods, appropriate options, including a competitive crop, should be chosen for the specific field and rotation. ...|$|E
40|$|Sonchus arvensis L. is a {{perennial}} weed {{which has become}} more common in Scandinavian countries owing mainly to the proliferation of organic farming which limits the use of her-bicides. When soil tillage is used for controlling perennial weeds, farmers are usually recommended that mechanical disturbance should {{be done at the}} developmental stage when the plant is most sensitive for disturbance which coincides with minimum below ground dry weight. Håkansson (1969 b) has shown that S. arvensis reaches its minimum dry weight of underground regenerative structures at 5 - 7 true leaves. The time taken to reach dry weight minimum depends on environmental factors like temperature but may also be influenced by competition from other plants. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate if the phenological stage, at which minimum dry weight of below ground biomass occurred in S. arvensis (i. e. compensation point), was affected by competition from a crop. A greenhouse box experiment was performed at Ultuna, close to Uppsala, Sweden (59 º 48 ’N, 17 º 39 ’E) during January - April 2012. The plant material used in the experiment was Sonchus arvensis L. (<b>perennial</b> <b>sow-thistle)</b> and Hordeum vulgare L. var Judit (spring barley). The experiment consisted of two treatments: S. arvensis grown (1) with (C+) and (2) without (C-) competition from spring barley. The compensation point in competing plants occurred at leaf stages 4 and 5, while it occurred at the 4 leaf stage in plants without competition. For given phenological stages, weight loss of below-ground structures did not differ between the C+ and C- plants, apart from the 5 leaf stage, at which the C+ plants had lost more in weight that the C- plants. The initially planted root parts of C+ plants lost more weight than the C- plants. Phenological development of S. arvensis, in terms of development of numbers of leaves over time, was delayed by competition with spring barley. For agronomy practice, these results imply that S. arvensis should be controlled earlier than previously was recommended, and that competition from a crop can be used in addition to greatly deplete the below-ground resources in S. arvensis...|$|E
40|$|Summary 	Organic farming means {{a chance}} for plants to reveal their abilities. We offer better {{conditions}} to the associated plants for their growth and reproduction by no use of chemical herbicides and by using alternative growing methods. 	Organic agrophytocoenoses are significant by higher species richness and cover. There can be found some of endangered species among the weeds, which may be more successful in organic system, therfore the organic type of farming may serve for their protection. The most successful weed species endanger cultural crops on both organic and conventional fields. They become more dangerous {{without the possibility of}} herbicide application. Thanks to this, the strategy of each plant species is more important. That is why the question of weed suppression in organic farming is highly important and frequently asked. 	The aim of this thesis is to analyse weed flora on organic cereals fields and to point out possible factors influencing them. Braun-Blanquet scale of dominance and abundance has been used for the assessment of weed communities. Several different localities were investigated in Benešov district. Influence of winter cereals, spring cereals, previous crop and the tillage system have been assessed. 	Some of the most important weed species were: annual winter weed species in winter cereals, perennials and few annual spring species in spring cereals. Annual weeds were typical for spring cereals sown two years on a one plot, perennials were associated with spring cereals sown after fodder crops. -There were not found any evident differences in weed spectrum in winter cereals based on previous crop. Agrophytocoenosis on fields with conventional and reduced tillage differed. Wider spectrum of perennial species was typical for fields where reduced tillage was applied, differences in annual weed spectrum were also found. Typical species for conventional tillage were for example: marsh woundwort, common couch-grass and common poppy, while, creeping thistle, creeping buttercup, <b>perennial</b> <b>sow-thistle,</b> mugwort, corn chamomile, loose silky-bent and some others were often found on fields where reduced tillage were used. 	The results of the analysis in this thesis mostly lead to the same description of weeds as in literature, but few of the results are different. Thanks to statistically decisive results, it is apparent, how a farmer can affect the plant associations over a long period. Key words: organic farming, weeds, agrophytocoenosis, cereals, weed control, features(characteristic) of weeds...|$|E
