5|$|It {{was early}} June before UB-10 sank her next ship. The Belgian ship Menapier, {{carrying}} {{a load of}} iron ore from Algiers for Middlesbrough, was torpedoed and sunk off North Foreland by Steinbrinck on the 7th. Of the 23 <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the 1,886-ton ship, only 6 were saved.

5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was cleared for the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} approach to the airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

Natal was sunk by a magazine explosion near Cromarty on 30 December 1915, killing an estimated 390–421 <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> Most of her wreck was slowly salvaged over the decades until the remnants were demolished in the 1970s so they were no longer a hazard to navigation.|$|E

25|$|On 3 March 2001, a C-23B Sherpa {{belonging}} to the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard was carrying 18 construction workers from Hurlburt Field (Florida) to Naval Air Station Oceana (Virginia). The pilot left the flight deck to use the aft bathroom. His weight in the tailcone shifted {{the center of gravity}} sufficiently (later calculations determined that the aircraft had been loaded outside its operating envelope {{at the start of the}} flight) that the airplane became unstable when a patch of severe turbulence was encountered. The violent g-force shifts then encountered rendered the crew unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight near Unadilla, Georgia, killing the 21 <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

500|$|Following {{publication}} of the report, the ICAO adopted a resolution condemning the Soviet Union for the attack. Furthermore, the report led to a unanimous amendment in May 1984 – though not coming into force until October 1, 1998 – to the Convention on International Civil Aviation that defined {{the use of force}} against civilian airliners in more detail. The amendment to section 3(d) reads in part: [...] "The contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight and that, in case of interception, the lives of <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the safety of aircraft must not be endangered." ...|$|E

Luce, holding tightly to his child, was dragged deep down by the suction of the sinking vessel. When he rose to the surface, [...] "a most awful and heart-rending scene presented itself to my view—over two hundred men, women and children struggling together amidst pieces of wreck of every kind, calling on each other for help, and imploring God to assist them. Such an appalling scene may God preserve me from ever witnessing again." [...] As he struggled, a section of one of Arctics paddle-boxes rose to the surface, delivering him a glancing blow but striking and killing his son outright. Despite the shock, Luce was able to clamber on to the paddle-box, which provided a temporary raft for him and eleven others.|$|E
