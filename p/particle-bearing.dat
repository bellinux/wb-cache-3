50|$|Particle density, in {{the context}} of {{particle}} counts, is a measurement of the number of particles in a spatial unit of a <b>particle-bearing</b> medium. Where the spatial unit is one of volume, the medium is likely to a fluid; in another class of cases, the unit is one of area of a surface, and the particles rest on or adhere to that surface.|$|E
40|$|Four murine {{tissue culture}} cell strains, which {{originated}} by cloning from one common cell of subcutaneous connective tissue origin, were examined {{for the presence}} of virus by electron microscopy and complement fixation techniques. The relative distribution of C particles and intracisternal A particles was determined. Thereafter, the characteristics of and relationship between A- and C-type particles were investigated. Cell extracts were passaged onto virus-free Swiss and C 3 Hf mouse embryo tissue cultures; CF and EM tests were again made to investigate the infective capacities of the various particle types. Although C particles were found in passage cultures exposed to extracts from the C <b>particle-bearing</b> strains, no A particles were found in any passage culture. These results indicate that the intracisternal A particle was neither infective nor developmentally associated with the C particle. A positive CF test was correlated with the presence of morphologically detectable C particles and was independent of the concentration of A particles...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{administration}} of biomimetic nanoparticles loaded with antigen may represent an effective strategy to directly modulate adaptive immune {{responses in the}} respiratory tract. Depending on the design, virosomes may not only serve as biomimetic antigen carriers but are also endowed with intrinsic immune-stimulatory properties. We designed fluorescently labeled influenza-derived virosomes and liposome controls coupled to the model antigen ovalbumin to investigate uptake, phenotype changes, and antigen processing by antigen-presenting cells exposed to such particles in different respiratory tract compartments. Both virosomes and liposomes were captured by pulmonary macrophages and dendritic cells alike and induced activation in <b>particle-bearing</b> cells by upregulation of costimulatory markers such as CD 40, CD 80, CD 86, PD-L 1, PD-L 2, and ICOS-L. Though antigen processing and accumulation of both coupled and soluble antigen was similar between virosomes and liposomes, only ovalbumin-coupled virosomes generated a strong antigen-specific CD 4 + T cell proliferation. Pulmonary administrated antigen-coupled virosomes therefore effectively induced adaptive immune responses and may be utilized in novel preventive or therapeutic approaches in the respiratory tract...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} has been devised for isolation of lumenal plasma membranes from transitional epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder in rabbits and for subsequent separation of <b>particle-bearing</b> plaque regions from particle-free {{areas of the}} membranes. The success of the procedures employed and their effects on the isolates were assessed by electron microscopy of conventional plastic sections, negatively stained preparations, and freeze-etch replicas. When bladders are distended with a solution of 0. 01 M thioglycolic acid, which reduces sulfhydryl bridges, cytoplasmic filaments are disrupted, and {{large segments of the}} lumenal membranes rupture and float free into the lumen. A centrifugation procedure was developed for isolating a fraction enriched with the large fragments. A comparison of membranes isolated in the presence of thioglycolate with those isolated from epithelial cells homogenized in sucrose medium indicates that thioglycolate has little effect on their fine structure except for the removal of filaments which are normally associated with their cytoplasmic surface. The curved plaques of hexagonally arrayed particles and the particle-free interplaque regions, both characteristic of membranes before exposure to thioglycolate, are well preserved. Subsequent treatment of thioglycolate-isolated lumenal membranes with 1 % sodium desoxycholate (DOC) severs many of the interplaque regions, releasing individual plaques in which the particles are more clearly visible than before exposure to desoxycholate. Presumably, DOC acts by disrupting the hydrophobic bonds within the membrane; therefore, this type of cohesive force probably is a major factor maintaining the structural integrity of interplaque regions. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that interplaque regions undergo freeze-cleaving like simple bilayers with a plane of hydrophobic bonding...|$|E
40|$|Pigment grade {{titanium}} dioxide {{is composed of}} sub-micron sized particles, including a nano fraction, and is widely utilised in food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biomedical industries. Oral exposure to pigment grade {{titanium dioxide}} results {{in at least some}} material entering the circulation in humans, although subsequent interactions with blood immune cells are unknown. Pigment grade titanium dioxide is employed for its strong light scattering properties and this work exploited that attribute to determine whether single cell-particle associations could be determined in immune cells of human whole blood at ‘real life’ concentrations. In vitro assays, initially using isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, identified titanium dioxide associated with the surface of, and within, individual immune cells by darkfield reflectance in imaging flow cytometry. This was confirmed at the population level by side scatter measurements using conventional flow cytometry. Next it was demonstrated that imaging flow cytometry could quantify titanium dioxide <b>particle-bearing</b> cells, within the immune cell populations of fresh whole blood, down to titanium dioxide levels of 10 parts per billion, which is in the range anticipated for human blood following titanium dioxide ingestion. Moreover, surface association and internal localisation of titanium dioxide particles could be discriminated in the assays. Overall, results showed that in addition to the anticipated activity of blood monocytes internalising titanium dioxide particles, neutrophil internalisation and cell membrane adhesion also occurred, the latter for both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cell types. What happens in vivo and whether this contributes to activation of {{one or more of these}} different cells types in blood merits further attention.
