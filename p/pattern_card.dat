30|$|Swatches {{cut from}} pieces of cloth mounted in pattern books or on <b>pattern</b> <b>cards</b> {{provided}} {{a point of}} contact between the manufacturer and the distant buyer who used them to select the fabrics he or she wanted to buy. Organised in numerical sequence, the swatches were essential management tools for the communication of orders. Manufacturers saw such books ‘… {{not only as a}} history of their trade, but as a resource for communicating complex technical information quickly and efficiently. Nothing could supplant the effectiveness of a sample textile to communicate information about a pattern, colour, texture and finish’ [2]. As exporters of vast quantities of stuffs, Norwich’s manufacturers relied heavily on pattern books and <b>pattern</b> <b>cards</b> in their transactions with foreign and London customers.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the behavioral and neuropsychological characteristics of decision-making behavior during a gambling task {{as well as how}} these characteristics may relate to the Somatic Marker Hypothesis and the Frequency of Gain model. The applicability to intertemporal choice was also discussed. <b>Patterns</b> of <b>card</b> selection during a computerized interpretation of the Iowa Gambling Task were assessed for 10 men and 10 women. Steady State Topography was employed to assess cortical processing throughout this task. Results supported the hypothesis that <b>patterns</b> of <b>card</b> selection were in line with both theories. As hypothesized, these 2 <b>patterns</b> of <b>card</b> selection were also associated with distinct patterns of cortical activity, suggesting that intertemporal choice may involve the recruitment of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for somatic labeling, left fusiform gyrus for object representations, and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for an analysis of the associated frequency of gain or loss. It is suggested that processes contributing to intertemporal choice may include inhibition of negatively valenced options, guiding decisions away from those options, as well as computations favoring frequently rewarded options...|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>patterns</b> are <b>card</b> {{designs in}} the public domain that have been printed by {{multiple}} publishers in the past or present. These are regional patterns that are still in use today. Decks with 50 cards have two jokers.|$|R
40|$|Design Patterns are {{supposed}} to be well documented, tried and tested solutions to recurrent problems. Current pattern evaluation techniques do not evaluate patterns according to the quality of pattern presented, the quality of the solution presented, nor the quality of the documentation. This paper introduces <b>Pattern</b> Report <b>Cards</b> as an evaluation process for design patterns that is demonstrable, measurable and reproducible. For the evaluation process several quality indicators have been identified from existing literature {{that can be used to}} assess the quality of a design pattern. During evaluation a collection of qualitative and quantitative evaluation techniques are used to assess how well patterns adhere to the identified quality indicators. Further, management and execution of the <b>Pattern</b> Report <b>Card</b> process is controlled by the PREMES framework. This framework provides a PDCA management cycle that facilitates the construction of bespoke evaluation systems for design patterns. Tailoring is achieved by providing guidance over selection and construction of the techniques used to assess pattern quality. Use of PREMES framework and <b>Pattern</b> Report <b>Cards</b> will lead to improvement in the quality of patterns being created by pattern writers. Postprin...|$|R

30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the pattern books and <b>pattern</b> <b>cards,</b> the present work is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first substantial scientific research ever conducted on Norwich textiles other than: an independent study by Beth Szuhay (on textile finishes) [9]; analysis of an undated Norwich wool textile from the Winterthur collection, where indigo carmine, madder and weld were identified [10]; two small investigations into a dye known as ‘Norwich red’; and a piece of green fabric from an eighteenth century wing chair analysed by the Institut Royale du Patrimoine Artistique in Brussels during 2016. Based on a conversation with C. Terry (Senior Curator Senior Curator of Social History, Norfolk Museums Service), the Belgian study found evidence of an indigoid dye.|$|R
50|$|All {{cards were}} {{originally}} printed from woodcuts; the cards were later coloured either by hand {{or by the}} use of stencils. Tarot was recorded as being very popular card game throughout France during the 16th and early 17th century but later fell into obscurity with the exception of eastern France and Switzerland. Very few Marseilles <b>pattern</b> <b>cards</b> from the 17th century have survived, chiefly among them are Noblet's. In contrast, dozens of decks from the 18th century have made it to the present. From eastern France and Switzerland, the game spread north to Sweden and east to Russia starting {{from the middle of the}} 18th century, making it one of the most popular card games of that era until being overtaken by Whist in the 19th century.|$|R

5000|$|Garzoni {{calls it}} the common game, and Tarocco the new invention, quoting the {{authority}} of Volaterano. However {{it is known that}} Tarocco was once called Trionfi and dates to at least 1440. It is clear that throughout the 17th to 19th centuries the game of Trappola was very popular over a wide area stretching from Nürnberg and Leipzig to Graz and Budapest. Other forms of Trappola, like Špady and Šestadevacet, were popular in the Czechoslovakia before World War II when the last Trappola cards were produced. Trappola {{is likely to be the}} first card game encountered by Greeks as the Greek word for playing card is [...] "Τράπουλα", is a transliteration of Trappola.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{examine the}} effects of acute insulin-induced {{hypoglycemia}} on spatial cognitive abilities in adult humans with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Sixteen adults with type 1 diabetes underwent two counterbalanced experimental sessions: euglycemia (blood glucose 4. 5 mmol/l [81 mg/dl]) and hypoglycemia (2. 5 mmol/l [45 mg/dl]). Arterialized blood glucose levels were maintained using a hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique. During each session, subjects underwent detailed assessment of spatial abilities from the Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests and two tests of general cognitive function. RESULTS — Spatial ability performance deteriorated significantly during hypoglycemia. Results for the Hidden <b>Patterns,</b> <b>Card</b> Rotations, Paper Folding, and Maze Tracing tests were all impaired significantly (P � 0. 001) during hypoglycemia, as were results for the Cube Comparisons Test (P � 0. 03). The Map Memory Test was not significantly affected by hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS — Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of insulin therapy in individuals with type 1 diabetes, and spatial abilities are of critical importance in day-to-day functioning. The deterioration in spatial abilities observed during modest experimental hypoglycemia provide...|$|R

30|$|Merchant-manufacturers in Norwich, a {{major centre}} for textile {{production}} in England, used pattern books and <b>pattern</b> <b>cards</b> containing swatches of worsted and worsted mixed with other yarns to facilitate sales and trade. Studying such well-preserved and dated materials provides valuable {{information that can}} translate into informed decisions {{for the care of}} Norwich textile collections. Using a Norwich pattern book from Winterthur Museum’s Special Collections dated c. 1790 – 1793, we report the first stage of a substantial study that combines spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques with archival research. A combination of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC–PDA) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) allowed for identification of characteristic mordants like iron and tin salts; and dyes, like quercitron, native to North America. In addition, a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) allowed for partial identification of the glazed finish in some textiles as a natural gum. Setting the foundations for future conservation and conservation science work, our research contributes to the care of these important and beautiful textiles, by providing scientific evidence for humidity and/or light sensitive constituent materials.|$|R

5000|$|In 1995, Wendy Keele {{published}} Poems of Color: Knitting in the Bohus Tradition and the Women Who Drove This Swedish Cottage Industry. Her book kindled {{a revival}} of interest in Bohus Stickning, particularly outside of Sweden, offering the first extended history of the cooperative in English, including color reproductions of original design cards, and republishing photographs of vintage Bohus Stickning garments. In 1999, working with the Bohusläns Museum, master dyer Solveig Gustafsson sourced and dyed yarns to recreate Bohus Stickning garments from original <b>pattern</b> <b>cards</b> and instructions. She later recreated 70 Bohus Stickning patterns and offered the patterns and dyed yarns for sale through her business, Solsilke, and via the Bohusläns Museum, before retiring in 2014. Angora rabbit farmer Pernille Silfverberg then took over the enterprise and expanded the pattern repertoire through her business, Angoragarnet. The story of their research and efforts is chronicled in the museum's book, authored by Viveka Overland, Bohus Stickning: På Nytt, The Revival (2015). Gustafsson and the Bohusläns Museum are joint owners of the Bohus Stickning trademark. Bohus Stickning recreations are popular among knitters interested in fine gauge, multi-color, stranded knitting. Notably, Stephanie Pearl McPhee has blogged about her knitting progress during work on two Bohus Stickning reproduction sweaters, and Kate Davies has analyzed the Bohus Stickning yoke style through knitting the Gotiska Fönstret, or Gothic Window sweater. In 2009, Susanna Hansson and Wendy J. Johnson curated the exhibition, [...] "Bohus Stickning. Radiant Knits: An Enchanting Obsession," [...] at the American Swedish Institute in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which highlighted both the history and legacy of the Bohus Stickning cooperative.|$|R

40|$|The {{author has}} long enjoyed using the CSP {{refinement}} checker FDR to solve puzzles, as witnessed by examples in tpc,ucs. Recent experiments {{have shown that}} a number of games of patience (card games for one) are now well within bounds. We discuss the modelling approaches used to tackle these and avoid symmetric states. For two such games we reveal much higher percentages of winnable games than was previously believed. The techniques developed for some of these card games -which employ various dynamic <b>patterns</b> of <b>cards</b> - suggest techniques for modelling pointer structures in CSP and FDR analogous to those used with the pi-calculus. Most of these use CSP's ability to express mobile systems. Comment: Example files available on author's websit...|$|R
