5|$|Hart's {{new role}} {{involved}} overseeing the upkeep of the cemeteries and memorials {{established by the}} Commission in the Middle East, Turkey and Greece. Ensuring the maintenance of these places required extensive travel, and his duties also became more difficult when Italy joined in the Second World War in June 1940 and conflict {{broke out in the}} Middle East. This required the creation of an organisation responsible for the graves of Allied personnel killed in the region. Consequently, Hart became Assistant Director, Graves Registration and Inquiry Section for the Middle East, in addition to his existing Commission duties. His new position entailed him becoming a serving officer in the British Army as a lieutenant, but with the acting rank of brigadier. He set up grave registration units, new cemeteries and organised the relocation of existing graves in remote areas to the new cemeteries. This work struck a <b>personal</b> <b>note</b> when his nephew was killed during the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942. Early the following year Hart visited the El Alamein battlefield and the nearby cemetery, the establishment of which was partly due to the infrastructure he helped put in place, to lay flowers at his nephew's grave.|$|E

Under the pen name Nely, he published the defiantly erotic novel Poet-Poetă (1898, with a preface by Galaction), {{that resulted in}} his near-definitive expulsion from public high school. Around the same time, Galaction married Cocea's cousin Zoe Marcou, a laicized Romanian Orthodox nun; she would inspire him to become an Orthodox priest.|$|E
25|$|Tehran's only Jewish hospital, run by Dr. Sapir, was {{instrumental}} in helping the wounded revolutionaries. At the time most of the public hospitals would report the wounded revolutionaries to SAVAK but Dr. Sapir's hospital was the only hospital that was treating them without informing the SAVAK agents. Dr. Sapir hospital's actions were so instrumental that Ayatollah Khomeini himself wrote a <b>personal</b> <b>note</b> thanking the hospital for its help after the revolution succeeded.|$|E
25|$|Following the Natwest Trophy, Sri Lanka {{travelled}} to the Netherlands for a two-match one-day series.

On a <b>personal</b> <b>note</b> the innings was his 4th score of over 150 in ODI cricket {{and he is}} currently the only player to do so other than Sachin Tendulkar who has achieved it five times. It was also his second successive score of 150 plus, another first in ODI cricket.|$|E

25|$|Gonzalez's critics {{considered}} him a stubborn and willful ideologue. When the Board {{put forth a}} resolution commending San Franciscan Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi for being elected House Minority Whip and being {{the first woman to}} hold that position, Gonzalez was the only board member who voted against it. Gonzalez said that supervisors should not issue commendations for winning partisan political positions and that he had written a <b>personal</b> <b>note</b> to Pelosi congratulating her, as she had done him for being elected board president. Gonzalez refused to meet with Brown during his first two years on the Board of Supervisors, saying he did so to avoid being subject to Brown's influence rather than as a matter of disrespect. Two sources reported that Gonzalez defied Brown by walking out of the mayor's State of the City address in 2002. However, Gonzalez later told SF Weekly that he was never in attendance.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 1942, Lombard was a {{passenger}} on Transcontinental and Western Air Flight 3 {{with her mother}} and press agent Otto Winkler. She had just finished her 57th movie, To Be or Not to Be, and was on her way home from a successful war bond selling tour when the flight's DC-3 airliner crashed into a mountain near Las Vegas, Nevada, killing all 22 passengers aboard, including 15 servicemen en route to training in California. Gable flew to the crash site to claim the bodies of his wife, mother-in-law, and Winkler, who had been the best man at Gable and Lombard's wedding. Lombard was declared to be the first war-related American female casualty of World War II, and Gable received a <b>personal</b> <b>note</b> of condolence from President Roosevelt. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation into the crash concluded that pilot error was its cause.|$|E

500|$|Puffy {{expressed}} his respect for Mariah and her craft, mentioning that she re-did her vocals many times until she {{felt they were}} perfect. After they had the vocals, Carey and Puffy began working on the song's hook and incorporating the music samples and blending them into the bridge and chorus. After the song was completed, Combs was very confident with the song, calling it [...] "slammin'," [...] but because of its heavy hip-hop influence, he felt only cautiously optimistic about the song's commercial success. On a more <b>personal</b> <b>note,</b> [...] "Honey" [...] served as Carey's first single after her separation from estranged husband, Tommy Mottola, who also lead her current record label, Columbia.|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be."

I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a <b>personal</b> <b>note.</b> I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Lewis was a {{prominent}} figure in the British Labour Party, which, in emphasizing parliamentary action and organizational prowess, took an approach similar to the Bund's. [...] Upon his 1935 graduation, the party offered him a candidacy in a safe seat in the British House of Commons. [...] This left Lewis with a difficult decision: whether to stay in England or go home to Canada. If he had stayed in England, he likely {{would have been a}} partner in {{a prominent}} London law firm associated with Stafford Cripps and become a cabinet minister the next time Labour formed a government. [...] Cripps, then a prominent barrister and Labour Party official, was grooming Lewis to be Prime Minister. Lewis' other choice was to return to Montreal and help build the fledgling Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), with no guarantee of success. A <b>personal</b> <b>note</b> from J. S. Woodsworth, dated June 19, 1935, asked Lewis to take this latter option; in the end, he did.|$|E

500|$|Philip Larkin {{wrote in}} The Spectator that [...] "I am not {{surprised}} that Fleming preferred to write novels. James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, does not fit snugly into the short story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception." [...] The critic for The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book was [...] "slight and predictable, and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology". Writing in The Listener, Anthony Burgess thought that [...] "in their fascinated poring on things...remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn't necessarily spring from a thought-out aesthetic", going on to note that [...] "it is the mastery {{of the world that}} gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche". On a <b>personal</b> <b>note,</b> Burgess added [...] "I admired all the Bond books and I'm sorry there'll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming".|$|E
500|$|Since Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, {{little is}} known of her {{personal}} feelings. As a constitutional monarch, she has not expressed her own political opinions in a public forum. She does have {{a deep sense of}} religious and civic duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously.Shawcross, pp. 194–195 Aside from her official religious role as Supreme Governor of the established Church of England, she is personally a member of that church and the national Church of Scotland. She has demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and has met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. A <b>personal</b> <b>note</b> about her faith often features in her annual Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she spoke about the theological significance of the millennium marking the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus:To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.Shawcross, pp. 236–237 ...|$|E
