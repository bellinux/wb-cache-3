5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent of the Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the <b>Proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E

The <b>Proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> (Amendment) Act 2016 is {{designed}} to facilitate the seizure of property which is suspected to be the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> by expanding {{the powers of the}} Criminal Assets Bureau to seize those proceeds. This act amends the <b>Proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> Act 1996 in two key respects. First, it allows the Criminal Assets Bureau to seize property which it suspects to be the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> for up to 21 days. Second, it reduces the threshold value of property which can be pursued by the Criminal Assets Bureau from €13,000 to €5,000.|$|E

25|$|Money {{laundering}} is {{broadly defined}} in the UK. In effect any handling or involvement with any proceeds of any crime (or monies or assets representing the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime)</b> can be a money laundering offence. An offender's possession of the proceeds of his own crime falls within the UK definition of money laundering. The definition also covers activities within the traditional definition of money laundering, as a process that conceals or disguises the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> to make them appear legitimate.|$|E

5000|$|Often {{a further}} {{distinction}} is drawn between rents obtained legally through {{political power and}} the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> private common-law <b>crimes</b> such as fraud, embezzlement and theft. This viewpoint sees [...] "profit" [...] as obtained consensually, through a mutually agreeable transaction between two entities (buyer and seller), and the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> common-law <b>crime</b> non-consensually, by force or fraud inflicted on one party by another. Rent, by contrast with these two, is obtained when a third party deprives one party of access to otherwise accessible transaction opportunities, making nominally [...] "consensual" [...] transactions a rent-collection opportunity for the third party. The high profits of the illegal drug trade are considered rents by this definition, as they are neither legal profits nor the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> common-law <b>crimes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Money {{laundering}} is {{the process}} in which the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> are transformed into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets. However, in a number of legal and regulatory systems the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial crime, and sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing, tax evasion and evading of international sanctions.|$|E
25|$|The {{elements}} <b>of</b> the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> {{money laundering}} are {{set forth in}} the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

However the variations between all the national laws were likely to damage the fight that was getting itself better organized and internationalized. A true international crusade took place.

25|$|Threat {{and risk}} {{assessments}} are {{widely recognized as}} valuable decision-making tools when setting examination priorities.
