5|$|The {{courts in}} Malaysia {{have taken a}} similar {{approach}} in defining the meaning of religious practice under Article 11 of the Malaysian Constitution. Furthermore, they have also consulted religious texts to determine what type of acts might constitute religious practices. In Halimatussaadiah v. Public Service Commission, Malaysia (1992), the appellant claimed she had been wrongfully dismissed from her employment due to her refusal to comply with employment conditions that prohibited any attire that covered a female public servant's face while on duty. According to the appellant, this contravened her right to religious practice on grounds that the wearing of the <b>purdah</b> was part of her religious practice as a Muslim. However, the court disagreed and held that the <b>purdah</b> was not considered a religious practice as {{it was not a}} requirement under Islam since there was no express mention of such a requirement in the Quran.|$|E

60|$|It was a strange--a {{stirring}} sight! The camp-fires were lighted; {{and round}} them--eating, reposing, talking, {{looking at the}} merry steps of the dancing-girls, or listening to the stories of some Dhol Baut (or Indian improvisatore) were thousands of dusky soldiery. The camels and horses were picketed under the banyan-trees, on which the ripe mango fruit was growing, and offered them an excellent food. Towards the spot which the golden fish and royal <b>purdahs,</b> floating in the wind, designated as the tent of Holkar, led an immense avenue--of elephants! the finest street, indeed, I ever saw. Each of the monstrous animals had a castle on its back, armed with Mauritanian archers and the celebrated Persian matchlock-men: it was the feeding time of these royal brutes, and the grooms were observed bringing immense toffungs, or baskets, filled with pine-apples, plantains, bandannas, Indian corn, and cocoa-nuts, which grow luxuriantly at all seasons of the year. We passed down this extraordinary avenue--no less than three hundred and eighty-eight tails did I count on each side--each tail appertaining to an elephant twenty-five feet high--each elephant having a two-storied castle on its back--each castle containing sleeping and eating rooms for the twelve men that formed its garrison, and were keeping watch on the roof--each roof bearing a flag-staff twenty feet long on its top, the crescent glittering with a thousand gems, and round it the imperial standard,--each standard of silk velvet and cloth-of-gold, bearing the well-known device of Holkar, argent an or gules, between a sinople of the first, a chevron, truncated, wavy. I took nine of these myself {{in the course of}} a very short time after, and shall be happy, when I come to England, to show them to any gentleman who has a curiosity that way. Through this gorgeous scene our little cavalcade passed, and at last we arrived at the quarters occupied by Holkar.|$|R

And though I like to walk, even in fancy, in an earl's house, splendid, well ordered, where there are feasts and fine pictures and fair ladies and endless books and good company; yet there are times when the visit is not pleasant; and when the parents in that fine house are getting ready their daughter for sale, and frightening away her tears with threats, and stupefying her grief with narcotics, praying her and imploring her, and dramming her and coaxing her, and blessing her, and cursing her perhaps, till they have brought her into such a state as shall fit the poor young thing for that deadly couch upon which they are about to thrust her. When my lord and lady are so engaged I prefer not to call at their mansion, Number 1000 in Grosvenor Square, but to partake of a dinner of herbs rather than of that stalled ox which their cook is roasting whole. There are some people who are not so squeamish. The family comes, of course; the Most Reverend the Lord Arch-Brahmin of Benares will attend the ceremony; there will be flowers and lights and white favours; and quite a string of carriages up to the pagoda; and such a breakfast afterwards; and music in the street and little parish boys hurrahing; and no end of speeches within and tears shed (no doubt), and His Grace the Arch-Brahmin will make a highly appropriate speech, just with a faint scent of incense about it as such a speech ought to have; and the young person will slip away unperceived, and take off her veils, wreaths, orange-flowers, bangles and finery, and will put on a plain dress more suited for the occasion, and the house-door will open--and there comes the SUTTEE in company of the body: yonder the pile is waiting on four wheels with four horses, the crowd hurrahs and the deed is done.|$|R

25|$|Bengal has a {{long history}} of feminist {{activism}} dating back to the 19th century. Begum Rokeya and Faizunnessa Chowdhurani played an important role in emancipating Bengali Muslim women from <b>purdah,</b> prior to the country's division, as well as promoting girls' education. Several women were elected to the Bengal Legislative Assembly in the British Raj. The first women's magazine, Begum, was published in 1948.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, feminist science fiction emerged as a subgenre of science fiction that deals with women's roles in society. Female writers of the utopian literature movement at the time of first-wave feminism often addressed sexism. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland (1915) did so. Sultana's Dream (1905) by Bengali Muslim feminist Roquia Sakhawat Hussain depicts a gender-reversed <b>purdah</b> in a futuristic world.|$|E
25|$|The Taliban {{disagreed}} with past Afghan statutes {{that allowed the}} employment of women in a mixed sex workplace. They claimed this was a breach of <b>purdah</b> and sharia law. On September 30, 1996, the Taliban decreed that all women should be banned from employment. It is estimated that 25 percent of government employees were female, and when compounded by losses in other sectors, many thousands of women were affected. This had a devastating impact on household incomes, especially on vulnerable or widow-headed households, which were common in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of Indian women in society further deteriorated during the medieval period, when child marriages and {{a ban on}} remarriage by widows became part of social life in some communities in India. The Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent brought <b>purdah</b> to Indian society. Among the Rajputs of Rajasthan, the Jauhar was practised. In some parts of India, some of Devadasis were sexually exploited. Polygamy was practised among Hindu Kshatriya rulers for some political reasons. In many Muslim families, women were restricted to Zenana areas of the house.|$|E

Her major works include Abarodhbasini, a spirited attack on the extreme forms of <b>purdah</b> that endangered women's lives and thoughts; Sultana's Dream, a science fiction novella set in a place called Ladyland in nisah, a world ruled by women; Padmarag ("Essence of the Lotus", 1924), another feminist utopian novel; Motichur, collection of essays in two volumes.|$|E
500|$|Gandhi {{strongly}} favoured {{the emancipation}} of women, and urged [...] "the women {{to fight for}} their own self-development." [...] He opposed <b>purdah,</b> child marriage, dowry and sati. A wife is not a slave of the husband, stated Gandhi, but his comrade, better half, colleague and friend, according to Lyn Norvell. In his own life however, according to Suruchi Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi's relationship with his wife were at odds with some of these values.|$|E
500|$|Women were {{expected}} to confine themselves to indoor activities {{and the maintenance of}} the household. Muslims and high-caste Hindu women observed <b>purdah.</b> The daughter in the family rarely received an education and usually helped her mother with household chores. [...] Upon marrying, she moved to the house of her in-laws where she was expected to serve her husband and the elder members of his family. There have been recorded instances of torture and ill treatment of daughters-in-law. A Brahmin widow was expected to shave her head and was subjected to numerous indignities.|$|E

[...] As a woman, Victoria saw them without veils. The Munshi and his family were housed in cottages at Windsor, Balmoral and Osborne, the Queen's retreat on the Isle of Wight. Victoria visited regularly, usually bringing her female guests, including the Empress of Russia and the Princess of Wales, to meet the Munshi's female relatives.

2500|$|The nivi is today's {{most popular}} sari style from Andhra Pradesh. The {{increased}} {{interaction with the}} British saw most women from royal families come out of <b>purdah</b> in the 1900s. This necessitated a change of dress. Maharani Indira Devi of Cooch Behar popularised the chiffon sari. She was widowed early in life and followed the convention of abandoning her richly woven Baroda shalus in favour of the unadorned mourning white as per tradition. Characteristically, she transformed her [...] "mourning" [...] clothes into high fashion. She had saris woven in France to her personal specifications, in white chiffon, and introduced the silk chiffon sari to the royal fashion repertoire.|$|E
2500|$|Freedom of {{movement}} {{is an essential}} right, recognized by international instruments, including [...] Article 15 (4) of CEDAW. Nevertheless, in many regions of the world, women have this right severely restricted, in law or in practice. For instance, in some countries women may not leave the home without a male guardian, or {{without the consent of}} the husband – for example the personal law of Yemen states that a wife must obey her husband and must not get out of the home without his consent. Even in countries which do not have legal restrictions, women's movement [...] may be prevented in practice by social and religious norms such as <b>purdah.</b> Laws restricting women from travelling existed until relatively recently in some Western countries: until 1983, in Australia the passport application of a married woman had to be authorized by her husband.|$|E
2500|$|Till then, {{women in}} the Brahmo Samaj used to sit in <b>purdah,</b> behind a screen. Some of the leading Brahmos such as Dwarkanath Ganguly, Durgamohan Das, Rajaninath Roy and Annadacharan Khastagir and their {{families}} desired that women should sit in the open and ultimately they prevailed in getting some of the screens removed. Disputes surfaced regarding education of women. There also were minor clashes within the Brahmo Samaj regarding some of the views and activities of Keshub Chunder Sen. Finally, when Keshub Chunder Sen’s daughter was married to the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, the Brahmo Samaj of India split into two. A bitter struggle followed in the Brahmo Samaj. Sivanath Sastri was not {{only one of the}} leaders but also the principal ideologue of the group opposing Keshub Chunder Sen. They were initially called the Samadarshi group and in 1878 formed the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj.

2500|$|Following the {{conventions}} of Afghan nobility, Babajan was reared under the strict <b>purdah</b> tradition, in which women were secluded from the outside world, and also subservient to a custom of arranged marriages. She opposed an unwelcome marriage planned for her, and {{ran away from home}} on her wedding day at the age of eighteen. Disguised in her burqa, she journeyed to Peshawar, the frontier city {{at the foot of the}} Khyber Pass. It was in or near Peshawar that she eventually came into contact with a Hindu sadguru. Following instruction from the guru, [...] "she went into seclusion in a nearby mountain outside Rawalpindi and underwent very severe [...] (spiritual austerities) for nearly seventeen months. Thereafter she came down to [...] Punjab and stayed a few months in Multan. It was in Multan, while [...] was 37 years of age, she contacted a Muslim saint … who put end to her spiritual struggle by giving her God-realisation." [...] After that experience she returned to Rawalpindi to reconnect with the Hindu guru who, after several years, helped her return to normal consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|Singha {{argues that}} after 1857 the colonial {{government}} strengthened and expanded its infrastructure via the court system, legal procedures, and statutes. New legislation merged the Crown {{and the old}} East India Company courts and introduced a new penal code {{as well as new}} codes of civil and criminal procedure, based largely on English law. In the 1860s–1880s the Raj set up compulsory registration of births, deaths, and marriages, as well as adoptions, property deeds, and wills. The goal was to create a stable, usable public record and verifiable identities. However, there was opposition from both Muslim and Hindu elements who complained that the new procedures for census-taking and registration threatened to uncover female privacy. [...] <b>Purdah</b> rules prohibited women from saying their husband's name or having their photograph taken. [...] An all-India census was conducted between 1868 and 1871, often using total numbers of females in a household rather than individual names. [...] Select groups which the Raj reformers wanted to monitor statistically included those reputed to practice female infanticide, prostitutes, lepers, and eunuchs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{degree to}} which women {{participate}} in public life, that is being outside the home, varies by region and background. For example, the Rajputs, a patrilineal clan inhabiting parts of India, especially the north-western area, have traditionally practised <b>purdah,</b> and many still do to this day. In recent years however, more women have started to challenge such social norms: for instance women in rural Haryana are increasingly rejecting the ghunghat. In India, most population (about two thirds) is rural, and, as such, lives in tight-knit communities where {{it is very easy}} for a woman to ruin her family's 'honor' through her behavior. The concept of family honor is especially prevalent in northern India. Izzat is a concept of honor prevalent in the culture of North India and Pakistan. Izzat applies to both sexes, but in different ways. Women must uphold the 'family honor' by being chaste, passive and submissive, while men must be strong, brave, and be willing and able to control the women of their families. The rural areas surrounding Delhi are among the most conservative in India: {{it has been estimated that}} 30% of all honor killings of India take place in Western Uttar Pradesh, while Haryana has been described as [...] "one of India's most conservative when it comes to caste, marriage and the role of women. Deeply patriarchal, caste purity is paramount and marriages are arranged to sustain the status quo." ...|$|E

6000|$|For a {{long time}} Sir Richmond had met no one so {{interesting}} and amusing as this frank-minded young woman from America. [...] "Young woman" [...] was how he thought of her; she didn't correspond to anything so prim and restrained and extensively reserved and withheld as a [...] "young lady [...] "; and though he judged her no older than five and twenty, the word [...] "girl" [...] with its associations of virginal ignorances, invisible <b>purdah,</b> and trite ideas newly discovered, seemed even less appropriate for her than the word [...] "boy." [...] She had an air of having in some obscure way graduated in life, as if so far she had lived each several year of her existence in a distinctive and conclusive manner with the utmost mental profit and no particular tarnish or injury.

60|$|But {{upon the}} {{question}} of labour Mr. Grammont was fierce, even for an American business man, and one night {{at a dinner party}} he discovered his daughter displaying what he considered an improper familiarity with socialist ideas. This had produced a violent revulsion towards the <b>purdah</b> system and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with Gunter Lake. Gunter Lake, Sir Richmond gathered, wasn't half a bad fellow. Generally it would seem Miss Grammont liked him, and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way Mr. Lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behaviour under bad treatment. There was some story, however, connected with her war services in Europe upon which Miss Grammont was evidently indisposed to dwell. About that story Sir Richmond was left {{at the end of his}} Avebury day and after his last talk with Dr. Martineau, still quite vaguely guessing.|$|E
60|$|There are no {{universal}} laws {{of affection}} and desire, {{but it is}} manifestly true {{that for the most}} of us free talk, intimate association, and any real fellowship between men and women turns with an extreme readiness to love. And that being so it follows that under existing conditions the unrestricted meeting and companionship {{of men and women in}} society is a monstrous sham, a merely dangerous pretence of encounters. The safe reality beneath those liberal appearances is that a woman must be content with the easy friendship of other women and of one man only, letting a superficial friendship towards all other men veil impassable abysses of separation, and a man must in the same way have one sole woman intimate. To all other women he must be a little blind, a little deaf, politely inattentive. He must respect the transparent, intangible, tacit <b>purdah</b> about them, respect it but never allude to it. To me that is an intolerable state of affairs, but it is reality. If you live in the spirit of any other understanding you will court social disaster. I suppose it is a particularly intolerable state of affairs to us Strattons because it is in our nature to want things to seem what they are. That translucent yet impassible <b>purdah</b> outrages our veracity. And it is plain to me that our social order cannot stand and is not standing the tensions it creates. The convention that passions and emotions are absent when they are palpably present broke down between Mary and myself, as it breaks down in a thousand other cases, as it breaks down everywhere. Our social life is honeycombed and rotten with secret hidden relationships. The rigid, the obtuse and the unscrupulously cunning escape; the honest passion sooner or later flares out and destroys.... Here is a difficulty that no bullying imposition of arbitrary rules on the one hand nor any reckless abandonment of law on the other, can solve. Humanity has yet to find its method in sexual things; it has to discover the use and the limitation of jealousy. And before it can even begin to attempt to find, it has to cease its present timid secret groping in shame and darkness and turn on the light of knowledge. None of us knows much and most of us do not even know what is known.|$|E
