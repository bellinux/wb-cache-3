Early <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> tools excavated in South China are discussed in this paper. The polishing technology developed from <b>stone</b> tools with <b>polished</b> blades to whole <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> tools. Different kinds of <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> tools appeared at different times. The earliest <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> tools are axes, adyes and cutters, with only the blades polished. They date to 21000 - 19000 cal BP. The whole <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> tools appeared thousands of years later.

50|$|Leaving Glencullen, the Way enters {{forestry}} at Ballyedmonduff, {{passing the}} site of Ballyedmonduff wedge tomb. This Bronze Age wedge-shaped gallery grave consists of three chambers surrounded by a horseshoe arrangement of stones. It was excavated in 1945 and sherds of Beaker pottery, a polished hammer, a possible <b>polishing</b> <b>stone</b> and a flint scraper were found. The trail ascends through the spruce, larch and pine woods of Ticknock forest to reach the summit of Three Rock (449 m). This area {{is dominated by the}} masts used by RTÉ and other broadcasters for the transmission of radio and television services. The mountain takes its name from the three groups of rocks visible from much of Dublin city and suburbs. It was once believed that these features were man made: for example, in 1780 Gabriel Beranger speculated that they were altars on which sacrifices were offered. In fact, the rocks are granite tors formed naturally over many years by the process of weathering. The middle tor contains a series of bowl-shaped depressions known as bullauns which were used for grinding in early Christian times.|$|E
50|$|A {{differentially}} hardened blade {{will usually}} be coated with an insulating layer, like clay, but leaving the edge exposed. When it is heated to red-hot and quenched, the edge cools quickly, becoming very hard, {{but the rest}} cools slowly, becoming much softer. The insulation layer is quite often a mixture of clays, ashes, <b>polishing</b> <b>stone</b> powder, and salts, which protects {{the back of the}} blade from cooling very quickly when quenched. The clay is often applied by painting it on, coating the blade very thickly around the center and spine, but leaving the edge exposed. This allows the edge to cool very quickly, turning it into a very hard microstructure called martensite, but causes the rest of the blade to cool slowly, turning it into a soft microstructure called pearlite. This produces an edge that is exceptionally hard and brittle, but is backed-up by softer, tougher metal. The edge, however, will usually be too hard, so after quenching the entire blade is usually tempered to around 400 F for a short time, to bring the hardness of the edge down to around HRc60 on the Rockwell hardness scale.|$|E
50|$|Mandalay's 100,000 strong Chinese {{population}} comprise {{ten percent}} of the city's entire population yet control all of Mandalay's retail gold shops, gemstone mining concessions, and timber trading companies surrounded by Chinese owned large Victorian villas scattered on the outskirts left behind by the British colonialists. Gemstones and gold bars are among many the goods sold on the Burmese commodities market and represent the trade of many Chinese expatriate entrepreneurs and investors. Mandalay's other major industries include sports where the nation's popularity of soccer has sprung across the city. The soccer team, Yadanabon FC represents the city in the newly formed Myanmar National League, making it the nation's first professional soccer league. Burmese Chinese entrepreneurs are also involved in silk weaving, tapestry, jade cutting and <b>polishing,</b> <b>stone</b> and wood carving, making marble and bronze Buddha images, food products, temple ornaments and paraphernalia, the working of gold leaves and of silver, garments, pharmaceuticals, match manufacturing, brewing, and distilling. Burmese Chinese entrepreneurs have also have established heavy industry joint ventures with many large Chinese conglomerates. These industries include shipbuilding, copper, nickel, oil and natural gas, cement, base metals, coal, fertilizers, jet fuel, industrial minerals, kerosene, steel, tin, tungsten, agricultural processing, wood and wood products, teak logging, timber, rice, and construction materials, machinery, transport equipment, and plastics. Sino-Burmese entrepreneurs have also established numerous joint ventures to have the construction of oil pipelines bring thousands of jobs into the country. Chinese consumer electronics and fashion are also large industries. In Yangon, the Hokkien operate small and medium-sized family businesses in teak logging, rice, bean and legume trading, and cooking oil production while the Cantonese focused on small-scale manufacturing of handicrafts and similar artisan retail products.|$|E

5000|$|In an area {{of forest}} to the {{southeast}} of the summit, near Ballyedmonduff, at grid reference O 185 213, there is a Bronze Age wedge tomb, known as the [...] "Giant's Grave". It {{is considered one of}} the finest examples of a wedge tomb in Ireland: the antiquarian John O'Donovan said of it, [...] "I doubt I have met so perfect a pagan grave in any other counties hitherto examined". Its appearance has changed since the time of its first discovery: sketches made in the 1830s by the Ordnance Survey show a grass-covered tumulus. A drawing by George Du Noyer indicates that the roof was partially intact at that time. In addition, the pine forest that now surrounds the site obscures the views of the Great Sugar Loaf mountain and the twin tors of Two Rock that would have been possible from this location in the past. The tomb was first opened in 1832 by Alderman Blacker of St Andrew Street, Dublin but no record of this excavation survives. However, when John O'Donovan visited on behalf of the Ordnance Survey, the locals told him that ashes had been found when the grave was opened. After the tomb was opened, many of the larger stones were removed by local stonecutters. The site was excavated again in 1945 by Seán P. Ó Riordáin and Rúaidhri de Valera who found sherds of decorated Beaker pottery, a polished hammer, a possible <b>polishing</b> <b>stone</b> and a flint scraper. A small amount of cremated human bone was also found. Following the excavation the monument was rebuilt in the form it appears in today. The tomb consists of a burial gallery over 6 m long divided into three chambers surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of stones with a straight façade at the western end. At the southern end is a long stone with seven cupmarks on one surface. This form of rock art is usually associated with earlier Neolithic culture and is generally found on natural rock outcrops. The stone may have come from a natural boulder brought to the site during construction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} the behaviour of stone waste aggregate (SWA) concrete slabs under impact loading. The stone waste was obtained during extraction of layered stone (at mines) and at <b>polishing</b> <b>stone</b> industries. This stone waste is converted in useful aggregate {{and used in}} the concrete as coarse aggregate {{in the place of}} natural aggregate with replacement levels of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %. For each replacement level, three slab specimens were cast and tested. 0 % replacement level consider as Natural Aggregate Concrete (NAC) slabs. The SWA slabs were compared with natural aggregate concrete (NAC) slabs. The results showed that the SWA slab performance is less than the natural aggregate concrete slabs. From experimental results, regression models were developed to estimate energy absorption at first and ultimate crack stages. In addition to the slab specimens cubes were cast and tested. The cube strength results were used during development of regression models. Keywords:- Impact, stone waste aggregate, natural aggregate, failure loads, damage analysis, regression model. I...|$|E
