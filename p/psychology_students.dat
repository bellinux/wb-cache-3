25|$|In their 2002 survey, the AAUW {{reported}} that, {{of students}} who had been harassed, 38% were harassed by teachers or other school employees. One survey that was conducted with <b>psychology</b> <b>students</b> reports that 10% had sexual interactions with their educators; in turn, 13% of educators reported sexual interaction with their students. In a national survey conducted for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 found that roughly 290,000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a public school employee between 1991 and 2000. And a major 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education found that nearly 10 percent of U.S. public school students reported having been targeted with sexual attention by school employees. Indeed, one critic has claimed that sexual harassment and abuse by teachers is 100 times more frequent than abuse by priests.|$|E

Stratton became a director of the newly established psychology lab, in the philosophy department, in 1899. By 1900 he was an associate professor in the philosophy department, then headed by Howison. He contributed a paper to the Festschrift honoring Wundt's seventieth birthday in 1902: [...] "Eye movements and the aesthetics of the visual form". He also taught a series of twenty lectures on philosophy and psychology at the Pacific Theological Seminary in Berkeley.

500|$|Cooney's {{proposal}} included using in-house formative {{research that}} would inform and improve production, and independent summative evaluations {{to test the}} show's effect on its young viewers' learning. During 1967, Morrisett recruited Harvard University professor Gerald S. Lesser, whom he had met while they were both <b>psychology</b> <b>students</b> at Yale, to help develop and lead the Workshop's research department. During 1972, the Markle Foundation donated $72,000 to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children's Television, which served as a research agency for the CTW. [...] Harvard produced about 20 major research studies about Sesame Street {{and its effect on}} young children. [...] Lesser also served as the first chairman of the Workshop's advisory board, a position he held until his retirement in 1997. According to Lesser, the CTW's advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber-stamping the Workshop's decisions like most boards for other children's television shows, it contributed significantly to the series' design and implementation. Lesser reported in , his 1974 book about the beginnings of Sesame Street and the Children's Television Workshop, that about 8—10% of the Workshop's initial budget was spent on research.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Lesser {{was asked}} to help develop and lead the {{research}} department of the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop), the organization responsible {{for the production of}} Sesame Street and other educational television programs. [...] He was invited by Carnegie Foundation vice-president and Sesame Street co-creator Lloyd Morrisett, whom he had met while they were both <b>psychology</b> <b>students</b> at Yale. [...] At first, Lesser was skeptical about the new show's potential and its ability to teach children; according to Morrisett, [...] "he took some convincing". [...] As Lesser later reported, he would be involved only if he was able to make a real contribution. [...] When he saw that Morrisett and his co-creator, Joan Ganz Cooney, were serious about developing goals and a curriculum for the new show, {{and that it would be}} an [...] "experimental venture in education by television", he became the first chairman of the CTW's advisory board, a position he held from 1967 to 1997. [...] Lesser was skeptical about Cooney's qualifications as CTW's first CEO, although by the time he wrote Children and Television in 1974, she stated in the book's foreword, [...] "...I couldn't begin to measure how proud I am to be Gerry Lesser's colleague and how happy I am to know the pleasure of his company".|$|E
