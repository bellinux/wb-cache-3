40|$|To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of the <b>PAPNET</b> <b>System</b> with conventional rescreening of negative cervical smears in a high-risk population. STUDY DESIGN: Three thousand ninety-seven negative cervical smears from women with past history of cervical abnormalities were rescreened manually and with the <b>PAPNET</b> <b>System.</b> There were two reviews of PAPNET images: the first by two cytotechnologists with limited exposure to the instrument, and the second, limited to smears with discrepant diagnoses, by an expert {{in the use of the}} system. The remaining discrepant smears were submitted to a blinded microscopic review by a third party. The a priori consensus diagnosis was arbitrarily established when the result of two of the three reviews#manual, PAPNET and the independent third review#were concordant. The results of rescreening were compared with available biopsies. RESULTS: On manual rescreening of the 3, 097 smears, 2, 901 (93. 66 %) were reported as negative and 170 (5. 49 %) as abnormal. On the first PAPNET review, 2, 938 (94. 87 %) were reported as negative and 150 (4. 84 %) as abnormal. There were 144 smears with discrepant diagnoses. After the second PAPNET review of these discrepant smears, the agreement between manual and PAPNET rescreening rose from 94. 27 % to 95. 58 %. A final, blinded review of 89 residual discrepant smears was used to establish consensus diagnoses. The diagnoses made by PAPNET-assisted rescreening agreed much better with the consensus diagnoses than did manual rescreening (Kappa= 3 D. 61 vs. Kappa= 3 D-. 32, P<. 001). When compared with the results of 50 available biopsies, PAPNET-assisted rescreening also had a somewhat lower false negative rate (sensitivity 58. 82 % vs. 41. 18 %, P= 3 D. 17) and a statistically significant lower false positive rate (specificity 63. 64 % vs. 36. 36 %, P= 3 D. 01). CONCLUSION: PAPNET-assisted rescreening, when carried out by an experienced person, is more efficient than manual rescreening...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} sensitivity, specificity and reliability of PAPNET-assisted diagnosis in comparison with conventional screening. Seven Italian and one English University or Research Institutes, and a random sample of an other 20 Italian Laboratories of the Italian National Health Service (INHS) provided the cervical smears. During the training phase every center examined in rotation four sets of slides for a total of 300 representative slides. Afterwards, 900 "positive" slides were added to the 3, 100 slides which were collected consecutively without any selection or exclusion. The eight main centers were divided into four couples and each couple of centers examined 775 slides with the <b>PAPNET</b> <b>system,</b> "blindly" to the original diagnosis. An expert cytopathologist (M. A.) of the National Institute of Health (NIH) reassessed 40 % of the slides with an original negative diagnosis to evaluate the false negative rate. Two expert NIH cytopathologists (M. A., G. M.) re-examined all slides where a disagreement had been observed between the original and {{one or both of the}} study diagnoses. The main analyses concerned the following three main categories: WNL and unsatisfactory for evaluation; ASCUS, AGUS and LSIL; HSIL and carcinoma. A special algorithm was devised to define the reference diagnosis for sensitivity and specificity assessment. Laboratories, even belonging to the same couple, classified as "no review" a very different proportion of slides ranging from 35 % to 74 %. The index of kappa agreement between the members of couples examining the same sets of slides was low or very low, ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 03. The sensitivity of the review classification was particularly low in some laboratories. Surprisingly, only a small correlation was observed between the sensitivity of the review classification and the proportion of slides classified as "review". The "tentative" diagnosis on PAPNET tiles of the "review" slides was almost as reliable as the microscopic diagnosis. In the overall performance, there were many significant differences among the eight laboratories. The best laboratory had a sensitivity of 95 % and a specificity of 96 %. At least three laboratories displayed unacceptably low sensitivity and one a very low specificity. Altogether these results seem to confirm that there are wide differences among cytological laboratories per se, and that these differences are intensified by the use of an instrument like PAPNET. The huge variation in performance may be explained by differences in basic skills and by different training, but it is difficult to understand exactly what could have been done to reduce it...|$|E
40|$|In Taiwan, the {{mortality}} of uterine cervical carcinoma, {{the most common}} female cancer, has effectively been reduced by the cervical smear screening programs. To develop more effective and scientific methods or instruments for {{improving the quality of}} screening is an important issue in the world. Techniques of digital image processing and computer-aided analysis system are introduced in this field. <b>PAPNET</b> <b>system</b> (Neuromedical Systems, Inc., NY, USA) and AutoPap (NeoPath, Inc., USA) are representatives in the market. However, the high cost and inconvenience may limit the use of these commercial instruments in Taiwan. The fast changing and improvement of the synthetic industry of Taiwan is famous in these decades. However, very few studies focusing on the cytologic image medical engineering are done in Taiwan. This project aims at developing a low-cost automated analysis system using low-cost, easily available instruments in the usual laboratories, and a cellular image analytic program accomplished by the cooperation of local cytopathologists, medical image-processing scientists. In our study, the morphological features of uterine cervical cells were initially recorded through high-resolution microscopy, digital camera and computer-aided cellular image analysis system to construct a reasonable-sized database. The automated cellular analytic technologies for inspecting and identifying abnormal smears are developed based on the image processing and fuzzy artificial intelligence. The accuracy of the developed system is quite excellent (sensitivity 92 %, specificity 90 %, and accurate rate 91 %). The proposed system is expected to set up an image data base for further development of an automated screening system to share the exhausted duty and reduce the misdiagnosis of manual screening. In addition it may also be applied for other functions, including teaching, training, diagnostic consultation and proficiency test for cervical smears and other cellular investigation. It is a new powerful cellular analytic tool for Taiwanese medical and biological engineering investigation. 子宮頸癌是臺灣婦女之首要好發癌症，而子宮頸抹片是一項簡單、便宜又極方便的篩檢方法，它已公認可有效的檢驗初癌前病變、細胞異生及各種癌症。近年來由於衛生署大力推廣子宮頸癌之細胞抹片篩檢，使得此癌症之死亡率下降。在台灣，目前的抹片篩檢率為 20 - 30 %，提昇篩檢率將增加篩檢量與負擔，但人為的篩檢與評估，終究有一些限制，例如主觀意識、疲勞、時效性等等，難以完全克服，所以設計出更快、更好、更有效的科學方法來改善細胞篩檢品質，已成為近年來國際間爭相研究的主題之一，目前臨床上已通過運用一些電腦輔助的自動化子宮頸癌細胞篩檢系統，例如PAPNET system (Neuromedical Systems, Inc., NY, USA) 以及AutoPap (NeoPath, Inc., USA) 來作篩檢及評估的工作，顯示此項研究的可行性及應用價值極高。然而由於它們的價格昂貴、或判讀與操作過程複雜，使得其在國內之使用率其普遍性極低，幾乎沒有實驗室負擔得起其費用以及所耗之工時。我們的研究是借由通過衛生署審查合格的實驗室，收集經傳統固定及染色處理之後的抹片，透過數位相機及高解析度之顯微鏡， 取得國人的子宮頸抹片細胞之數位化記錄，再將各類細胞之數位化記錄並自行研發出判讀軟體系統。經過測試此系統的細胞辨識能力極佳，檢測異常細胞檢測的敏感度(sensitivity) 為 92 %，精確度(specificity) 為 90 %，正確率(accuracy) 為 91 %。此研究不但證實國人在醫學工程上的實力，已可自製研發出價廉物美、多功能且操作容易的細胞分析軟體系統。產生的子宮頸細胞數位化資料庫，可供建立國人子宮頸正常及不正常細胞的基本數值，以便進一步發展全自動的子宮頸抹片細胞篩檢儀器，以減低人工篩檢的負擔與診斷的錯誤率，並作為癌症細胞教學研究、診斷與照會等多項功能使用。除外，此細胞分析軟體也可作為人體其他細胞或其他生物細胞型態分析研究等等功能，對我國生物醫學科技的研究發展，提供一項強而有力的資訊化影像檔案分析工具。壹、摘要 頁數 一、中文摘要………………………………………………………… 5 - 6 二、英文摘要………………………………………………………… 7 - 8 貳、前言……………………………………………………………… 9 - 13 參、材料與方法 一、抹片的收集與製作……………………………………………… 14 - 17 二、子宮頸抹片的篩選與診斷……………………………………… 18 - 25 三、子宮頸抹片細胞影像的擷取與處理…………………………… 26 四、子宮頸抹片細胞影像的分析…………………………………… 27 五、子宮頸抹片細胞影像的判讀與辨識軟體的能力測試………… 28 - 29 六、實驗設計之整體流程簡圖與簡寫符號一覽表………………… 30 - 31 肆、結果與討論 一、研究的重要性與意義…………………………………………… 32 - 33 二、子宮頸抹片的製作與細胞的選擇……………………………… 34 三、系統設備之組裝與特色………………………………………… 35 - 37 四、電腦細胞分析系統之設計理論………………………………… 38 - 40 五、子宮頸細胞影像資料庫的建立、分析與執行困難…………… 41 - 49 六、電腦分析及辨識子宮頸細胞影像之能力……………………… 50 - 57 伍、結論與建議……………………………………………………… 58 - 59 陸、參考文獻………………………………………………………… 60 - 64 柒、論文發表………………………………………………………… 65 捌、附錄 一、各類正常與不正常子宮頸細胞數位化量測的原始數值……… 66 - 68 二、CIAS基礎細胞影像分析系統介紹……………………………… 69 - 80 玖、表目錄 表一：文獻中子宮頸抹片正常與不正常細胞之型態與測量…………… 42 表二：總擷取影像檔案、所佔記憶體大小以及可分析的細胞數…目… 44 表三：數位影像分析出的子宮頸抹片細胞之各項測量值……………… 45 表四：子宮頸抹片細胞的文獻紀錄與數位影像分析測量值之比對 表四(1) ：細胞之形狀、細胞大小、細胞面積、核面積之比對……… 46 表四(2) ：核直徑、核質比之比對……………………………………… 47 表四(3) ：染色質分佈(細胞核顆粒粗糙度) 、染色質強度之比對…… 48 表五：數位影像分析出的子宮頸抹片正常細胞之各項辨識結果…… 57 壹拾、圖目錄 圖一、用採檢器在婦女子宮頸括取剝落細胞………………………… 15 圖二、以線型自動染色機進行柏式染色法染色……………………… 16 圖三(1) 、顯微高解析數位相機擷取影像模組之顯微鏡與數位相機… 18 圖三(2) ：顯微高解析數位相機擷取影像模組之電腦規格…………… 19 圖四、淺層鱗狀上皮細胞……………………………………………… 19 圖五、中層鱗狀上皮細胞……………………………………………… 20 圖六、側基底鱗狀上皮細胞…………………………………………… 20 圖七、成熟鱗狀上皮化生細胞………………………………………… 21 圖八、內頸腺體細胞…………………………………………………… 21 圖九、子宮內膜腺體細胞……………………………………………… 22 圖十、子宮內膜間質細胞……………………………………………… 22 圖十一、低危險度鱗狀表皮內病灶…………………………………… 23 圖十二(1) 、高危險度鱗狀表皮內病灶，中度異生………………… 24 圖十二(2) 、高危險度鱗狀表皮內病灶，重度異生………………… 25 圖十三(1) 、細胞核面積大小之數位影像常態分布圖……………… 51 圖十三(2) 、細胞核濃度之數位影像常態分布圖…………………… 52 圖十三(3) 、細胞核粗糙度之數位影像常態分布圖………………… 53 圖十三(4) 、細胞核直徑之數位影像常態分布圖…………………… 54 圖十三(5) 、細胞面積之數位影像常態分布圖……………………… 55 圖十三(6) 、核質比之數位影像常態分布圖………………………… 5...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the reproducibility of the PAPNET scanning station (Neuromedical Systems, Inc., Suffern, New York, U. S. A.) in selecting cells from a cervical smear. STUDY DESIGN: We compared {{the images of}} 196 smears that were scanned on two occasions by the PAPNET scanning station on two monitors simultaneously and compared the cellular contents and technical records provided by the scanning station. The sample consisted of 62 positive smears (mild dysplasia and more) and 134 negative smears. RESULTS: Although {{differences were found in}} the technical information provided by the scanning station (k= 3 D. 65, 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 3 D. 51 - 0. 79) and in the reported percentages of air bubbles (k= 3 D. 60, 95 % CI= 3 D. 51 -. 68), the detection of abnormal cases was not affected. Furthermore, the agreement on microscopic review was excellent (k= 3 D. 92, 95 % CI= 3 D. 88 -. 96). In nine cases that did not differ in tech code or percentage of air bubbles, however, differences were found in the cellular content of the tiles that would have led to different advice for additional microscopic review. This would have had important clinical consequences in two cases because a serious abnormality would have been missed. CONCLUSION: The consistency of the <b>PAPNET</b> scanning <b>system</b> is somewhat on the low side in providing technical information, although this did not affect the clinical outcome. In nine cases, for example, we found differences in the demonstration of cells in the tiles on the screen; two would have had clinical consequences. It is important to set goals for the performance of the machine and to incorporate them in the procedures to be used as standard practice. This is especially true when the scanning stations are going to be operated on site in the cytology laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Objective This study aims {{to analyze}} the role of {{artificial}} neural networks (ANNs) in cytopathology. More specifically, it aims to highlight the importance of employing ANNs in existing and future applications and in identifying unexplored or poorly explored research topics. Study Design A systematic search was conducted in scientific databases for articles related to cytopathology and ANNs with respect to anatomical places {{of the human body}} where cytopathology is performed. For each anatomic system/organ, the major outcomes described in the scientific literature are presented and the most important aspects are highlighted. Results The vast majority of ANN applications are related to cervical cytopathology, specifically for the ANN-based, semiautomated commercial diagnostic <b>system</b> <b>PAPNET.</b> For cervical cytopathology, there is a plethora of studies relevant to the diagnostic accuracy; in addition, there are also efforts evaluating cost-effectiveness and applications on primary, secondary, or hybrid screening. For the rest of the anatomical sites, such as the gastrointestinal system, thyroid gland, urinary tract, and breast, there are significantly less efforts relevant to the application of ANNs. Additionally, there are still anatomical systems for which ANNs have never been applied on their cytological material. Conclusions Cytopathology is an ideal discipline to apply ANNs. In general, diagnosis is performed by experts via the light microscope. However, this approach introduces subjectivity, because this is not a universal and objective measurement process. This has resulted in the existence of a gray zone between normal and pathological cases. From the analysis of related articles, it is obvious {{that there is a need}} to perform more thorough analyses, using extensive number of cases and particularly for the nonexplored organs. Efforts to apply such systems within the laboratory test environment are required for their future uptake...|$|R
