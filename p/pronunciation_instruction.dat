40|$|Learners {{with good}} English {{pronunciation}} {{are likely to}} be understood even if they make errors in other areas, whereas learners with bad pronunciation will not be understood, even if their grammar is perfect. Such learners may avoid speaking in English, and experience social isolation, employment difficulties and limited opportunities for further study. We judge people by the way they speak, and so learners with poor pronunciation may be judged as incompetent, uneducated or lacking in knowledge. Yet many learners find pronunciation {{one of the most difficult}} aspects of English to acquire, and need explicit help from the teacher. Therefore, some sort of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> in class is necessary. The goals of this paper are to define English pronunciation, review the history of English <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction,</b> explain the aim of English <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction,</b> elaborate pronunciation and communication, review the previous research about the effectiveness of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> on learners’ achievement, and discuss the English pronunciation and the target of comfortable intelligibility. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{study was}} an attempt to examine the effect of two methods of instructing English words' pronunciations on Iranian EFL {{learners}} ’ listening comprehension. Pretest-posttest design was employed to scrutinize the possible improvements of three classes of intermediate English learners (two experimental and one control group) as listening comprehension was concerned. A 25 -item listening test was constructed inspired by the Cambridge Key English Test listening materials to measure students ’ listening ability. All groups were exposed to the same listening test as the pre and the post-test, however, only the experimental groups received the special treatment regarding the phonetic symbols and phonemic transcription, segmental features (group A) and supra-segmental features (group B). After the application of the study’s treatment, data analysis process initiated which indicated that experimental groups who received explicit <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> had a better performance than the control group on the final listening test. In addition, the findings suggested that the experimental group which received segmental <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> had a better performance than the experimental group which received supra-segmental <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction.</b> Generally, the findings imply that <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> can positively affect the listening comprehension ability of intermediate EFL learners.

40|$|It {{has often}} been {{pointed out that the}} English {{instructions}} in elementary schools are not connected smoothly to those in junior high-schools, where emphasis is put on literacy instructions. Previous researches showed developing phonological awareness and phonemic awareness is necessary for early literacy instructions.

Therefore, this study hypothesized that explicit <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instructions</b> are effective in developing pupils’ phonemic awareness.

40|$|Pronunciation {{is one of}} the {{important}} skills that should be mastered by English foreign learners like Indonesian. If the learners have poor pronunciation, their speaking will not be understood by the listeners. Moreover, they will fail in English communication. To get successful communication, learners should have accurate and intelligible English pronunciation in order that the speakers and listeners can understand each other. This study was conducted to analyze the errors of English pronunciation in learning English produced by the students of Al-Izzah International Islamic Boarding School and to know the possible causes of pronunciation errors. The design used by the researcher was descriptive qualitative research. The subjects of this study were 30 second grade students of International class in SMP al-Izzah Islamic Boarding School, Batu-Malang. The instruments used to collect the data were pronunciation test, questionnaire and interview. The data were analyzed by finding the pronunciation errors of the students. The data showed that there were three errors produced by the subjects of the study. Those errors were classified as the errors of vowel, diphthong, and consonant. The second result of the study showed the possible causes of pronunciaion errors: that the difference between mother tongue and the target language, mother tongue interference, a lack of cognitive skill, a lack of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instructions,</b> the students feel psychological barriers, the students have never been tought the phonological system of English. In addition, some factors also became the causes of studentsÂ’ pronunciation errors, such as; the students are not used to listening the English words, the students have no good environment to practice their English and they had less media to practice their pronunciation, the students are not interested in English...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{emphasis}} on the role of pronunciation in obtaining proficiency in the English Language and the rightful place it has been given in the Malaysian Secondary School English Language syllabus, pronunciation still struggles to gain the attention it deserves in the ESL classrooms. Thus, it is {{the purpose of this study}} to investigate the beliefs of selected ESL teachers that have led to their decisions on their classroom practices in <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction.</b> This study focuses on three aspects of the teachers’ beliefs; firstly, the beliefs of their roles in learning and teaching pronunciation. Secondly, the beliefs they hold about the focus areas in <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> and finally, their beliefs of approaches in the teaching of pronunciation. This study also investigates the ESL teachers’ strategies in incorporating the instruction of pronunciation features in their teaching of other language skills and contents. Then, the congruence of the teachers’ beliefs about <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> and their classroom instructional practices are looked at to understand the process that happens between them. The study utilizes a multiple case study approach which allows an in-depth investigation that captures the actual beliefs and practices of five selected secondary school ESL teachers in <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction.</b> A multiple case study was employed as it could help to unravel the complexity of beliefs in a curricular area which is often left out from the ESL lessons. The teachers were purposively selected to have an array of different educational background as well as professional experience. The data was collected from in-depth interviews with the participants and selected students taught by these participants. Besides interviews, data was also collected from observations of their selected ESL lessons to observe the practices of the integration of pronunciation into the ESL lessons. The data was then analysed manually to get the feel of the data. The triangulation of this study is enhanced through the cross case analysis of the data and the various methods of data collection. The study has found that the five teachers had vague and negative beliefs about <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction.</b> Most of the beliefs on <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> they had were the reflections of their unsupportive experience during their schooling and professional experience. The ESL teachers’ current teaching situations with the examination requirements and packed schools’ agendas that limited their time to include the teaching of pronunciation contributed to their negative beliefs about <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction.</b> This is evident in their practices of pronunciation in the ESL classrooms observed. The contextual factors that bound the teachers and their teaching practices have a large impact on their decisions of whether to regard or disregard pronunciation in their ESL lessons. This study has concluded that conflicts occur between the English Language curriculum and the implementation of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction.</b> As a result, teaching pronunciation appears to be challenging to the ESL teachers. This is supported by the trivialization of the pronunciation component by many parties including the participants themselves. The negative congruence between the teachers’ beliefs about <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> and their practices would indicate serious implications in the future of ESL instructions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPronunciation {{was defined}} as “the act or result of {{producing}} the sounds of speech, including articulation, intonation, and rhythm” by McArthur (1992, p. 810). However, different approaches and methods have held different and sometimes controversial views concerning <b>pronunciation</b> and its <b>instruction</b> throughout the language education history {{since the beginning of}} the grammar-translation method. One viewed pronunciation as irrelevant to teaching, the other regarded it as “meaningless non-communicative drill-and-exercise gambits” (Morley, 1991, pp. 485 - 486). Yet, the other saw little connection between teaching and learning of pronunciation and acquiring sufficient level of pronunciation competency. It can be also stated that the scope of teaching pronunciation has been significantly affected by different school of thoughts of that particular time. Current pronunciation teaching trends have been affected by varying disciplines such as psychology, sociology, computer technology and semiotics to a great extent. This paper aims at emphasizing the importance of semiotic elements in pronunciation teaching and suggests ways to implement it appropriately in language classrooms. Then, it describes a lesson plan of a pronunciation class for pre-intermediate level preparation class in detail...|$|R

These were Task Knowledge of Pronunciation Learning; Person Knowledge of Pronunciation Learning; Positive Experiences in Pronunciation Learning; Motivating Experiences in Pronunciation Learning; Learning Pronunciation by External Assistance; and Learning Pronunciation by Self-Effort. Based on Flavell’s model of metacognition, the metacognitive model of pronunciation learning was constructed. In addition, following an eight-week metacognitive instruction with weekly journals kept by the participants, dynamic changes in metacognition were discovered. Moreover, as the results of pronunciation tests before and after the instruction showed, the participants manifested increased pronunciation proficiency after the instruction, suggesting that metacognitive instructions may be effective in improving learners’ pronunciation in a foreign language.

40|$|The {{communicative}} language approach (CLA) dominates pedagogical {{practice in}} second language acquisition classrooms in the US. However, this approach does not emphasize independent <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction,</b> leaving learners to improve pronunciation on their own.

The intelligibility principle of language served as the theoretical foundation underlying this study guided by research questions addressing how well the CLA met ELLs 2 ̆ 7 pronunciation intelligibility needs and their perspectives on receiving independent <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> to meet these needs. Using qualitative case study methods, the research questions were addressed through an analysis of interviews of 10 community college ELL adult volunteers who received instruction using the CLA as current or former students in the intensive English program, had linguistic skill levels ranging from beginner to advanced, and were graduates of U.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} changes in the pronunciation and intelligibility of instructed and uninstructed second language (L 2) learners over time, and to identify instructional, environmental, and methodological factors playing a role in pronunciation and intelligibility. Seventeen L 2 graduate students at an English-medium university recorded three personal anecdotes over five months. The students also regularly logged their exposure to and use of English. Nine of the students (instructed group) were concurrently taking an oral communication course focussing on suprasegmental <b>pronunciation.</b> Classroom <b>instruction</b> was regularly observed and recorded. All 17 students were interviewed at the end of the study. L 1 listeners heard anecdotes from three instructed and three uninstructed students, matched for length of residence and first language (L 1). Listeners also heard anecdotes from four L 1 English speakers. One group of listeners retold each anecdote after hearing it (discourse-level task). The other group paused the recording of each anecdote whenever a word was unclear (word-level task). Each group of listeners also rated excerpts for accentedness, comprehensibility, and fluency. Results of quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that: (a) no unambiguous changes in the pronunciation or intelligibility of either L 2 learner group occurred over time; (b) word-level intelligibility measures more consistently differentiated L 1 and L 2 groups, and the instructed and uninstructed L 2 groups; (c) compared to the instructed group, the uninstructed group logged relatively more English exposure/use for academic activities and relatively less for interactive social activities; (d) many instructed L 2 learners did not believe that their pronunciation had noticeably improved, but almost all expressed satisfaction with their ability to communicate in English; (e) at the end of the study, many uninstructed learners reported persistent difficulties in communicating in English. The results suggest that instruction in suprasegmental aspects of pronunciation sometimes may not lead to improved intelligibility or pronunciation. In addition, some L 2 learners can be as intelligible as L 1 speakers, depending on the listening task. Finally, results suggest that L 2 learners' perceptions of their communicative ability and their patterns of L 2 exposure/use are related.

40|$|In {{this study}} I examine twenty-five reading {{textbooks}} published in America between 1785 and 1819 for their rhetorical theory, pedagogy, and approach to language {{in order to}} discover more {{about the origins of}} modern writing instruction. The reading textbooks were selected for popularity, needing to go through at least three editions. I also examine four early writing textbooks, all published 1816 and earlier, and compare them to the reading textbooks on the same points. My results show that the dominant rhetorical theorist before 1800 is James Burgh, and not Hugh Blair. After 1800, rhetorical theory in these textbooks is dominated by Blair and John Walker. An emphasis on grammatical correctness is inherent in both writing and speech instruction, meaning the public associated grammatical correctness with writing instruction even in the eighteenth century. Correctness went beyond grammar into vocabulary and <b>pronunciation</b> because language <b>instruction</b> was primarily a matter of imitating the upper class. The reading textbooks, designed for teaching speech, show no evidence of the transition to writing instruction that occurred in the nineteenth century. My examination of the writing textbooks shows that writing instruction developed separately from speech instruction because the elocutionary pedagogy dominant in these years could not be applied to writing instruction. The early writing textbooks have the same emphasis on grammatical correctness, and add inventional schemata that are wholly absent from the reading textbooks. Department of EnglishThesis (D.

40|$|Language {{learning}} strategy (LLS) research {{has provided a}} large body of evidence for the effectiveness of strategy-based instruction (SBI), though the evidence is very limited for <b>pronunciation</b> strategy <b>instruction.</b> For both general and pronunciation LLSs, most research has focused on identifying the strategies used by successful learners. When strategy instruction has been investigated, in most cases the strategies that were taught were not directly linked to specific tasks, learners were not observed using the strategies, and measures of strategy effectiveness often were holistic and did not reveal improvements in specific pronunciation features. The goal {{of this study was to}} extend our understanding of the role of strategy use in L 2 (second language) pronunciation learning by investigating the effectiveness of training future international teaching assistants (ITAs) to critically listen to, transcribe, mark corrections (annotate), and orally rehearse English suprasegmental features in their own speech. The suprasegmental features investigated were message unit boundaries, primary phrase stress, intonation, vowel reduction in content and function words, linking, word stress, and multiword construction stress. Fifteen graduate-level learners of English (14 Mandarin speakers, 1 Korean speaker) from an intact English as a Second Language (ESL) pronunciation class at a Midwestern university were solicited to participate in a repeated-measures design, in which the independent variables were 3 levels of self-monitoring (listening only [L], listening + transcription [LT], and listening + transcription + annotation [LTA]) and rehearsal (R). The strategies were examined in the following combinations: LR-LR-LR, LT-RRR, and LTA-RRR. The dependent variable was the change in suprasegmental accuracy following self-monitoring and rehearsal. Speech data resulting from strategy use were gathered at the beginning and end of a 16 -week semester in order to determine the extent to which strategy use corresponded to improved suprasegmental accuracy. Key findings include the following: (a) All participants made meaningful improvements in suprasegmental accuracy for at least some of the targets following self-monitoring; (b) the LT-RRR combination was most effective for lower proficiency learners and LTA-RRR was most effective for higher proficiency learners; (c) starting proficiency and size of accuracy gains following self-monitoring were negatively correlated; (d) self-monitoring had differential effects on accuracy for the suprasegmental features, with message units, linking, and function words showing the greatest improvement;(e) and observation of individual task performance provided useful insights into how effectively adult L 2 learners utilize self-monitoring strategies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{current research}} on the second language acquisition of English phonology and its implication for (and applications to) <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> in the language classroom. More specifically, the paper follows the development of English word-final consonants by Brazilian Portuguese speakers learning English as a foreign language. The findings of two parallel studies reveal that the acquisition of these constituents is motivated by both extralinguistic (proficiency, style) and linguistic (word size, place of articulation) factors, and that the process is mediated by an intermediate stage characterized by consonant lengthening or aspiration (Onset-Nucleus sharing). Based on these results, I propose that the segments and environments that seem to delay coda production (i. e., monosyllabic words, labial and dorsal consonants) should be given priority in <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction.</b> Along the lines of Dickerson (1975), this paper proposes (what we believe is) a more effective and socially realistic pedagogy for the teaching of English pronunciation within an approach that recognizes that "variability is the norm rather than the exception" in second language acquisition...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that native {{speakers}} of English (or other advanced speakers of English) can easily forgive foreigners their accents in sounds but take their intonation at face value. Therefore, the methodology of the teaching of English pronunciation should suggest more effective materials to help students learn necessary supra-segmental skills consisting of stress patterns, rhythm, intonation and phrasing. This thesis will explore how master’s students studying English and EFL master’s students assess and use their pronunciation of English when delivering presentations, reading papers and discussing their field of study with fellow master's students and which variety of English they suppose they use. In addition, {{the aim of this}} thesis is to find out how familiar the master’s students of the University of Tartu (UT) are with the use of prosodic features in spoken English and how much attention they pay to their pronunciation of English. In order to get the results, an interview consisting of a spontaneous informative conversation together with two reading passages is undertaken with 36 Master’s students of UT. As a result, this thesis comes to the conclusion that that the Master’s students of UT are not familiar {{with the use of the}} prosodic features of English and are not consistent in using English varieties (General American or Received Pronunciation). The results lead to the necessity of amplified emphasis on <b>pronunciation</b> in English-language <b>instruction</b> in Estonian schools. The thesis consists of an introduction, theoretical background in two chapters, empirical data analysis with discussion and conclusions that can be drawn from the research. The introductory part introduces prior researches on similar topics of English pronunciation in Estonia and background information on the importance of awareness of the varieties of English. Chapter 1 includes the theoretical aspects and functions of supra-segmentals in pronunciation.

Taking into consideration the importance of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> and the central impact of suprasegmentals on comprehensibility (Celce-Murcia, Brinton, Goodwin, 2 ̆ 6 Griner, 2010; Isaacs, 2008), a four-week fully online pronunciation tutor (the Supra Tutor) was developed as an attempt to address gaps in <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> identified by previous research (e. g., marginalization of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction,</b> lack of trained instructors, and lack of connection between theory and practice) (Derwing 2 ̆ 6 Munro, 2005). The primary purpose of this mixed methods study, an adapted version of the embedded experimental model, was to assess whether a fully online pronunciation course can help international teaching assistants (ITAs) improve their comprehensibility. The study also analyzed ITAs’ evaluation of the Supra Tutor in regards to usefulness, level of interest, and quality of the materials. Finally, the study examined the contributions of suprasegmentals (word stress, rhythm, and intonation) to comprehensibility ratings and the language features that trained raters attended to when judging the comprehensibility of L 2 speakers. Twelve ITAs from several L 1 backgrounds delivered a 7 -minute field-specific lecture, which was videotaped for later analysis. Then, the ITAs completed the four-week online training. After the training, the ITAs delivered another 7 -minute lecture on a related topic and were once again videotaped. Finally, the ITAs were rated for comprehensibility by different groups of naïve and trained native listeners. The rating instruments were a holistic comprehensibility scale used by naïve native listeners and a language-specific scale used by trained raters. Verbal protocols were employed during trained rater sessions. Both scales were developed specifically for this study. Findings indicated that the Supra Tutor was effective in providing <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> as four out of the 12 ITAs showed significant comprehensibility improvement. The findings also indicated that the ITAs found the tutor to be useful, appealing, and of excellent quality. As for the contributions of suprasegmentals to comprehensibility, the analysis of trained rater data indicated that raters tended to place similar emphasis on rhythm and intonation. However, word stress was a suprasegmental that raters attended to when judging the comprehensibility of learners at all levels of proficiency. In addition, findings revealed that often there was not a clear connection between comprehensibility ratings and suprasegmental ratings. Also, individual trained raters focused on a variety of language features when judging L 2 speech. Segmentals, especially vowels, however, were the most common source of disagreement among the raters. The results of this study contribute to the area of technology applied to <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> in that it is the first study to employ fully online pronunciation training through the use of a tutor designed to target specific suprasegmental features and specific learner needs. The findings in this study have several pedagogical implications. First, the tutor was perceived to keep learners engaged and motivated to complete the training, which is an indication that this kind of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> can be helpful to raise learners’ motivation to improve their pronunciation skills. Second, the Supra Tutor can be easily adapted for different audiences and contexts, which can help solve the lack of trained teacher conundrum. Third, in addition to learner training, an online approach such as the Supra Tutor has the potential to serve as a teacher-training tool. The Supra tutor can raise teachers’ awareness of the pronunciation features of English, help them understand how to structure their own classes, and give them the confidence to embrace the teaching of pronunciation...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} second {{language}} (L 2) <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> has benefited greatly from an increasing {{amount of research}} and attention {{in the last ten}} years. Before this, the field suffered from a narrow approach to pronunciation featuring a dominant emphasis on students sounding native-‐like. However, in the last ten years, a paradigm shift has occurred bringing focus to aspects of intelligibility and comprehensibility (Derwing & Munro, 2005; Levis, 2005). With the focus of L 2 pronunciation research and instruction shifting, areas of word stress, intonation, connected speech, and suprasegmentals have seen much more exposure in scholarly articles and <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> texts. These changes have resulted in the publication of New Ways in Teaching Connected Speech (2012). This book offers an extensive amount of pronunciation lessons created by teachers for teachers of a range of proficiency levels (i. e., beginner to advanced). The editor suggests that connected speech is not simply a marker for casual, less formal speech, but is instead present in all situations of language use to some degree. By enabling students to utilize rules for connected speech in English, teachers can provide their students with a means for being perceived as more intelligible an...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} integrating commercial pronunciation software into an ESL pronunciation class of learners at university level. The study partially replicates Seferoğlu 2 ̆ 7 s (2005) research design and seeks to confirm her findings through a revised methodology. Participants {{in this study were}} 18 international graduate students from various departments of the Iowa State University in the US. Students were assigned to two experimental groups which received traditional classroom <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> and instruction that integrated the use of commercial pronunciation software, respectively, for six weeks. A pretest and a posttest using the same picture-description task were conducted in an attempt to find changes in the students overall pronunciation quality. As measured by the ratings of comprehensibility and accentedness from six native speaker raters, the group receiving software-integrated instruction did not show significant pronunciation improvement after the treatment. Neither did the two groups show significant difference in their pretest and posttest scores. Therefore the results did not confirm Seferoğlu 2 ̆ 7 s findings. In addition, the students 2 ̆ 7 reflection on the instruction received was analyzed to explore which features of the two types of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> were considered most useful and least useful by the language learners...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{pronunciation}} has slowly regained some of its former prominence in the second language (L 2) classroom. Yet, despite this renewed interest, L 2 instructors often perceive it {{to be one of}} the most challenging areas to teach. Specialists, therefore, suggest that preparing pronunciation teachers is a much needed area in the field of language teaching, but little is known about the education of pronunciation instructors and its potential impact on prospective teachers. This article reports on a qualitative case study in which questionnaires, focus groups, classroom observations and semi-structured interviews were employed to obtain insights on the impact of a postgraduate pronunciation subject on 15 student teachers 2 ̆ 7 cognition (beliefs, thoughts, attitudes and knowledge) about pronunciation pedagogy. Findings revealed that the subject had a notable effect on the development of participants 2 ̆ 7 cognition about <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> and its goal. Group work/discussions and comparisons of accents increased student teachers 2 ̆ 7 awareness about the value of non-native English varieties and accents, which in turn facilitated a change in participants 2 ̆ 7 beliefs that the objective of <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> should not be accent elimination. The article concludes with a discussion about implications for L 2 teacher educators and language instructors teaching English pronunciation in their classrooms...|$|E
40|$|In a {{time when}} the {{communicative}} approach is the teaching methodology of choice in most foreign language classes, certain aspects of language are often brought to the forefront: grammar and vocabulary. Explicit instruction of pronunciation, by contrast, is often not attended to during regular instruction. More researchers have only recently begun to challenge the current notion that foreign language pronunciation will be acquired incidentally only at a point when the student is ready (e. g. Plough et al. 2010, Rossiter 2009). Parallel {{to the development of the}} communicative approach is the focus on language-related anxiety. Horwitz (2001) asserts that one-third of all second language learners experience some level of language anxiety. ^ This study seeks to identify to what extent explicit <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> plays in the level of anxiety students experience in the German classroom. A total of 284 students at the second-, fourth-, and sixth-semester levels were interviewed and surveyed about their language learning experiences. The results indicated that students did not generally feel anxious about speaking German, but did worry about their pronunciation. Many students also indicated that pronunciation is either important or very important to them. Additionally, they expressed their desire to practice pronunciation more in class and to receive corrective feedback from their instructors. Students who had received explicit <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> in the past were very satisfied with their experience. ...|$|E

Despite the {{importance}} of correct pronunciation, {{there is often a}} lack of explicit <b>pronunciation</b> <b>instruction</b> in beginner-level foreign language courses. Teachers sometimes believe that students acquire pronunciation through mere exposure to the target language. Phonetics, i. e. the description of sound articulation and the use of written symbols to represent pronunciation, is typically reserved for upper level courses. This poster argues that using phonetics in beginner-level French courses can help establish a strong foundation for more accurate pronunciation.
