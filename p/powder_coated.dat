5|$|In April 1934, {{following}} the moving of the Richard Johnson, Clapham and Morris Ltd firm to Trafford Park, the playing grounds were {{offered to the}} Parks Committee of the Manchester Corporation for £2,400. At the time, the ground was described as being fenced all round with iron railings, containing bowling greens, a number of tennis courts and a cricket pitch, together with two well-built pavilions. For many years the land was used for community events including football and funfairs. A cycle speedway track was built during the 1980s. In 2005, a 2.4 m green <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> weld mesh fence with gates was erected at {{the perimeter of the}} fields.

Based on the CSR260, this model adds a ‘Superlight’ lightweight specification to the CSR, further extending the CSR260’s already epic performance envelope. The 2.3 litre Cosworth-powered Caterham CSR260 Superlight brings all the performance credentials associated with its stablemate; performance {{is quoted as}} a 0-60mph time of 3.1 seconds and {{a top speed of}} [...] The Superlight swaps the windscreen, carpet, heater and weather gear on the standard car for a limited slip differential and a quicker steering rack. There is a 25 kilo weight reduction over the standard CSR260, this model variant also adds distinctive Superlight styling to the exterior, including a wind deflector, a carbon fibre dashboard and wings, a black <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> cockpit and a quick-release MOMO steering wheel. Of particular note are ‘Dynamic Suspensions’ Damper units developed by specialist Multimatic for the car. The damper units lend the already capable CSR a further edge in terms of handling and cornering performance. It features the same 2.3 litre (260bhp) engine as the CSR260, but weighs only [...] and has a power-to-weight ratio of -per-tonne.|$|E

40|$|The <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> of wood {{products}} as an emerging environmentally sustainable coating technology holds promise {{in terms of}} novel product quality features for engineered wood like medium-density fiberboards (MDFs). However, one major limitation currently impeding widespread application of <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technology is the availability of MDF panels that are suitable for this process. Typically, special-grade MDF panels are required that are more costly than standard-grade MDF panels to provide reliable coating quality, which makes <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> economically unattractive for many users. Methods are needed that allow extending the range of available MDF grades. In the present study, three surface pretreatment approaches for MDFs were studied to increase the processability of standard-grade MDF in the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> process: atmospheric plasma pretreatment, infrared irradiation, and moisture equilibration in a climate chamber prior to electrostatic powder application. While atmospheric plasma treatment had no beneficial effect {{on the use of}} standard-grade MDF panels, both infrared preheating and preconditioning of the panels under controlled temperature–humidity conditions demonstrated that the range of MDF panels suitable for <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> can be significantly extended by appropriate selection of the pretreatment procedure...|$|R
