40|$|The {{consequences}} of wildfires are felt in susceptible {{communities around the}} globe on an annual basis. Climate change predictions {{in places like the}} south-east of Australia and western United States suggest that wildfires may become more frequent and more intense with global climate change. Compounding this issue is <b>progressive</b> <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> at the peri-urban fringe (wildland-urban interface), where continued infrastructure development and demographic changes are likely to expose more people and property to this potentially disastrous natural hazard. Preparing well in advance of the wildfire season is seen as a fundamental behaviour that can both reduce community wildfire vulnerability and increase hazard resilience - it is an important element of adaptive capacity that allows people to coexist with the hazardous environment in which they live. We use household interviews and surveys to build and test a substantive model that illustrates how social cohesion influences the decision to prepare for wildfire. We demonstrate that social cohesion, particularly community characteristics like 2 ̆ 7 sense of community 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 collective problem solving 2 ̆ 7, are community-based resources that support both the adoption of mechanical preparations, and the development of cognitive abilities and capacities that reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience to wildfire. We use the results of this work to highlight opportunities to transfer techniques and approaches from natural hazards research to climate change adaptation research to explore how the impacts attributed to the social components of social-ecological systems can be mitigated more effectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{most violent}} {{city in the}} world only twenty years ago, Medellín, Colombia is now a beacon of <b>progressive</b> <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> Governance and {{structuration}} theory provide an analytical framework through which three stages of this remarkable transformation can be assessed. During an illicit hegemony, narcotraffickers and state military forces ruthlessly controlled the city, and clientelism and corruption went unchecked. The principle results of the period were fixity of violence, a destabilization of formal government and a systematic disempowerment of the urban poor, who populated the city’s precarious mountainsides. Progressive interventions, inspired by a wave of decentralization in the late- 1980 s, sought to redress growing informality and enable local agency. The city’s first resulting policy experiment, PRIMED, was short-lived, however, because it did not improve municipal administration, strengthen community organization or build a political clientele around pro-poor governance. Learning from PRIMED, the current social urbanism agenda has ignited a political movement for poverty alleviation and directed spectacular infrastructure investment to the city’s poorest regions. Yet, as social urbanism reaches maturity, escalating violence and the city’s competitiveness agenda risk derailing its redistributive goals. Viewing these three periods in continuum suggests that while efficiency, agency and equitable distribution are critical components and outcomes of good governance, the level of interdependence fostered—particularly through strong state leadership—profoundly influences both the longevity of good governance practice and the durability of its impact. The city’s trajectory, furthermore, offers some substantiation of structuration theory. Local political leadership has built and financed a progressive discourse, which has, over time, established new social structures to govern the city’s public affairs...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{question}} whether {{and to what extent}} <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics make use of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts to tackle tasks and challenges posed by immigration and the presence of migrants in cities. As a start, relevant migration-related issues with a connection to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are expounded. This is followed by the analysis of six <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in terms of any migration and integration – related statements they may contain. The thesis consists of three chapters: in the first chapter, “migration” as the given central topic is identified and discussed following an examination of up-to-date specialist literature. There is a strong emphasis on the terminology used in current debates with particular attention given to the term “integration“. Another aspect of the first chapter is immigration in Germany: since its foundation, the Federal Republic of Germany has been a destination for immigrants; as a result, there are presently 12 million people from migrant backgrounds living in Germany. Among the main destinations were large West German cities, and within these cities specific districts which have consequently become rife with migration-related issues and problems. As a result, there are complex social, economic and spatial developments and phenomena which all have an impact on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics: Population development, segregation, the housing situation, the educational situation, their economic potential and chances, cultural impact of the presence of migrants. These aspects and the subject of integration and their relevance to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are the main topics of the professional debate. “Migration” with its complex spatial and content-related implications thus offers a cross- section view of <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> The second chapter addresses the subject of “urban development”. A brief retrospective highlights the general framework and paradigms of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> since the 1960 s and, above all, the use and implementation of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. The realisation here is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts do provide ideas and possibilities on how to handle migration-related issues and integrate these into <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics. Basic consideration of urban migration topics on one hand and <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics on the other hand have been the basis for developing a “migration evaluation” of selected current <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. Using a uniform investigation raster, it is explored how and to what extent these <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts contain statements on the migration-related topics mentioned above. The concluding examination in the third chapter returns to the initial questions: Is migration an integral part of current <b>urban</b> <b>development?</b> If so, how and to what extent? This will then lead to questions of whether the full potential of migration-related possibilities is being tapped and the restrictions and boundaries that apply. The overall conclusion is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics has so far failed to fully realise the importance of “migration” as an issue. <b>Urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts have been used with reserve to implement this issue in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics in an explicit, constructive and stringent manner. There {{can be no doubt that}} this is a difficult task. The appropriate consideration of issues of migration and integration in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts is met with various challenges: the complexity of this task cannot be ignored. However, this should by no means affect the comprehensibility of the problem; the significance of migration issues within <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and the real life impact of these issues on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> should correspond; <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts should be closely linked with other (professional) conceptions in the context of migration and integration. Migrants should be involved in the process of creating <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in order to tap their resources, knowledge and potential for <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> Finally, the thesis identifies existing gaps and areas in need of further research: <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts give but little indication of actual activity in the respective migration-related communal arenas; also, <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts are the result and expression of ongoing local politics debates, yet a discrepancy remains between the political aims and stances identified in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and those discussed outside the realm of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. This discrepancy requires further analysis. A third gap has been identified between local politics objectives and actual local activity beyond political agendas. The thesis closes on the note that not only is there a need for migration to be recognised as an urban development-relevant matter but that there is ample reasoning for the integration of migration as a task in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics...|$|R

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>development</b> bestows a great {{opportunity}} to increase sustainability in the built environment as cities are responsible for the majority of environmental impacts. However, the <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> process is fragmented and sub-optimization leads to unsustainable life cycle outcomes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> process from a life cycle perspective and identify how different actors understand life cycle management.

The theoretical perspective is a combination of the ecosystem construct and life cycle management. Results show that there is no clear responsible actor for life cycle management in <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> All actors claim that there is value to be added, mostly in economic, but also environmental and social terms. This study reveals that investors should be the responsible actor in the <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> process.

40|$|In {{the global}} {{knowledge}} economy, knowledge-intensive industries and knowledge workers are extensively {{seen as the}} primary factors to improve the welfare and competitiveness of cities. To attract and retain such industries and workers, cities produce knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies, and therefore such strategising has become an important development mechanism for cities and their economies. The paper discusses the critical connections between knowledge city foundations and integrated knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> mechanisms in both the local and regional level. In particular, the paper investigates Brisbane’s knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies that support gentrification, attraction, and retention of investment and talent. Furthermore, the paper develops a knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> assessment framework to provide {{a clearer understanding of}} the local and regional policy frameworks, and relevant applications of Brisbane’s knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> experience, in becoming a prosperous knowledge city. The paper, with its knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> assessment framework, scrutinises Brisbane’s four development domains in detail: economy; society; institutional; built and natural environments. As part of the discussion of the case study findings, the paper describes the global orientation of Brisbane within the frame of regional and local level knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies performing well. Although several good practices from Brisbane have already been internationally acknowledged, the research reveals that Brisbane is still {{in the early stages of}} its knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> implementation.
