40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental results of temperature and air velocity field measurements near a glazed façade {{located in a}} test chamber at the Hydro-Quebec (LTE) research laboratory in Shawinigan, Quebec. The façade separates a cold room from a warm room (at normal conditions), both controlled. The objective of the experiment {{was to examine the}} air movement and heat transfer near the windows with and without shading and with different <b>perimeter</b> <b>heating</b> configurations (for winter conditions). The chamber is equipped with three types of heating systems: electrically heated windows, a baseboard heater and a radiant ceiling panel. 2 -D velocity field measurements were performed on a 15 cm× 11 cm vertical plane perpendicular to the window surface using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. A 2 -D motorized traverse system was used to allow measurements at different heights, closer or further away from the façade. The thermal stratification in the room was monitored using a grid of thermocouples at different heights and distances from the facade. The general objective of this work is to develop design recommendations for high performance facades that will reduce or eliminate <b>perimeter</b> <b>heating</b> in buildings as a secondary heating system...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a current}} trend of {{designing}} new commercial buildings with large glazed façade areas. Maintaining {{comfort in the}} perimeter zones of these buildings is difficult due to their exposure to solar radiation and cold outdoor air temperature. Designing these buildings with high-performance fenestration systems, however, can improve energy performance, provide a high-quality thermal and visual environment, and reduce thermal loads. This study presents an experimental and simulation study of thermal comfort conditions of a perimeter zone office with a glass façade and solar shading device. The study investigates the impact of climate, glazing type, and shading device properties on thermal comfort conditions. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the façade properties that will provide a comfortable indoor environment without the need for secondary <b>perimeter</b> <b>heating.</b> Experimental measurements were taken in an office equipped with two different shading devices: venetian blind and roller shade. The thermal environment was measured with thermocouples, an indoor climate analyzer, and thermal comfort meter. For the simulation study, a one-dimensional transient thermal simulation model of a typical glazed perimeter zone office and a transient two-node thermal comfort model were developed. The impact of solar radiation and shading device properties on thermal comfort was also quantified. Simulation results were compared with experimental measurements. The impact of diffuser location for primary heating supply on indoor airflow and comfort is also investigated using computational fluid dynamics software and it is shown that good comfort is achieved without the presence of <b>perimeter</b> <b>heating...</b>|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{have been reported}} on steady state natural convection from the outer surface of vertical rectangular and square ducts in air. Seven ducts have been used; three {{of them have a}} rectangular cross section and the rest have square cross section. The ducts are heated using internal constant heat flux heating elements. The temperatures along the vertical surface and the peripheral directions of the duct wall are measured. Axial (<b>perimeter</b> averaged) <b>heat</b> transfer coefficients along the side of each duct are obtained for laminar and transition to turbulent regimes of natural convection <b>heat</b> transfer. Axial (<b>perimeter</b> averaged) Nusselt numbers are evaluated and correlated using the modified Rayleigh numbers for laminar and transition regime using the vertical axial distance as a characteristic length. Critical values of the modified Rayleigh numbers are obtained for transition to turbulent. Furthermore, total overall averaged Nusselt numbers are correlated with the modified Rayleigh numbers and the area ratio for the laminar regimes. The local axial (<b>perimeter</b> averaged) <b>heat</b> transfer coefficients are observed to decrease in the laminar region and increase in the transition region. Laminar regimes are obtained at {{the lower half of the}} ducts and its chance to appear decreases as the heat flux increases. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} field {{studies on the}} {{performance}} of displacement ventilation (DV) were carried out in schools across Canada during the heating season over the last three years. Indoor air quality was evaluated using the IAQ index Contaminant Removal Effectiveness (CRE) based on carbon dioxide concentrations for three schools equipped with DV systems. Results from the three field studies have shown values of CRE to be higher than 0. 7 (ventilation effectiveness specified in ASHRAE 62. 1 - 2007 when DV systems are used for heating, with ceiling return). The measured CRE in the three schools was often greater than 1. 0 even {{in the middle of the}} heating season. The results show that as long as the supply air is cooler than the room air, DV system works well in achieving good contaminant stratification and ventilation effectiveness in the space when combined with a <b>perimeter</b> <b>heating</b> system. 92012 ASHRAE.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical simulation and {{experimental study of}} the thermal environment in a perimeter zone near a highly-glazed façade. A finite difference thermal network approach {{was used to determine}} the daily variation in temperature of façade components (glazing and shading device) and indoor environmental parameters (air and operative temperature, radiant asymmetry) under variable climatic conditions (outdoor temperature and incident solar radiation). A transient, two-node thermal comfort model was used to determine the level of occupant comfort. The comfort model takes into account the solar radiation falling directly on the occupant. The simulation results are compared to experimental measurements taken from an experimental façade at Concordia University. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a mathematical model than can provide recommendations for components of high-performance façades (glazing U-value and shading device type and properties) for different climatic conditions and orientations that will allow for the elimination or reduction of <b>perimeter</b> <b>heating</b> as a secondary system while maintaining comfort conditions in perimeter zones...|$|E

40|$|Displacement {{ventilation}} systems take a fundamentally {{different approach to}} space conditioning than the systems found {{in the majority of}} commercial buildings, which currently use a fully mixed and dilution approach to ventilation. Displacement ventilation (DV) is an alternate air distribution method for commercial spaces, in particular schools. Previous research has shown that this type of system works well for regions where buildings require year-round cooling, however there are a growing number of buildings using this approach in Canada, where buildings require heating during winter months. A series of field studies in existing Canadian schools were carried out during the heating season over the last three years. This paper presents results from field studies conducted in schools designed for displacement ventilation with a <b>perimeter</b> radiant <b>heating</b> system. We measured several aspects of the performance of a DV systems installed in schools located {{in different parts of the}} country. The results show that the measured contaminant removal effectiveness was higher than that provided in previous studies for heating mode. In addition, key predictors of thermal comfort are also generally within limits set by ASHRAE standards. The results of these field studies provide some evidence of thermal comfort and IAQ-related benefits of DV in cold climate. However, before general conclusions are drawn, the benefits need to be confirmed in other studies. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|The {{parameters}} for a dynamic, computer simulation model were developed. The parameters characterize {{the physical and}} geometric properties of a building shell, {{the internal and external}} building loads, the buildings secondary systems, and the plant or primary energy source. The purpose of the model is to provide a standard testbed for the evaluation of control algorithms and strategies related to variable air volume HVAC systems. This work was conducted in collaboration with, and under subcontract to Loughborough University of Technology, Loughborough England. The prototype building is a four level commercial, multi-use building and activities in the building include classroom / educational space professorial and student offices, and office / administrative. The building contains three air-handling units; one unit and the volume it serves provides the basis for the testbed. The model volume is divided into thirty four zones, each with its own single duct, pressure independent V A V terminal box with hot water reheat. A <b>perimeter</b> <b>heating</b> system, composed of hot water convectors, radiators and baseboard heaters, augments the room comfort control system. Local loop control in the mechanical room and for {{all but one of the}} zones is micro-processor based pneumatic actuated. One prototype direct digital control terminal box system was in use for a classroom zone. DDC control systems and motor driven actuators were substituted in the testbed for the pneumatic equipment. Zoning in the volume was redistributed into six zones; the supply and return duct system was redesigned to accommodate the simplified zone configuration. A survey was conducted to determine the availability of sub-one-hour solar and collateral weather data. Historically, data in this frequency has been collected, but, not reported. A relatively new program called the Automated Surface Observing System (AS OS) and operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will eventually provide weather data at varying intervals down to one minute, depending on the type of information required. Daily and monthly summaries are available, however, resolution is reduced and averaged to one hour intervals. The SOLMET program, under the auspices of DOE, provides archived solar data at one hour intervals on CD Rom. Data is collected from twenty-six stations distributed around the United States. Collateral weather data is also provided with the solar data and for simulation purposes the SOLMET data provides the best resource. by Mark DeSimone. Thesis (M. S.)

The density of convective heat flow in the neighborhood of its critical point during the heating of the plasma flow in a wire coating is defined. Calculation of the heat flux density is a 3 -d plasma radiation. It is shown that the spherical layer of 2 mm radius of argon plasma is optically transparent in the temperature range (8 – 20) 103 k, since the degree of this layer blackness is considerably less than one.

40|$|A {{short-time}} asymptotic {{solution is}} {{developed for the}} problem of a half-space, part of the surface of which is raised to a prescribed temperature. A Green's function formulation is used {{to demonstrate that the}} heat flux at the surface can be determined from a one-dimensional analysis of the local heat conduction problem, except in the immediate vicinity of the edge of the heated area, where there is a boundary layer, the thickness of which grows with time. This boundary layer is then analyzed in more detail, using Williams' asymptotic technique. In particular, the additional total heat flux to the half-space due to the boundary layer is determined and hence a two-term asymptotic expression for the transient thermal resistance is obtained, which depends only on the area and the <b>perimeter</b> of the <b>heated</b> region.

40|$|Carleton Lodge, {{situated}} {{on the banks of}} the Rideau River, is a 160 -bed long-term care facility that opened on April 8, 1989. The structure is light wood frame construction with insulated stud walls, vertical aluminum siding, and pitched roof trusses. The Lodge, with a central core and four 2 -storey residential wings, has private rooms with en suite bathrooms, which project beyond the face of the main walls, and vent directly outside.

Since construction, problems have existed with water infiltration, condensation and mould within the exterior walls. The residential wings were cold and drafty in winter and hot in summer. Whenever mould has been encountered since the building was completed, the City of Ottawa (and formerly the Regional Municipality of Ottawa Carleton) has taken immediate action to remove and remediate and conducted frequent air testing to ensure residents and staff were safe. The project objectives were to solve the problem of water penetration into the exterior walls, carry out mould decontamination, and re-clad with a system that will provide trouble free service with a reasonable degree of maintenance.

5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, passive fire {{protection}} remains inactive in the coating system until a fire occurs. There are mainly two types of PFP: intumescent fire protection and vermiculite fire protection. In vermiculite fire protection, the structural steel members are covered with vermiculite materials, mostly a very thick layer. This is a cheaper option as compared to an intumescent one, but is very crude and aesthetically unpleasant. Moreover, if the environment is corrosive in nature, then the vermiculite option is not advisable, as {{there is the possibility}} of water seeping into it (because of the porous nature of vermiculite), and there it is difficult to monitor for corrosion. Intumescent fireproofing is a layer of paint which is applied along with the coating system on the structural steel members. The thickness of this intumescent coating is dependent on the steel section used. For calculation of DFT (dry film thickness) a factor called Hp/A (<b>heated</b> <b>perimeter</b> divided by cross sectional area), referred to as [...] "section factor" [...] and expressed in m−1, is used. Intumescent coatings are applied as an intermediate coat in a coating system (primer, intermediate, and top/finish coat). Because of the relatively low thickness of this intumescent coating (usually in the 350- to 700-micrometer range), nice finish, and anti-corrosive nature, intumescent coatings are preferred on the basis of aesthetics and performance.|$|R
