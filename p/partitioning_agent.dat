Neste trabalho, buscou-se estudar a influência do tipo de agente de partição da borracha nitrílica (resina de PVC e CaCO 3) na obtenção de blendas PVC/NBR. As propriedades mecânicas das blendas foram avaliadas por ensaios de tração, rasgo e dureza. As blendas com NBR com agente de partição de PVC apresentaram maior tensão na ruptura e módulo elástico que as blendas em que utilizaram NBR com agente de partição de CaCO 3. A morfologia foi avaliada por microscopia eletrônica de varredura sendo bastante afetada pelo tipo de agente de partição.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Air {{traffic flow}} {{management}} over the U. S. airpsace {{is a difficult}} problem. Current management approaches lead {{to hundreds of thousands}} of hours of delay, costing billions of dollars annually. Weather and airport conditions may instigate this delay, but routing decisions balancing delay with congestion contribute significantly to the propagation of delays throughout the US airspace. The task of managing delay may be seen as a multiagent congestion problem. In this problem there are many tightly coupled agents whose actions collectively impact the system, making it difficult for agents to learn how they individually affect the system. Reward shaping is effective at improving agent learning for soft constraint problems by reducing noise caused by interactions with other agents, so we extend those results to hard constraints that cannot be easily learned, and must be enforced algorithmically. Additionally, congestion must be removed from the system in order to ensure a safe environment for all aircraft. This can be done {{through the use of a}} greedy scheduler, enforcing a ground delay on each plane to remove congestion from the system, at the cost of delay. Reward shaping reduces noise caused by agent interactions, and a greedy scheduler removes congestion from the system, but these two approaches cannot be simply combined without a large increase in computational complexity. <b>Agent</b> <b>partitioning</b> can be used to alleviate this complexity by treating each <b>partition</b> of <b>agents</b> as an independent set of <b>agents</b> from other <b>partitions,</b> thus simplifying the computation during each learning step. Our approach is based on the combination of three different methods to perform hard constraint optimization: a greedy scheduler, reward shaping and <b>agent</b> <b>partitioning.</b> We present two <b>agent</b> <b>partitioning</b> algorithms in conjunction with this approach to simplify the learning domain. The first partitioning algorithm uses system features to compute similarities between agents. This is then used to <b>partition</b> <b>agents</b> into small subsets. To remove the assumption of having domain knowledge, we introduce the Reward/Utility Based Impact (RUBI) algorithm. This algorithm develops an effective similarity matrix while requiring no prior domain knowledge. This similarity matrix can then be used in any similarity based partitioning algorithm.

Agents have strict preferences over houses, and the market operates without payments. The goal is to enable an efficient reallocation of objects, along with strategyproofness and while satisfying participation constraints. We first establish conditions under which an online mechanism that allows an agent to influence the period in which it trades can be manipulated. This motivates partition mechanisms in which agents are divided online into disjoint feasible trading groups, with the top trading cycle algorithm (TTCA) run separately for each group. In particular, we demonstrate good rank-efficiency for a mechanism that adopts stochastic-optimization in determining how to <b>partition</b> <b>agents.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes the development of novel methodology for the preparation of macromolecular conjugates using proteins and dendrimers as scaffolds. This methodology {{is based on the}} discovery that chemical modification of proteins can be achieved in vacuo, in the absence of solvents, viz., water. The results obtained represent the first attempts to use this methodology to achieve protein modifications that are otherwise difficult or impossible under aqueous conditions. While the inspiration for this research stemmed from practical objectives, much of the work undertaken developed into a proof of principle, not by design, but {{due to the fact that}} there is no precedence or established theoretical base for the in vacuo chemical modification of proteins. Initially, the scope of the project involved the design and development of a novel detoxication construct for an artificial liver consisting of an enzyme coupled to lipophilic poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers as <b>partitioning</b> <b>agents</b> for the clearing of hydrophobic compounds from aqueous solution. While the lipophilic dendrimers proved to be feasible <b>partitioning</b> <b>agents</b> when tested with some drugs in aqueous solution, attempts to attach a model enzyme to the construct by established methods in solution met with limited success. The search for better, more efficient methods of tethering, immobilizing and cross-linking enzymes lead to the investigation of alternative conjugation methods. p-Nitrophenylchloroformate is a common activating reagent used in organic synthesis and has been used to activate chemical modifiers for proteins. However, this reagent has not been used for direct chemical modification of proteins because of its insolubility in water. The results obtained show that this reagent, when used with the in vacuo procedure, can activate and cross-link proteins through chemical modification of protein carboxyl groups. In the course of these studies it was observed that a covalent dimer was present in ribonuclease A heated in the absence of reagent. This observation lead to an investigation which demonstrated that proton transfers between interacting carboxylate and ammonium groups in vacuo results in the formation of amide bonds. Compared to solution methods, the in vacuo methods developed are experimentally simple, and may also be carried out without the use of reactive chemical reagents. Glycation of protein amino groups with reducing monosaccharides can readily be achieved by the formation of stable ketoamine derivatives using the in vacuo methodology.

40|$|Abstract. Constrained global {{types are}} a {{powerful}} means to represent agent interaction protocols. In our recent research we demonstrated {{that they can}} be used to represent complex protocols in a very compact way, and we exploited them to dynamically verify correct implementation of a protocol in a real MAS framework, Jason. The main drawback of our pre-vious approach is the full centralization of the monitoring activity which is delegated to a unique monitor agent. This approach works well for MASs with few agents, but could become unsuitable in communication-intensive and highly-distributed MASs where hundreds of agents should be monitored. In this paper we define an algorithm for projecting a constrained global type onto a set of agents Ags, by restricting it to the interactions in-volving agents in Ags, so that the outcome of the algorithm is another constrained global type that can be safely used for verifying the compli-ance of the sub-system Ags to the protocol specified by the original con-strained global type. The projection mechanism is implemented in SWI Prolog and is the first step towards distributing the monitoring activity, making it safer and more ecient: the compliance of a MAS to a protocol could be dynamically verified by suitably <b>partitioning</b> the <b>agents</b> of the MAS into small sets of agents, and by assigning to each partition Ags a local monitor agent which checks all interactions involving Ags against the projected constrained global type. We leave for further investigation the problem of finding suitable <b>partitions</b> of <b>agents</b> in a MAS, to guar-antee that verification through projected types and distributed agents is equivalent to verification performed by a single centralized monitor with a unique global type...|$|R

We consider convergence of dynamics to locally stable matchings [...] states that are stable {{with respect to their}} imposed information structure in the network. In the two-sided case of stable marriage in which existence is guaranteed, we show that the existence of a path to stability becomes NP-hard to decide. This holds even when the network exists only among one <b>partition</b> of <b>agents.</b> In contrast, if one partition has no network and agents remember a previous match every round, a path to stability is guaranteed and random dynamics converge with probability 1.

Also, it is crucial which <b>partition</b> of the <b>agents</b> has memory.
