40|$|Abstract. <b>Tripod</b> {{configurations}} <b>of</b> plane curves, {{formed by}} certain triples of normal lines co-inciding at a point, were introduced by Tabachnikov, who showed that C 2 closed convex curves possess {{at least two}} tripod configurations. Later, Kao and Wang established the existence <b>of</b> <b>tripod</b> configurations for C 2 closed locally convex curves. In this paper we generalize these two results, answering a conjecture of Tabachnikov on the existence <b>of</b> <b>tripod</b> configurations for all C 2 closed plane curves by proving existence for a generalized notion <b>of</b> <b>tripod</b> configuration. We then demon-strate {{the existence of the}} natural extensions <b>of</b> these <b>tripod</b> configurations to the spherical and hyperbolic geometries for a certain class of convex curves, and discuss an analogue of the problem for regular plane polygons. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract : Constant {{velocity}} joint (CVJ) lines of front drive automobiles are composed <b>of</b> the <b>tripod</b> CVJ or the double offset CVJ, the Rzeppa CVJ and the drive shaft. The rotational angle error of the CVJ {{line and the}} three dimensional motion of the drive shaft (the whirling motion and the fluctuation of axial direction) were measured and its components were expanded in trigonometric functions. The rotational angle error contains sinusoidal fluctuations with 2 π, 2 π/ 3, 2 π/ 6 periods according to joint angles <b>of</b> <b>Tripod</b> and Rzeppa CVJs. The whirling motion has the period of 2 π/ 3 according to the joint angle <b>of</b> <b>Tripod</b> CVJ. The axial direction motion of the drive shaft contains sinusoidal fluctuations of 2 π, 2 π/ 3 or 2 π/ 6 periods according to joint angles <b>of</b> <b>Tripod</b> and Rzeppa CVJs.

Materials & methods: Tripods were prepared by controlling the temperature during the thermal decomposition of Fe(CO) 5, and their magnetic properties were characterized by superconducting quantum interference device, and NMR. Citric acid stabilized USPIONs were used to assess cytocompatibility. Results: T 2 relaxivity <b>of</b> <b>tripods</b> showed dependency on AR <b>of</b> the <b>tripod</b> arm. Liver enzyme levels in presence <b>of</b> <b>tripods</b> were comparable to spherical USPIONs, and surprisingly tripods induced lower levels of reactive oxygen species.

40|$|Robot tacheometers are {{nowadays}} {{used more}} and more frequently. Due to their motor-controlled axis drives and ATR (Automatic Target Recognition) facility, {{they are able to}} independently target and follow points indicated by prisms. However, the motor acceleration and braking processes can cause tripods to twist or tilt. For this reason, the tripod movements have been investigated in comprehensive tests using an electronic autocollimator. Tripods from Nedo, Leica and Crain were included in the investigations. Typical scenarios such as "face change " and "set of angles " were simulated with a Leica TCA 2003 robot tacheometer. All measuring scenarios showed systematic horizontal twisting and tilting <b>of</b> the <b>tripod,</b> whereby tilting occurred to a considerably greater extent. It was shown that the twisting and tilting <b>of</b> the <b>tripod</b> remained in the position in which the direction measurements were taken, and that the order of magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>tripod</b> movements was dependent on the position of the instrument. The residual horizontal twisting <b>of</b> the <b>tripod</b> causes a change in direction of the line of sight and thus an error in orientation. Tilting <b>of</b> the <b>tripod</b> has the same effect as a vertical axis error. Using the identified order <b>of</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>tripod</b> movements, an estimate can be made as to what extent these errors {{have an effect on the}} required accuracy of measurement in individual cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{deformation}} <b>of</b> <b>tripods</b> may {{significantly affect}} high precision measurements. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to have profound knowledge about the effect of static and dynamic loads (magnitude and temporal progress). This may be e. g. vertical deformations or torsions induced by mounting a tacheometer and executing automatic measurement processes. The effects are dependent on the stability of these ‘accessories’, which often are provided in a wide bandwith by the manufacturer, starting from a lowcost tripod up to a highend tripod for industrial measurements. This study investigates the effect of static and dynamic loads on different types <b>of</b> <b>tripods</b> and shortly outlines the reasonable application in relation to different measurement tasks and accuracy requirements. The work is a cooperation between TU Vienna and Leica Geosystems AG. For a priori theoretical simulations a Finite Element model <b>of</b> a <b>tripod</b> is created to design the experimental investigations. Because of the complexity of the mechanical system, the model is firstly restricted to the simulation of vertical static loadings. For the investigations of height stability, different sensors are evaluated. Considering measuring accuracy and capability for automatisation, it is decided to use a Leica DNA 0...|$|R
