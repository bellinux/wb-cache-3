25|$|Finding a {{cure for}} the {{diseases}} caused by frameshift mutations is rare. Research into this is evident. One example is a <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiency</b> (PID), an inherited condition {{which can lead to}} an increase in infections. There are 120 genes and 150 mutations that play a role in primary immunodeficiencies. The standard treatment is currently gene therapy, but this is a highly risky treatment and can often lead to other diseases, such as leukemia. Gene therapy procedures include modifying the zinc fringer nuclease fustion protein, cleaving both ends of the mutation, which in turn removes it from the sequence. Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated exon skipping is another possibility for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This process allows for passing over the mutation so {{that the rest of the}} sequence remains in frame and the function of the protein stays intact. This, however, does not cure the disease, just treats symptoms, and is only practical in structural proteins or other repetitive genes. A third form of repair is revertant mosaicism, which is naturally occurring by creating a reverse mutation or a mutation at a second site that corrects the reading frame. This reversion may happen by intragenic recombination, mitotic gene conversion, second site DNA slipping or site-specific reversion. This is possible in several diseases, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, and Bloom syndrome. There are no drugs or other pharmacogenomic methods that help with PIDs.|$|E
25|$|Immunopathology is {{a branch}} of {{clinical}} pathology that deals with an organism’s immune response to a certain disease. When a foreign antigen enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system {{that can lead to}} more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation {{is a prime example of}} autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are <b>Primary</b> <b>Immunodeficiency,</b> where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and Secondary Immunodeficiency, where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia. In all vertebrates, there are two different kinds of immune responses: Innate and Adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is used to fight off non-changing antigens and is therefore considered nonspecific. It is usually a more immediate response than the adaptive immune system, usually responding within minutes to hours. It is composed of physical blockades such as the skin, but also contains nonspecific immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T Cells, and basophils. The second for of immunity is Adaptive immunity. This form of immunity requires recognition of the foreign antigen before a response is produced. Once the antigen is recognized, a specific response is produced in order to destroy the specific antigen. Because of this idea, adaptive immunity is considered to be specific immunity. A key part of adaptive immunity that separates it from innate is the use of memory to combat the antigen in the future. When the antigen is originally introduced, the organism does not have any receptors for the antigen so it must generate them from the first time the antigen is present. The immune system then builds a memory of that antigen, which enables it to recognize the antigen quicker in the future and be able to combat it quicker and more efficiently. The more the system is exposed to the antigen, the quicker it will build up its responsiveness.|$|E

40|$|Background The ImmunoDeficiency Resource (IDR) is a {{knowledge}} {{base for the}} integration of the clinical, biochemical, genetic, genomic, proteomic, structural, and computational data of <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies.</b> The need for the IDR arises from the lack of structured and systematic information about <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> on the Internet, and from the lack of a common platform which enables doctors, researchers, students, nurses and patients to find out validated information about these diseases. Description The IDR knowledge base, first released in 1999, has grown substantially. It contains information for 158 diseases, both from a clinical as well as molecular point of view. The database and the user interface have been reformatted. This new IDR release has a richer and more complete breadth, depth and scope. The service provides the most complete and up-to-date dataset. The IDR has been integrated with several internal and external databases and services. The contents of the IDR are validated and selected for different types of users (doctors, nurses, researchers and students, as well as patients and their families). The search engine has been improved and allows either a detailed or a broad search from a simple user interface. Conclusion The IDR is the first knowledge base specifically designed to capture in a systematic and validated way both clinical and molecular information for <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies.</b> The service is freely available at [URL] and is regularly updated. The IDR facilitates <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> informatics and helps to parameterise in silico modelling of these diseases. The IDR is useful also as an advanced education tool for medical students, and physicians. BioMed Central Open acces...|$|R

40|$|Autoinflammatory syndromes (AISs) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of genetically determined diseases, whose basis is the dysregulated mechanisms of inflammation. Despite {{the fact that}} traditional <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> and AISs have an external dissimilarity, there are many parallels, such as hypodiagnosis, multisystem pattern of lesion, chronic inflammation-induced complications, possible medical therapy using cytokine inhibitors, and cardinal cure by stem cell transplantation and gene therapy. There are more than 25 different AISs, their common manifestations are fever episodes accompanied by laboratory inflammatory activity, polymorphous eruption, lymphoproliferative syndrome, and injury to different organs. Genetic analysis {{plays an important role}} in the diagnosis in traditional AISs and <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies.</b> This is particularly relevant to AISs that are not infrequently very closely allied phenotypically. Moreover, it is important that the detection of a causative genetic defect frequently determines man-agement tactics for patients. For AIS treatment, there is a spectrum of agents modulating these or those inflammatory components. However, there is a problem of resistance to standard therapy as before. Pathogenetic therapy for AISs is lifetime, expensive, and commonly responsible for serious adverse reactions, which worsens quality of life in patients. Patients with AISs, like those with other <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> need a multidisciplinary approach with the participation of various specialists. These patients should be followed up in specialized centers that perform treatments according to the international algorithms. Since the early diagnosis of <b>primary</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> and AISs is a key to their successful treatment; primary care physician’s awareness of these rare diseases is of the most importance. </em...|$|R
