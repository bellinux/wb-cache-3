5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, after <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> {{with his}} stepfather, Parker moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia, {{to live with his}} {{maternal}} uncle, Jay Combs. Combs, a former wrestler, encouraged Parker to join the wrestling team at Princess Anne High School. He then attended Churchland High School and continued on their wrestling team, before moving to Great Bridge High School before attending Penn State University on a wrestling scholarship in 1999. After a rape allegation, he later transferred to and graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2002, where he was on the wrestling team and received a degree in management science and information systems.|$|E
5|$|After suppressing a minor {{rebellion}} in Wales in 1276–77, Edward {{responded to a}} second {{rebellion in}} 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, Edward subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. In the war that followed, the Scots persevered, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. At {{the same time there}} were <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son, EdwardII, an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems.|$|E

25|$|Differences in the {{political}} and economic systems of Western democracies and the Soviet Union—socialism versus capitalism, economic autarky versus free trade, state planning versus private enterprise—became simplified and refined in national ideologies to represent two ways of life. Following the postwar Red Scare, many in the U.S. saw the Soviet system as a threat. The atheistic nature of Soviet communism also concerned many Americans. Up until the mid-1930s, both British and U.S. policymakers commonly assumed the communist Soviet Union to be a much greater threat than disarmed and democratic Germany and focused most of their intelligence efforts against Moscow. However, it has also been stated that in the period between the two wars, the U.S. had little interest in the Soviet Union or its intentions. America, after minimal contribution to World War I and the Russian Civil War, began to favor an isolationist stance when concerned with global politics (something which contributed to its late involvement in the Second World War). An example of this can be seen from its absence in the League of Nations, an international political forum, much like the United Nations; President Woodrow Wilson {{was one of the main}} advocates for the League of Nations; the United States Senate, however, voted against joining. America was enjoying unprecedented economic growth throughout the 1910s and early 1920s. However, the world soon plunged into the Great Depression and the U.S. was therefore even less inclined to make contributions to the international community while it suffered from serious financial and social <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{research}} {{achievements of}} Chinese {{scholars in the}} study of the marriage system and the Mosuo people in Yunnan are the result of decades of data accumulation. In the 1950 s and 1960 s, the old generation of Chinese ethnologists conducted an investigation on the Mosuo people and published a number of monographs. (Yan and Song, 1981) Despite different interpretations of this <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and abroad, (Han, 2003) this study itself demonstrates that the Chinese ethnological academia has increasingly delivered world-class outcomes after decades of accumulation, and contributed to the development of theories in international ethnology.|$|R

500|$|Lasting {{until the}} final day without ever being kicked out or leaving for another reason is treated as an {{impressive}} feat on the series due {{to the level of}} violence and hostility.

Security guards apparently live in the house behind the scenes as they jump into camera shot to break up the many violent altercations that break out on the series. Beyond the common occurrence of violence and combat, other reasons for the premature exits of cast members have been from bullying, ostracism and alienation from the rest of the housemates, <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> court proceedings, or their own narcissism.

2500|$|Mobutu's {{relationship}} with the Soviet Union was frosty and tense. Mobutu, a staunch anticommunist, was not anxious to recognize the Soviets; the USSR had supported, though mostly in words, Patrice Lumumba, Mobutu's democratically elected predecessor, and the Simba rebels. However, to project a non-aligned image, he did renew ties in 1967; the first Soviet ambassador arrived and presented his credentials in 1968. Mobutu did, however, join the United States in condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that year. Mobutu viewed the Soviet presence as advantageous for two reasons: it allowed him to maintain an image of non-alignment, and it provided a convenient scapegoat for <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> For example, in 1970, he expelled four Soviet diplomats for carrying out [...] "subversive activities," [...] and in 1971, twenty Soviet officials were declared persona non grata for allegedly instigating student demonstrations at Lovanium University.|$|E
2500|$|The Scottish {{churches were}} {{relatively}} late {{to take up}} the challenge of foreign missions. The most famous Scottish missionary, David Livingstone, was not funded from his home country, but by the London Missionary Society. After his [...] "disappearance" [...] and death in the 1870s he became an icon of evangelic outreach, self-improvement, exploration and a form of colonialism. The legacy of Livingstone {{can be seen in the}} names of many mission stations founded following his example, such as [...] Blantyre (the place of Livingstone's birth) for the Church of Scotland and Livingstonia for the Free Church, both now in Malawi. As well as the cult of Livingstone, Scottish missionary efforts were also fuelled by the rivalry between different denominations in Scotland, and may have helped distract from <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> The missions were popularised at home by publications and illustrations, often particularly designed to appeal to children, and through the new medium of the magic lantern show, shown to audiences in church halls throughout the country.|$|E
2500|$|Consultation is an {{important}} part of a school psychologist’s career because it allows school psychologists to reach more children than using direct intervention techniques. Consultation is usually thought of as a triadic relationship with the school psychologist working with another individual in hopes of helping change many students behaviors/grades [...] The individual that school psychologists usually work with during consultation is a parent or teacher. School psychologists consult with parents to address learning and behavioral <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> that can interfere with school progress. More frequently though school psychologists work with teachers during consultation to reach the many students in their classrooms. School psychologists mainly consult teachers on developing and implementing classroom management techniques and implementing specific interventions for specific students. School psychologists also now consult with administrators on a systems-level. When working on a systems level, school psychologists generally do not just work with one person but instead works with multiple individuals to make changes and help students on a more broad level. This can be to develop school wide programs to combat bullying or improve the entire school’s reading program.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the role of family context variables (i. e., parenting stress and positive parenting practices) as possible moderators and mediators of the relationship between conjoint behavioral consultation (CBC) and change in child problem behavior in the home setting. Another aim of the study was to evaluate the mediator roles of two dimensions of intervention implementation integrity (i. e., adherence to interventions and full engagement in the plan implementation phase) on parenting stress and change in child problem behavior for families involved in CBC. Participants were 203 parents, 81 teachers (81 classrooms), and 203 children who took part in a larger experimental study. Measures included rating scales of parenting stress and parenting practices, home intervention implementation integrity self-reports and permanent products, and parent reports of child <b>problem</b> behavior <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> The presence of moderators and mediators in three models were tested for and teacher effects were accounted for using multilevel path analyses. Results indicated CBC was effective <b>at</b> reducing child <b>problem</b> behavior <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Additionally, when parent 2 ̆ 7 s reported high levels of parenting stress, they reported little increase in their use of positive parenting practices and less engagement in the CBC plan implementation phase. Furthermore, a parent 2 ̆ 7 s full engagement was affected by their child’s classroom/teacher. Lastly, as parents reported more adherence to interventions, they reported greater reductions in child <b>problem</b> behaviors <b>at</b> <b>home</b> than when less adherence was reported. Implications for practice and future research directions will be discussed. ...|$|R
