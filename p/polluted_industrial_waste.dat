40|$|Anaerobic {{wastewater}} treatment (AnWT) is considered {{as the most}} cost-effective solution for organically <b>polluted</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> streams. Particularly the development of high-rate systems, in which hydraulic retention times are uncoupled from solids retention times, {{has led to a}} world-wide acceptance of AnWT. In the last decade up to the present, the application potentials of AnWT are further explored. Research shows the feasibility of anaerobic reactors under extreme conditions, such as low and high temperatures. Also toxic and/or recalcitrant wastewaters, that were previously believed not to be suitable for anaerobic processes, are now effectively treated. The recent advances are made possible by adapting the conventional anaerobic high-rate concept to the more extreme conditions. Staged anaerobic reactor concepts show advantages under non-optimal temperature conditions as well as during the treatment of chemical wastewater. In other situations, a staged anaerobic - aerobic approach is required for biodegradation of specific pollutants, e. g. the removal of dyes from textile processing wastewaters. The current paper illustrates the benefits or reactor staging and the yet un-exploited potentials of high-rate AnWT...|$|E
40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{generated from}} pharmaceutical industry generally contain high organic load {{and the treatment}} is primarily carried out using two major types of biological methods; aerobic and anaerobic. However, due to high strength, it is infeasible to treat some pharmaceutical wastewater using aerobic biological processes. As an alternative, an anaerobic process is preferred to remove high strength organic matter. Anaerobic wastewater treatment is considered as the most cost effective solution for organically <b>polluted</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> streams. In particular the development of high rate systems, in which hydraulic retention times (HRT) are uncoupled from solids retention times (SRT), {{has led to a}} worldwide acceptance of anaerobic wastewater treatment. In this paper, literature on anaerobic digestion, anaerobic reactor technology and existing anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater are presented. In addition, fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment was also discussed in brief. A case study of a laboratory investigation into the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater containing the antibiotic Tylosin in an anaerobic reactor was also given. Specifically, it was determined whether the anaerobic reactor {{could be used as a}} pre-treatment system at an existing pharmaceutical production plant. The performance of the reactor treating real pharmaceutical wastewater at various organic loading rate (OLR) was investigated and showed efficient substrate removal at low OLRs (0. 43 - 1. 86 kg COD. m- 3. d- 1) by promoting efficient chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction (70 - 75 %). Under these conditions, an average of 95 % Tylosin reduction was achieved in the UASR. However, increasing the OLRs to 3. 73 kg COD. m- 3. d- 1 by reducing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) (4 - 2 d) reduced the COD removal efficiency (45 %). Changes in the organic loading affected the treatment performance of the anaerobic reactor, and at high OLRs, it was not able to withstand the short HRT, probably due to the complexity of pharmaceutical wastewater...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} clean water is {{increasing}} and anaerobic wastewater treatment {{can be used}} as a cost-effective solution for purification of organically <b>polluted</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> streams. This thesis presents results from microbiological investigations of several full-scale and lab-scale anaerobic wastewater treatments systems. Anaerobic wastewater treatment has gained popularity and is now one of the key technologies in environmental biotechnology. However, knowledge of the microbial community structure – function relationships is limited. A combination of cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent techniques can be used to improve this knowledge. In this thesis, batch serial dilution incubations from a methanol-fed lab-scale thermophilic (55 °C) methanogenic bioreactor indicated that syntrophic interspecies hydrogen transfer-dependent methanol conversion is at least equally important as direct methanogenesis in this lab-scale reactor. A direct methanol-utilizing Methanomethylovorans hollandica-related strain was detected up to a 10 8 -fold dilution, while Thermodesulfovibrio relatives and Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus strains were found till 10 9 –fold dilutions in the presence of H 2 /CO 2. Microbial diversity was further evaluated in two expanded granular sludge bed reactors fed with increasing oleic acid loading rates. The archaeal community in the reactor inoculated with granular sludge stayed quite stable and active, whereas the relative abundance of Methanosaeta-like organisms gradually decreased in the reactor inoculated with suspended sludge when oleate loads were increased to 8 kg of chemical oxygen demand m - 3 day - 1. Desulfomicrobium and Methanobacterium were found to dominate the start-up of a full-scale synthesis gas fed gas-lift reactor treating metal and sulphate rich wastewater. Most Probable Number (MPN) counts confirmed that heterotrophic sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) were dominant (10 11 - 10 12 cells/g VSS) compared to homoacetogens (10 5 - 10 6 cells/g VSS) and methanogens (10 8 - 10 9 cells/g VSS). Methanogens can still persist in sulphate-reducing bioreactors with short sludge retention time, since competition for hydrogen is determined by Monod kinetics and not by hydrogen threshold values. The microbial community in a full-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating paper mill wastewater operated at 37 °C was relatively stable over a period of 3 years as indicated by a high similarity (> 75 %) of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene fragments. Batch incubations at different temperatures resulted in microbial community changes. While the archaeal community composition differed significantly between incubations at 45 and 55 °C, the bacterial composition changed between 37 and 45 °C. Overall the bacterial community was dominated by Firmicutes (68 % of the clones) and Delta-Proteobacteria (17 % of the clones). A sequential degradation of first butyrate and then propionate at 37 °C was linked to strong presence of Syntrophomonas sp. and Desulfobulbus propionicus, respectively. MPN series allowed estimating the number of micro-organisms per ml sludge that could use propionate without sulphate (10 9), propionate and sulphate (10 5), butyrate without sulphate (10 8), butyrate with sulphate (10 5), glucose (10 9) and H 2 /CO 2 (10 10). Archaea were mainly dominated by Methanosaeta, but also Crenarchaeota-relatives were identified. Bacterial clone sequences were related to a variety of different known species, with expected functions in anaerobic digestion like fermentative bacteria, syntrophic short chain fatty acids oxidisers and SRB. However, about 80 % of the clones was similar to sequences in the database without close cultured relatives, but many of these appeared to be present in anaerobic environments. It is important to improve knowledge of these unknown micro-organisms and fast accurate monitoring and identification could be instrumental in realising this. Therefore, a pilot macro-array was developed and tested. It appeared that combining probes generated by PCR amplification of the V 1 and V 6 variable regions of the 16 S rRNA gene provided accurate differentiation of closely related organisms. The integrated application of molecular and cultivation dependent analyses of microbiota structure and function of a broad variety of anaerobic wastewater treatment systems described in this thesis has been used to improve insight of the ecophysiology in such reactors. Some general commonalities of anaerobic systems have been found, but also system-specific characteristics. This provides potential identification of general and system-specific indicator populations, allowing improved diagnostics and reactor predictability...|$|E

Due to its non biodegradable nature it cannot be easily disposed off. So, nowadays new technology {{is being used to}} treat the waste plasic. One of such process is pyrolysis. This paper describes non catalytic pyrolysis and catalytic cracking of plastic wastes into useful gasoline range hydrocarbons. Under the pyrolytic and cracking conditions the plastic wastes can be decomposed into three fractions: gas, liquid and solid residue. Here the main consideration is the recovery of liquid products which are composed of higher boiling point hydrocarbons. The waste plastics consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE) was pyrolyzed in this study. Pyrolysis appears to be a technique that is able to reduce a bulky, high <b>polluting</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> while producing energy and/or valuable chemical compounds. The pyrolysis of plastic wastes produces a whole spectrum of hydrocarbons including paraffins, olefins, naphthalenes and aromatics. By catalytic cracking more aromatics and naphthene in the range of C 6 -C 8 which are valuable gasoline range hydrocarbons can be produced. Different catalysts like Silica Alumina, Modernite and Activated Carbon were used for catalytic cracking. The catalysts were used in different ratios with feed to find out the optimum range at which maximum yield occurs. The liquid product yield is about 60 % in all the cases. In thermal pyrolysis, the product obtained gets solidified but in catalytic cracking good liquid product can be obtained which can be used as fuel.

40|$|International audienceTreatment of <b>polluted</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> {{is one of}} the {{challenging}} research topics that occupy an important position in various chemical processes. Among the various types of processes which can be used for treating aqueous wastes polluted with organic matter, the biological and chemical treatments, as well as the incineration are the most commonly used techniques. Each of the mentioned techniques can be used separately or combined with other procedures in order to optimise the global operating conditions. The choice of the process depends upon the nature of the waste and its final destination. Although, the operating cost is an important factor which determines the possibility to exploit the process in large scale. Wet air oxidation is a destructive technology based upon the oxidation of organic and inorganic pollutants in aqueous solutions. The system uses molecular oxygen or air as a potential source of oxidant. Wet air oxidation can be either a non-catalysed process or can occur in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. Destruction of Methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (MTBE) is a research subject of growing concern since the recognition of this compound as an environmental pollutant. MTBE is commonly added to gasoline as an octane enhancer and has been used for the last two decades. It is highly soluble in water and transports easily in ground and surface water. As a result, it is found frequently in groundwater and some surface water. We have focused our research on the catalytic decomposition of this compound using a wet air oxidation process. Some typical results are presented, pointing out the most important parameters of the process and showing the specific behaviour of a Ruthenium/Cerium catalyst during the oxidation of MTBE. The main part of the process consists of one fixed bed tubular reactor centred in an electrical automated oven. The substrate mixed to pure oxygen is oxidised over the catalyst bed and the emergent effluent is therefore cooled into a condenser thus liquid and gas phases could be separated hereafter. Catalysts are prepared by co-impregnation process of metallic chloride precursors (RuCl 3. H 2 O and CeCl 3. 7 H 2 O) onto commercial alumina (Merck-Prolabo; BET = 331 m²/g) support commonly used in the industrial catalytic processes. Therefore, catalysts are calcinated at 450 °C under airflow in order to remove impurities at the surface, then reduced at the same temperature under pure hydrogen flow for 3 hours. Feed solution of MTBE giving 2500 ppm of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) was prepared in distilled water. The oxidation runs have been carried out at 150 °C under 2 bar of pure oxygen pressure during 3 hours. The catalyst presenting 3 % of Cerium concentration showed the best result regarding the abatement of COD and TOC (Total Organic Carbon). Higher concentrations of cerium have negative effects on the oxidation reaction. This could be explained by the presence of chlorine which inhibits the active metallic sites. AOSC (Average Oxidation State of Carbon) has been calculated according to the measured COD and TOC values. Here again, the optimal oxidation state was obtained with the catalyst of 3 % of Cerium concentration...|$|R
