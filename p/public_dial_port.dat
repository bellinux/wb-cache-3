40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaBoth AT&T and GSAT are {{presently}} using the COMSTAR {{to expand and}} diversify their domestic <b>public</b> <b>dial</b> telephone networks. COMSAT General’s TTC&M earth station facilities at Southbury, Connecticut, and Santa Paula California, continuously monitor {{the status of the}} COMSTARs. For the purpose of increasing the likelihood of availability and maximizing the number of communications transponders to the users, {{at the end of the}} spacecraft design lifetime, COMSAT General was able to reach a business agreement with AT&T and obtain FCC authorization to launch COMSTAR D- 4 and colocate D- 1 and D- 2. Therefore, as far as the communications earth stations are concerned, colocated D- 1 and D- 2 with a coordinated 24 TWT configuration are technically identical to a single COMSTAR satellite. There is, however, a significant increase in satellite lifetime due to reduced solar array and battery loading (about half) since each satellite now operates with twelve TWTs on instead of the usual twenty-four for a COMSTAR. This paper will describe the TTC&M earth stations’ modification to accommodate the colocated satellites. Operational considerations and some actual operational experience will also be discussed...|$|R

40|$|This Part {{describes}} a mine pager phone to public telephone interconnect sys tem that permits mine paging telephones to be selectively interconnected {{with the public}} telephone system, as illustrated by Figure 1. This interconnect concept was first conceived and demonstrated in breadboard form by H. E. Parkinson of Industrial Hazards and Communications, PMSRC, as one means for providing improved emergency and off-hours communications. The third-generation prototype unit described in this Part was designed and fabricated by Arthur D. Little, Inc. This unit is a small desk-top or wall-mounted unit that connects directly to both the public telephone line and the mine pager phone line, and requires no modifications to either the <b>public</b> <b>dial</b> telephone or mine pager phones. As part of this task, ADL also built, under a very compressed time schedule, a second-generation prototype unit suitable for reliable demonstration of the interconnect concept during the Bureau's technology transfer seminar on mine communications in March 1973. * A major objective of {{the design of the}} third-generation unit described in this Part was that it be compatible with present mine pager phone systems utilizing DC voltage on the mine phone line to activate the phone loudspeakers. Therefore, this unit was designed to operate in a push- to-talk, push-to-listen mode that accommodates the inherent design differences and operation modes of the mine phones of different manufacturers. Though this push- to- talk, push- to-listen mode of operation may seem slightly unusual at first sight, we have found it is easily learned by new users. However, mine phone manufacturers wishing to expand their product lines with such an interconnect system will probably find it to their advantage to customize the design of this system to their particular mine phones, thereby utilizing the unique attributes offered by their individual product lines. This customization should not be difficult, and Section III below suggests some of the features that can be easily added to future designs. Detailed parts lists and circuit schematics for the present third-generation proto- type system can be obtained from the system manual submitted to PMSRC and placed on public file...|$|R
5000|$|The {{attendant}} console {{may also be}} sent other calls that the PBX may not otherwise know how to handle, such as direct inward dialed calls that are not associated with a valid extension. The {{attendant console}} typically has no restrictions about the types of calls that may be made from it so the attendant may complete calls for restricted extensions. This is typically the case where a phone is placed in a public location, such as a lobby, but is set up so that it cannot dial long distance or international calls. Callers using the <b>public</b> phone must <b>dial</b> the attendant, who can complete the call for them.|$|R

50|$|It is the Public Distress Response {{system which}} uses GSM, Wireless Media, and Computer based Command and control from Police control room, {{multiple}} vehicle mount terminals and GIS based navigation and guidance. On receipt of complaint / grievance from <b>public</b> by <b>Dial</b> 100 to Control Room, an incident report is generated and {{is transferred to}} the dispatcher electronically in real time. The wireless operator/dispatcher assesses the incident report along with all details of complaint, address, telephone number and scene of crime and GIS map (Digital Map) of the city / locality to help dispatcher to see the address on the map for the incident. GPS based Vehicle tracking system displays the real time availability of the PCR(Police Control Room) vehicles which will respond to the emergency call. The dispatcher based on above information will instantaneously transfer the incident report to the identified Patrol van on to its Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) for attending to the emergency and the system enables the dispatcher to monitor the patrol van in real time on his computer. After successfully attending the emergency calls the system /dispatcher closes the event. The calls handled by the Police control room are fully monitored and stored in computer systems to facilitate the response process to be computerized.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Billimoria created Childline India Foundation, a 24-hour {{emergency}} telephone service for children, {{based on her}} work with children {{living on the streets}} of India. Eventually all phones available for <b>public</b> use could <b>dial</b> Childline toll free in order to help children find aid in places where an emergency shelter may not be located. In June 1998, Childline held an event, inviting the government and other people from 29 different cities in India to help spread the Childline phone service. Anand Bordia, joint secretary of India's Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, had been in contact with Billimoria about expanding Childline across the country. Following the presentation, Bordia, along with A. P. Singh, deputy secretary of the Ministry of Justice and Social Empowerment, offered to help expand Childline to ten cities. A month later, Maneka Gandhi, India's minister of social justice and empowerment, talked to Billimoria, stating that Childline should be expanded further, offering service to children in all of India's largest cities (totaling more than 1 million in population). In 2002, Childline had expanded to 43 cities in India, with 12 more soon to be added.|$|R
5000|$|The Local Access Alert {{was used}} by local law {{enforcement}} agencies and emergency management staff, and it's much like the antiquated Emergency Broadcast System. A <b>public</b> servant would <b>dial</b> up a number and PIN through a phone {{to take control of}} a certain cable city or cluster in the path of danger. Once the number and PIN are entered, it switches all cable subscribers, regardless of what channel they're on, to a black screen or static and uses a distinct attention signal (in this case, a siren). Police or emergency management then let viewers know of an impending disaster and instructs them to take shelter or evacuate. The more modern systems had a black screen with the words [...] "Local Access Alert" [...] in all capital letters. The problem with the Local Access Alert system is that the operators would have to dial out to end transmission. Simply hanging up the phone connected to such system after an emergency broadcast would not work, and sometimes viewers would hear other phone noises (examples: off-hook and/or a dial tone) before finally being switched back to normal cable operations.|$|R
60|$|With {{regard to}} the more {{important}} part of your letter, I am under many difficulties. I am writing from a window which gives me a view of a little boat, gliding quietly about upon the surface of our basin of a lake. I should {{like to be in}} it, but what could I do with such a vessel {{in the heart of the}} Atlantic Ocean? As this boat would be to that navigation, so is my letter to the subject upon which you would set me afloat. Let me, however, say, that I have read your sermon (which I lately received from Longman) with much pleasure; I only gave it a cursory perusal, for since it arrived our family has been in great confusion, we having removed to another house, in which we are not yet half settled. The Appendix I had received before in a frank, and of that I feel myself more entitled to speak, because I had read it more at leisure. I am entirely of accord with you in chiefly recommending religious books for the poor; but of many of those which you recommend I can neither speak in praise nor blame, as I have never read them. Yet, as far as my own observation goes, which has been mostly employed upon agricultural persons in thinly-peopled districts, I cannot find that there is much disposition to read among the labouring classes, or much occasion for it. Among manufacturers and persons engaged in sedentary employments, it is, I know, very different. The labouring man in agriculture generally carries on his work either in solitude or with his own family--with persons whose minds he is thoroughly acquainted with, and with whom he is under no temptation to enter into discussions, or to compare opinions. He goes home from the field, or the barn, and within and about his own house he finds a hundred little jobs which furnish him with a change of employment which is grateful and profitable; then comes supper, and bed. This for week-days. For sabbaths, he goes to church with us often or mostly twice a day; on coming home, some one turns to the Bible, finds the text, and probably reads the chapter whence it is taken, or perhaps some other; and in the afternoon the master or mistress frequently reads the Bible, if alone; and on this day the mistress of the house almost always teaches the children to read, or as they express it, hears them a lesson; or if not thus employed, they visit their neighbours, or receive them in their own houses as they drop in, and keep up by the hour a slow and familiar chat. This kind of life, of which I have seen much, and which I know would be looked upon with little complacency by many religious persons, is peaceable, and as innocent as (the frame of society and the practices of government being what they are) we have a right to expect; besides, it is much more intellectual than a careless observer would suppose. One of our neighbours, who lives as I have described, was yesterday walking with me; and as we were pacing on, talking about indifferent matters, by the side of a brook, he suddenly said to me, with great spirit and a lively smile, 'I like to walk where I can hear the sound of a beck!' (the word, as you know, in our dialect for a brook). I cannot but think that this man, without being conscious of it, has had many devout feelings connected with the appearances which have presented themselves to him in his employment as a shepherd, and that the pleasure of his heart at that moment was an acceptable offering to the Divine Being. But to return to the subject of books. I find among the people I am speaking of, halfpenny ballads and penny and two-penny histories in great abundance; these are often bought as charitable tributes to the poor persons who hawk them about (and it is the best way of procuring them). They are frequently stitched together in tolerably thick volumes, and such I have read; some of the contents, though not often religious, very good; others objectionable, either for the superstition in them, such as prophecies, fortune-telling, &c., or more frequently for indelicacy. I have so much felt the influence of these straggling papers, that I have many a time wished that I had talents to produce songs, poems, and little histories that might circulate among other good things in this way, supplanting partly the bad flowers and useless herbs, and to take place of weeds. Indeed, some of the poems which I have published were composed, not without a hope that at some time or other they might answer this purpose. The kind of library which you recommend would not, I think, for the reasons given above, be of much direct use in any of the agricultural districts of Cumberland and Westmoreland with which I am acquainted, though almost every person here can read; I mean of general use as to morals or behaviour. It might, however, with individuals, do much in awakening enterprise, calling forth ingenuity, and fostering genius. I have known several persons who would eagerly have sought, not after these books merely, but any books, and would have been most happy in having such a collection to repair to. The knowledge thus acquired would also have spread, by being dealt about in conversation among their neighbours, at the door, and by the fire-side; so that it is not easy to foresee how far the good might extend; and harm I can see none which would not be greatly overbalanced by the advantage. The situation of manufacturers is deplorably different. The monotony of their employments renders some sort of stimulus, intellectual or bodily, absolutely necessary for them. Their work is carried on in clusters,--men from different parts of the world, and perpetually changing; so that every individual is constantly in the way of being brought into contact with new notions and feelings, and being unsettled in his own accordingly; a select library, therefore, in such situations may be of the same use as a <b>public</b> <b>dial,</b> keeping everybody's clock in some kind of order.|$|R
40|$|The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) {{represents}} {{the new generation}} of local area networks (LANs). These high speed LANs are capable of supporting up to 500 users over a 100 km distance. User traffic is expected to be as diverse as file transfers, packet voice and video. As the proliferation of FDDI LANs continues, the need to interconnect these LANs arises. FDDI LAN interconnection can be achieved in a variety of different ways. Some of the most commonly used today are <b>public</b> data networks, <b>dial</b> up lines and private circuits. For applications that can potentially generate large quantities of traffic, such as an FDDI LAN, it is cost effective to use a private circuit leased from the public carrier. In order to send traffic from one LAN to another across the leased line, a routing algorithm is required. Much research has been done on the Bellman-Ford algorithm and many implementations of it exist in computer networks. However, due to its instability and problems with routing table loops it is an unsatisfactory algorithm for interconnected FDDI LANs. A new algorithm, termed ISIS which is being standardized by the ISO provides a far better solution. ISIS will be implemented in many manufacturers routing devices. In order to make the work as practical as possible, this algorithm will be used as the basis for all the new algorithms presented. The ISIS algorithm can be improved by exploiting information that is dropped by that algorithm during the calculation process. A new algorithm, called Down Stream Path Splits (DSPS), uses this information and requires only minor modification to some of the ISIS routing procedures. DSPS provides a higher network performance, with very little additional processing and storage requirements. A second algorithm, also based on the ISIS algorithm, generates a massive increase in network performance. This is achieved by selecting alternative paths through the network in times of heavy congestion. This algorithm may select the alternative path at either the originating node, or any node along the path. It requires more processing and memory storage than DSPS, but generates a higher network power. The final algorithm combines the DSPS algorithm with the alternative path algorithm. This is the most flexible and powerful of the algorithms developed. However, it is somewhat complex and requires a fairly large storage area at each node. The performance of the new routing algorithms is tested in a comprehensive model of interconnected LANs. This model incorporates the transport through physical layers and generates random topologies for routing algorithm performance comparisons. Using this model it is possible to determine which algorithm provides the best performance without introducing significant complexity and storage requirements...|$|R
