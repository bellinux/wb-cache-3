25|$|Later exchanges {{consisted}} {{of one to}} several hundred plug boards staffed by switchboard operators. Each operator {{sat in front of}} a vertical panel containing banks of ¼-inch tip-ring-sleeve (3-conductor) jacks, each of which was the local termination of a subscriber's telephone line. In front of the jack panel lay a horizontal panel containing two rows of <b>patch</b> <b>cords,</b> each pair connected to a cord circuit.|$|E
25|$|Electronic analog {{computers}} {{typically have}} front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) {{to create the}} interconnections which define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there {{is likely to be}} a zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes.|$|E
25|$|Tangerine Dream's {{earliest}} concerts were visually simple {{by modern}} standards, with three men sitting motionless for hours alongside massive electronic boxes festooned with <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> {{and a few}} flashing lights. Some concerts were even performed in complete darkness as happened during the performance at York Minster, 20 October 1975. As time went on and technology advanced, the concerts became much more elaborate, with visual effects, lighting, lasers, pyrotechnics, and projected images. By 1977 their North American tour featured full-scale Laserium effects.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure that}} {{specifications}} are met over FDDI-grade, OM1 and OM2 fibers, the transmitter should be coupled through a mode conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> No mode conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> {{is required for}} applications over OM3 or OM4.|$|R
50|$|Armored {{fiber optic}} <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> uses {{flexible}} {{stainless steel tube}} inside the outer jacket as the armor to protect the fiber glass inside. It retains all the features of standard <b>patch</b> <b>cord,</b> but is much stronger. It will not get damaged even if stepped by an adult and they are rodent-resistant.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{conventional}} to {{have the}} top row of jacks wired at the rear to outputs and bottom row of jacks wired to inputs. Patch bays may be half-normal (usually bottom) or full-normal, [...] "normal" [...] indicating that {{the top and bottom}} jacks are connected internally. When a patch bay has bottom half-normal wiring, then with no <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> inserted into either jack, the top jack is internally linked to the bottom jack via break contacts on the bottom jack; inserting a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> into the top jack will take a feed off that jack while retaining the internal link between the two jacks; inserting a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> into the bottom jack will break the internal link and replace the signal feed from the top jack with the signal carried on the <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> With top half-normal wiring, the same happens but vice versa. If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes break contacts in both rows of jacks.|$|R
2500|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform sequences and loops of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square-root, input/output functions, and conditional branches. [...] Programming was initially accomplished with <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> and switches, and reprogramming took days. [...] It was redesigned in 1948 to allow the use of stored programs with some loss in speed.|$|E
2500|$|Educational analog {{computers}} {{illustrated the}} principles of analog calculation. The Heathkit EC-1, a $199 educational analog computer, {{was made by the}} Heath Company, USA c. 1960. It was programmed using <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> that connected nine operational amplifiers and other components. General Electric also marketed an [...] "educational" [...] analog computer kit of a simple design in the early 1960s consisting of a two transistor tone generator and three potentiometers wired such that the frequency of the oscillator was nulled when the potentiometer dials were positioned by hand to satisfy an equation. The relative resistance of the potentiometer was then equivalent to the formula of the equation being solved. Multiplication or division could be performed depending on which dials were considered inputs and which was the output. Accuracy and resolution was limited and a simple slide rule was more accurate; however, the unit did demonstrate the basic principle.|$|E
5000|$|A {{patch cable}} or patch cord or patch lead is an {{electrical}} or optical cable used to connect ("patch in") one electronic or optical device to another for signal routing. Devices {{of different types}} (e.g., a switch connected to a computer, or a switch to a router) are connected with <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> <b>Patch</b> <b>cords</b> are usually produced in many different colors {{so as to be}} easily distinguishable, and are relatively short, perhaps no longer than two metres. Types of <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> include microphone cables, headphone extension cables, XLR connector, Tiny Telephone (TT) connector, RCA connector and ¼" [...] TRS phone connector cables (as well as modular Ethernet cables), and thicker, hose-like cords (snake cable) used to carry video or amplified signals. However, <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> typically refer only to short cords used with patch panels.|$|E
50|$|Bend {{insensitive}} fiber <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> {{is widely}} used in FTTH. The fiber is not sensitive to stress and bending. Singlemode bend insensitive fibers include G657A1, G657A2, G657B2, and G657B3.|$|R
50|$|For MMF {{links the}} WDM output {{needs to be}} coupled through a SMF offset-launch mode-conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> This is {{explained}} in subclauses 53.6 and 38.11.4 of the IEEE 802.3 spec.|$|R
50|$|Mode Conditioning <b>Patch</b> <b>Cord</b> is {{required}} where Gigabit 1000 Base-LX and 10GBASE-LRM routers and switches are installed into existing multimode cable plants.

50|$|The {{birth of}} {{progressive}} rock roughly {{coincided with the}} commercial availability of synthesizers. Early modular synthesizers were large instruments that used <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to route the signal flow. Programming the instruments meant placing the <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to connect the individual modules. The Minimoog, a smaller, simplified synthesizer that needed no <b>patch</b> <b>cords,</b> began production in 1971 and provided keyboardists with a more-easily programmed instrument that could imitate other instruments, could create new sounds of its own, and was highly portable and affordable. Progressive rock was the genre in which the synthesizer first became established as a common part of popular music. Synthesizers {{could be used to}} play the rapid, virtuosic lines that changed the perception of keyboard instruments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Patch</b> <b>cords</b> are {{classified}} by transmission medium (long or short distance), by connector construction and by {{construction of the}} connector's inserted core cover.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after Mickey, Worlds of Wonder {{created an}} {{animated}} Goofy to sit aside Mickey.

50|$|The GigaBIX {{system is}} {{primarily}} {{made up of}} mounts and connectors. The Patch Cord topology utilizes GigaBIX PS6+ <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> which are 4 pair 23-AWG UTP cords with a channel bandwidth of 250 MHz or 300 MHz, depending on how they are employed. These <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> are typically used with the and the Cross-Connect topology utilizes GigaBIX cross-connect wire. Both topologies utilize the same mounts, connectors, distribution frames, and other accessories (such as designation strips, wire guards, covers, distribution rings, and many other accessories).|$|E
50|$|A {{patch cable}} is an {{electrical}} or optical cable used to connect one electronic or optical device to another or to building infrastructure for signal routing. Devices {{of different types}} (e.g. a switch connected to a computer, or a switch connected to a router) are connected with <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> <b>Patch</b> <b>cords</b> are usually produced in many different colors {{so as to be}} easily distinguishable, and most are relatively short, no longer than a few meters. In contrast to on-premises wiring, patch cables are more flexible but may also be less durable.|$|E

50|$|A {{fiber optic}} <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> is {{constructed}} from a core {{with a high}} refractive index, surrounded by a coating with a low refractive index, that is strengthened by aramid yarns and surrounded by a protective jacket. Transparency of the core permits transmission of optic signals with little loss over great distances. The coating's low refractive index reflects light back into the core, minimizing signal loss. The protective aramid yarns and outer jacket minimizes physical damage to the core and coating.|$|R
5000|$|Like the {{electric}} guitar, {{the electric}} bass guitar {{is almost always}} connected to an amplifier and a speaker with a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> for live performances. Electric bassists use either a [...] "combo" [...] amplifier, which combines an amplifier and a speaker in a single cabinet, or an amplifier and one or more speaker cabinets (typically stacked, with the amplifier sitting on the speaker cabinets, leading to the term [...] "half-stack" [...] for one cabinet setups and [...] "full stack" [...] for two).|$|R
50|$|FTTO is {{a hybrid}} network {{involving}} fibre optic cabling (pre-terminated or extractable cables) and copper twisted pair <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> with 8P8C connectors. In an FTTO environment, fibre is laid up vertically {{from the central}} distribution switch right to the office floor, where it runs horizontally to active FTTO switches at the users' workplaces. The final distance of 3-5 m to the end user desk is bridged using standard 8P8C twisted pair <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> There are only two network levels: the core and the access with no aggregation or distribution level in between compared to traditional structured cabling networks.|$|E
50|$|Matrix systems use pin matrixes {{or other}} {{crosspoint}} switches rather than <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> Historic examples with pin matrixes include the EMS Synthi 100, EMS VCS-3, ETI International 4600, Maplin 5600. The ARP 2500 used a matrix switch.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{flexible}} cords with plugs at their ends and sockets (jacks) to make temporary connections {{dates back to}} cord-type manually operated telephone switchboards (if not even earlier, possibly for telegraph circuits). Cords with plugs at both ends had been used for many decades {{before the advent of}} Moog's synthesizers to make temporary connections (patches) in such places as radio and recording studios. These became known as <b>patch</b> <b>cords,</b> and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{single-mode}} laser {{launch into}} the center of a multimode fiber can generate multiple signals that confuse the receiver {{at the other end of}} the fiber. These multiple signals, caused by Differential Mode Delay (DMD) effects, limit the system distance lengths for operating Gigabit Ethernet. Mode Conditioning <b>Patch</b> <b>Cord</b> eliminates these multiple signals by aligning the single-mode launch away from the center of a multimode fiber core. This offset launch creates a transmitted signal that is similar to typical multimode light emitting diode (LED) launches.|$|R
50|$|NORDX/CDT {{developed}} the GigaBIX IDC-based {{system with a}} transmission performance thatgoes beyond the Category-6 standard and is available in two topologies: the <b>Patch</b> <b>Cord</b> topology and the Cross-Connect Wire topology. It {{is based on the}} mature BIX technology, which is over 25 years old and well-established in the telecommunications industry. The termination and installation procedures have been improved, allowing the quality of the system to surpass Category-6. The system guarantees channel bandwidths up to 300 MHz, and can transmit data up to 4.8 Gbit/s.|$|R
5000|$|... 1000BASE-LX {{can also}} run over all common types of {{multi-mode}} fiber {{with a maximum}} segment length of 550 m. For link distances greater than 300 m, {{the use of a}} special launch conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> may be required. This launches the laser at a precise offset {{from the center of the}} fiber which causes it to spread across the diameter of the fiber core, reducing the effect known as differential mode delay which occurs when the laser couples onto only a small number of available modes in multi-mode fiber.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} cables {{are used to}} carry {{electrical}} signals in sound recording studios and with electronic or electrical musical instruments. Microphones are typically connected to mixing boards or PA systems with XLR microphone cables which use three-pin XLR connectors. A huge range of electric or electronic instruments use 1/4 inch mono <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to connect the instrument to the amplifier, such as the electric guitar, electric bass, synthesizer, electric piano, or electronic drum machine. Musicians playing electric or electronic instruments often use longer cables (from 10 to 20 feet) between their instrument and their amplifier, and then use shorter <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> (from a few inches {{to one or two}} feet long) to connect chains of effects devices, [...] "stomp box" [...] pedals, or other signal processors.|$|E
5000|$|Users create sounds by {{manipulating}} <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> {{to direct the}} signal through the modules above the keyboard. In other words, different combinations of patch cord connections produced different sounds. Through all of the combinations available, the Modular System could produce any popular synthesizer sound in use at the time. Users could also save favored patch sequences using a [...] "firm-wire" [...] patch that connected to the instrument and could be swapped out at any time, recreating sounds without manipulating the <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> The Modular System was known to have a [...] "cleaner" [...] sound that its competitors, although that aspect was not always desired by users. It also had a unique aesthetic, featuring blue-lined modules rather than the traditional black and aluminum panels.|$|E
50|$|A modular {{synthesizer}} has a case or frame {{into which}} arbitrary modules can be fitted; modules are usually connected together using <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> {{and a system}} may include modules from different sources, {{as long as it}} fits the form factors of the case and uses the same electrical specifications.|$|E
50|$|Diamond was {{an early}} (1997) entrant into PC DVD kits with their Maximum DVD 1000DB-VAR (Value Added Reseller) and 2000-RETKIT (RETail KIT). These kits bundled a 'feature reduced' (several pin headers and other parts not installed) full length PCI MPEG2 analog overlay decoder card made by divion. This card {{connected}} to the VGA card with an external passthrough cable, a 3.5mm (1/8") external <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> to the soundcard's line-in jack, and the analog audio cable from the included Toshiba SD-M1002 DVD-ROM drive connected to the divion card while a second cable passed the audio on to the soundcard's internal connector.|$|R
2500|$|Regular {{electronic}} tuners contain {{either an}} input jack for electric instruments (usually a 1/4" [...] <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> input), a microphone, or a clip-on sensor (e.g., a piezoelectric pickup) {{or some combination}} of these inputs. [...] Pitch detection circuitry drives some type of display (an analog needle, an LCD simulated image of a needle, LED lights, or a spinning translucent disk illuminated by a strobing backlight). Some tuners have an output, or through-put, so the tuner can connect 'in-line' from an electric instrument to an instrument amplifier or mixing console. Small tuners are usually battery powered. Many battery powered tuners also have a jack for an optional AC power supply.|$|R
