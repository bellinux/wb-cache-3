5|$|The {{proposed}} scheme covered all six greenhouse gases {{specified in the}} Kyoto Protocol and was intended to progressively apply to all {{sectors of the economy}} including agriculture. 'Participants' (who would account for their emissions) were to be few, and high in the <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> of each sector.

5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, {{in part because of the}} general lack of materials, and in part because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E
40|$|Interlocking {{balance sheets}} through {{accounts}} receivable and accounts payable pro-vides incentives necessary to sustain long <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> We construct {{a model of}} incentives in <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> which has the implication that upstream firms in the chain have higher accounts receivable. Further, the working capital of upstream firms are relatively {{more sensitive to the}} availability of credit. Using a large firm-level dataset for 15 European OECD countries and the United States, 2000 - 2009, combined with sector-level measures of relative position in <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> (“upstreamness”), we find strong empirical support for the model. Lack of credit matters for amplifying recessions in economies with long <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> ∗Preliminary version. Comments are most welcome. ...|$|R

25|$|Contrary to {{electric}} vehicle applications, batteries for stationary storage do not suffer from mass or volume constraints. However, {{due to the}} large amounts of energy and power implied, the cost per power or energy unit is crucial. The relevant metrics to assess the interest of a technology for grid-scale storage is the $/Wh (or $/W) rather than the Wh/kg (or W/kg). The electrochemical grid storage was made possible thanks {{to the development of}} the {{electric vehicle}}, that induced a fast decrease in the production costs of batteries below $300/kWh. By optimizing the <b>production</b> <b>chain,</b> major industrials aim to reach $150/kWh by the end of 2020. These batteries rely on a Li-Ion technology, which is suited for mobile applications (high cost, high density). Technologies optimized for the grid should focus on low cost and low density.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{mechanism}} that links industry’s technological characteristics (i. e. quality of non-labor inputs, which is proxied by {{the length of}} industry <b>production</b> <b>chains),</b> industry-specific skill wage premium, and skill sorting across industries. It is hypothesized that high-skilled workers are sorted into industries where they can receive a higher skill wage premium, by working with better quality non-labor input. The quality of non-labor inputs {{is assumed to be}} worse in industries with longer <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> due to the increased involvement of low-skilled labor and poor infrastructure over the sequential production. By examining Indian wage and employment data for 1999 - 2000, empirical evidence to support this mechanism can be obtained: First, the skill wage premium is lower [higher] in industries with longer [shorter] <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> Second, the skill wage premium is lower [higher] in industries with a higher [lower] proportion of low-skilled workers producing inputs outside their own industry. Third, the proportion of high-skilled workers is larger in industries with shorter <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> and lower ratio of low-skilled labor involved, i. e., a skill sorting trend can be observed...|$|R
2500|$|The EC {{decided to}} request governments, {{industry}} and NGO's {{to set up}} voluntary schemes to certify biofuel sustainability {{for all types of}} biofuels, including those imported into the EU. [...] According to the EC, the overall majority of biofuels are produced in the EU, and for 2007, only 26% of biodiesel and 31% of bioethanol consumed in the EU was imported, mainly from Brazil and the United States. The Commission set standards that must be met for these schemes to gain EU recognition. One of the main criteria is that the certification scheme must be interdependently audited and fraud-resistant. Auditors must check the whole <b>production</b> <b>chain,</b> from the farmer and mill to the filling station (well-to-wheel life cycle). Auditors must check all the paper and inspect a sample of the farmers, mills and traders, and also whether the land where the feedstock for the ethanol is produced has been indeed farm land before and not a tropical forest or protected area. [...] The certificates are to guarantee that all the biofuels sold under the label are sustainable and produced under the criteria set by the Renewable Energy Directive. Several private certification systems originally designed for sustainability more generally have adapted their standards to qualify for recognition under the Renewable Energy Directive, including the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials and Bonsucro.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} the different comparative advantages of two emerging economic giants, China and India, {{in relation to}} the different skill distribution patterns in each country. By utilizing industry export data on China and India from 1983 to 2000, we find that a country with a greater dispersion of skills (i. e., India, especially in the earlier years) has higher exports in industries with shorter <b>production</b> <b>chains,</b> whereas a country with a more equal dispersion of skills (i. e., China, especially in the later years) is found to have higher exports in industries with longer <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> The causal relationship is fairly robust across different specifications. This empirical evidence supports our assumption that the likely mechanism for these results is the negative impact of low-skilled workers on input quality, which accumulates and becomes larger as the length of <b>production</b> <b>chains</b> and the proportion of low-skilled workers in the economy increase.
