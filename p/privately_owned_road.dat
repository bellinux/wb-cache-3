5000|$|Sharper Security: A Sovereign Security Company Novel, part of {{a series}} by Thomas Sewell, is [...] "set a couple of decades into the near-future with a liberty view of society based on {{individual}} choice and free market economics" [...] and features a society where individuals hire a security company to protect and insure them from crime. The security companies are sovereign, but customers are free to switch between them. They behave as a combination of insurance/underwriting and para-military police forces. Anarcho-capitalist themes abound, including an exploration of not honoring sovereign immunity, <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> <b>road</b> systems, a laissez faire market and competing currencies.|$|E
50|$|Other notable {{aspects of}} United States society include pre-payment before {{emergency}} services can be dispatched, {{the abolition of}} welfare, the complete deregulation of weapons, legalized drugs sold in supermarkets and <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> <b>roads</b> with toll charges.|$|R

5000|$|Knight also famously debated A.C. Pigou {{about social}} costs. He {{also contributed to}} the {{argument}} for toll roads. He said that rather than congestion justifying government tolling of <b>roads,</b> <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> <b>roads</b> would set tolls to reduce congestion to its efficient level. In particular, he developed the argument that forms the basis of analysis of traffic equilibrium, and has since become known as Wardrop's Principle: ...|$|R
50|$|Brynglas Road was {{the first}} road {{to be built in}} the Brynglas area. The houses were <b>privately</b> <b>owned.</b> The <b>road</b> {{originally}} led solely to Brynglas House on top of the hill. Later on, a council estate, Brynglas Drive was added.|$|R
50|$|The Dulles Greenway is a <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> toll <b>road</b> in Northern Virginia, {{running for}} 12.53 miles (20.17 km) {{northwest}} {{from the end}} of the Dulles Toll Road to the Leesburg Bypass (U.S. Route 15/State Route 7). Although <b>privately</b> <b>owned,</b> the highway is also part of SR 267. The speed limit is 55 mph.|$|R
50|$|As a result, until recently, {{the only}} tolls on {{roads in the}} United Kingdom were mainly tolled bridges and tunnels at {{estuaries}} (e.g. Humber Bridge, Severn crossing, Mersey Tunnels and Tyne Tunnel) and some small, <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> toll <b>roads</b> and bridges (for example, in Dulwich College).|$|R
50|$|The Williams {{supports}} resident trout {{as well as}} {{salmon and}} steelhead, but access to the stream is limited. Most of the surrounding land is <b>privately</b> <b>owned,</b> and <b>roads</b> are sometimes blocked by gates. Salmon and steelhead fishing is not allowed on the stream, and other fishing is rated poor.|$|R
50|$|The 13 mi Clifton to Blackpool {{section of}} the A583 was {{formerly}} a <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> toll <b>road</b> <b>owned</b> by the Clifton and De Hoghton estates. The tolls were abolished in 1902, when it became a main road {{as a result of}} an agreement made by Lancashire County Council and Fylde Rural District three years earlier which also saw the construction of new sections of road at Clifton and Blackpool.|$|R
5000|$|In 1932, {{the bridge}} was {{extensively}} rebuilt by GWR. Half the wooden piles were replaced with new creosoted pitch pine. Additional work also included changing the cross members and bracings. The work increased the overall width of the viaduct to 8.5 m.Despite the nationalisation of the [...] "Big Four" [...] British railway companies in 1947, the viaduct remained a <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> toll <b>road</b> for traffic between Penrhyndeudraeth and Harlech.|$|R
40|$|Usually {{transport}} systems, {{and roads}} in particular, {{are viewed as}} public goods. However, {{this is not always}} the case. In Sweden {{a large part of the}} <b>road</b> system is <b>privately</b> <b>owned.</b> Most of these <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> <b>roads</b> are rural roads used by farmers and summer cottage owners, or used for forest transport. The roads are mainly provided by ownership associations. The motivation of this paper is the practical problem of how such an ownership association can dicide the costs for the road netword among the members in a "fair" way. The problem is treated from a game theoretical point of view, making use of the Shapley value. This means that the problem is associated with a game – a mathematical representation of the conflict situation. The Shapley value is a very important solution concept for cooperative games, like tha game in this case. For games corresponding to this specific type of problems, it is shown that the Shapley value has excellent properties, such as being an element of the core, and being very easy to compute.

50|$|The Petroleum Road or Tapline Road (Hebrew: כביש הנפט, Kvish HaNeft) is a <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> north-south asphalt <b>road</b> in the Golan Heights. It is 47 km long. It begins near Mount Peres on {{the east}} edge of the central Golan, and ends in the {{northern}} Golan near the Israeli controlled Golan-Lebanese frontier, nearby Ghajar.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first state}} road was {{authorized}} on March 26, 1895, when a law created {{the post of}} [...] "Lake Tahoe Wagon Road Commissioner" [...] to maintain the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road (the 1852 Johnson's Cut-off of the California Trail), now US 50 from Smith Flat, [...] east of Placerville, to the Nevada state line. The [...] road had been operated as a <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> toll <b>road</b> from about 1855 till 1886, when El Dorado County bought it; the county deeded {{the road to the}} state on February 28, 1896. Funding initially was only enough for minimal improvements, including a stone bridge over the South Fork American River in 1901.|$|R
50|$|The Swift Run Gap Turnpike, a <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> toll <b>road,</b> {{was first}} {{completed}} through Swift Run Gap {{in the early}} 19th century. In the 1840s, plans for the Louisa Railroad (renamed the Virginia Central Railroad in 1850) originally anticipated crossing the Blue Ridge at Swift Run Gap to reach Harrisonburg, but projected construction costs after surveying were prohibitive. This was primarily due to the steepness of the terrain on the eastern slope. Addressing the dilemma, Claudius Crozet, the legendary Chief Engineer of the Virginia Board of Public Works, determined that a system of tunnels at Rockfish Gap, about 30 mi to the south, would be more feasible. Despite later technological advances, no railroad crossing was ever attempted at Swift Run Gap.|$|R
5000|$|The west branch also transported {{pulpwood}} to Millinocket. Log drives initially floated 20- or 24-foot (6.1-7.3 m) [...] "long logs" [...] to the mill. Pulpwood was {{cut into}} shorter 4-foot (1.2 m) lengths beginning in 1917; {{and the last}} [...] "long log" [...] drive was in 1928. As forests within the west branch drainage were converted to pulpwood, GNP built the Eagle Lake and West Branch Railroad and the Seboomook Lake and Saint John Railroad to transport pulpwood from the Allagash and Saint John river drainage basins into the west branch log drives. Environmental concerns ended river transport of pulpwood in 1971 when Great Northern opened the Golden Road (Maine) which parallels the river to the mill in Millinocket. The <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> Golden <b>Road</b> remains the primary road access to the river. The lumber industry has been greatly diminished and the Millinocket mill is being torn down.|$|R
5000|$|The Preserve at Sharp Mountain (also called The Sharp Mountain Preserve) is a nature-based {{community}} {{located near}} Jasper, Georgia in Pickens County. It {{is one of}} three mountain communities in Pickens County, and the only one dedicated to maintaining its natural amenities. There are 12 mi of paved roads running through the community, but the population density is intentionally low (approximately 300 lots over 1600 acre ranging in size from a minimum of 3 acre to a maximum of 37 acres.) The Preserve at Sharp Mountain was named the [...] "Best Community for Outdoor Lovers" [...] by Pinnacle Living magazine, [...] Unlike many planned communities, the Preserve at Sharp Mountain does not have swimming pools and tennis courts with club houses or golf courses. Instead, the Preserve at Sharp Mountain offers many acres of green space, hiking and nature trails, a nature pavilion, waterfalls, a bird sanctuary, a butterfly garden and various nature parks. The community is gated to restrict use of its 12 mi of <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> <b>roads</b> to those living in the community. The Preserve at Sharp Mountain was developed by Four Seasons originally, which later became Naterra Land. [...] Naterra's stated goal in all of its projects is [...] "to better connect people with nature." [...] Naterra Land sold out all of its inventory in the Preserve, and control of the community is now governed by a Property Owners' Association (POA). In 2011, the Preserve Association switched from being an HOA (Home Owners' Association) to being a POA (Property Owners' Association), each being viewed differently under Georgia law. In 2008 the Preserve became a recognized member of the national Firewise [...] communities program {{and is one of the}} 13 in Georgia.|$|R
5000|$|Development of {{the island}} began in the 1960s, but was slow due {{to the absence of}} {{electric}} service and the difficulty on transporting building materials to the island. Commercial electric and phone service was established in the mid 1980s. The island now has about 300 homes built and 300 vacant lots. About half {{of the island}} is owned by the State of Florida and is part of a State Park. All other areas are <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> including the <b>roads.</b> Since the island can be accessed by boat or small plane only, a regular passenger ferry service runs from Pine Island Marina (the [...] "Island Girl" [...] charter service) at two-hour intervals, serving both tourists and locals.

50|$|<b>Privately</b> <b>owned</b> {{public space}} (POPS), or alternatively, <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> public open spaces (POPOS), are terms used to {{describe}} a type of public space that, although <b>privately</b> <b>owned,</b> is legally required {{to be open to}} the public under a city's zoning ordinance or other land-use law. The acronym POPOS is preferentially used over POPS on the west coast of the US. Both terms can be used to represent either a singular or plural space or spaces. These spaces are usually the product of a deal between cities and private real estate developers in which cities grant valuable zoning concessions and developers provide in return <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> public spaces in or near their buildings. <b>Privately</b> <b>owned</b> public spaces commonly include plazas, arcades, small parks, and atriums. Many cities worldwide, including Auckland, New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Seoul, and Toronto, have <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> public spaces. Some cities and advocacy groups have created websites about these spaces (see, for example, apops.mas.org).|$|R
