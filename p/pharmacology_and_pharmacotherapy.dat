5000|$|<b>Pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> (like {{health care}} generally) are universally {{relevant}} around the world, making translingual communication about them an important goal. An interlingual perspective is thus useful in drug nomenclature. The WHO issues INNs in English, Latin, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese. A drug's INNs are often cognates across {{most or all}} of the languages, but they also allow small inflectional, diacritic, and transliterational differences that are usually transparent and trivial for nonspeakers (as is true of most international scientific vocabulary). For example, although paracetamolum (la) has an inflectional difference from paracetamol (en), and although paracétamol (fr) has a diacritic difference, the differences are trivial; users can easily recognize the [...] "same word". And although парацетамол (ru) and paracetamol (en) have a transliterational difference, they sound similar, and for Russian speakers who can recognize Latin script or English speakers who can recognize Cyrillic script, they look similar; users can recognize the [...] "same word". Thus INNs make medicines bought anywhere in the world as easily identifiable as possible to people who do not speak that language. Notably, the [...] "same word" [...] principle allows health professionals and patients who do not speak the same language to communicate to some degree and to avoid potentially life-threatening confusions from drug interactions.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> {{education}} is being increasingly integrated in medical curricula, which {{might lead to}} a specific loss of knowledge in these subjects. This, in turn, could lead to harmful prescribing errors, especially in vulnerable older patients. METHODS: Teachers who coordinated education in Dutch medical schools completed a structured interview on (geriatric) <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> education. A list of core learning goals was developed. <b>Pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> education in general was compared to geriatric <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> education. RESULTS: All Dutch medical schools participated. Contact hours for education in <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> ranged from 39 to 107 h; ECTSs (representing 28 study hours) ranged from 0 to 3. The various curricula covered, on average, 79 % of all learning goals for these subjects: knowledge 85 %, skills 76 %, and attitudes 66 %; the curricula also covered specific geriatric goals: knowledge 87 % and skills 65 %. All geriatric learning goals were met if a geriatrician was among the coordinators. Half (4 of 8) of the medical schools lacked appropriate assessment procedures. Evaluation was mostly based on students' opinions. Teachers rated students as being moderately well prepared for daily practice. CONCLUSIONS: There are large differences in {{the quantity and quality of}} (geriatric) <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> education in Dutch medical schools. In general, more time should be devoted to skills and attitude, and the assessment procedures should be optimized with high priority. Other curricula with a problem-based approach might benefit from the points of improvement described in this article...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{differences}} in the <b>pharmacology</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> skills of pharmacists and physicians is vital to optimizing interprofessional collaboration and education. This study investigated these differences and the potential influence of work experience. The <b>pharmacology</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> skills of pharmacists, general practitioners (GPs), and trainees were compared, using a written assessment; 294 participants were included. Overall scores (mean[*]±[*]SD) ranged from 69. 3 %[*]±[*] 6. 5 % to 76. 5 %[*]±[*] 9. 5 % for basic knowledge, 70. 3 %[*]±[*] 10. 8 % to 79. 7 %[*]±[*] 8. 4 % for applied knowledge, and 66. 3 %[*]±[*] 21. 1 % to 84. 7 %[*]±[*] 20. 7 % for pharmacotherapy skills (analysis of variance all P[*] [*]. 05). The GPs scored the lowest for pharmacotherapy skills (P[*]<[*]. 05). More work experience was associated with better knowledge of applied pharmacology among pharmacists (by 2 % per 10 work-years), but with poorer pharmacotherapy skills among pharmacists and GPs (by 3 % and 4 % per 10 work-years, respectively). In conclusion, pharmacists and GPs differ in their knowledge and skills, and these differences become more pronounced with more work experience. In general, pharmacists outperform pharmacist trainees, whereas GP trainees outperform GPs. These differences could be important for interdisciplinary collaboration and education...|$|R

40|$|Irrational {{prescribing}} is {{a global}} problem. Rational prescribing cannot be defined without a method of measurement and a reference standard. The former is now available but the latter needs further development. Proven effective interventions to promote rational prescribing in developed countries are treatment protocols based on wide consultation and consensus, properly introduced and with a possibility of feedback; face-to-face education focussed on a particular prescribing problem in selected individuals; structured order forms; and focussed educational campaigns. Essential drugs lists are probably effective when based on consensus and used within a comprehensive educational programme. Printed materials alone are not effective. In most cases the usefulness of such strategies in developing countries has not been proven and should be studied. Medical education in clinical <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> {{should be based on}} the practical needs of future prescribes, should include the principles of rational therapeutics and problem solving, and should immunize the students against the influences they are likely to encounter in their professional life, such as patient pressure, drug promotion and irrational prescribing by peers.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of real problems into health education {{is seen as}} an effort to prepare future health professionals to meet the challenging demands of the profession, in particular, the provision of quality patient care. The foundation of this methodology {{can be traced back to}} Dewey. The author suggested that students should be presented with real life problems in order to discover the information required to solve them. With the introduction of the Bologna Process in Portugal, the School of Allied Health Sciences of Oporto, saw this opportunity to put in practice Dewey´s axiom. This paper represents a small part in the process of integrating a Case Based, Learner Centered approach to Pharmacotherapy. Since 2008, Pharmacotherapy is no longer taught in a lecture based model. With the implementation of Bologna Process in the Pharmacy Degree, some basic science curricular units maintained their lecture based approach, only to serve as mediators to a more student-centered approach in the applications of knowledge to real life situations. <b>Pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pharmacotherapy,</b> are good examples of this dichotomy.

40|$|Background: Australian {{community}} pharmacists {{are well}} placed to provide medication-related support {{and contribute to}} optimization of outcomes for mental health consumers and their caregivers. However, {{little is known about}} the actual competencies of community pharmacists to provide this care. To determine how graduates are being prepared to competently assist mental health consumers and their caregivers, an exploration of the mental health content of university pharmacy programs that set the foundation for pharmacists' professional roles is needed. Aim: To investigate the mental health content of accredited Australian pharmacy qualifying programs. Method: A review of publically available online profile information for accredited degree programs was conducted, and program coordinators from the 18 accredited pharmacy degree programs providers in Australia were surveyed. Results: Mental health education is embedded in core subjects such as <b>pharmacology,</b> <b>pharmacotherapy,</b> <b>and</b> pharmacy practice. Multiple options are employed to deliver mental health teaching, including lectures, workshops, and experiential learning. However, while education is intended to align with pharmacists' expected level of professional competencies, there is a lack of national standardized outcome-based competency criteria for new graduates and wide-ranging inter-program variations were evident. Conclusion: A lack of standardized content in pharmacy qualifying programs that underpin pharmacists' mental health knowledge and skills might result in variations to practice competencies. Further work is needed to determine how variations impact the way pharmacists deliver care to mental health consumers and their caregivers...|$|R

40|$|The papers {{presented}} here detail {{the approach to}} provide <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> education at the Leiden University Medical Center. First {{it was decided to}} use the ability-based education model as the educational method and to have consistent outcomes and assessments throughout the curriculum. Pharmacology materials were moved to the TRC Pharmacology Database, a computer self-study program. Students’ acceptance of the Database is demonstrated in their utilization. In effort to measure students’ learning when using the TRC Pharmacology Database, we correlated the students’ time spent using the database and the grade they ultimately achieved in each course. There was no standard model for pharmacotherapy, so a survey of local physicians ability to report a therapeutic plan to one another was done. The results determined the competencies the local physicians most needed to improve to communicate an appropriate therapeutic plan. A new learning strategy was developed for students to address the deficient competencies. Students’ abilities were assessed after repeatedly developing a therapeutic plan using the new learning strategy. Lastly, incorporating initiatives across the curriculum is not easy. Change management skills were used to liaise with colleagues, departments, and committees. Both successful and unsuccessful techniques are presented. Promotores: A. F. Cohen, J. H.

Methods: Using the proposals for competences produced by the previousPHARMINE(Pharmacy education in Europe; www. pharmine. eu) project, together with those of other sources, the authors produced a listof 68 personal and patient care competencies. Using internet surveytools the stakeholders—European pharmacy community (universitydepartment staff and students, community, hospital and industrialpharmacists, as well as pharmacists working in clinical biology andother branches, together with representatives of chambers and associations) —were invited to rank the proposals and add comments. Results and conclusions: <b>Pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> togetherwith competences such as ‘‘supply of appropriate medicinestaking into account dose, correct formulation, concentration, administrationroute and timing’’ ranked high. Other topics such as ‘‘currentknowledge of design, synthesis, isolation, characterisation and biologicalevaluation of active substances’’ ranked lower. Implications for practice: In the short term, it is anticipated that thissurvey will stimulate a productive discussion on pharmacy educationand practice by the various stakeholders.

40|$|Appropriate {{pharmacotherapy}} {{in older}} patients is of increasing importance. Advances {{in medicine and}} pharmacotherapy mean that people with health problems live longer. The longer life expectancy means that health professionals, but particularly physicians, pharmacists, and nurses, will have {{to meet the challenge}} of providing pharmaceutical care to older vulnerable patients. Older patients often have more than one medical problem. This makes appropriate prescribing for curative, preventive and symptomatic treatment goals essential, with polypharmacy as a result. However, there is currently concern about the large number of drug-related problems reported, which appear to especially affect older patients. These problems are thought to be because health professionals lack sufficient knowledge and skills in <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy,</b> possibly because of shortcomings in their education and training. Indeed, {{it has been suggested that}} improving education in geriatric pharmacotherapy might improve the knowledge and skills of health professionals in complex pharmacotherapy, thereby preventing or reducing the number of drug-related problems. ADDIN RW. CITE 328 Topinkova,E. 2012; 316 Members of EMERGE, Erice Medication Errors Research Group 2009; 14 Krahenbuhl-Melcher,A. 2007; 40 van den Bemt,P. M. 2000; 97 Aronson,J.

K. 2009; 321 Cherubini,A. 2012 This thesis presents a series of studies on education in general and geriatric pharmacotherapy, knowledge and skills of health professionals, and educational intervention studies. No high-level evidence-based geriatric pharmacotherapy education was found in the literature. The WHO- 6 -step is proven to be effective for prescribing in general. The general and geriatric <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> education at Dutch medical schools is already constructed quite well. However medical schools need to pay attention to assessment procedures – prescribing without a ‘prescribing examination’ is like driving without a driver’s license, given that it is a high risk task with potentially negative patient outcomes. For prescribing in general, the WHO- 6 -step should be adopted by medical schools worldwide, given the robust evidence supporting its effectiveness. This thesis shows that the effectiveness remains after implementation in a real medical curriculum by a longitudinal learning programme. The STRIP, a medication review method, could be adopted for polypharmacy skills, given the positive results on medical students’ polypharmacy skills and the lack of other evidence-based strategies. It might be worth considering using other clinical methods to achieve educational goals. A start was made to studying interdisciplinary learning between pharmacists and physicians, by identifying the actual knowledge of both professions. Several factors contribute to differences in knowledge and skills of health professionals. Undergraduate training results in more basic pharmacology knowledge for pharmacy students compared to medical students. Medical students had better pharmacotherapy skills and on applying knowledge on patients both groups of students performed equally. In the graduated health professionals, the pharmacists and the physicians, the difference increase with more years of work experience, with the highest scores for pharmacists on all domains of pharmacology and pharmacotherpy knowledge and skills. It is important to realize that the absence of evidence is not evidence for the absence of effect. ADDIN RW. CITE 372 Altman,D. G. 1995 In the field of geriatric pharmacotherapy education, there is a major absence of evidence, which means that teachers and curriculum designers should use the best evidence available.

This study investigated {{whether there are}} differences in the <b>pharmacology</b> <b>and</b> <b>pharmacotherapy</b> knowledge and skills of pharmacy and medical students after their undergraduate training. Differences could serve as a starting point from which to develop joint interdisciplinary educational programmes for better prescribing. METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, the knowledge and skills of advanced pharmacy and medical students were assessed, using a standardized test with three domains (basic pharmacology knowledge, clinical or applied pharmacology knowledge and pharmacotherapy skills) and eight subdomains (pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, interactions and side-effects, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification groups, prescribing, prescribing for special groups, drug information, regulations and laws, prescription writing). RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-one medical and 151 pharmacy students were included between August 2010 and July 2012. The response rate was 81 %. Pharmacy students had better knowledge of basic pharmacology than medical students (77. 0 % vs. 68. 2 % correct answers; P < 0. 001, δ = 0. 88), whereas medical students had better skills than pharmacy students in writing prescriptions (68. 6 % vs. 50. 7 %; P < 0. 001, δ = 0. 57). The two groups of students had similar knowledge of applied pharmacology (73. 8 % vs. 72. 2 %, P = 0. 124, δ = 0. 15). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy students have better knowledge of basic pharmacology, but not of the application of pharmacology knowledge, than medical students, whereas medical students are better at writing prescriptions. Professional differences in knowledge and skills therefore might well stem from their undergraduate education. Knowledge of these differences could be harnessed to develop a joint interdisciplinary education for both students and professionals...|$|E

The WHO- 6 -step-based learning programme improved students' knowledge of basic pharmacology (mean score ± SD, 60. 6 ± 10. 5 % vs. 63. 4 ± 10. 9 %, P < 0. 01) and clinical or applied pharmacology (63. 7 ± 10. 4 % vs. 67. 4 ± 10. 3 %, P < 0. 01), and improved their pharmacotherapy skills (68. 8 ± 26. 1 % vs. 74. 6 % ± 22. 9 %, P 0. 02). Moreover, satisfaction with education increased (5. 7 ± 1. 3 vs. 6. 3 ± 1. 0 on a 10 -point scale, P < 0. 01) and as did students' confidence in daily practice (from - 0. 81 ± 0. 72 to - 0. 50 ± 0. 79 on a - 2 to + 2 scale, P < 0. 01). Conclusions The WHO- 6 -step method was successfully implemented in a medical curriculum. In this observational study, the integrated learning programme had positive effects on students' knowledge of basic and applied pharmacology, improved their pharmacotherapy skills, and increased satisfaction with education and self-confidence in prescribing. Whether this training method leads to better patient care remains to be established...|$|E

Participants: The single-blinded, randomized, controlled study involved 110 adult patients undergoing diagnostic UGE at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hvidovre University Hospital, Denmark. Methods: The patients were randomized to receive either 100 mg lidocaine as a lozenge or 5 mL lidocaine viscous oral solution 2 %. Intravenous midazolam was administered if needed. The effect of a lidocaine lozenge in reducing patient discomfort, including the gag reflex, during UGE compared with a lidocaine oral solution was assessed. Results: Questionnaires from the patients showed that the gag reflex was acceptable for 64 % in the lozenge group compared with 33 % in the oral solution group (P = 0. 0072). UGE was evaluated as acceptable by 69 % in the lozenge group compared with 39 % in the oral solution group (P = 0. 0092). The taste was evaluated as good by 78 % in the lozenge group (P &lt; 0. 0001), and 82 % found the lozenge to have good texture (P &lt; 0. 0001). Conclusion: The lozenge reduced the gag reflex, diminished patients&rsquo; discomfort during UGE, and was evaluated as having a good taste and texture. The lozenge improved patients&rsquo; acceptance of UGE. Keywords: upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, topical pharyngeal anesthetic, lidocaine lozeng...|$|E

Patients and methods: Eighty-six adult, chronic-phase CML patients {{who had been on}} TKI treatment (79 % on imatinib, 10. 5 % dasatinib, and 10. 5 % nilotinib) for at least 6 months participated in the study (mean age: 57. 8 years, 52 % males). The mean time from diagnosis was 5. 1 years. All patients were interviewed, and patient-reported ADRs were obtained using a structured list. Adherence was assessed using Morisky’s 8 -item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). The symptoms’ interference with patient’s daily QoL was measured by asking patients about the influence of symptom(s) on their mood, general condition, enjoyment of life, walking, relationships, and work. Results: Ninety-seven percent of the patients were suffering from at least one ADR. The mean number of different symptoms was seven (range: 0 – 15, median 6). The most commonly perceived ADRs were muscle soreness or cramp (69 / 86, 80 %); swelling of hands, legs, feet, or around the eyes (59 / 86, 69 %); and fatigue (43 / 86, 50 %). No correlation was found between adherence and ADRs, because symptoms were equally common in each MMAS adherence class. Half of the patients felt that the ADRs had a negative influence on their daily QoL. A quarter of the patients reported that ADRs affected either their mood, general condition, or enjoyment of life. The incidence of almost all ADRs was much higher among patients reporting negative influence of ADRs on their daily life compared to total study population (P= 0. 016). Conclusion: TKI-related ADRs were common among CML patients irrespective of patient’s adherence level. Patients who reported that ADRs had a negative influence on their daily QoL perceived more ADRs {{than those who did not}} experience a negative influence.
