This {{was attributed to}} {{the popularity of the}} Fire Emblem series. It was the best-selling Super Famicom game of September. By November the following year, it was reported to be the most popular Nintendo Power title within that period. Combined sales of its Nintendo Power and ROM Cartridge releases reached 106,108 units as of 2002, making Thracia 776 the worst-selling Fire Emblem game at the time.

According to Famitsu, it was the highest-selling Super Famicom release of that year.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after NBC's pick up of Friends, Crane, Kauffman and Bright {{reviewed}} sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced Seinfeld episodes. Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because [...] "When you're 40, you can't do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> out of college." [...] The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for [...] "myriad storylines and give the show legs." [...] The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas. The writers originally planned a big love story between Joey and Monica, as they intended them {{to be the most}} sexual of the characters in the series pitch. The idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script.|$|E
500|$|In {{her book}} American Science Fiction TV, Jan Johnson-Smith noted that [...] "Tuvix" [...] {{is one of}} a {{recurring}} type of Star Trek episodes concerned with issues of individuality and self. [...] She thematically tied this episode to [...] episode [...] "" [...] where the transporter rends Captain Kirk into two separate representations of his psyche, Star Trek: Voyagers episode [...] "" [...] where hybrid Human/Klingon character B'Elanna Torres is split along her bloodline into two separate species, and s character of Jadzia Dax who is of a conjoined species (Trill) that repeatedly goes through a conjoining process when the host organism dies. [...] When asked regarding accusations of [...] "Tuvix" [...] and other Voyager episodes simply aping previous Star Trek series in this way, executive producer Michael Piller called out Time magazine for their comments on the matter before conceding, [...] got to keep new <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> and pitching because otherwise you're going to be retreading an old ground." [...] Seven years later, when writing [...] "", Manny Coto would take pains to write that episode to be dissimilar to [...] "Tuvix".|$|E

500|$|In the 3rd century, {{the pattern}} changed. Emperors became {{more active and}} {{government}} officials began to actively pursue Christians, rather than merely {{to respond to the}} will of the crowd. Christianity, too, changed. No longer were its practitioners merely [...] "the lower orders fomenting discontent"; some Christians were now rich, or from the upper classes. Origen, writing at about 248, tells of [...] "the multitude of <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> to the faith, even rich men and persons in positions of honour, and ladies of high refinement and birth." [...] Official reaction grew firmer. In 202, according to the Historia Augusta, a 4th-century history of dubious reliability, Septimius Severus (r. 193211) issued a general rescript forbidding conversion to either Judaism or Christianity. Maximin (r. 23538) targeted Christian leaders. Decius (r. 24951), demanding a show of support for the faith, proclaimed that all inhabitants of the empire must sacrifice to the gods, eat sacrificial meat, and testify to these acts. Christians were obstinate in their non-compliance. Church leaders, like Fabian, bishop of Rome, and Babylas, bishop of Antioch, were arrested, tried and executed, as were certain members of the Christian laity, like Pionius of Smyrna. The Christian theologian Origen was tortured during the persecution and died about a year after from the resulting injuries.|$|E
500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, so of course the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> and out of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, and he loves it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... to do it to an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{initially}} gained {{interest from}} major terrestrial networks {{such as the}} BBC and ITV. However, Max Beesley and Philip Glenister grew frustrated with the comments from the commissioning teams from the networks. Glenister stated that [...] "the problem with the BBC and ITV is more <b>people</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> and telling you what to do; we are grown up and big enough {{to know where the}} boundaries are". They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted". In January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was [...] "vindicated", as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence, and language. He stated that the restrictions would not make the series [...] "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make". Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was [...] "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary, and funny it is", believing it to be [...] "the perfect show for Sky1". In a separate interview, Beesley stated: [...] "Andy Harries basically put the show out to a few of the networks and Sky said, 'Here's the money, go and make it and we'll give you notes later on, but really do have the freedom to make it,' which is great, and there's not a lot of that happens nowadays." ...|$|E
