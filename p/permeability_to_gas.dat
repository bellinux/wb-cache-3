Similar pressure differences exist across the pit membranes separating gas and sap-filled conduits when cavitation occurs in Rhododendron. It is suggested that cavitation in detached leaves and shoots of Rhododendron occurs when gas penetrates the pit membranes.

40|$|In N 2 -fixing legumes, the {{proportion}} of total electron flow through nitrogenase (total nitrogenase activity, TNA) that is used for N 2 fixation is called the electron allocation coefficient (EAC). Previous studies have proposed that EAC is regulated by the competitive inhibition of H 2 on N 2 fixation and {{that the degree of}} H 2 inhibition can be affected by a nodule's <b>permeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gas</b> diffusion. To test this hypothesis, EAC was measured in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) nodules exposed to various partial pressures of H 2 and N 2, with or without changes in TNA or nodule <b>permeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gas</b> diffusion, and the results were compared with the predictions of a mathematical model that combined equations for gas diffusion and competitive inhibition of N 2 fixation (A. Moloney and D. B. Layzell [1993] Plant Physiol 103 : 421 - 428). The empirical data clearly showed that decreases in EAC were associated with increases in external pH 2, decreases in external pN 2, and decreases in nodule permeability to O 2 diffusion. The model predicted similar trends in EAC, and the small deviations that occurred between measured and predicted values could be readily accounted for by altering {{one or more of the}} following model assumptions: K 1 (H 2) of nitrogenase (range from 2 - 4 % H 2), Km(N 2) of nitrogenase (range from 4 - 5 % N 2), the allocation of less than 100 % of whole-nodule respiration to tissues within the diffusion barrier, and the presence of a diffusion pathway that is open pore versus closed pore. The differences in the open-pore and closed-pore versions of the model suggest that it may be possible to use EAC measurements as a tool for the study of legume nodule diffusion barrier structure and function. The ability of the model to predict EAC provided strong support for the hypothesis that H 2 inhibition of N 2 fixation plays a major role in the in vivo control of EAC and that the presence of a variable barrier to gas diffusion affects the H 2 and N 2 concentration in the infected cell and, therefore, the degree of H 2 inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Permeability {{characterisation}} of low permeability, clay-rich gas sandstones is part {{of production}} forecasting and reservoir management. The physically based Kozeny (1927) equation linking permeability with porosity and pore size is derived for a porous medium with a homogeneous pore size, whereas the pore sizes in tight sandstones can range from nm to μm. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) transverse relaxation was used to estimate a pore size distribution for 63 samples of Rotliegend sandstone. The surface relaxation parameter required to relate NMR to pore size is estimated by combination of NMR and mercury injection data. To estimate which pores control <b>permeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gas,</b> gas permeability was calculated for each pore size increment by using the Kozeny equation. Permeability to brine is modelled by assuming a bound water layer on the mineral pore interface.

With demand {{for oil and gas}} resources increasing, attention is sharply focused on unconventional resources. Much of this attention is directed at tight gas sandstones (Shanley et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2008; Zou 2011). The Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the Western Sichuan Foreland Basin develops abundant gas sources with thick reservoirs, large traps, and good sealing conditions. It is equipped with the gas accumulation conditions for forming large gas field, and has huge exploration potential (Wei et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2009). But the Western Sichuan Foreland Basin experienced complicated tectonic evolution and intense diagenesis. Most of the reservoirs are tight gas sandstones with low porosity, ultralow permeability, well-developed fractures, and great reservoir heterogeneity. All of these made it difficult to identify sand bodies and reservoirs (Qin et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2008).

Consequently, considerable efforts over years have been devoted to discover and improve suitable techniques for measuring gas concentrations by optical fiber sensors. Optical gas sensors consist of a gas-sensitive dye entrapped in a matrix with a high <b>permeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gas.</b> With such sensors, gas concentration is evaluated based upon the reduction in luminescence intensity caused by gas quenching of the emitting state. However, the luminescence quenching effect of oxygen is highly sensitive to temperature. Thus, a simple, low-cost plastic optical fiber sensor for dual sensing of temperature and oxygen is presented.

Assuming the area is covered by a thin, compact dust layer of low <b>permeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gas</b> flow compared to deeper, porous layers, gas can accumulate below the surface when a surge of gas release from amorphous ice occurs upon crystallization. The gas pressure is found to exceed the hydrostatic pressure down {{to a depth of}} a few metres. The rapid build-up of pressure may weaken the already fragile, highly porous structure. Eventually, the high pressure gradient that arises drives the gas out and the pressure falls well below the hydrostatic pressure. The rapid pressure drop may result in collapse. Since the crystallization front lies at some depth below the surface, the location on the orbit when this phenomenon occurs is determined by the thermal lag, which, in turn, depends on the thermal conductivity. Numerical simulations show that mostly such activity occurs post-perihelion, but it may also occur pre-perihelion. When permeability is uniform, crystallization still causes increased gas production, but the gas pressure inside the nucleus remains below hydrostatic pressure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the characterisation of <b>permeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>gas</b> of unsaturated GCLs, with applications in cover liners of municipal solid waste landfills. Conducting such tests at low gas pressure gradient limits the risk of moisture distribution change in the bentonite, which has been observed under high pressure gradients. However, a consequence of a low pressure gradient is a small gas flow rate that is difficult to measure with good accuracy. Therefore a solution may be the use of transient state tests, such as the falling pressure test adapted to GCL permeability characterisation. This paper shows the influence of the main parameters related to the test, and to the material tested (natural or activated calcium bentonite, moisture content, presence or not of small cracks in the bentonite). The results obtained showed good repeatability for gas differential pressures up to 40 kPa for the test conditions employed in this work. The results showed that the gravimetric moisture content of the GCL necessary to attain a certain permeability value depends {{on the nature of the}} bentonite, which was not observed in terms of volumetric moisture content. However, other factors were shown to be more important than the nature of bentonite in GCL permeability to gas: the desiccation due to the gas flow can significantly increase the permeability, which compromises the GCL's performance as a gas barrier...|$|E
