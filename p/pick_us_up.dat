2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision now whether you're going to <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, some ship {{is bound}} to <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> some day," [...] {{returned}} Tom. [...] "And {{if we can find}} enough to live on in the meantime, what is the use of complaining? I am glad my life was spared." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Sticking to {{us like a}} leech," [...] was the terse reply. [...] "She {{is not out of}} any American port. She {{must have}} just <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up.</b> She isn't any {{ordinary}} cargo steamer, either, or she couldn't make the speed." ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Well, {{until they}} miss us, and {{run back to}} <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up,</b> I shall be obliged to ask your indulgence. I will try not to disturb you; I {{would go out and}} stand on the platform, but it's raining." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{of the men}} {{left with}} me was skilled in stone-cutting; and before Sir William {{returned}} to <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up,</b> I had chiselled on a boulder this inscription, {{with a copy of}} which I may fitly bring my narrative to a close: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sooner too, I trust, Wallingford," [...] resumed the father. [...] "These Frenchmen {{can have}} it their own way, {{out here in the}} {{solitude}} of the Pacific; but, once in the Atlantic, I shall expect some British cruiser to <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up,</b> long ere we can reach France." ...|$|E
60|$|He was right. In {{less than}} that time a boat from the Stormy Petrel had <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up,</b> and we were {{standing}} in for land, firing rockets {{all the way to}} announce the news to Lord and Lady St. Maurice. So ended this, the most eventful day of my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "One of the nastiest {{pieces of}} water in the world," [...] he concurred. [...] "Eighteen years ago the Plate gave it to me--lost half our sticks, twenty hours on our beam-ends, cargo shifted, and foundered. I was two days in the boat before an English tramp <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up.</b> And none of the other boats ever was picked up." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was amazing, I was so {{glad when}} {{he agreed to}} do it. I thought I would be intimidated, because it’s Black Francis you know? But it wasn’t, it was amazing. He <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> {{at the airport in}} his car, and he’s just such a {{friendly}} enthusiastic man. It’s hard to be intimidated by him, really, as he’s just a good person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "there'll {{be plenty}} of craft around to <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up.</b> This thing can't sink. Keep the lifebelt on and get your arms through the belt I have tied on to the table, so. That's right. Now {{come over to the}} side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Jacinta, sweetly, [...] "will be your business. You are {{a friend}} of Don Fernando, and he has really a {{comfortable}} house. Still, I expect three days {{of it will be}} quite enough for Mrs. Hatherly. You can <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up,</b> you know, when you come back from Lanzarote." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{make for}} the {{headland}} from there. You see, we shall be outside the Gidney Shallows, and number twelve will <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up.</b> Put all the fishing tackle in the boat, and don't forget the bait. We must never {{lose sight of the}} fact, Jimmy, that the main object of our lives is to catch fish." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{the figures}} were published, Currie said: [...] "In {{the three years}} since {{the launch of the}} Herald on Sunday, the {{newspaper}} has found its voice, attracting new Sunday newspaper buyers to what is the most competitive newspaper market in the country. We owe a huge debt to those who stuck with us in our early days, and to those readers who have <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> for the first time, or more frequently, over the past 12 months. We've listened to what readers liked - and didn't like - and evolved accordingly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, miss; I have sailed in one o' your father's wessels, an' once I {{was washed}} {{overboard}} by a heavy sea, and he flung over a lifebuoy arter me, and {{jumped into the}} water himself to keep me afloat till a boat <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up,</b> for I couldn't swim. Now, look 'ere, miss, if you'll consent to sail under my orders for a short spell, you'll {{have a better chance}} o' doin' your father a sarvice than by returnin' to that nest o' pirates. Moreover, you'll have to make up your mind pretty quick, for we've lost too much time already." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, we must chance that, Hawkins. If {{one does}} come you must <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> {{as we come}} along. I agree with you; it does look as if {{we should have a}} squall. It may not be {{anything}} very serious, but anyhow, if it comes it will take her along a great deal faster than we can row.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is from Dicky!" [...] she exclaimed, glancing {{it through}} quickly,--"Savoy notepaper, too, so I suppose {{he has been}} here. He says {{that he may be}} a few minutes late and that we are not to wait. He will <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> either here or at the theatre. Prince, shall we let these young people follow us? I haven't heard your excuses yet. Do you know that you were {{a quarter of an hour}} late?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} would be a good plan," [...] Jeanne said; [...] "because they might not stop to <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up,</b> and then we might have a long way to reach the shore. No, I think it will be better to stay on board, Harry; for, as you say, if she does have to run away for a time, she is sure to come back again to unload her cargo. But of course do {{whatever}} you think best." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "There were {{frequent}} razzias {{when the}} train taking us to school in Ljubljana from our village of Polje pulled in to the main station.

6000|$|The mail <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> about dusk at the [...] "Royal George" [...] on the heath. I was {{wedged in}} between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, {{and in spite}} of the swift motion and the cold night-air, I must have dozed a great deal from the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage; for when I was awakened, at last, it was by a punch in the ribs, and I opened my eyes, to find that we were {{standing}} still before a large building in a city street, and that the day had already broken a long time.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{we could}} fly with {{her through the}} air, you might get her away, but I see no other way. I have been {{thinking}} it over since you left. With luck we might get her safely out of the bay, but the galleys row four feet to our one, and as they would be sure to send some one way, and some the other, along the coast; they would <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> again {{in two or three}} hours after daylight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, boys, I don't {{know how}} you take it, {{but it seems to}} me that this is not a healthy place to stop in. We cannot always keep {{together}} and always be on our guard, and they may <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> one after the other. I thought when you were talking yesterday about Judge Lynch that you were away from the mark. He has been to two or three camps where I have been, and it ain't no manner of good bucking against him. My opinion is, the sooner we git the better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} thrown {{somewhat}} out of my reckoning," [...] returned the hermit, [...] "by having to fly from the party on the islet, where I meant to remain till a steamer, owned by a friend of mine, should pass and <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up,</b> canoe and all. The steamer is a short-voyage craft, and usually so punctual that I can count on it to a day. But it may have passed us in the gale. If so, I shall {{take advantage of the}} first vessel that will agree to lend us a hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “When Hobson {{was about}} two {{hundred yards from the}} harbour the first gun was fired, from the eastern bluff. We were then about half a mile offshore, and nearing the batteries. The firing {{increased}} rapidly. We steamed in slowly, and lost sight of the Merrimac in the smoke which the wind carried offshore. It hung heavily. Before Hobson could have blown up the Merrimac the western battery <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> and commenced firing. They shot wild, however, and we ran in still farther to the shore until the gunners lost sight of us. Then we heard the explosion of the torpedoes on the Merrimac.|$|R

6000|$|Anyway all the [...] "boys" [...] {{agreed that}} the great {{advantage}} of a launch would be {{that we could get}} a man to take us. By that means the man could see to getting the worms, and the man would be sure to have spare lines, and the man could come along to our different places--we were all beside the water--and <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up.</b> In fact the more we thought about the advantage of having a [...] "man" [...] to take us the better we liked it. As a boy gets old he likes to have a man around to do the work.|$|E

[...] "It brought {{me out in}} a cold sweat at the thought that, if the Osprey were to be run down, there was an end to all chance of rescuing Bertha from that scoundrel's clutches. I don't know that I thought of myself at all. I am a good swimmer, and I suppose she would have stopped to <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up.</b> It was the Osprey I was {{thinking}} of. Even if every life on board had been saved, I don't see how we could have followed up the search without her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't be helped, and we {{must take}} things as we find them. The {{question}} is, {{what is to be}} done with the ship? Should we venture into the channel, yonder chaps will be after us with the news of a Yankee, on board of whom they put a prize-crew, being adrift without the men; and there are fifty cruisers ready to <b>pick</b> <b>us</b> <b>up.</b> The news will spread all over the channel in a week, and our chances of getting through the Straits of Dover will be so small as not to be worth naming: nay, these fellows will soon repair damages, and might possibly overtake us themselves. The Speedy is only half-crippled." ...|$|E

50|$|Most of the {{division}} was encircled and destroyed in Budapest between December and February 1944-45. Those who escaped, consisting of 200-300 men, were reformed under Schöning. Wounded during the battle, Schöning broke through Soviet lines and reached the German 3rd Cavalry Brigade on the Buda side. Schöning remembered it thus: Suddenly I {{had the feeling that}} my leg was being torn off. (...) As my pistol was empty I ordered my lieutenant to finish me off because I didn't want to be taken prisoner. He was himself wounded in the arm. He then called to me: “Only another 2,000 metres, Lieutenant Colonel. We have to make it!'” I crept through the snow up a hill with the major...Two wounded grenadiers from our battle group <b>picked</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> under the arms under the heaviest fire and stood us upright and I dragged myself with several wounds to the feet the two kilometres to the German position.|$|R
