40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOn July 1, 1995, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service fielded the On-line Prevalidation System for processing vendor <b>payment</b> <b>requests.</b> Its {{purpose was to}} prevent new Negative Unliquidated Obligation and Unmatched Disbursements records by comparing disbursement requests to obligations prior to payment. The Objectives of this thesis were to determine the causes of rejected <b>payment</b> <b>requests</b> by analyzing sample data drawn from Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic's Operations and Maintenance appropriation and to recommend {{ways to improve the}} prevalidation process so that obligation validation is more efficient and effective. Research included an investigation into the background of the prevalidation system and an analysis of UMDs and NULOs before and after the implementation of the OPV System. Seven causes of rejected <b>payment</b> <b>requests</b> were identified, along with the penalty interest charged as a result of document numbers remaining on the Rejected <b>Payment</b> Authorization <b>Request</b> Report. It was observed that the formation of new UMDs and NULOs has decreased as a result of OPV's implementation. While the disbursements that are prevalidated generally do not result in problem disbursements, only a portion of all disbursements is prevalidated. Lowering thresholds at which disbursements must be prevalidated and expanding the types of payments that are subject to prevalidation will improve the credibility of DoD financial management and further decrease problem disbursement levels.

5000|$|When a bank {{customer}} uses an unplanned overdraft {{and then}} makes a <b>payment</b> <b>request</b> (whether by standing order, direct debit or using an ATM or debit card), banks generally make the payment as requested, and then charge fees (which may include [...] "paid item" [...] charges and unauthorised overdraft fees) which accrue {{on a daily}} basis whilst the unauthorised overdraft continues. The Office of Fair Trading ('OFT'), acting on behalf of consumers, challenged these fees under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 ('UTCCR'), which implements European Union Unfair Contract Terms Directive. OFT claimed the sizeable fees charged were not a fair reflection of the banks' costs but were instead a penalty upon the consumer or bank account holder, hence unlawful. If these fees were confirmed to be a penalty for breach of contract then under UK law the amount that could be charged would be limited to reflect the actual (and considerably lower) costs which were incurred by the bank.|$|E

For new employees {{it is important that}} their access is set up properly and that future access granted has proper approval. After the system has been implemented the control over system changes and the approval process required for it is vital to ensure the continued security and functionality of the system. Without proper security measures in place from start to finish there will be a material weakness in the controls of the system because of this there will likely be some level of fraud as well. Through security you are able to [...] who has access to what data and processes and ensure that there is sufficient segregation of duties so as to prevent someone from perpetrating fraud. One of the major advantages of SAP is that it can be programmed to perform various audit functions for you. One of the most important of those is for reviewing user access and using the system to cross check based on an access matrix to ensure that proper segregation is in place so a person with <b>payment</b> <b>request</b> access does not also have access to create a vendor.|$|E

First, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a given set of coins to solve the problem.

Although these scenarios offer advantages to protocol designers in terms of design simplicity and the development of payment protocols without losing security capabilities, the full connectivity scenario does not consider those situations where the client cannot directly communicate with the merchant. We present the design of an anonymous secure Payment protocol based on the Payment Gateway Centric scenario for those scenarios in mobile environments where the Client cannot communicate directly with the Merchant to process the <b>Payment</b> <b>Request.</b> Our proposed protocol uses symmetric-key operations which require low computational power and can be processed faster than asymmetric ones...|$|E
