25|$|Narcolepsy has {{sometimes}} been treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine, imipramine, or <b>protriptyline,</b> {{as well as other}} drugs that suppress REM sleep. Venlafaxine, an antidepressant which blocks the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, has shown usefulness in managing symptoms of cataplexy, however, it has notable side-effects including sleep disruption.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, <b>protriptyline,</b> butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, <b>protriptyline).</b> Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include nortriptyline (noramitriptyline, N-desmethylamitriptyline), <b>protriptyline,</b> and butriptyline. Amitriptyline is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nortriptyline being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of amitriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzocycloheptene-5-ylidene)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C20H23N with a molecular weight of 277.403g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely and the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-48-6, of the hydrochloride is 549-18-8, and of the embonate is 17086-03-2.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> is the English and French {{generic name}} of the drug and its , , and , while <b>protriptyline</b> {{hydrochloride}} is its , , and [...] Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its [...] are protriptylina, in German is protriptylin, and in Latin is protriptylinum.|$|E
50|$|A {{common problem}} with TCAs is {{sedation}} (drowsiness, lack {{of physical and}} mental alertness), but <b>protriptyline</b> is considered the least sedating agent among this class of agents. Its side effects are especially noticeable early in therapy. In most people, early TCA side effects decrease or disappear entirely with time, but, until then, patients taking <b>protriptyline</b> should take care to assess which side effects occur in them and should not perform hazardous activities requiring mental acuity or coordination. <b>Protriptyline</b> may increase the possibility of having seizures.|$|E
50|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>protriptyline</b> are {{increased}} when it is taken with central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines, {{as well as with}} other antidepressants including SSRIs, SNRIs or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. It may be dangerous to take <b>protriptyline</b> in combination with these substances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protriptyline,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Vivactil among others, is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA), specifically a secondary amine, indicated {{for the treatment of}} depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Uniquely among most of the TCAs, <b>protriptyline</b> tends to be energizing instead of sedating, and is sometimes used for narcolepsy to achieve a wakefulness-promoting effect.|$|E
5000|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressants}} (TCAs): amitriptyline, butriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, dosulepin, doxepin, imipramine, lofepramine, nortriptyline, <b>protriptyline,</b> trimipramine.|$|E
50|$|The sale of <b>protriptyline</b> was {{discontinued}} in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Ireland in 2000.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> acts by {{decreasing}} the reuptake of norepinephrine {{and to a}} lesser extent serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. Its affinity for the human norepinephrine transporter (NET) is 1.41 nM, 19.6 nM for the serotonin transporter and 2,100 nM for the dopamine transporter. TCAs act to change the balance of naturally occurring chemicals in the brain that regulate the transmission of nerve impulses between cells. <b>Protriptyline</b> increases the concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin (both chemicals that stimulate nerve cells) and, to a lesser extent, blocks the action of another brain chemical, acetylcholine. The therapeutic effects of <b>protriptyline,</b> like other antidepressants, appear slowly. Maximum benefit is often not evident for at least two weeks after starting the drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and butriptyline. <b>Protriptyline</b> is a secondary amine TCA, with its N-methylated relative amitriptyline being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine TCAs include desipramine and nortriptyline. The chemical name of <b>protriptyline</b> is 3-(5H-dibenzoa,d7annulen-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21N1 with a molecular weight of 263.377 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 438-60-8 and of the hydrochloride is 1225-55-4.|$|E
50|$|When <b>protriptyline</b> is used {{to treat}} the {{depressive}} component of schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms may be aggravated. Likewise, in manic-depressive psychosis, depressed patients may experience a shift toward the manic phase if they are treated with an antidepressant drug. Paranoid delusions, with or without associated hostility, may be exaggerated. In any of these circumstances, it may be advisable to reduce the dose of <b>protriptyline</b> or to use a antipsychotic drug concurrently.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> may {{increase}} {{heart rate and}} stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. In rare cases in which patients with cardiovascular disease must take <b>protriptyline,</b> they should be monitored closely for cardiac rhythm disturbances and signs of cardiac stress or damage.|$|E
5000|$|Like all TCAs, <b>protriptyline</b> {{should be}} used {{cautiously}} and with close physician supervision. This is especially so in the elderly, or people who have benign prostatic hypertrophy (enlarged prostate gland), or urinary retention, or glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma (the most severe form). Before starting treatment, people should discuss the relative {{risks and benefits of}} treatment with their doctors to help determine if <b>protriptyline</b> is the right antidepressant for them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> has uniquely low dosing among TCAs, {{likely due to}} its {{exceptionally}} long terminal half-life. It is used in dosages of 15 to 40 mg/day, {{whereas most}} other TCAs are used at dosages of 75 to 300 mg/day. The maximum dose is 60 mg/day. Therapeutic levels of <b>protriptyline</b> are typically {{in the range of}} 70 to 250 ng/mL (266-950 nmol/L), which {{is similar to that of}} other TCAs ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> is used {{primarily}} to treat depression and {{to treat the}} combination of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Like most antidepressants of this chemical and pharmacological class, <b>protriptyline</b> has also been used in limited numbers of patients to treat panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa, cocaine dependency, and the depressive phase of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) disorder. It has also been used to support smoking cessation programs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> is or {{has been}} marketed {{throughout}} the world {{under a variety of}} brand names including Anelun, Concordin, Maximed, Triptil, and Vivactil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> was {{developed}} by Merck. It was patented in 1962 and {{first appeared in the}} literature in 1964. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Formylation of 3-methylamino-1-propanol with formamide (instead of ethyl chloroformate) as a {{protecting}} {{group in}} the preparation of <b>Protriptyline.</b> Formamide was also used (instead of formic acid) in the synthesis of primidone.|$|E
50|$|Previous {{treatments}} include tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine, clomipramine or <b>protriptyline.</b> Monoamine oxidase inhibitors {{may be used}} {{to manage}} both cataplexy and the REM sleep-onset symptoms of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations.|$|E
50|$|Various {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (TCAs) {{contain the}} dibenzocycloheptene moiety in their chemical structures, including amineptine, amitriptyline, amitriptylinoxide, butriptyline, demexiptiline, nortriptyline, noxiptiline, and <b>protriptyline.</b> Cyclobenzaprine, a skeletal muscle relaxant, also contains this functional group.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{tricyclic}} antidepressants {{are primarily}} norepinephrine reuptake inihibitors, with no clinically relevant serotonin reuptake except {{in rare cases}} where large doses are used. <b>Protriptyline</b> (Vivactil), Nortriptyline (Pamelor), and Desipramine (Norpramin) are examples of these.|$|E
50|$|TCAs {{including}} <b>protriptyline</b> {{are also}} used to {{reduce the incidence of}} recurring headaches such as migraine, and for other types of chronic pain. This drug can also be used for sleep apnea treatment along with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|Metabolic studies {{indicate}} that <b>protriptyline</b> is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly sequestered in tissues. Relatively low plasma levels are found after administration, and {{only a small amount}} of unchanged drug is excreted in the urine of dogs and rabbits. Preliminary {{studies indicate}} that demethylation of the secondary amine moiety occurs to a significant extent, and that metabolic transformation takes place in the liver. It penetrates the brain rapidly in mice and rats, and moreover that which is present in the brain is almost all unchanged drug.Studies on the disposition of radioactive <b>protriptyline</b> in human test subjects showed significant plasma levels within 2 hours, peaking at 8 to 12 hours, then declining gradually.|$|E
50|$|Nortriptyline is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include amitriptyline (N-methylnortriptyline), <b>protriptyline,</b> and butriptyline. Nortriptyline is a secondary amine TCA, with its N-methylated parent amitriptyline being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine TCAs include desipramine and <b>protriptyline.</b> The chemical name of nortriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoa,dcyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl-1-propanamine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21N1 with a molecular weight of 263.384 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 72-69-5 and of the hydrochloride is 894-71-3.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> is {{available}} as 5 mg and 10 mg tablets. Doses range from 15 to 40 mg {{per day and}} can be taken in one daily dose or divided into up to four doses daily. Some people with severe depression may require up to 60 mg per day.|$|E

50|$|Maprotiline, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Ludiomil among others, is a tetracyclic {{antidepressant}} (TeCA) that {{is used in the}} treatment of depression. It may alternatively be classified as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), specifically a secondary amine. In terms of its chemistry and pharmacology, maprotiline is closely related to other secondary amine TCAs like nortriptyline and <b>protriptyline,</b> and has similar effects to them.|$|E

50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> shares {{side effects}} {{common to all}} TCAs. The most {{frequent}} of these are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, decreased coordination, anxiety, blood disorders, confusion, decreased libido, dizziness, flushing, headache, impotence, insomnia, low blood pressure, nightmares, rapid or irregular heartbeat, rash, seizures, sensitivity to sunlight, stomach and intestinal problems. Other more complicated side effects include; chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; sudden numbness or weakness, especially {{on one side of}} the body; sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; hallucinations, or seizure (convulsions); easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness; restless muscle movements in your eyes, tongue, jaw, or neck; urinating less than usual or not at all; extreme thirst with headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness; or feeling light-headed or fainting. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Patients may also chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless candy in order to increase the flow of saliva. Some artificial saliva products may give temporary relief. Men with prostate enlargement who take <b>protriptyline</b> may be especially likely to have problems with urinary retention. Symptoms include having difficulty starting a urine flow and more difficulty than usual passing urine. In most cases, urinary retention is managed with dose reduction or by switching to another type of antidepressant. In extreme cases, patients may require treatment with bethanechol, a drug that reverses this particular side effect.|$|E
50|$|Amitriptyline is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure.

5000|$|Butriptyline is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and <b>protriptyline.</b> Butriptyline is an analogue of amitriptyline with an isobutyl side chain instead of a [...] side chain. It is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite norbutriptyline being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine.

50|$|Desipramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine (N-methyldesipramine), clomipramine, trimipramine, and lofepramine (N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). Desipramine is a secondary amine TCA, with its N-methylated parent imipramine being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine TCAs include nortriptyline and <b>protriptyline.</b> The chemical name of desipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzob,fazepin-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C18H22N2 with a molecular weight of 266.381 g/mol.

50|$|<b>Protriptyline</b> is a TCA. It {{was thought}} that TCAs work by {{inhibiting}} the reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus {{is part of the}} limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. TCAs are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain. A precise mechanism for their analgesic action is unknown, but it is thought that they modulate anti-pain opioid systems in the central nervous system via an indirect serotonergic route. TCAs are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack. The mechanism of their anti-migraine action is also thought to be serotonergic, similar to psilocybin.|$|E
50|$|Maprotiline is a tetracyclic {{compound}} and is grouped with the TeCAs. Its chemical name is N-methyl-9,10-ethanoanthracen-9(10H)-propylamine. The drug has a dibenzobicyclo2.2.2octadiene (9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethanoanthracene) ring system; that is, a tricyclic anthracene ring system with an ethylene {{bridge across the}} central ring. This results in it having a unique three-dimensional central ring (a bicyclo2.2.2octane or 1,4-endoethylenecyclohexane ring) and being a tetracyclic rather than a tricyclic compound. However, it could also or alternatively {{be considered to be}} a tricyclic and hence a TCA. In addition to its heterocyclic ring system, maprotiline has an alkylamine side chain attached similarly to other TCAs (but notably unlike other TeCAs). In terms of the side chain, it is a secondary amine, and its chemical structure, aside from the ethylene link in the central ring, {{is similar to that of}} secondary amine TCAs like nortriptyline and <b>protriptyline.</b> In accordance, the pharmacology of maprotiline is very similar to that of secondary amine TCAs.|$|E
50|$|Lofepramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, and trimipramine. Lofepramine is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desipramine being a secondary amine. Unlike other tertiary amine TCAs, lofepramine has a bulky 4-chlorobenzoylmethyl substituent on its amine instead of a methyl group. Although lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, it acts in large part as a prodrug of desipramine, and is more similar to secondary amine TCAs in its effects. Other secondary amine TCAs besides desipramine include nortriptyline and <b>protriptyline.</b> The chemical name of lofepramine is N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)-3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzob,fazepin-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C26H27ClN2O with a molecular weight of 418.958 g/mol.
