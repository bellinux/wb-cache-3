He receives an e-mail from Kaminsky, asking to arrange another date; he is also questioned by Cross.|$|E
5|$|John Stuart Mill was {{impressed}} by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in The Malay Archipelago. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his Land Tenure Reform Association, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written {{only a handful of}} articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and land reform in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.|$|E
5|$|Stead {{began writing}} the novel in 2002, but her first draft was {{confusing}} and unorganized. To help her, she met editor Wendy Lamb who advised her {{to meet with}} a small group of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> help critique the novel. After three years of work, Stead finished the second draft and met with Lamb who once again helped make improvements and later published the novel. Reviewers praised the description of Gracehope and main characters, as well as the performances of Coleen Marlo and David Ackroyd who voiced Thea and Peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of First Light.|$|E

5|$|Alaska possessed no {{mental health}} {{treatment}} facilities prior {{to the passage of}} the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E
5|$|Biko's banning {{order in}} 1973 {{prevented}} him from working officially for the BCPs from which he had previously earned a small stipend, but he helped {{to set up a}} new BPC branch in Ginsberg, which held its first meeting in the church of a sympathetic white clergyman, David Russell. Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, dressmaking and health education. For Biko, community development was {{part of the process of}} infusing black people with a sense of pride and dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural black <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not otherwise have access to hospital facilities. He helped to revive the Ginsberg crèche, a daycare for children of working mothers, and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for local women. In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.|$|E
5|$|His {{military}} career began in January 1678 when Paulet purchased for him an ensign's commission in the Holland Regiment, {{in which he}} saw service against the French in Flanders. The regiment saw no combat, and was disbanded {{at the end of}} the year. In July 1680 he purchased a staff lieutenant's commission in the newly formed 2nd Tangier Regiment, which was sent to English Tangier to reinforce the garrison holding the city. Tangier's council was then headed by the Duke of York (later King James II), and its governor was Colonel Percy Kirke. Nicholson distinguished himself in the service, carrying dispatches between the enemy Moroccan camp, Tangier, and London. In addition to favorable notice from Kirke, this brought Nicholson to the attention of the powerful colonial secretary, William Blathwayt. Tangier was abandoned in 1683, and his regiment returned to England. During the service in Tangier he met a number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> figure prominently North American colonial history, including Thomas Dongan and Alexander Spotswood.|$|E

5|$|This pigeon was {{a source}} of food for the local <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> locate its {{roosting}} sites either due to the bird calling or by the droppings that had accumulated below its perches. It was well-remembered by the indigenous peoples, and stories of the delicious ground-dwelling pigeon were passed down by local elders after its extinction. One indigenous person implied that the gizzard stones of the pigeon may have had value locally. After the bird's extinction, the indigenous people have occasionally confused the Choiseul pigeon with the arboreal crested cuckoo-dove in modern folklore, and several claims of the pigeon's continued existence turned out {{to be based on the}} cuckoo-dove. After its discovery, several Western bird collections highly desired its skins; the Whitney South Seas Expedition spent three months at high expense on Choiseul with the primary objective being the acquisition of the Choiseul pigeon. In 2012 the Choiseul pigeon was commemorated on a stamp from Mozambique along with several other extinct birds. The Choiseul pigeon is depicted on the flag of the Choiseul Province.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided {{that it would be}} easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) have a minor {{fight over}} Keith’s {{relationship}} with Harmony. Veronica is staying in Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Piz’s (Chris Lowell) dorm room. Piz comes in unexpectedly, {{and the two}} end up hanging out. However, a girl shows up and tells them that her boyfriend, Sully, has gone missing. They look in Sully’s room, but the girlfriend is hesitant to help. In criminology class, Mr. Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica that he’s applied her for an internship at the FBI. Veronica talks to Logan (Jason Dohring) about Mercer, but he still refuses to give her an alibi. Veronica and the girlfriend, Meryl, find that Sully has contacted another girl, Scarlett, but Scarlett knows that Sully has a girlfriend. Veronica visits Mercer in prison, and he tells her {{that there are many}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> want to frame him. Sully’s roommate comes back to their room, and Veronica uncovers that Meryl and Sully had a fight the previous weekend.|$|E

At the time, this was a relatively uncontroversial anomaly because the additional territory was primarily populated by First Nations <b>peoples,</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not gain the right to vote until the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E
