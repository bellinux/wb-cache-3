40|$|Three {{parallel}} overlapping cores {{have been}} taken in the Albanian side of Lake Shkodra (Albania/Montenegro). The chronological frame of the record, spanning approximately the last 4500 years, has been assessed using four radiocarbon dates and four well-known tephra layers of Italian volcanoes. Multidisciplinary analyses {{turned out to be}} decisive to understand environmental, climatic changes and human impact. Here, we focus on palynology. The humidity at Shkodra was always enough to allow the developing of a luxuriant arboreal vegetation. The pollen <b>percentage</b> <b>diagram</b> does not record important changes in terrestrial plants percentages. Arboreal pollen (AP) shows only a rather slight decrease, with ‘natural forests’ replaced by intensive cultivation of chestnut and walnut in the last seven/eight centuries. The rather minimal changes in composition and dominance are {{because of the fact that}} the pollen rain comes from different vegetation belts, from the Mediterranean to the alpine one. Two major periods of humidity are found, one at the base of the pollen concentration and influx diagram, before 4100 yr BP, the other at 1300 yr BP. Minima in pollen influx and concentration occurred soon before 4000, at ca. 2900 and at ca. 1450 yr BP These minima, interpreted as aridity crises, show a temporal coincidence with the so-called Bond events 1 - 3 already found in other central and eastern Mediterranean records. The minimum in AP occurring after 500 yr BP could represent the record of the ‘Little Ice Age’, even if it could be the effect of a strong land use...|$|E
40|$|Pollen and plant-macrofossil {{data are}} {{presented}} for two lakes near the timberline in the Italian (Lago Basso, 2250 m) and Swiss Central Alps (Gouille Rion, 2343 m). The reforestation at both sites started at 9700 - 9500 BP with Pinus cembra, Larbc decidua, and Betula. The timberline reached its highest elevation between 8700 and 5000 BP and retreated after 5000 BP, {{due to a}} mid-Holocene climatic change and increasing human impact since about 3500 BP (Bronze Age). The expansion of Picea abies at Lago Basso between ca. 7500 and 6200 BP was probably favored by cold phases accompanied by increased oceanicity, whereas {{in the area of}} Gouille Rion, where spruce expanded rather late (between 4500 and 3500 BP), human influence equally might have been important. The mass expansion of Alnus viridis between ca. 5000 and 3500 BP probably can be related to both climatic change and human activity at timberline. During the early and middle Holocene a series of timberline fluctuations is recorded as declines in pollen and macrofossil concentrations of the major tree species, and as increases in nonarboreal pollen in the pollen <b>percentage</b> <b>diagram</b> of Gouille Rion. Most of ·the periods of low timberline can be correlated by radiocarbon dating with climatic changes in the Alps as indicated by glacier ad­ vances in combination with palynological records, solifluction, and dendrocli­ matical data. Lago Basso and Gouille Rion are the only sites in the Alps showing complete palaeobotanical records of cold phases between 10, 000 and 2000 BP with very good time control. The altitudinal range of the Holocene treeline fluc­ tuations caused by climate most likely was not more than 100 to 150 m. A possible correlation of a cold period at ca. 7500 - 6500 BP (Misox oscil­ lation) in the Alps is made with paleoecological data from North America and Scandinavia and a climatic signal in the GRIP ice core from central Greenland 8200 yr ago (ca. 7400 yr uncal.

40|$|A {{relocation}} program, {{especially to}} overcome natural disasters, {{has a tendency}} of being emergency and imperfect in planning so that some important considerations concerning to society preferences in deciding their residency become less ignored as said by Rees (1980). At last the relocation program implementation will put more orientation on meeting houses demands as basic ones so that generating policies are to fulfill people housing demand in mathematical counts. In {{the case of the}} relocation of Damai III in Balikpapan City, {{it can be seen that}} there is an interesting phenomena to be studied. On one side, the program at the beginning of dwelling was assumed less consider the society preferences so that the target is not optimally attained. The other side the existing condition of the after dwelling shows that the relocation become a fast growing area and favorite to Balikpapan society. The phenomena will be studied in this thesis. By studying the case of the relocation in Damai the research objectives are to study the after-dwelling condition and the preference factors and influencing perceptions of the societies in deciding to dwell in the relocation area. The aims of the study are to find out the socio-economic characteristics of the relocated societies, to know the relocation area characteristics, and to identify and analyze the influencing factors of people preferences as their basic to make a decision to live in the relocation area. The method being used in the research is a descriptive method with an evaluative and ex post facto approach. The techniques to analyze research results will integrate qualitative and quantitative ones. The quantitative techniques are a statistic descriptive (frequency distribution, table, graphics, <b>percentage,</b> <b>diagram)</b> and cross tabulation.

40|$|The Flandrian vegetational and archaeological {{history of}} the Ingleborough Massif was {{investigated}} using pollen and macrofossil analysis of peat deposits in conjunction with radiocarbon dating. A transect was taken across the massif, running northwest to south-east, and peat deposits were sampled at intervals, {{as close to the}} transect as possible. This was to give a range of altitude and peat types, as well as sites both near to and far from limestone and known archaeological remains. Pollen influx (produced by means of an exotic marker grain method) and <b>percentage</b> pollen <b>diagrams</b> were produced for five peat profiles while <b>percentage</b> <b>diagrams</b> only were produced for a further six. The earliest peat formed in the Arks corrie c. 9240 t 100 BP and revealed an open countryside with some birch and juniper bushes. Corylus migrated into the area and formed a major component the vegetation near the Arks C. 8730 - 80 BP. After the arrival of Quercus and Ulmus trees, Alnus appeared in the area c. 80 BP but did not reach high numbers until 6400 ± 70 BP. Some evidence of possible early Mesolithic activity during this period was found. Small-scale and short-lived clearance of the mixed-oak woodland began c. 5700 BP, due to the activities of either Late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic peoples. A distinctive and long-term clearance phase (lasting c. 500 - 700 years) took place in the Early Neolithic Period, characterised by high percentages of Rumex acetosa/acetosella type pollen with smaller percentages of other ruderal pollen types and occasional cereal grains. The evidence points to both pastoral and arable farming being practised on the well-drained Carboniferous Limestone soils. After a short tree recovery, widespread clearance was renewed on the massif in the Early Bronze Age, with Plantago lanceolata and Pteridium the most abundant indicator grains. Extensive areas of the massif were covered by spreading blanket bog in this period. All peat profiles have been truncated, three end with the Late Bronze Age; the others continue until the Iron Age on end of the Romano-British Period, at which time the massif was almost cleared of woodland. Regrowth occurred {{at the beginning of the}} Norman Period, at least at one site. Severe erosion has taken place over the whole of the massif. There is evidence at the Arks site of a "bogburst" or "gill-brack" having taken place...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{estimation}} of absolute microfossil numbers, with reference especially to diatoms A new method for obtaining permanent quantitative slides of microfossils {{involves the use of}} an evaporation tray in which micro-fossil suspensions can be sedimented randomly onto cover slips on the tray floor. Slides are made after evaporation. The technique is statistically reliable. The results of diatom analyses from lake sediments are usually presented in the form of <b>percentage</b> <b>diagrams</b> in which the varia-tion in the percentage frequency of indi-vidual taxa or groups of taxa are shown for successive levels in the sediment (Nygaard 1956; Behre 1962). These percentage anal-yses are easy to make, and the diagrams often give a good picture of the changing structure of fossil communities. However, they allow no estimation of the absolute abundance of diatoms in the sediment, and their interpretation must take into account the constraints of using a constant sum (Chayes 1960). In response to the latter problem, pollen analysts have devised methods for esti-mating total numbers of pollen grains per sample (Davis 1965; Benninghoff 1962; Jergensen 1967) and have expressed the results after correction for the rate of sedi-ment deposition in terms of pollen grains deposited per square centimeter per annum (Davis 1967). In paleolimnological studies it is also useful to express results in this way, to obtain information on the paleo-productivity of lakes and to make compari-sons with the quantitative results of lim-nological analysis. The history of lake eutrophication provides especially apposite conditions for this approach. I wish to thank Prof. F. Oldfield for reading the manuscript.

40|$|Palynological and tephra {{information}} {{provides the}} foundation for correlation of five deep wells from the Great Salt Lake. Pollen correlations are primarily resolved using pollen <b>percentage</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Analysis of the individual tephra units allow correlation of tephras based on chemical similarities. Known regional tephras recognized {{in one or more}} of the wells are the Lava Creek B ash bed, the Bishop ash bed, the Huckleberry Ridge ash bed, the Santee ash bed and the Walcott ash bed. Absolute ages associated with these ash beds and three other units subsequently allow for the calculation of long term sediment accumulation rates at each well location. Sediment accumulation rates, averaged over the last 4 to 5 million years of record, range between 0. 18 mm/yr and 0. 43 mm/yr, with fairly constant rates within each well. The two longest records, which represent an approximated 16 million years, provide average sedimentation rates over this entire period of 0. 23 mm/yr and 0. 13 mm/yr. Neogene through Pleistocene paleoclimatic conditions are estimated using pollen percentages based on the pollen counts from all five wells. Quantitative climatic interpretations based on the palynology suggest close to modern, but slightly warmer and drier conditions from ca. 7 million years ago (Ma) to ca. 3. 5 Ma. The period lasting from ca. 3. 5 Ma to ca. 0. 7 Ma was characterized by a clearly hotter and more arid climate compared to today; though a short cool period may have occurred between 2. 7 and 2. 9 Ma. Conditions over the last 0. 7 Ma were generally cooler and moister than the previous period, and at times may have been significantly cooler and moister than the modern climate.

40|$|The {{archaeology}} of Rombalds Moor, West Yorkshire, is {{reviewed and}} discussed. Vegetational information {{is provided by}} thirteen pollen <b>diagrams</b> (nine <b>percentage</b> <b>diagrams</b> and four influx diagrams) for seven sites on the moor. At {{the end of the}} Late-Devensian period Rombalds Moor was aspecies-rich grassland. Following the Post-glacial warming of the climate-there was a succession of trees arriving in the area, but true woodland was not established until c. 8800 years BP. Dates are proposed for two early Mesolithic forest burnings, and late Mesolithic disturbance has been noted, particularly at the Alnus rise. The morphology of the Alnus rise differs in diagrams from different parts of the moor. Differences in diagrams from the same site, together with radiocarbon dating evidence, points to the presence of one or more hiatuses in the late Boreal/early Atlantic. At this site there is evidence that Pinus persisted long after the Alnus rise. There was a small amount of clearance, but no agriculture, in the Neolithic period. In the Bronze Age there was more extensive clearance, some pastoralism, and a limited amount of cereal cultivation in the east of the moor. Pollen analysis of a buried soil provides evidence that a supposed 'Bronze Age' cairn represents a burial, but the radiocarbon date is Iron Age. Major deforestation took place in the Iron Age when the population moved from the higher land into the valleys and there were significant increases in both pastoral and arable farming. Cultivation stopped and woodland regrew in some areas {{towards the end of the}} Roman period. There is evidence that removal of the woodland cover led to soil degeneration on the higher parts of the moor which prevented later regrowth of woodland. In the late 13 th and early 14 th centuries remaining woodland was cleared and agriculture increased, particularly pastoralism.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} its {{subsequent}} ecological problems {{are one of}} the most important environmental challenges humanity has to face in the 21 st century. In addition to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, large scale changes in land cover and land use have been recognized to play an important role in climate change. This human impact on land cover and climate is not a phenomenon of recent times. Humans have substantially transformed the European landscape since the advent of agriculture during the Mid-Holocene. In order to test hypotheses on past vegetation-climate feedbacks and to improve climate models, spatially-explicit historical data on such landscape transformations is needed. The aim of this study is to quantify Holocene land cover and land use changes (LCLUCs), and to reconstruct the timing and extent of the advent of agriculture on the Drenthe Plateau, the Netherlands. Pollen data from two lakes on the Drenthe Plateau were used, namely (1) Hijkermeer and (2) Mekelermeer. The pollen data from Hijkermeer were obtained for the purpose of this study (i. e. sediment sampling, pollen preparation and counting. Samples were not radiocarbon dated), while the pollen data from Mekelermeer were obtained from a previous study. The pollen data were then analyzed with the REVEALS-model, using averaged pollen productivity estimates from several European regions. Although there are some uncertainties about the age-model used for the Hijkermeer pollen samples, the results of this study show that during the Atlantic (~ 8900 - 5750 calyrBP.) the Drenthe Plateau was covered with woodlands and forests. The first signs of agriculture appear during the Subboreal ~ 5250 calyrBP. with (1) an increase in grassland vegetation, most likely as a consequence of husbandry, (2) the appearance of P. major / media which probably also indicates the presence of husbandry. The first evident signs of crop cultivation were found ~ 4750 calyrBP., with the first appearance of Cerealia, and the presence of P. major / media, R. acetosella, Artemisia and Poaceae. These early agricultural activities can be attributed to people of the Funnel Beaker Culture. The advent of agriculture on the Drenthe Plateau was probably stimulated by the drier and warmer climate of the Subboreal, compared to the colder and wetter climate of the Atlantic. The Subatlantic was characterized by an open landscape, with grasslands and agricultural fields dominating the landscape ~ 1250 calyrBP. In addition, the study showed that human impact on land cover and landscape openness during the Subboreal as estimated by the REVEALS model was more profound than pollen <b>percentage</b> <b>diagrams</b> would suggest...|$|R

This {{has affected the}} quality of education in the country. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the role of principal in parental participation in education at secondary level in district Chitral, Pakistan. This study investigated the perceptions of 100 government secondary school principals. Questionnaire was used to collect data. The collected data was interpreted and presented in simple <b>percentage</b> and <b>diagrams.</b> Results of the study showed that in Pakistan school principals do not play an active role in promoting parental participation. According to principals parental participation means sending their children to schools only. Hence, parents are not encouraged to participate in the education process of their children. School principals at secondary level do not know the ways and means of involving parents in the education process. They lack motivating and management skills to engage parents in education process. The study further discovered that principals consider parental involvement in education as interference in school affairs. Ironically, the principals accept that parental participation is essential for education. However, the study explored that principals consider parents ill-equipped in terms of knowledge and skills to understand the process of education. According to the principals parental involvement in education will create more management issues for schools rather than solutions. On the basis of this study it recommended that principals should be provided comprehensive training on the concept of parental participation in education. For this purpose strong parent teacher associations should be formed and actively monitored. Schools teachers could be trained in keeping close relationship with parents whose children are in the school. Parents could be invited to schools through conferences, meetings and other national and international events.

Values of mean annual precipitation (Pann, mm/yr) have been calculated {{at each of the}} 51 sampling sites from a great number of meteorological stations in South India, using a method of data interpolation based on artificial neural network. Interpolated values at the pollen sites of Pann range from 1200 to 5555 mm/yr, while mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO) remains > 15 degreesC and humidity factor (AET/PET, the actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration ratio) remains also included between 65 and 72 %. Results are presented in the form of <b>percentage</b> pollen <b>diagrams</b> where samples are arranged according to increasing values of annual precipitation.

40|$|The {{trend of}} high {{growth of the}} vehicle fleet in Russia along with the {{positive}} impact on the socio-economic development of the country has a number of adverse consequences, one of which is the high accident rate on the roads. The paper considers modern way to provide the safe vehicles flow with the use of colored asphalt, which is a kind of hot asphalt and can have a variety of colors, which consists of coloring pigments. The conventional method of coloring the asphalt mix is produced by adding color rubble or pigmenting additives. The task, which was put forward, was the establishment of such road concrete mix, from which, without the use of primary materials and without increasing the consumption of bitumen, asphalt concrete road surfaces of acceptable strength could be obtained. As a pigment the dust of gas purification system of electrical furnace DSP - 60 of «Kamastal» plant, Perm, was used. The composition of the dust waste from the furnace consists of metal oxides and silicates. Dust-gas-cleaning is a fine powder with a high specific surface (1. 2 … 2. 5 thousand cm /g) and bulk density of 3. 7 … 4. 2 g/cm. The powder color is dark brown. The density of the ready colored asphalt samples is 2. 47 [...] . 2. 49 g/cm, and water saturation is 3. 50 … 3. 55 %. As a result of the research the diagrams of the dependence of road concrete mix’s water saturation from dust <b>percentage</b> and a <b>diagram</b> of dependence of concrete mixes’ durability from dust percentage at t = 20 ° and 50 ° C were built. After analyzing the obtained curves it can be concluded that the increase of the percentage of dust leads to increase of water saturation of road concrete mix and reduced strength. Thus, the developed asphalt concrete mix allows visually separating the lanes on the road, it has the relevant regulatory requirements durability and water resistance. This mixture corresponds to the type B mark III and can be used in regions I, II, and partly III of road-climatic zones, characterized by cold and humid climate...|$|R
40|$|The small {{enterprise}} sector {{has an important}} role to play in economic development, poverty alleviation and job creation. The sector faces a number of constraints especially in accessing finance, markets; training and technology that greatly affect their performance. Researches carried out earlier on small-scale enterprises also reveal that the performance of a number of them is less than satisfactory. There are many other areas where SMEs seem to be picking well. For instance, with development of information technology in the world, Kenya is slowly and steadily moving towards embracing technology. It is evident in the major towns of Kenya with the rate at which cyber café and other information and communication technology businesses are coming up though much is still {{to be done in the}} small scale industry. Various local studies have been conducted by Wasonga (2008) who did a study on challenges influencing small and medium enterprises (SMES) in Kenya. There is limited information available on factors affecting the growth of small scale real estate companies in Kenya. Therefore, this study sought to establish factors affecting the growth of small scale real estate companies, a case of Setmark properties Limited in Trans - Nzoia County, Kenya. This research adopted a descriptive research design where the population of interest was the employees of the company. The design is deemed appropriate because the main interest was to establish factors affecting the growth of small scale real estate companies in Kenya with a focus on Setmark properties ltd in Trans - Nzoia County, Kenya. The target population for this study was 51 staff working with the company. Census survey was used to select 51 respondents. The researcher used the questionnaire as the primary data collection instrument. The questions were designed to collect qualitative and quantitative data and content and descriptive analysis employed. The content analysis was used to analyze the respondents’ views about the factors affecting the growth of small scale real estate companies in Kenya with a focus on Setmark properties ltd in Trans - Nzoia County, Kenya. A frequency distribution table was informative to summarize the data from respondents, <b>percentages</b> and other <b>diagrams</b> such as bar charts, histograms, grouped frequency distributions and pie charts used during the analysis. Tables and other graphical presentations as appropriate were used to present the data collected for ease of understanding and analysis. Significantly, the study established that access to marketing information services, technology, managerial training and experience in SME sector, have a positive influence on the growth of small scale real estate companies in Kenya while poor government policies and regulations negatively affects the growth of small scale real estate companies in Kenya. The management of financial institutions should consider reviewing their policies regarding access to finance by SMEs and entrepreneurs in the sector should seek for advancement of their technological expertise...|$|R
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: The {{return of}} {{restraint}} in psychiatry raises many ethical issues for caregivers. However their experience is little explored in literature. OBJECTIVES: Our {{objective was to}} study the feelings of caregivers facing restraint with regard to an ethical perspective and to identify areas for improvement. METHOD: Between November 2011 and February 2012 a descriptive cross-sectional epidemiological study was performed in two psychiatric emergency services and two closed units in which doctors and nurses were individually interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Five topics were explored: indications and contexts, impact on the patient, caregiver-patient relationship, perspective on the practice and feelings of caregivers on which we insist particularly. Results were presented in tables with <b>percentages</b> and possibly <b>diagrams.</b> The notable responses of caregivers were also cited. RESULTS: Twenty nurses and nine psychiatrists, mostly female, were recruited. They all had participated in experiments of restraint. The self-aggressiveness, the aggressiveness against other persons and agitation were the most frequent indications. In the patients, caregivers identified misunderstanding (79. 3 %) and anger (75. 9 %). The majority of nurses (75 %) {{felt that there was}} an improvement in the caregiver-patient relationship after the episode of restraint compared to what {{it had been in the}} moments preceding this measure. The emotional experience of caregivers was rich, intense and predominantly negative type of frustration (35 % of nurses; 66. 7 % of doctors), anger (30 and 33. 3 %) and lack of feeling (35 and 44. 4 %). The feelings of doctors and nurses were not completely similar. For caregivers it was "a difficult but necessary experience" (82. 75 %), "an act of care and safety" (68. 9 %). All psychiatrists and almost half of the nurses (45 %) said they did not feel the same when they used seclusion. In their opinion, seclusion entailed a less painful experience because of its therapeutic properties. More than half of the caregivers thought that there were alternatives to restraint: the strengthening of containing function in the hours before the use of restraint; the use of seclusion at the time of the decision to restrain. They identified contexts (80 %) encouraging the use of restraints, not only related to the patient, the lack of resources but also institutional contexts, in particular conflicts or divisions in the health care team. DISCUSSION: The misunderstanding of the patient led us to wonder about the quality of the information he/she received: it was sometimes too formal and did not take into account the uniqueness of the patient. The frustration of caregivers could concern the lack of resources but also be directed towards a patient or caregiver. In addition, there were often cleavages between doctors and nurses that stemmed from a misunderstanding, also with rivalries and power struggles. From the literature and caregivers' reflections we identified three prospects to reduce the use of restraint and modify feelings of caregivers: 1) develop better crisis management upstream through increasing resources and improving training; 2) promote patients support in using ethical principles of autonomy and beneficence by showing them solicitude, inviting them to tell themselves and helping them to regain their own experience; 3) develop an afterthought in setting up institutional reflection time by restoring a central role in clinical team meetings in psychiatry, possibly supplemented by supervision, but also through regional ethical spaces. CONCLUSION: In our investigation, we found that caregivers had a predominantly negative experience with frustration, anger and a lack of feeling. Among caregivers we also identified awareness of ethical issues that may be for the first time for a change...|$|R
