5|$|From {{a global}} perspective, {{there have been}} {{political}} debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and broadcasting. The history of broadcasting discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio broadcasting. The onset of World War II brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting <b>propaganda.</b> Countries, their governments, insurgents, terrorists, and militiamen have all used telecommunication and broadcasting techniques to promote <b>propaganda.</b> Patriotic <b>propaganda</b> for political movements and colonization started the mid-1930s.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o conteúdo das <b>propagandas</b> de alimentos veiculadas na televisão e dirigidas a crianças, sob a ótica da regulação. As <b>propagandas</b> foram gravadas em fitas VHS de duas grandes emissoras de televisão, no período de férias escolares. Foram utilizadas técnicas de análise de conteúdo e definidas oito categorias de análise a partir do referencial teórico sobre as práticas alimentares e seus determinantes. Para subsidiar a análise utilizou-se a proposta de Regulamento Técnico da Anvisa. Foram contabilizadas 1018 <b>propagandas,</b> das quais foram selecionadas as 132 (12, 9 %) que anunciavam alimentos dirigidos para as crianças, sendo identificados somente 12 produtos diferentes. De acordo com o Regulamento proposto, todas as <b>propagandas</b> analisadas infringiam pelo menos três artigos, entre os quais se destaca o 4 º, Incisos III e VIb.

The proposal for a Technical Regulation of Anvisa was used to conduct this analysis. 1018 advertisements were recorded, of which 132 (12. 9 %) that advertised foods targeted at children were selected, but only 12 different products were identified.

40|$|O cotidiano vivido pelo homem moderno vem sofrendo uma {{avalanche}} de textos nÃo-verbais. Na Ãnsia de se mostrar e se fazer notar, outdoors, <b>propagandas,</b> charges e fotografias poluem o espaÃo visÃvel, sobrecarregando o olhar do leitor sem que ele tenha tempo de refletir criticamente sobre o que vÃ. Dentre as diversas tipologias de textos nÃo-verbais que se produzem e se levam a pÃblico, estÃo as <b>propagandas</b> impressas. Este trabalho analisa algumas <b>propagandas</b> da Duloren â marca de lingerie â e objetiva mostrar que elas sÃo resultado de reflexÃo sobre a cultura na qual estÃo inseridas, isto Ã, dialogam com o lastro cultural que as sustenta. A Duloren, tendo conhecimento sobre essa cultura, utiliza-a para articular em suas <b>propagandas</b> assuntos considerados tabus culturais com a finalidade de chocar o leitor e, com isso, fazer com que este preste atenÃÃo, memorizando a marca e consumindo o produto. Dito de outra maneira, os assuntos impedidos para os discursos sÃo usados como estratÃgia publicitÃria pela Duloren, que visa a criar um efeito de sentido positivo em relaÃÃo Ã marca. Tais temas tabus fazem parte do lastro cultural de uma sociedade e podem variar conforme varia esse lastro, o que significa dizer que as <b>propagandas</b> veiculadas numa cultura nÃo seriam, necessariamente, interpretadas da mesma forma se tivessem sido veiculadas noutra sociedade cuja cultura fosse diferente. A partir de uma anÃlise reflexiva do trabalho estratÃgico levado a efeito pelos produtores dos textos imagÃticos, procura-se verificar como esses temas tabus sÃo agenciados para persuadir o leitor a comprar nÃo sÃ o produto, mas tambÃm o modelo de comportamento feminino e masculino. Nesse modelo, a mulher Ã considerada um objeto, submissa ao homem que, por sua vez, Ã concebido como dominador, enquanto ela Ã percebida como frÃgil e dependente da presenÃa e da aprovaÃÃo dele. Tal aprovaÃÃo, conforme sugerem as <b>propagandas,</b> fica mais fÃcil de se obter se se fizer uso da lingerie Duloren, que promete ser uma arma de seduÃÃo para quem a usar. Acredita-se que uma leitura mais detalhada e crÃtica dos textos publicitÃrios, tais como as <b>propagandas,</b> possa fazer com que o leitor deixe de consumir inadvertida e passivamente idÃias, produtos e modelos de comportamento. The {{everyday life}} of modern {{man has been}} suffering an avalanche of non-verbal texts. In their eagerness to appear and be noticeable, billboards, advertisements, cartoons and photographs pollute the visual space, overloading the readerâs look {{in such a way}} that he/she cannot reflect critically on what he/she sees. Among the several types of non-verbal texts that are produced and published, we highlight the print advertisements. This study analyzes some advertisements by Duloren â a brand of lingerie â and aims at showing that they are a result of reflection on the culture in which they are inserted, that is, they interact with the cultural basis that supports them. Knowing this culture, Duloren uses it in advertisements for articulating issues considered cultural taboos in order to shock the reader, making him pay attention and, thus, memorize the brand and consume the product. In other words, the issues blocked to the discourses are used by Duloren as an advertising strategy, which aims at creating a positive meaning effect regarding the brand. Such taboo themes are part of the cultural basis of a society and may vary as this basis varies, which means that the advertisements conveyed in a given culture would not be necessarily interpreted in the same way in another society whose culture is different. Based on a reflexive analysis on the strategic work carried out by the producers of imagistic texts, we try to verify how these taboo themes are manipulated in order to persuade the reader to buy not only the product, but also the model of feminine and masculine behavior. According to this model, the woman is considered an object, submissive to the man, who is conceived as a dominator while she is seen as fragile and dependent on his presence and approval. This approval, as suggested by the advertisements, is easier to get if the woman wears Duloren lingerie, which promises to be a weapon of seduction for those who wear it. We believe that a more detailed and critical reading of advertising texts may prevent the reader from inadvertently and passively consuming ideas, products and behavior models...|$|R
