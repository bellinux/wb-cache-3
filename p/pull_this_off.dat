500|$|... "House of Jealous Lovers" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. Stylus Magazine described the track as all four band members [...] "playing their instruments {{as if they}} were leads" [...] and continued that [...] "nobody's been able to <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> so well since Joy Division". AllMusic said that its rhythm section was [...] "as dynamite as anything from the late-'70s U.K. post-punk bands." [...] Pitchfork called the song [...] "the unparalleled champion of 2002's summer anthem sweepstakes".|$|E
500|$|Once Iñárritu {{agreed to}} direct, {{he began working}} with Smith on script rewrites. In an {{interview}} with Creative Screenwriting, Smith admitted during this process he was unsure if Iñárritu would {{even be able to}} film some of the sequences they wrote. He recalled, [...] "He would have some ideas and I would say, 'Alejandro, we can’t <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off.</b> It’s not going to work,' and he would say, 'Mark, trust me, we can do this.' In the end, he was right." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Philip Stead {{was more}} generous to Dr. No. Despite {{thinking}} that Fleming was offering [...] "too opulent a feast" [...] with the book, Stead argued that Fleming managed to <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off,</b> where [...] "a less accomplished writer... {{would never have}} got away with this story." [...] Raymond Chandler reviewed the novel for The Sunday Times and praised as [...] "masterly" [...] Fleming's depiction of colonial Kingston in the first chapter. Chandler admired Fleming's writing, which had [...] "an acute sense of pace.... You don't {{have to work at}} Ian Fleming. He does the work for you." ...|$|E
60|$|A Welshman, whose {{appearance}} denoted {{a higher}} rank than the others, approached Oswald, {{as soon as}} he sat up, and called to four or five of his countrymen. Oswald, with difficulty, rose to his feet. He still wore, round his wrist, the chain that Glendower's daughter had given him; and he now <b>pulled</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> and held it up, loudly calling out the name of Glendower, several times. The Welsh leader waved his followers back.|$|R
5000|$|A {{first baseman}} may attempt the play after a pitcher, {{in an attempt}} to pick off a runner, throws to first. The first baseman then fakes the throw back to the pitcher while keeping the ball in his glove, and if and when the runner leaves the base, tags the runner. [...] Dave Bergman is a former first baseman who <b>pulled</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> on {{multiple}} occasions. A second baseman could attempt a similar play after a successful steal of second base, having received a throw from the catcher.|$|R

500|$|Alan Pergament, {{writing for}} The Buffalo News, awarded the episode 3 {{and a half}} stars out of five and said the episode [...] "offers a delicious take on the {{surprise}} theatrical movie hit from England." [...] Pergament thought there were too many penis jokes, especially for the show's time slot, but called the dance scenes [...] "hysterically funny." [...] The Spokesman-Review's John Martin stated that while he usually condemned the [...] "cheap, tawdry use of nudity" [...] to boost ratings, it was different with Carey and he thought the take on The Full Monty was [...] "riotous" [...] and [...] "wild". Martin finished by saying [...] "Carey may be the only comic in prime time who could <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off,</b> so to speak. You gotta love the big guy." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of Michael's film, Novak {{realized}} that scenes would have to be filmed {{as if they had been}} shot years prior to the episode. In order to successfully <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off,</b> editor David Rogers and script supervisor Veda Semame were tasked with [...] "mapping out" [...] every scene to make sure the continuity of the series was preserved. Novak later elaborated on the continuity during an interview with The Office fansite OfficeTally. The scene featuring [...] "The Scarn" [...] would have been filmed after the corporate merger that occurred during the third season; this would explain Karen's willingness to deliver her lines, as she would be [...] "eager to fit in". Stanley's voiceover was recorded [...] "on a lunch break" [...] sometime after the fourth season episode [...] "Local Ad" [...] because he had [...] "got a big kick out of seeing himself" [...] in Michael's commercial. Helene's scenes were filmed sometime when Michael was dating her during the early part of the sixth season.|$|E
500|$|Positive reviews {{praised the}} film's {{take on a}} classic Disney story, its comedy and musical numbers {{as well as the}} {{performance}} of its lead actress, Amy Adams. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality" [...] and one that [...] "has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life". Film critics of Variety and LA Weekly remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. LA Weekly described the film as [...] "the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with Hairspray) but hasn't managed to get right until now" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "More than Disney's strictly animated product, Enchanted, in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population – niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> today is no small feat." [...] Enchanted was the Broadcast Film Critics Association's choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it the 4th best film of 2007.|$|E
5000|$|For Ellen E Jones, {{writing in}} UK {{newspaper}} The Independent on Sunday, [...] "Part of the enjoyable comfort of Christie on TV is the period detail and the BBC has <b>pulled</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> {{with much more}} visual flair than ITV ever managed". Jones found Walliams and Raine to be, [...] "as well turned out as Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, or James Stewart and Kim Novak; it’s only a shame their interactions don’t fizz with the same sexual chemistry”, but added, “At least the two leads are individually endearing”. She also noted “a promising cast of support characters".|$|R
5000|$|If a {{third party}} could get enough votes to win an election, then voters who would support the nominee could {{infiltrate}} {{one of the two}} parties by registering as members, and force a win in that party's primary. However, <b>pulling</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> would take considerable coordination {{on the part of the}} supporting voters, especially if half of them preferred to infiltrate the other major party or remain independent. It would also depend on the rules of the major party for how people may become candidates in their primary, and on which registered members may vote in the primary.|$|R
2500|$|Jones {{has been}} interviewed by {{mainstream}} news sources {{and has made}} a number of public appearances. Although Jones has urged caution in drawing conclusions, some believe that his public comments have indicated a significant degree of certainty on the controlled demolition of the World Trade Center and the culpability of elements within the U.S. government. In one interview, Jones directly called into question the government's theory regarding the attacks and subsequent uncharacteristic total destruction of the buildings, stating that [...] "we don't believe that 19 hijackers and a few others in a cave in Afghanistan <b>pulled</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> acting alone". His name is often mentioned in reporting about 9/11 conspiracy theories.|$|R
500|$|In the 1966 NBA Playoffs, the Sixers again met the Celtics, and for {{the first}} time had home-court advantage. However, Boston easily won the first two games on the road, winning 115–96 and 114–93; Chamberlain played within his usual range, but his {{supporting}} cast shot under 40%. This caused sports journalist Joe McGinnis to comment: [...] "The Celtics played like champions and the Sixers just played." [...] In Game 3, Chamberlain scored 31 points and 27 rebounds for an important road win, and the next day, coach Schayes planned to hold a joint team practice. However, Chamberlain said he was [...] "too tired" [...] to attend, and even refused Schayes' plea to at least show up and shoot a few foul shots with the team. In Game 4, Boston won 114–108. Prior to Game 5, Chamberlain was nowhere to be found, skipping practice and being non-accessible. Outwardly, Schayes defended his star center as [...] "excused from practice", but his teammates knew the truth and were much less forgiving. In Game 5 itself, Chamberlain was superb, scoring 46 points and grabbing 34 rebounds, but the Celtics won the game 120–112 and the series. Cherry is highly critical of Chamberlain: while conceding he was the only Sixers player who performed in the series, he pointed out his unprofessional, egotistical behavior as being a bad example for his teammates. Prior to the 1966–67 NBA season, the friendly but unassertive Schayes was replaced by a familiar face, the crafty but firm Alex Hannum. In what Cherry calls a tumultuous locker room meeting, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season, several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light. Sixers forward Chet Walker testified that on several occasions, players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight. Fellow forward Billy Cunningham observed that Hannum [...] "never backed down" [...] and [...] "showed who was the boss". By doing this, he won Chamberlain's respect. When emotions cooled off, Hannum pointed out to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title; but to <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off,</b> he – like his teammates – had to [...] "act like a man" [...] both on and off the court. Concerning basketball, he persuaded him to change his style of play. Loaded with several other players who could score, such as future Hall-of-Famers Hal Greer and newcomer Billy Cunningham, Hannum wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense.|$|E

2500|$|Business lobby groups Business New Zealand and the Employers and Manufacturers Association both {{expressed}} concern that the dispute reflected a new style of ideological union claims, such as the claim for a national collective agreement.

5000|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode with a B rating {{saying that this}} week the show split its plots under the {{umbrella}} of patriotism. On Jay and Gloria's plot, Ihnat states: [...] "It’s always valuable to see the chemistry between Jay and Gloria, as we remember why they’re together in the first place. Jay sold every one of his arguments, fake or not, {{about what it means to}} be in this country. It’s a fairly blatant message for a sitcom, but [...] "Patriot Games" [...] <b>pulled</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> in a nicely sentimental way, from teen romance to the culmination of a lifelong dream." ...|$|R

2500|$|Magneto {{appears in}} Wolverine and the X-Men voiced by Tom Kane in a {{rendition}} of Ian McKellen's portrayal of Magneto in the X-Men films. He {{is shown to}} rule the island of Genosha, where it appears most mutants are moving to, {{in light of recent}} anti-mutant feelings. Despite the government's treatment of mutants, they seem content to allow Magneto to promote Genosha in the United States with assorted poster and commercials. It is later revealed that Magneto found Professor X unconscious on Genosha after the destruction of the X-Mansion and took to caring for him. When the X-Men arrive to [...] "rescue him" [...] Magneto turns over his care to them, stating that they are his family. When Nightcrawler arrived in Genosha, he had his daughter Scarlet Witch give him a tour. During that time, he sends Mystique to the X-Mansion to [...] "check up" [...] on Professor X. Magneto, Scarlet Witch, and the Acolytes attacked Nightcrawler when he discovered Magneto's underground cells. When Nightcrawler did a lot of teleporting to warn the X-Men, Magneto had Mystique intercept him while he prepared a special cell for Nightcrawler. Magneto gave Quicksilver and his Brotherhood of Mutants a mission. During the transmission, Quicksilver tells his father that if they <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off,</b> he'd better receive a warm welcome back to Genosha. In [...] "Battle Lines", Magneto had a talk with Senator Kelly about holding back the powerful mutants from being sent to Genosha. He later has his Acolytes raid the MRD prisons to free the mutants. In [...] "Hunting Grounds", he finds out that Scarlet Witch and Nightcrawler had been abducted by Mojo. After the rescue, Scarlet Witch persuades Magneto to let Wolverine and Nightcrawler go. In [...] "Backlash", Quicksilver was not pleased with Magneto when he cuts Quicksilver's Brotherhood of Mutants loose. After a chat with Quicksilver, he has Scarlet Witch notify the MRD of the Brotherhood's hideout. In [...] "Aces and Eights", Senator Kelly sends Gambit to steal Magneto's helmet. When Gambit gets away without the helmet and Magneto learns of this, he was about to pummel Senator Kelly until intervention by the X-Men prevented this, showing Magneto and Kelly the true horror of the future their actions are creating.|$|E

She forces her double to accept this pact and the young village girl is left to assume the role of a rich and married woman, with a husband who is not really hers but who she ends up falling in love with. She will also face an alcoholic mother-in-law, stepchildren in need of attention and love, a company teetering on bankruptcy and above all, the eminent danger of discovery.|$|R
5000|$|Season one of Dollhouse {{had mixed}} reviews, with Metacritic {{giving it a}} rating of 57 out of a {{possible}} 100. Ellen Gray of Philadelphia Daily News gave a positive review, remarking that [...] "Dollhouse is less about the ninja kicks and witty banter than it is about instant transformations, and about making the audience care about a character who's likely to behave differently every time we see her. That Dushku mostly <b>pulls</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> is a happy surprise, as is Dollhouse, which has survived Firefly-like trials of its own to get this far." [...] Salon.com reviewer Heather Havrilesky was also positive, commenting that the show's combination of mystery, sly dialogue, and steady flow of action results in a [...] "provocative, bubbly new drama that looks as promising as anything to hit the small screen {{over the course of the}} past year." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of a false ending can be anticipated {{through a number of}} ways. The medium itself might betray that it isn't the true ending (i.e. it's only halfway into a book or a song, a film's listed running time hasn't fully elapsed, only half the world has been explored in a video game, etc.), making only stories with indeterminate running length or a multi-story structure able to <b>pull</b> <b>this</b> <b>off</b> effectively. Another indicator is the feeling that too much of the story is incomplete when the false ending comes, making it feel like there has to be more.|$|E
