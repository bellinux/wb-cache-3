5|$|The Act covers five {{areas of}} trust law: {{the duty of}} care imposed upon trustees, trustees' power of investment, the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> appoint nominees and agents, the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> acquire land, and the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> receive {{remuneration}} for work done as a trustee. It sets a new duty of care, both objective and standard, massively extends the trustees' power of investment and limits the trustees' liability {{for the actions of}} agents, also providing for their remuneration for work done {{in the course of the}} trust.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{is divided}} into six parts, forty-three {{sections}} and four schedules, and focuses upon five specific areas of law.

5|$|The General Assembly is {{empowered}} {{to regulate the}} state's judiciary system by setting {{the size of the}} courts and the bounds of their districts.

25|$|As {{with the}} {{allocation}} of <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> the United States Congress under the United States Constitution, the Constitution of Australia grants a number of specified <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> the Parliament of Australia, while leaving unassigned <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> the state parliaments. Most of the <b>powers</b> granted <b>to</b> the federal parliament can also be exercised by the state parliaments, though because of section 109 of the Australian Constitution federal laws will prevail in case of inconsistency. This arrangement resulted in a constitutional dispute {{as to whether the}} federal government could be subject to state laws, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Australian {{federalism}} {{does not}} permit the federal Parliament or Government <b>to</b> delegate its <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> state or territorial parliaments or governments, nor the state or territorial parliaments or governments <b>to</b> delegate their <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> the federal Parliament or Government.|$|R

5|$|The Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is {{the head}} of the {{executive}} branch of Kentucky's state government, and serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.

The Senate retained its <b>power</b> <b>to</b> block supply, and the Governor-General the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> dismiss government ministers.

5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past the idle position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase <b>power</b> <b>to</b> No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical <b>power</b> <b>to</b> the rotating mechanismsand increasing <b>power</b> <b>to</b> No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|E
5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His <b>power</b> <b>to</b> revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E

5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> tax, since it had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E
