Moreover, the illegal activities of the extraction of river sand and gravel in the rivers of Padas, Papar and Tuaran had become the latest concern along with the wildlife and marine hunting and poaching. Due to severe deforestation along with massive wildlife and marine poaching, the Sumatran rhino have been declared as extinct in early 2015. Some other species that was threatened with extinction is banteng, bearded pig, clouded leopard, dugong, elephant, false gharial, green turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, orangutan, pangolin, <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkey,</b> river shark, roughnose stingray, sambar deer, shark and sun bear. [...] Although the indigenous community are also involved in hunting, they hunt based on their spiritual believes and practice, and on a small scale, which differentiates them from poachers. Well-known indigenous practices, such as [...] "maganu totuo" [...] or [...] "montok kosukopan", [...] "tuwa di powigian", [...] "managal" [...] or [...] "tagal" [...] and [...] "meminting", have helped to maintain resources and prevent their depletion.|$|E

[...] Matang Wildlife Centre, Semenggoh Nature Reserve, and Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary are noted for their orangutan protection programmes. TalangSatang National Park is notable for its turtle conservation initiatives. Birdwatching is a common activity in various national parks such as Gunung Mulu National Park, Lambir Hills National Park, and Similajau National Park. MiriSibuti National Park {{is known for its}} coral reefs and Gunung Gading National Park for its Rafflesia flowers. Bako National Park, the oldest national park in Sarawak, is known for its 275 proboscis monkeys, and Padawan Pitcher Garden for its various carnivorous pitcher plants.

40|$|In {{mammalian}} herbivores, faecal {{particle size}} indicates chewing efficiency. <b>Proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Nasalis larvatus) are foregut fermenters in which regurgitation and remastication (i. e. rumination) {{was observed in}} the wild, {{but not with the}} same consistency as found in ruminants and camelids. To test whether this species has exceptional chewing efficiency among primates, as ruminants have among mammals, we compared faecal particle size in free-ranging specimens with those of 12 other primate species. The discrete mean faecal particle size (dMEAN) increased with body mass (M) as dMEAN (mm) = 0. 65 (95 % confidence interval 0. 49 – 0. 87) M 0. 33 (0. 23 – 0. 43) in simple-stomached species. At 0. 53 ± 0. 09 mm, dMEAN of <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> was particularly small for their average M (15 kg) and significantly smaller than values of two other foregut fermenting primate species. While we cannot exclude other reasons for the exceptional chewing efficiency in <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys,</b> this represents circumstantial evidence for regular use of rumination in this species. Thus, <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> might be a model for convergent evolution towards rumination in a non-ungulate taxon...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{observations}} and small fecal particles {{compared to other}} primates indicate that free-ranging <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Nasalis larvatus) have a strategy of facultative merycism (rumination). In functional ruminants (ruminant and camelids), rumination is facilitated by a particle sorting mechanism in the forestomach that selectively retains larger particles and subjects them to repeated mastication. Using a set of a solute and three particle markers of different sizes (b 2, 5 and 8 mm), we displayed digesta passage kinetics and measured mean retention times (MRTs) in four captive <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> (6 – 18 kg) and compared the marker excretion patterns to those in domestic cattle. In addition, we evaluated various methods of calculating and displaying passage characteristics. The mean ± SD dry matter intake was 98 ± 22 g kg− 0. 75 d− 1, 68 ± 7 % of which was browse. Accounting for sampling intervals in MRT calculation yielded results that were not affected by the sampling frequency. Displaying marker excretion patterns using fecal marker concentrations (rather than amounts) facilitated com- parisons with reactor theory outputs and indicated that both proboscis and cattle digestive tracts represent a se- ries of very few tank reactors. However, {{the separation of the}} solute and particle marker and the different-sized particle markers, evident in cattle, did not occur in <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys,</b> in which all markers moved together, at MRTs of approximately 40 h. The results indicate that the digestive physiology of <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> does not show typical characteristics of ruminants, which may explain why merycism is only a facultative strategy in this species...|$|R

40|$|In {{non-human}} primates, {{the daily}} feeding rhythm, i. e., temporal fluctuation in feeding activity across the day, {{has been described}} but has rarely received much analytical interpretation, though it may play a crucial part in understanding the adaptive significance of primate foraging strategies. This study {{is the first to}} describe the detailed daily feeding rhythm in <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Nasalis larvatus) based on data collected from both riverbank and inland habitats. From May 2005 to May 2006, data on feeding behavior in a group of <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> consisting of an alpha-male, six adult females and immatures was collected via continuous focal animal sampling technique in a forest along the Menanggul River, Sabah, Malaysia. In both the male and females, the highest peak of feeding activity was in the late afternoon at 15 : 00 – 17 : 00, i. e., shortly before sleeping. The differences in the feeding rhythm among the seasons appeared to reflect the time spent eating fruit and/or the availability of fruit; clearer feeding peaks were detected when the monkeys spent a relevant amount of time eating fruit, but no clear peak was detected when fruit eating was less frequent. The daily feeding rhythm was not strongly influenced by daily temperature fluctuations. When comparing the daily feeding rhythm of <b>proboscis</b> <b>monkeys</b> to that of other primates, {{one of the most common}} temporal patterns detected across primates was a feeding peak in the late afternoon, although it was impossible to demonstrate this statistically because of methodological differences among studies...|$|R
