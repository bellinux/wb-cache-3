The {{effect of the}} process variables - reaction time, enzyme and modifiers concentration on fabrics colour was studied, according to an appropriate experimental design.

The ability of the laccases to generate colour “in situ” from originally non-coloured, low-molecular substances, appears as an alternative to the conventional <b>dyeing</b> <b>processes.</b> The <b>dye</b> precursors can be used alone or in combination with suitable modifier (coupler) – another phenolic compound, which together with the dye precursor will enlarge the colour pallet achieved in the enzymatic dyeing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{association}} rule mining technique {{is very popular}} in the recent research area and as we know this technique {{is one of the}} powerful domains of data mining. The {{association rule}} mining concept was used in various applications such as healthcare, banking, sales, etc. The association rule mining concept, first time we are going to use in the domain of <b>dyeing</b> <b>process.</b> Hence, the nature of <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> is dynamic. So it has more number of event logs for one process, because the process is controlled by different parameters. So, the dependency variable decides the quality of the shade. The little shade different occurs due to lot of dyeing treatment problems. To overcome these difficulties, we have implemented the association rule mining technique in the domain of <b>dyeing</b> <b>process.</b> This paper validates the association rule mining approach that is particularly a new association rule mining algorithm LRM is used for two <b>dyeing</b> <b>processes</b> from Jayabala <b>dyeing</b> unit. This validation is conducted using clustering approach. The clustering is used because of the complexity of the <b>dyeing</b> <b>processes.</b> It reduces the complexity when the event logs are more in numbers.

Using ultrasonics (approx. 10 W/cm 2) in a conventional <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> leads to a faster dyestuff consumption of the wool fibre, a deeper depht of shade and higfher levelness. The influence of the ultrasonic waves lead to a fester penetration of the wool fibre surface but no faster diffusion inside the fibre. No kind of ultrasonic-induced fibre damage could be detected. It could also be shown {{that it is possible to}} dye wool in deep shades and with high levelness and fastness properties in a water-free <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> using supercritical carbon dioxide instead of water. To match the fastness standards of today it is necessary to use fiber-reactive disperse dyes or mordant dyes on a pre-mordanted wool fabric. Small amounts of modifier are inevitable for deep shades and high levelness. It is possible to recycle the modifier with the carbon dioxide. The water-free dyeing conditions allow higher dyeings temperatures up to 120 °C. Without any detectable wool fibre damage, this reduces the <b>dyeing</b> <b>process</b> for more than 30 %...|$|R
