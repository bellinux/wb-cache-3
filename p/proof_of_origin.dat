While the honey collection areas are defined, extraction can take place outside of these areas, provided that traceability is ensured.

40|$|Non-repudiation allows an {{exchange}} of data between two principals {{in such a manner}} that the principals cannot subsequently deny their participation in the exchange. Current non-repudiation schemes, while providing a mandatory <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> service, generally provide only discretionary proof of receipt since it is difficult to enforce the return of the proof of receipt by the recipient. In this paper a new scheme for achieving mandatory mutual non-repudiation is proposed, encompassing both mandatory <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and mandatory proof of receipt. The fundamental feature of the scheme is that the proofs of origin and receipt are not exchanged until both principals have submitted their digitally signed evidence to a trusted third party intermediary. This ensures that if the non-repudiation protocol is not completed, neither principal can gain from the exchange. An added advantage is that the process of dispute arbitration is considerably simplified since a small number of rules are required to decide whether an alleged data exchange took place...|$|E

To the extent that this characterisation is justified, the use of a process algebra such as Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) seems appropriate to describe and analyse them.

The paper is concerned with the theoretical basis for such analysis. A formal verification of a simple example is carried out as an illustration.

40|$|Este estudo está inserido num tópico que têm recebido muita atenção por parte da {{literatura}} financeira atualmente, principalmente porque, a partir da publicação da lei 11. 308 de 13 de julho de 2007, tomou obrigatorio a puplicação da demonstração do fluxo de caixa, em substituíçaõ da à demonstração das origens e aplicação dos recursos. O fluxo de caixa deve ser tratado como um grande instrumento gerencial que permite identificar a maneira como o dinheiro circula na empresa, ou seja identifica qual é o grau de liquidez, mostrando a posição financeira da empresa de maneira a estabelecer tendências sobre as eventuais sobras ou falta de recursos. A finalidade do fluxo de caixa realizado é mostrar como se comportaram as entradas e as saídas de recursos financeiros da empresa em detenninado penodo. O estudo cuidadoso do fluxo de caIxa realizado, além de propicIar análise de tendência, serve de base para o planejamento do fluxo projetado. O objetivo principal do estudo é fazer uma análise do volume de perdas financeiras ao longo do período compreendido entre 1996 a 2008. As perdas financeiras que nos referimos, ocorreram devido ao atraso de pagamento por parte do cliente gerando a necessidade de aumento do capital de giro, causado pela grande diferença de prazo entre o ciclo de caixa projetado (ideal) comparado ao ciclo de caixa real. O presente trabalho foi realizado em uma empresa de grande porte no setor da construção civil. O trabalho realizado foi o de comparar o ciclo de caixa planejado versus o ciclo de caixa real, determinando assim o montante de perdas financeiras que foi de R$ 48, 46 milhões de reais atualizados para o final do período analisado, representando uma redução da rentabilidade em 3, 26 %. Palavras-chave: Fluxo de caixa. Capital de giro. Ciclo de caixa projetado. Ciclo de caixa real. This {{study is}} inserted in {{a topic that}} has current 1 y been calling much attention from financiaI literature. The main reason for this fact is that {{since the publication of}} the law number 1 l. 308 of July 13 th, 2007 which made obligated the publication of cash flow instead of presenting the <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> as well as application of resources. The cash flow must be treated as a great management tool that allows identifying the way money circulates in the company, in other words, identifies the leveI of liquidity showing the financiaI position ofthe company in order to establish trends 00 eventual remaining or lack of resources. The cash flow is accomplished with the purpose of demonstrating how the ioputs and outputs of the company' s financiaI resources behaved in a given period. The careful study of the cash flow done not only enables the trend analysis but also works as base for projected cash flow planning. The main objective ofthe study is to analyze the amount of financiai losses over the period betweeo 1996 to 2008. The financiai losses that we have referred to occurred due to the late payment from the client making necessary an increase of the working capital, caused by the big difference in the term between the (ideal) projected cash cycle compared to the real cash cycle. The current work was accomplished in a large company in the civil construction sector. The work was performed aimed at comparing the projected cycle flow to the real cycle flow, determining, therefore, the amount of financiai losses which was of R$ 48, 46 million updated {{for the end of the}} period that was analyzed representing a reduction in profitability of 3 %.

Everybody received an identical copy of the data. Thus, if one of the copies was illegally distributed, it was impossible to determine the initiator of the unauthorized distribution. Typical effects are software piracy, the unauthorized distribution of vector fonts for printers and the distribution of certain digital images, such as art collections and satellite data. The same holds true for the distribution of confidential texts or images. All possible kinds of digital data, such as computer software, fonts, texts, images [...] ...|$|R
