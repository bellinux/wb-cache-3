40|$|Corrosion {{protection}} of steel by glass flake (GF) containing coatings {{is widely used}} in marine atmosphere. Eventhough, the coatings conttaining glass flake are highly corrosion resistant, their performance is decreased due {{to the presence of}} pinholes and coating defects. It is well established that polyaniline containing coating is able to protect the pinhole defects in the coatings due to passivating ability of polyaniline. Hence a study has been made on the corrosion <b>protection</b> <b>ability</b> of steel using polyaniline-glass flake composite containing coating with 10 % loading of glass flake in epoxy binder. The polyaniline glass flake composite (PGFC) was synthesized by chemical oxidation of aniline by ammonium persulphate in presence of glass flake.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} 'F u. E' {{project was}} to improve the stress {{corrosion}} cracking of aluminium alloys by means of modification of the surface or marginal layers. The main results of the examinations are: cathodic corrosion protection (Mg) reduces the susceptibility against stress corrosion cracking and prevents initiation of cracks {{as long as the}} 'sacrificial anode' is not consumed; noble marginal layers (Si) result in a considerable delay of the incubation period for initiation of cracks. The corrosion <b>protection</b> <b>ability</b> of cathodic coatings is better than that of anodic layers; the <b>protection</b> <b>ability</b> of cathodic layers increases with the thickness of the layer; amorphous or partly amorphous marginal layers, studied with the Zr/Al/Si system, inhibit the initiation of stress corrosion cracking for a prolonged period; under the given conditions it seems that pitting is not a prerequisite for stress corrosion cracking of the investigated aluminium alloy.
