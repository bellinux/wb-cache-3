40|$|The present {{investigation}} explores {{a method to}} analyze colchicine in <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>saline</b> pH 6. 4. Based on the spectrophotometric characteristics of colchicine, λmax selected was 353. 8 nm. Analytical parameters validated were linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD, LOQ and robustness. The developed method demonstrated exemplary linearity in <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>saline</b> pH 6. 4 (R 2 = 0. 995) for concentration of 6 - 22 µg/ml with linear equation of y= 0. 037 x+ 0. 005.

40|$|A simple, economic, highly {{sensitive}} and highly selective method {{for the detection}} of caffeine has been developed at bare and Nafion-modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCE).

Modifications of the GCE surface with poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), Nafion, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were tested in order to evaluate possible sensor performance enhancements, Nafion giving the most satisfactory results. The effect of interfering compounds usually found in samples containing caffeine was examined at GCE without and with Nafion coating, to exclude interferences, and the sensors were successfully applied to determine the caffeine content in commercial beverages and drugs...|$|R

50|$|Para{{formaldehyde}} {{is not a}} fixative; it must be depolymerized to formaldehyde in solution. In cell culture, {{a typical}} formaldehyde fixing procedure would involve using a 4% formaldehyde solution in <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline</b> (PBS) on ice for 10 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical fixatives {{are used}} to {{preserve}} tissue from degradation, and to maintain {{the structure of the}} cell and of sub-cellular components such as cell organelles (e.g., nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria). The most common fixative for light microscopy is 10% neutral buffered formalin (4% formaldehyde in <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline).</b> For electron microscopy, the most commonly used fixative is glutaraldehyde, usually as a 2.5% solution in <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline.</b> These fixatives preserve tissues or cells mainly by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. The main action of these aldehyde fixatives is to cross-link amino groups in proteins through the formation of methylene bridges (-CH2-), in the case of formaldehyde, or by C5H10 cross-links in the case of glutaraldehyde. This process, while preserving the structural integrity of the cells and tissue can damage the biological functionality of proteins, particularly enzymes, and can also denature them to a certain extent. This can be detrimental to certain histological techniques. Further fixatives are often used for electron microscopy such as osmium tetroxide or uranyl acetate ...|$|E

50|$|In biology, BLOTTO is a {{blocking}} reagent {{made from}} nonfat dry milk, <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline,</b> and sodium azide.

Its use was first reported in 1984 by Johnson and Elder's lab at Scripps. Prior to 1984, partially purified proteins such as bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, or gelatin from various species had been used as blocking reagents but had the disadvantage of being expensive.|$|E

The clear gel formed is further sonicated after the addition of a small amount of <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline.</b> The organic phase is removed at 40 °C under low pressure.

50|$|Vascular {{corrosion}} casting {{requires the}} use of a solidifying material such as a resin. The most common resin used for vascular corrosion casting is Batson's 17. The process begins with the draining of blood from vessels to prevent blockage from clotting, this can be achieved by perfusing blood vessels with a physiological fluid such as <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline.</b> Subsequently, the blood vessels of interest are filled with resin (or alternate solidifying material). The resin is allowed to cure resulting in the blood vessel network containing a solid plastic material. Surrounding tissue is dissolved away using a corrosive chemical, commonly potassium hydroxide. Corrosion should not affect the resin, only dissolving tissue. The final product is a 3D network of blood vessels.|$|E

Biliverdin dimethyl ester is not soluble in common buffers, including <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline</b> (PBS) or Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). Add 1-5 μM biliverdin dimethyl ester in media or buffer containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Add 25 μM biliverdin (not as membrane permeant) to cells. Incubate smURFP with chromophore {{for as long as}} possible to increase protein accumulation caused by enhanced protein stability with chromophore. Leave chromophore for a minimum of 3 hours.

5000|$|The newly {{transferred}} blots {{are then}} soaked in a blocking solution; non-fat milk and bovine serum albumin are common blocking buffers. [...] This blocking solution assists with preventing non-specific binding {{of the primary}} and/or secondary antibodies to the nitrocellulose membrane. Once the blocking solution has adequate contact time with the blot, a specific competitor RNA is applied and given time to incubate at room temperature. During this time, the competitor RNA binds to the RNA binding proteins in the samples {{that are on the}} blot. The incubation time during this process can vary depending on the concentration of the competitor RNA applied; though incubation time is typically one hour. [...] After the incubation is complete, the blot is usually washed at least 3 times for 5 minutes each wash, in order to dilute out the RNA in the solution. Common wash buffers include <b>Phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline</b> (PBS) or a 10% Tween 20 solution. [...] Improper or inadequate washing will affect the clarity of the development of the blot. Once washing is complete the blot is then typically developed by x-ray or similar autoradiography methods.|$|E
50|$|For the inactivated vaccines, {{the virus}} is grown by injecting it, along with some antibiotics, into fertilized chicken eggs. About one to two eggs are needed to make each dose of vaccine. The virus {{replicates}} within the allantois of the embryo, which {{is the equivalent of}} the placenta in mammals. The fluid in this structure is removed and the virus purified from this fluid by methods such as filtration or centrifugation. The purified viruses are then inactivated ("killed") {{with a small amount of}} a disinfectant. The inactivated virus is treated with detergent to break up the virus into particles, and the broken capsule segments and released proteins are concentrated by centrifugation. The final preparation is suspended in sterile <b>phosphate</b> <b>buffered</b> <b>saline</b> ready for injection. This vaccine mainly contains the killed virus but might also contain tiny amounts of egg protein and the antibiotics, disinfectant and detergent used in the manufacturing process. In multi-dose versions of the vaccine, the preservative thimerosal is added to prevent growth of bacteria. In some versions of the vaccine used in Europe and Canada, such as Arepanrix and Fluad, an adjuvant is also added, this contains a fish oil called squalene, vitamin E and an emulsifier called polysorbate 80.|$|E
