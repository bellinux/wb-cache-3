25|$|Led by Masayuki Uemura, Nintendo's R {{team had}} been {{secretly}} {{working on a}} system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance {{that could not be}} surpassed by its competitors for at least a year. Uemura initially thought of using a modern 16-bit CPU, but instead settled on the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502, supplementing it with a custom graphics chip (the Picture Processing Unit). To keep costs down, suggestions of including a keyboard, modem, and floppy disk drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-pin expansion <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> {{on the front of the}} console for future add-on functionality such as peripheral devices.|$|E
5000|$|The {{terminology}} generally {{refers to}} variants of the Ethernet over twisted pair technology that use a female 8P8C <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> on a computer, or other network device.|$|E
50|$|The base model, the 4300, has the {{following}} specifications: 64MB of memory, parallel <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> and a 600 sheet paper tray. All the others with factory-installed features as indicated above have 80MB of memory.|$|E
40|$|In a {{system-on-a-chip}} (SOC) design, several {{to hundreds}} of design blocks or intellectual properties (IPs) are integrated to form a complex function. Prior to verify the functionality of the integrated IPs, {{it is very important}} to ensure the correctness of the <b>port</b> <b>connections</b> among these IPs. This paper addresses the problem of verification on <b>port</b> <b>connections</b> while IPs are integrated into a larger block or a system, and presents a new connection model and the corresponding error model for <b>port</b> <b>connections.</b> An algorithm providing the minimum pattern set and a general verification flow used to verify <b>port</b> <b>connections</b> are also proposed. 1...|$|R

50|$|From Oulu {{railway station}} the line {{continued}} via Tuira {{to the port}} of Toppila (A suburb of Oulu) on a 5 km stretch of track, two other short lines were also opened: a <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> to the Kokkola suburb of Ykspihlaja (5 km) and in 1887 to Jakobstad (Finnish Pietarsaari) from Bennas.|$|E
5000|$|Parallel port - Connecting {{through a}} {{parallel}} port is the slowest common transfer method. Early scanners had parallel port connections {{that could not}} transfer data faster than 70 kilobytes/second. The primary advantage of the parallel <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> was economic and user skill level: it avoided adding an interface card to the computer.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} re-released in 1994 as Falcon Gold a {{compilation}} which included Art of the Kill video digitized on the CD collection, along with Operation Fighting Tiger and the announcement for Falcon 4.0. It noted for their early multiplayer support, as {{even the first}} version supported two players via a null modem serial <b>port</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
50|$|AbsoluteTelnet is a {{software}} terminal client for Windows that implements Telnet, SSH 1 and 2, SFTP, TAPI Dialup and direct COM <b>port</b> <b>connections.</b> It is commercial software, originally released in 1999 {{and is still}} in regular development by Brian Pence of Celestial Software.|$|R
30|$|Services {{have a set}} {{of input}} ports, from which they read data, process it, and deliver it to a set of output <b>ports.</b> <b>Connections</b> deliver data from a service output port to a service input port and store the data as packets in FIFO queues.|$|R
25|$|Rotterdam has {{city and}} <b>port</b> <b>connections</b> {{throughout}} the world. In 2008, {{the city had}} 13 sister cities, 12 partner cities, and 4 sister ports. Since 2008, the City of Rotterdam doesn't forge new sister or partner connections. Sister and partner cities are not a priority in international relations.|$|R
50|$|The Empeg Car was a Linux-based {{unit that}} {{transferred}} MP3 tracks from the user's computer to the player via USB, Ethernet, or a serial <b>port</b> <b>connection.</b> Prices started at $1,100 US for the 4GB version and {{went all the}} way up to a $2,400 28GB unit that utilized two laptop drives (which was considered very large capacity at the time). The Empeg Car garnered quite a following and became beloved among the small group of users who bought one.|$|E
50|$|The GRGH&M {{operated}} on private {{right of way}} between Grand Rapids and Muskegon Heights, MI. In the cities of Grand Rapids and Muskegon, the line used the tracks of the local street railway systems. A branch line ran from Grand Haven Junction, just east of Fruitport, MI to Grand Haven, where the line had its <b>port</b> <b>connection.</b> Between cities, cars took electricity from a third rail; in towns and cities, power was received through overhead wires.|$|E
50|$|The draft working {{version of}} ZIPI was {{primarily}} aimed at addressing many limitations of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface). Unlike MIDI {{which uses a}} peer-to-peer serial <b>port</b> <b>connection,</b> ZIPI was designed to run over a star network with a hub in the center. This allowed for faster connection and disconnection, {{because there was no}} need to daisy-chain multiple devices. Ethernet 10Base-T was used at the physical layer, but the protocol did not depend on any physical implementation.|$|E

50|$|The {{practice}} {{of attempting to}} connect {{to a range of}} ports in sequence on a single computer is commonly known as port scanning. This is usually associated either with malicious cracking attempts or with network administrators looking for possible vulnerabilities to help prevent such attacks. <b>Port</b> <b>connection</b> attempts are frequently monitored and logged by computers. The technique of port knocking uses a series of port connections (knocks) from a client computer to enable a server connection.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of USB, the {{parallel}} interface was adapted to access a number of peripheral devices other than printers. Probably {{one of the earliest}} devices to use parallel were dongles used as a hardware key form of software copy protection. Zip drives and scanners were early implementations followed by external modems, sound cards, webcams, gamepads, joysticks, external hard disk drives and CD-ROM drives. Some of the earliest portable MP3 players required a parallel <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> for transferring songs to the device. Adapters were available to run SCSI devices via parallel. Other devices such as EPROM programmers and hardware controllers could be connected via the parallel port.|$|E
50|$|Late in 1984, Fiscal Information Inc., of Florida, {{demonstrated}} the Lt. Kernal hard drive subsystem for the C64. The Lt. Kernal mated a 10 megabyte Seagate ST-412 hard drive to an OMTI SASI intelligent controller, creating a high speed bus interface to the C64's expansion <b>port.</b> <b>Connection</b> of the SASI {{bus to the}} C64 was accomplished with a custom designed host adapter. The Lt. Kernal shipped with a disk operation system (DOS) that, among other things, allowed execution of a program by simply typing its name and pressing the Return key. The DOS also included a keyed random access feature {{that made it possible}} for a skilled programmer to implement ISAM style databases.|$|E

50|$|Following the Doctor V64's success, Bung {{released}} the Doctor V64 Jr. in December 1998. This was a cost-efficient condensed {{version of the}} original V64. The V64jr had no CD drive and plugged into the normal cartridge slot {{on the top of}} the Nintendo 64. Data was loaded into the V64jr's battery-backed RAM from a PC via a parallel <b>port</b> <b>connection.</b> The V64Jr had up to 512 megabits (64 MB) of memory storage. At the time this was done to provide for future Nintendo 64 carts that employed larger memory storage. The prohibitive high costs associated with ordering large storage carts kept this occurrence at a minimum. Only a handful of 512 megabit games were released for the Nintendo 64 system.|$|E
50|$|Time Compression Multiplexing (TCM) is the {{standard}} communication protocol used by Nortel digital telephones on a 2-wire tip and ring circuit. Each digital phone line terminates at a station port on a Digital Voice Card (DVC) in the PBX. The circuit interface operates by a transformer coupling which provides foreign voltage protection between the TCM loop and the digital line. The maximum length of a normal TCM loop is 300 m (1000 ft.) Minimum voltage at telephone 10 V DC and a TCM port should have between 15 and 20 V DC across the Tip and Ring with the phone disconnected. The <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> may be through a Punch-down block or a Modular connector called a TELADAPT plug (or socket) which is Nortel parlance for phone connector.|$|E

5000|$|The first monastic site became {{abandoned}} by the 10th century, and began to be eroded by the sea, a problem which also afflicted a new foundation of 1095. A site further inland was provided for a new foundation of Folkestone Priory by William de Abrincis in 1137, with a church dedicated to St Mary and St Eanswythe. Saint Eanswith's day falls on September 12. [...] Traditionally, this is the date on which her remains were translated to the new church in 1138. The priory was closed at the Reformation, and the Church became Folkestone Parish Church. During restoration work at the church in 1885 human remains were discovered in a lead reliquary, embedded within the church wall, which were identified as a 12th-century vessel, and the bones of a young woman. This led {{to the conclusion that}} they could be the translated relics of Saint Eanswith, hidden away at the Reformation. Eanswith is sometimes portrayed with a fish, along with her abbess's staff, crown and a book. This appears to be a recent attribute, from Folkestone's fishing <b>port</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanics}} {{behind a}} PCB milling machine are fairly straightforward {{and have their}} roots in CNC milling technology. A PCB milling system {{is similar to a}} miniature and highly accurate NC milling table. For machine control, positioning information and machine control commands are sent from the controlling software via a serial port or parallel <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> to the milling machine's on-board controller. The controller is then responsible for driving and monitoring the various positioning components which move the milling head and gantry and control the spindle speed. Spindle speeds can range from 30,000 RPM to 100,000 RPM depending on the milling system, with higher spindle speeds equating to better accuracy, in a nutshell the smaller the tool diameter the higher RPM you need. [...] Typically this drive system comprises non-monitored stepper motors for the X/Y axis, an on-off non-monitored solenoid, pneumatic piston or lead screw for the Z-axis, and a DC motor control circuit for spindle speed, none of which provide positional feedback. More advanced systems provide a monitored stepper motor Z-axis drive for greater control during milling and drilling as well as more advanced RF spindle motor control circuits that provide better control over a wider range of speeds.|$|E
50|$|When Ethernet became Fast Ethernet, it {{continued}} to use the Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) mechanism to manage traffic on the network cable. 100VG {{took advantage of the}} token passing concept that made ARCNET and Token Ring popular in order to provide consistent performance no matter how large the network became. It removed the token passing responsibility from the wiring and network nodes and placed it internal to the 100VG-AnyLAN hubs. These hubs contained the rotating token that never left the hub itself. When a node wanted to transmit data, it would raise a bit on its hub <b>port</b> <b>connection</b> that indicating to the hub that it was ready. As the token passed by a ready hub port, it would then open up traffic to that node. Because the token stayed within the hub, it did not have to traverse long cables going to every node as in ARCNET and Token Ring therefore becoming faster than those other deterministic networking standards and being less susceptible to cabling problems, network card failures, and line interference. Real-life load testing showed 100VG-AnyLAN reaching 95% of its theoretical network speed instead of about 45% as in Fast Ethernet when using hubs. Fast Ethernet switches were not commonplace at first because of high cost and limited availability so, initially, 100VG had a significant performance advantage.|$|E
50|$|Citect for DOS could {{communicate}} with various programmable electronic devices via the various serial links {{offered by the}} device; some through direct PC serial <b>port</b> <b>connections,</b> others through 3rd party PC based cards designed {{to communicate with the}} target programmable electronic device. Software drivers were written for many protocols; its ability to communicate with a variety of devices - and to have new drivers written when required - became a primary selling point for Citect.|$|R
