5|$|Bethesda {{released}} a teaser trailer to promote gameplay being shown at E3 2015 on June 14, 2015; the trailer depicted the double-barreled shotgun and the Revenant, a monster {{returning to the}} game. On June 14, around 15 minutes of gameplay footage were shown at E3. Regarding the progression system, Marty Stratton {{thought that it was}} an important to allow players <b>personalization</b> and customization.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and <b>personalization</b> while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{targeted}} a wider demographic profile {{with the}} first Nintendo DS (2004) than it had with the Game Boy line. Comparing 2008 life-to-date DS and DS Lite sales to the best-selling game console, Sony's PlayStation 2, showed potential in further expanding the Nintendo DS gaming population—particularly in Europe and the United States. To further promote the product line while expanding its gaming population, Nintendo created the DSi. Iwata has said that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles, so to encourage each family member to buy an individual handheld, Nintendo added <b>personalization</b> features to the DSi.|$|E
5|$|While the DSi's {{design is}} similar to that of the DS Lite, it {{features}} two digital cameras, supports internal and external content storage, and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop. Nintendo stated that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles. Its new functionality was intended to facilitate <b>personalization,</b> so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi. The handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to DS games with DSi-specific features and standard DS titles. The only exception to its backward compatibility are earlier DS games that required the GBA slot. Nintendo had sold over 41 million DSi and DSi XL units combined.|$|E
5|$|The CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made {{friendly}} overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party {{relations with}} the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949). In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them. For instance, the longevity of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party is attributed to the <b>personalization</b> {{of power in the}} al-Assad family, the strong presidential system, the inheritance of power, which passed from Hafez al-Assad to his son Bashar al-Assad, and the role given to the Syrian military in politics.|$|E

25|$|In Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2016, the 30-day {{grace period}} has been removed. If the {{operating}} system is not activated, there is a watermark showing the edition of Windows (although it does not show to activate) on desktop, <b>personalization</b> features (in PC settings , it is located under Personalize in Windows 8, under PC & devices > Lock screen in Windows 8.1, and under <b>Personalization</b> in Windows 10) are disabled. Entire Screen notification appears periodically, roughly once in 6 hours. However, {{the operating system}} otherwise functions normally.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} geocaching {{applications}} {{are available for}} geocache data management, file-type translation, and <b>personalization.</b> Geocaching software can assign special icons or search (filter) for caches based on certain criteria (e.g. distance from an assigned point, difficulty, date last found).|$|E
25|$|Tablet PC Input Panel {{has been}} updated to support AutoComplete.

CX added a leather-wrapped steering wheel, theft deterrent system, illuminated vanity mirrors, driver information center <b>personalization</b> and more.|$|E
25|$|Residences in Cottage Home are {{typified by}} spindlework porches, turned posts, gable ornaments, {{variegated}} and fishscale shingling and gingerbread trim, features {{often found in}} Queen Anne and Folk Victorian homes. These types of detailing were placed on simple folk homes as an inexpensive way to provide varied design and <b>personalization.</b> This practice was common in Victorian-era working-class neighborhoods such as Cottage Home.|$|E
25|$|In personalised medicine, {{diagnostic}} {{testing is}} often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies {{based on the}} context of a patient’s genetic content or other molecular or cellular analysis. The use of genetic information has {{played a major role in}} certain aspects of personalized medicine (e.g. pharmacogenomics), and the term was first coined in the context of genetics, though it has since broadened to encompass all sorts of <b>personalization</b> measures.|$|E
25|$|At the NBAA in March 2007 in Atlanta, Eurocopter {{unveiled}} L’Hélicoptère par Hermès, a special-edition VIP model {{designed by}} Hermès International, S.A.; {{it features a}} customized luxury four-place main cabin, a sliding glass partition, a corporate baggage hold, redesigned skid landing gear and other external changes. The launch customer for the type is Falcon Aviation Services (FAS), based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

25|$|On January 23, 2014, AOL {{acquired}} Gravity, {{a software}} startup that tracked users’ online behavior and tailored ads and content {{based on their}} interests, for $83 million. The deal, which included roughly 40 Gravity employees and their <b>personalization</b> technology, was CEO Tim Armstrong’s fourth largest deal since taking over the company in 2009. Later that year, AOL also acquired Vidible, which developed technology to help websites run video content from other publishers, and help video publishers sell their content to these websites. The deal, which was announced December 1, 2014, was reportedly worth roughly $50 million.|$|E
25|$|The core {{gameplay}} remains {{similar to}} its predecessor, albeit with minor adjustments to returning game mechanics. Injustice 2 introduces a new feature called the Gear System, a loot-dropping system that rewards players with costume pieces and equipment {{that can be}} used to customize characters' appearances and modify their abilities and stats. According to developers, the idea for implementing an RPG-style progression system into a fighting game had existed since before the fall of Midway Games, the original publisher for the Mortal Kombat series. Director Ed Boon also sought to incorporate gameplay mechanics used by multiplayer shooter games, such as <b>personalization,</b> character creation, loot, and leveling up, into the fighting game genre, which led to the development of the Gear System.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Passport Canada {{began to}} issue an updated version within Canada, which {{includes}} the digitally printed photo of the bearer embedded into the identification page of the booklet, holographic images, bar-coded serial number, and a second hidden photo of the bearer {{that could only be}} viewed under ultraviolet light. Canadian diplomatic missions abroad adopted this version in 2006. In March 2010, the passport was upgraded to include a new design of the identification page and more anti-counterfeit elements, such as the new colours of Optically Variable Ink and addition of laser perforated number. The cover, watermark, <b>personalization</b> technique and holographic laminate are same with the 2002 version. The 2010 version was also the last revision of MRP prior to the release of e-passports.|$|E
25|$|News360 uses a {{semantic}} analysis engine, developed in-house by the company, to analyze content aggregated from over 100,000 sources around the web. After performing named-entity recognition, classification, and cluster analysis, News360 uses a complex formula to rank stories, {{taking in the}} influence of the source, author, text quality and complexity, size and velocity of the story cluster and many other metrics. The system then takes the clustered and ranked set of stories and identifies a personalized selection for each user, based on their interest graph. The Interest Graph is initially constructed by collecting, with permission, user data from Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Google Reader or Evernote. As the user uses News360, additional data is collected from their behavior - as they read stories and give feedback, the interest graph becomes more and more accurate and attuned to their real interests, making the <b>personalization</b> more effective.|$|E
25|$|Each user had a {{personal}} space which they could modify and change suitably. The initial basic apartment, the Harbour Studio, was free and offered users limited options for customization and <b>personalization.</b> Users could invite any other Home user (even cross-region, unless space was region locked) to their personal space. Some personal spaces, such as the PlayStation Home Mansion, had a built-in TV that played content from PlayStation (such as PlayStation.Blog). Loot Interactive's personal spaces had a variety of content that could be played on their Entertainment on Demand (EOD) screens. Users could also place their own digital photographs in picture frames to display {{on the walls of}} their apartment. While the Harbour Studio and basic furniture was provided to all users free of charge, premium personal spaces and furniture could be bought from stores. Other ways to obtain furniture, decorative ornaments, or even entire personal spaces included winning mini-games in Home and from playing certain PS3 games that supported Home rewards.|$|E
25|$|All the {{handwriting}} recognition, speech recognition and pen & ink features from Windows XP Tablet PC Edition {{as well as}} accessories like Tablet PC Input Panel, Windows Journal, Sticky Notes and InkBall have been included. New features include gestures and pen flicks. There is intrinsic support for handwriting and ink, via the Ink Analysis API. A new control, the InkCanvas is made available by the API to add ink support to applications. Ink support can not only recognize handwriting and formatting, but also hand-drawn shapes which are converted to vector-graphics, rendered as the shape that {{was intended to be}} drawn. An update for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition containing Ink Analysis and StylusInput API support is also available. Windows Vista also supports handwriting <b>personalization,</b> which allows the recognizer to identify a user's handwriting. To improve recognition accuracy, users can correct individual characters or words, or submit handwritten samples; an opt in data collection feature is also available. Support for touchscreens is also included.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, the BBC also {{announced}} that users {{would eventually be}} required to sign in with a BBC ID account to use the service. CBBC and CBeebies television content is exempt from the login requirement, but all other content requires a user login. In May 2017, iPlayer began to encourage users to login with a BBC ID in preparation for this change. Media outlets suggested that the account requirement was intended to help the BBC collect personal information {{that could be used}} to trace those who are evading TV Licensing whilst using iPlayer; Andrew Scott, launch director of the ongoing myBBC initiative, stated that the BBC may use account email addresses, along with existing methods, to help identify iPlayer users who do not hold a television licence. However, he noted the account system was primarily intended to provide <b>personalization</b> features across BBC properties, such as content recommendations on iPlayer, and the ability to continue watching a programme on one device from where it was left off on another.|$|E
25|$|On November 11, 2011, Apple {{announced}} the iPod Nano (1st generation) Replacement Program, intended to address concerns over overheating batteries. Customers with affected devices can {{fill out a}} claim form to confirm eligibility for replacement. Defective devices will be replaced within six weeks and will carry 90-day warranties. Customers who have personalized iPod Nano devices {{will not be able}} to receive <b>personalization</b> on their replacement devices. During the replacement process, there have been several reports of users receiving an iPod Nano 6th generation as replacement instead of the expected 1st generation device that users sent in during the recall. Because using the iPod nano 6th generation with a Mac computer requires iTunes 10 or higher, which in turn requires Mac OS X Leopard system software, Apple will upgrade the system software of participants running earlier versions of OS X, on request but this leaves users that do not have access to iTunes without a working device (because Apple changed the hashing of the music database which prevented the 6th generation iPod Nano from being used with open source software via libgpod).|$|E
25|$|Video game {{rehabilitation}}, {{also known}} as gaming rehabilitation {{is a process of}} using common video game consoles and methodology to target and improve physical and mental weaknesses through therapeutic processes. Platforms that feature motion control, notably the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft's Xbox Kinect, and Sony's Eye Toy, and virtual reality scenarios have all been effective in this field of research. Methodologies have been applied to all age groups, ranging from toddler to elderly aged people worldwide and have been used in a variety of cases ranging from stroke rehabilitation, cerebral palsy and other neurological impairments, to people with tendinitis and multiple sclerosis. Researchers have promoted such technology based on the <b>personalization</b> of gaming systems to patients which allows for further engagement and interaction. Additionally, gaming consoles have the ability to capture real-time data and provide instant feedback to the patients using the systems. Currently, several researchers have performed case studies to demonstrate the benefits of this technology, however, repeat trials and experiments have shown that outcomes are easily replicated among several groups worldwide. Additionally, the outcomes have increased interest in the field, growing experiments beyond simple case studies to experiments with larger participant basis.|$|E

500|$|Few methods {{exist for}} {{interface}} <b>personalization.</b> The Finder allows each icon {{to be assigned}} a color, but the desktop background is limited to an 8x8 pixel color tiled pattern (color patterns were introduced in System 5), and standard window frames are all black and white. However, many [...] "INIT" [...] extension files existed to add color and customization. System 7 later allowed the user to change the color and various {{other aspects of the}} user interface. By 1989, the System 6 user interface was in need of a change. In comparison to the NeXTSTEP operating system of the time, System 6 did not make use of sound, and its user interface presented several limitations in terms of file management and the way windows were displayed.|$|E
500|$|Engadget was {{similarly}} positive, {{noting that the}} upgrade process was painless, and that Windows10's user interface had balanced aspects of Windows8 with those of previous versions with a more mature aesthetic. Cortana's always-on voice detection {{was considered to be}} its [...] "true strength", also citing its query capabilities and <b>personalization</b> features, but noting that it was not as pre-emptive as Google Now. Windows10's stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows 8 counterparts, and for supporting windowed modes. The Xbox app was also praised for its Xbox One streaming functionality, although recommending its use over a wired network due to inconsistent quality over Wi-Fi. In conclusion, it was argued that [...] "Windows10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's so much more than that. It's also a decent tablet OS, and it's ready for a world filled with hybrid devices. And, barring another baffling screwup, it looks like a significant step forward for mobile.

500|$|Privacy {{advocates and}} other critics have {{expressed}} concern regarding Windows10's privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data. Under the default [...] "Express" [...] settings, Windows10 is configured to send various information to Microsoft and other parties, including the collection of user contacts, calendar data, and [...] "associated input data" [...] to personalize [...] "speech, typing, and inking input", typing and inking data to improve recognition, allowing apps to use a unique [...] "advertisingID" [...] for analytics and advertising <b>personalization</b> (functionality introduced by Windows 8.1) and allow apps to request the user's location data and send this data to Microsoft and [...] "trusted partners" [...] to improve location detection (Windows8 had similar settings, except that location data collection did not include [...] "trusted partners"). Users can opt out from most of this data collection, but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft, and this cannot be disabled on non-Enterprise versions of Windows10. Microsoft's privacy policy states, however, that [...] "Basic"-level telemetry data is anonymized and cannot {{be used to identify}} an individual user or device. The use of Cortana also requires the collection of data [...] "such as your device location, data from your calendar, the apps you use, data from your emails and text messages, who you call, your contacts and how often you interact with them on your device” to personalize its functionality.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{keeps the}} same collectibles and cheats as before, {{with the addition}} of several new cheats, such as exaggerated physics that fling enemies backwards as they are killed, and replacing the heads of non-player characters with watermelons. The game offers full PlayStation Network trophy and Xbox Live achievement support (trophies of which had been absent from the PlayStation 3 version of Modern Warfare, due to the game releasing before they were introduced), with the inclusion of several new challenges. The multiplayer features the same weapons, killstreaks, perks, and game modes. Existing modes present in other Call of Duty installments such as [...] "Kill Confirmed", [...] "Gun Game" [...] and [...] "Hardpoint", as well as new modes like [...] "Prop Hunt" [...] (in which players hide as inanimate objects from the opposing team) are also included. The multiplayer offers a greater variety of customization options for profile <b>personalization,</b> character skins, and weapon camouflage. A number of weapons not featured in Modern Warfare were also added. All new content can be unlocked through completing challenges, crafting by consuming [...] "Parts" [...] that the player can earn, or by opening supply drops, while existing content from the original remain unlockable only through gaining in experience. The online includes 20 prestige levels, an increase from the 10 available in Modern Warfare. Entering each new prestige level resets all unlockables that have been previously made available, but retains customization items and any weapons, attachments, or perks that have been permanently unlocked, either by crafting or {{through the use of a}} token awarded upon reaching the next level.|$|E
