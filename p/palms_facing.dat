25|$|Movement {{types are}} {{generally}} paired, with one being {{the opposite of}} the other. Body movements are always described in relation to the anatomical position of the body: upright stance, with upper limbs to the side of body and <b>palms</b> <b>facing</b> forward.|$|E

25|$|A second study, {{conducted}} by Moscovitch and Behrmann, investigated the reference frame of neglect {{with respect to}} the somatosensory system. Eleven patients with parietal lobe lesions and subsequent hemispatial neglect were analyzed during this experiment. A double simultaneous stimulation procedure was utilized, during which the patients were touched lightly and simultaneously on the left and right side of the wrist of one hand. The patients were tested both with their <b>palms</b> <b>facing</b> down and with their <b>palms</b> <b>facing</b> up. This experimental condition allowed the scientists to determine whether neglect in the somatosensory system occurs {{with respect to the}} sensory receptor surface (egocentric) or with respect to a higher-order spatial frame of reference (allocentric). The results of this experiment showed the hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli on the contralesional side of space, regardless of hand orientation. These findings suggest that, within the somatosensory system, stimuli are neglected with respect to the allocentric, spatial frame of reference, in addition to an egocentric, sensory frame of reference. Ultimately, the discoveries made by these experiments indicate that hemispatial neglect occurs with respect to multiple, simultaneously derived frames of reference, which dictate {{the nature and extent of}} neglect within the visual, auditory, and tactile fields.|$|E

25|$|ASL {{does have}} {{a limited number of}} concatenative affixes. For example, the agentive suffix (similar to the English '-er') is made by placing two B or 5 hands in front of the torso, <b>palms</b> <b>facing</b> each other, and {{lowering}} them. On its own this sign means 'person'; in a compound sign following a verb, it is a suffix for the performer of the action, as in 'drive-er' and 'teach-er'. However, it cannot generally be used to translate English '-er', as it is used with a much more limited set of verbs. It is very similar to the '-ulo' suffix in Esperanto, meaning 'person' by itself and '-related person' when combined with other words.|$|E
2500|$|The {{butterfly}} stroke has three major parts, the pull, the push, and the recovery. These {{can also be}} further subdivided. From the initial position, the arm movement starts very similarly to the breast stroke. At the beginning the hands sink a little bit down with the <b>palms</b> <b>facing</b> outwards and slightly down at shoulder width, then the hands move out to create a Y. This is called catching the water. The pull movement follows a semicircle with the elbow higher than the hand and the hand pointing towards {{the center of the}} body and downward to form the traditionally taught [...] "keyhole".|$|E
2500|$|The Kohen {{raises his}} hands, with the <b>palms</b> <b>facing</b> {{downward}} and the thumbs of his outspread hands touching. The four fingers on each hand are customarily {{split into two}} sets of two fingers each (thus forming the letter Shin (שׁ), an emblem for Shaddai, [...] "Almighty [...] "), or sometimes they are arranged to form an overlapping lattice of 'windows.' This Jewish ceremony is sometimes called Nesiat Kapayim, the [...] "lifting of the hands." [...] The Jewish tradition states the Divine Presence would shine through the fingers of the priests as they blessed the people, {{and no one was}} allowed to look at this out of respect for God.|$|E

The pedestal on which the Emerald Buddha deified is decorated with Garuda (the mythical half-man half-bird form, a steed of Rama, who holds his mortal enemy Naga the serpent in his legs) motifs It is central to Thai Buddhism. The image made with a circular base has a smooth top-knot that is finished with a [...] "dulled point marking {{at the top of the}} image". A third eye made in gold is inset over the elevated eyebrows of the image. The image appears divine and composed, with the eyes cast downward. The image has a small nose and mouth (mouth closed) and elongated ears. The hands are seen on the lap with <b>palms</b> <b>facing</b> upwards.|$|E
2500|$|Collect (sometimes {{called the}} Oration). Towards {{the end of}} the singing of the Gloria in excelsis (or Kyrie if the Gloria be omitted) the sacred ministers head {{to the center of the}} altar in a line. When the singing has finished, the Celebrant turns away from the altar and says, with hands {{extended}} to shoulder width only (Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, V, 1), [...] "Dominus vobiscum" [...] ("The Lord be with you"), to which is replied, [...] "Et cum spiritu tuo" [...] ("And with thy spirit"). The Celebrant then, with hands extended to no more than shoulder width and <b>palms</b> <b>facing</b> each other, reads the collect or prayer of the day. (Any time the verb read is used, this should be interpreted as sing in monotone, often with note variations at certain punctuations, and a special tone for the ending. The entirety of the Mass, as heard by the congregation, is sung—except the blessing, which is sung only by a bishop—though the priest recites quietly for himself everything that the choir sings, apart from short responses such as [...] "Et cum spiritu tuo.") ...|$|E

A crowd of pilgrims preventing our touching it that time, we raised our hands to our ears, in the first position of prayer, and then lowering them, exclaimed, “O Allah (I do this), in Thy Belief, and in verification of Thy Book, and in Pursuance of Thy Prophet’s Example—may Allah bless Him and preserve! O Allah, I extend my Hand to Thee, and great is my Desire to Thee!
