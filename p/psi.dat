5|$|During the 1973–1975 biennium, {{pressure}} {{was put on}} Kappa Kappa <b>Psi</b> chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of {{an equal number of}} members from Kappa Kappa <b>Psi</b> and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa <b>Psi</b> and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa Kappa <b>Psi</b> voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.|$|E

40|$|Postoperative spine infections (<b>PSIs)</b> are a {{frequent}} and dreaded complication of spine surgery. Although different {{studies have been}} published, the prevalence of <b>PSIs</b> {{is thought to be}} about 5 % for most spine surgical procedures. Different risk factors have been identified for <b>PSIs.</b> Among the others, extensive soft tissue dissection, longer operative time, soft tissue devitalization, and use of surgical instrumentation have been associated with higher risks of infection. Direct inoculation during surgery is the common infection route for <b>PSIs.</b> Gram-positive cocci (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and beta-hemolytic streptococci) are the most common pathogens. Gram-negative bacteria also play a role in <b>PSIs</b> and may be associated with systemic illness and multisystem organ failure. A high level of suspicion is of paramount importance in early diagnosis of <b>PSIs.</b> Clinical symptoms of <b>PSIs</b> may be subtle and the infection may become apparent only in its late stages. Early diagnosis is the most important prognostic factor for <b>PSIs.</b> Although blood tests (i. e. ESR, CRP, and white blood cell count) and imaging studies (most commonly MRI) can be useful, it must be clear to the clinician that diagnostic modalities, either tissue biopsy or blood cultures, are of the utmost importance for diagnosing <b>PSIs</b> and devising a correct antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy with early bracing (or bed rest) is the most commonly used treatment method for <b>PSIs.</b> Nevertheless, a more aggressive surgical treatment may be required in some patients. The goals of surgical treatment are to help the eradication of the infection, provide an adequate wound closure, and maintain spine column mechanical stability...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic semantic {{approach to the}} licensing of Polarity Sensitive Items (<b>PSIs)</b> and n [...] words of Negative Concord. We propose that <b>PSIs</b> are unified by the semantic scale property, {{which is responsible for}} their sensitivity to the context; we develop a semantic licensing analysis based on Fauconnier's (1975) scales and Ladusaw's (1979) notion of entailment. The first part of the paper concludes with a formalization of semantic licensing in the sense of Ladusaw (1979) within HPSG (see, e. g., Pollard and Sag (1994)) which allows for a uniform treatment of the licensing of <b>PSIs</b> and n [...] words of Negative Concord and accounts for the disambiguating nature of <b>PSIs</b> in scopally ambiguous sentences.

Of these, he labelled two stars close together Lambda, and assigned Omicron, <b>Psi</b> and Omega to three stars, which subsequent astronomers such as Benjamin Gould felt were too dim to warrant their letters. A different star was subsequently labelled <b>Psi</b> Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} hospital adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) on health outcomes, particularly patient safety indicators (<b>PSIs).</b> We find evidence of a positive impact of EMRs on <b>PSIs</b> via decision support rather than care coordination.

These findings indicate the negligible impacts for EMRs found by previous studies focusing on the Medicare population and/or mortality do not apply in all settings...|$|R

40|$|Eukaryotic genomes {{are divided}} into {{independent}} transcriptional domains by DNA elements known as insulators. The gypsy insulator, a 350 -bp element isolated from the Drosophila gypsy retrovirus, contains twelve degenerate binding sites for the Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw) ] protein. Su(Hw) associates with over 500 non-gypsy genomic sites, the functions of which are largely unknown. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified 37 putative Su(Hw) insulators (<b>pSIs)</b> that represent regions containing clustered matches to the gypsy insulator Su(Hw) consensus binding sequence. The majority of these <b>pSIs</b> contain fewer than four Su(Hw) binding sites, with only seven showing in vivo Su(Hw) association, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. To understand {{the properties of the}} <b>pSIs,</b> these elements were tested for enhancer-blocking capabilities using a transgene assay system. In a complementary set of experiments, effects of the <b>pSIs</b> on transcriptional regulation of genes at the natural genomic location were determined. Our data suggest that <b>pSIs</b> have complex genomic functions and, in some cases, establish insulators. These studies provide the first direct evidence that the Su(Hw) protein contributes to the regulation of gene expression in the Drosophila genome through the establishment of endogenous insulators...|$|R

5|$|Alexei Stukov was {{the vice}} admiral and second-in-command of the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary force.

A man of Russian descent, his {{military}} career primarily revolves around secret research, though he is also noted as an excellent tactician. A close friend of DuGalle, Stukov will debate situations with the admiral but will subordinate himself to his friend's higher rank. Stukov becomes suspicious of the motives of Samir Duran after the latter convinces DuGalle to destroy the <b>psi</b> disruptor. Believing the device to be the UED's best hope to conquer the Zerg, Stukov instead takes the <b>psi</b> disruptor to Braxis but is tracked down and shot dead by Duran.

40|$|Objective: The Patient Safety Indicators (<b>PSIs)</b> {{developed}} by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality identify potential patient safety events through administrative records. We sought {{to determine whether there}} were racial disparities in patient safety event rates in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals. Methods: We explored 5 years of VHA inpatient data for significant differences between racial/ethnic groups in their odds of experiencing <b>PSIs.</b> Results: No racial group had consistently higher or lower odds of experiencing <b>PSIs.</b> For example, African Americans had significantly higher odds of decubitus ulcer (OR = 1. 35, P < 0. 0001) and postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) /deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR = 1. 23, P < 0. 0001) but significantly lower odds of accidental puncture or laceration (OR = 0. 69, P = 0. 0003) compared with whites. Conclusion: Although significant differences between racial/ethnic groups in the odds of experiencing <b>PSIs</b> were few, the underlying causes of the disparities that were found must be explored to understand how they can be eliminated and to improve patient safety for all patients...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{syntactic}} distribution of amwu-N-to/-irato/-ina phrases, which are representative polarity sensitive items (<b>PSIs)</b> in Korean, and accounts for their semantic characteristics {{in terms of}} “arbitrary choice quantification ” and “concession. ” In the first section, we extensively illustrate the distributional behaviour of the <b>PSIs</b> in various constructions and roughly generalize the distribution in terms of “(anti/non-) verdicality. ” Section 2 claims amwu denotes an arbitrary choice quantifier, and the particles –to/-irato/-ina as “concessive” markers, so the compounds denote a special element in a pragmatic scale determined by context/situation. Section 3, based on the pragmatics of scalar implicature, accounts for the apparent ambiguity of <b>PSIs</b> between “universal ” and “existential ” readings, and further characterizes the difference among the concessive markers –to/-irato/-ina in terms of “quantity/quality scale. ” 1.
