5|$|Ethiopian historians such as Taddesse Tamrat (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie {{have argued}} that modern Ethiopian studies were an {{invention}} of the 17th century and originated in Europe. Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 Storia d'Etiopia a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies. The philosopher Messay Kebede likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars {{to the understanding of}} Ethiopia's past. But he also criticized the perceived scientific and institutional bias that he found to be pervasive in Ethiopian-, African-, and Western-made historiographies on Ethiopia. Specifically, Kebede took umbrage at E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the Kebra Nagast, arguing that Budge had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba although the Kebra Nagast itself did not indicate such a <b>provenience</b> for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin. Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by Semitic immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien elements of both uncertain extraction and negroid origin.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{excavation}} techniques {{require that}} the precise locations of objects and features, known as their provenance or <b>provenience,</b> be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see Primary Laws of Archaeology). Likewise, their association, or relationship with nearby objects and features, needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which artifacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its stratigraphy; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.|$|E
25|$|The Ceramic Technology Laboratory was {{established}} in 1977 {{under the direction of}} Dr. Prudence Rice, then UF professor of Anthropology. Pottery analysis plays an integral role in archaeological research at the museum as it constitutes the predominant material remaining at most archaeological sites investigated by museum curators. In addition pottery constitutes a very significant proportion of the Anthropology collections. The Ceramic Technology Laboratory is equipped for basic paste characterization studies: binocular microscope for gross identification of temper or paste constituents; a petrographic microscope for precise mineral identification in thin section; an electric furnace used for refiring experiments and for comparative investigation of clay samples collected from the vicinity of archaeological sites. Analysis of physical and mineralogical properties of the pottery are undertaken to provide precise data to address research questions regarding chronology, <b>provenience</b> or manufacturing origins, processes of production, culture change, and the development of social and economic complexity in prehistoric Florida, the Southeastern US, and the Caribbean Basin. The department is committed to the continuance of this research program as the capacity for in-house specialized analysis of pottery enhances the competitiveness for research grants.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, the British Museum does {{acknowledge}} {{the possibility that}} the relief depicts either Lilith or Ishtar, but prefers a third identification: Ishtar's antagonist and sister Ereshkigal, the goddess of the underworld. This interpretation is {{based on the fact that}} the wings are not outspread and that the background of the relief was originally painted black. If this were the correct identification, it would make the relief (and by implication the smaller plaques of nude, winged goddesses) the only known figurative representations of Ereshkigal. Edith Porada, the first to propose this identification, associates hanging wings with demons and then states: [...] "If the suggested <b>provenience</b> of the Burney Relief at Nippur proves to be correct, the imposing demonic figure depicted on it may have to be identified with the female ruler of the dead or with some other major figure of the Old Babylonian pantheon which was occasionally associated with death." [...] No further supporting evidence was given by Porada, but another analysis published in 2002 comes to the same conclusion. E. von der Osten-Sacken describes evidence for a weakly developed but nevertheless existing cult for Ereshkigal; she cites aspects of similarity between the goddesses Ishtar and Ereshkigal from textual sources – for example they are called [...] "sisters" [...] in the myth of [...] "Inanna's descent into the nether world" [...] – and she finally explains the unique doubled rod-and-ring symbol in the following way: [...] "Ereshkigal would be shown here at the peak of her power, when she had taken the divine symbols from her sister and perhaps also her identifying lions".|$|E

40|$|During {{excavations}} at the Canaanite-Phoenician coastal {{settlement of}} Sarepta, {{a wide range}} of imported wares were discovered. Their <b>proveniences</b> have been identified by comparisons with ceramic assemblages from areas outside of Phoenicia. It is expected that identification of the <b>proveniences</b> and dating of the wares will document the patterns of trade and contact beween Sarepta and the Eastern Mediterranean at large. ^ The earliest material is a small group of MB/LB Cypriote wares. Mycenaean pottery forms the largest Bronze Age assemblage and indicates active commercial ties between Sarepta and Mycenaean civilization during the 14 th- 13 th centuries B. C. Smaller amounts of Mycenaean IIIB late and IIIC early pottery were also found. In the early Iron Age, contacts are mainly with Cyprus. A group of 7 th century B. C.

2500|$|As {{the quality}} and style of the objects was {{generally}} considered to have {{stood the test of}} time, concerns over the antiquity of the great majority of the objects reduced over the years. [...] The issue was revived in 2003 when the archaeologist Oscar Muscarella, employed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for 40 years, was reported in The Times, in a story by Peter Watson, to have [...] "labelled as mostly fake" [...] the treasure. [...] However he was attacked by the Director of the Metropolitan, Philippe de Montebello, who said Muscarella, a long-standing critic of museums' tolerance and even encouragement of the trade in illegal antiquities, only remained there because of the [...] "exigencies of academic tenure", and was himself criticised for suppressing debate. [...] In an article on the Oxus Treasure published in 2003 Muscarella goes nothing like as far, but does fiercely attack the assumed unity of the treasure and the narratives of its <b>provenience,</b> and is sceptical of the authenticity of some of the votive plaques (especially the largest in the illustration above).|$|E

40|$|Halophytes {{thrive in}} a wide range of {{habitats}} and climates, which may largely determine the seed mineral content, and hence influence both their germination capacity and their subsequent establishment. In order to assess this hypothesis, we performed a comparative study on three Tunisian <b>proveniences</b> of the perennial oilseed halophyte Crithmum maritimum L. The ion (Cl-, K+, and Na+) contents in seeds and fruits were determined and their likely relationship to germination capacity was addressed. Whether seeds were sown in distilled water or under moderate salt solution (100 mM NaCl) germination of the three <b>proveniences</b> was negatively correlated with the seed K+, Na+ and Cl- content. The spongy coats (fruits) were found to accumulate much more Na+ and Cl- than seeds (up to aprox. 8 - and 11 - fold, respectively for Na+ and Cl-), indicating that efficient mechanisms may take place in order to protect seeds from the harmful accumulation of salt. In addition, the higher selectivity for K+ vs. Na+ within seeds as compared to fruits seemed to be a determining factor in germination capacity of this species...|$|R
2500|$|The {{number of}} sources for more precise dating and the {{attribution}} of <b>provenience</b> increase during the 17th century. Safavid carpets were presented as diplomatic gifts to European cities and states, as diplomatic relations intensified. In 1603, Shah Abbas presented a carpet with inwoven gold and silver threads to the Venetian doge Marino Grimani. European noblemen began ordering carpets directly from the manufactures of Isfahan and Kashan, whose weavers were willing to weave specific designs, like European coats of arms, into the commissioned peces. Their acquisition was sometimes meticulously documented: In 1601, the Armenian Sefer Muratowicz was sent to Kashan by the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa in order to commission 8 carpets with the Polish royal court of arms to be inwoven. The Kashan weavers did so, and on 12 September 1602 Muratowicz presented the carpets to the Polish king, and the bill to the treasurer of the crown. Representative Safavid carpets made of silk with inwoven gold and silver threads were erroneously believed by Western art historians to be of Polish manufacture. Although the error was corrected, carpets of this type retained the name of [...] "Polish" [...] or [...] "Polonaise" [...] carpets. The more appropriate type name of [...] "Shah Abbas" [...] carpets was suggested by Kurt Erdmann.|$|E
2500|$|From a Western perspective, {{there is}} not much {{detailed}} information about Kurdish village rugs, probably because there is insufficient information to identify them, as they have never been specifically collected in the West. Usually, rugs can only be identified as [...] "northwest Persian, probably Kurdish". As is generally the case with village and nomadic rugs, the foundation of village rugs is more predominantly of wool. Kurdish sheep wool is of high quality, and takes dyes well. Thus, a rug with the distinct features of [...] "village production", made of high-quality wool with particularly fine colours may be attributed to Kurdish production, but mostly these attributions remain educated guesswork. Extensive use of common rug patterns and designs poses further difficulty in assigning a specific regional or tribal <b>provenience.</b> A tendency of integrating regional traditions of the surrounding areas, like Anatolian or northwestern Persian designs was observed, which sometimes show distinct, unusual design variations leading to suggest a Kurdish production from within the adjacent areas. Also, northwestern Persian towns like Hamadan, Zenjan or Sauj Bulagh may have used [...] "Kurdish" [...] design features in the past, but modern production on display at the Grand Persian Exhibitions seems to focus on different designs.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that in {{archaeology}} (North American archaeology and anthropological archaeology throughout the world), when the US spelling <b>provenience</b> is used it has a related but subtly different sense to provenance. Archaeological researchers use <b>provenience</b> to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site, whereas provenance covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the <b>provenience</b> or find spot is recorded (even videoed) with great precision, but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. Any given antiquity may therefore have both a <b>provenience</b> (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). In some cases, especially where there is an inscription, the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground, as well as those relating to its history after rediscovery.|$|E

50|$|Oriental rugs {{from various}} <b>proveniences</b> often share common motifs. Various {{attempts}} have been made to determine the potential origin of these ornaments. Woven motifs of folk art undergo changes through processes depending on human creativity, trial and error, and unpredictable mistakes, but also through the more active process of stylization. The latter process is well documented, as the integration into the work of rural village and nomad weavers of patterns designed in town manufactures can be followed on carpets which still exist. In the more archaic motifs, the process of pattern migration and evolution cannot be documented, because the material evidence does not exist any more. This has led to various speculations about the origins and “meanings” of patterns, often resulting in unsubstantiated claims.|$|R
