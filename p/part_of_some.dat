5|$|The state {{currently}} {{has no plans}} to build Interstate 605. WSDOT however is widening SR18 between I-5 and I-90, with only the segment between the Issaquah Hobart Road and I-90 yet to be completed, creating a full limited-access freeway between I-5 and I-90, southeast of I-405. While SR18 has been a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> I-605 proposals, it only allows drivers to bypass the Greater Seattle area on the southern and eastern sides.|$|E
5|$|The tantra {{practices}} are secretive, subject to speculations and criticism. Scholars variously attribute such criticism to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> observers, {{as well as}} unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas. These {{are some of the}} reasons many Hindus question the relevance and historicity of Tantra to their tradition.|$|E

5|$|Along with Democrats John Stuart Williams, William Lindsay, and J. Proctor Knott, and Republican Robert Boyd, McCreary was {{nominated}} for a U.S. Senate seat in 1878. Democrats were divided by sectionalism and initially unable to unite behind one of their four candidates. After more than a week of caucusing among Democratic legislators, the nominations of McCreary, Knott, and Lindsay were withdrawn, and Williams was elected over Boyd. Historian Hambleton Tapp opined that the withdrawals were likely a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> kind of deal among legislators, although the details of the deal, if it ever existed, were not made public.|$|E
5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E
5|$|The {{process by}} which an {{organisation}} achieves sufficient prominence that {{it is able to}} exercise naked power can be described as the rule of three phases (Russell 1938:63). According to this rule, what begins as fanaticism on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> crowd eventually produces conquest by means of naked power. Eventually, the acquiescence of the outlying population transforms naked power into traditional power. Finally, once a traditional power has taken hold, it engages in the suppression of dissent by the use of naked power.|$|E

5|$|The word kosher is also <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> common product names. Sometimes {{it is used}} as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, {{meaning the}} process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt {{is a form of}} salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E
5|$|Hartnett was an {{all-around}} player, performing well both offensively and defensively. Known for {{his strong}} and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the National League's catchers in caught stealing percentage {{and was the}} first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season. During the course of his career, he took <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> of the most memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; Babe Ruth's Called Shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell's strike-out performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean's career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star Game. But the greatest moment of Hartnett's career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning to put the Cubs in first place. The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto Wrigley Field, became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.|$|E
5|$|James Winchester {{arrived in}} Gibraltar on January 15, to inquire when Mary Celeste might be {{released}} to deliver its cargo. Flood demanded a surety of $15,000, money Winchester did not have. He became aware that Flood thought he might have deliberately engaged a crew that would kill Briggs and his officers, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> conspiracy. On January 29, during a series of sharp exchanges with Flood, Winchester testified to Briggs's high character, and insisted {{that he would not}} have abandoned the ship except in extremity. Flood's theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of the stains found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood. A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague, the American consul in Gibraltar, from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy. In Shufeldt's view the marks on the bow were not man-made, but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship's timbers.|$|E
