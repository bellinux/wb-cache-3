50|$|In {{the novel}} Joan and Peter (1918) by H. G. Wells, Peter's <b>parents</b> <b>die</b> in a sailing accident. As {{it is not}} known which <b>parent</b> <b>dies</b> first, a legal fiction is applied {{maintaining}} that the husband, being a man and therefore stronger, lived longer. This decision results in the father's will determining Peter's legal guardian. However, later in the novel a witness to the accident declares seeing the mother floundering some time after the father has disappeared, and so the legal fiction is overturned and the mother's will is followed, providing Peter with a new legal guardian. Wells was in fact in error as to the English law, which instead presumes that the older person died first.|$|R
