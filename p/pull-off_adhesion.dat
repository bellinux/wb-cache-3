The tests were carried out on specially prepared model specimens of concrete floor. In order to vary <b>pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> in the specimens the surface of the base layer was prepared in four versions. The aim of the investigations was the neural prediction of the <b>pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> of the concrete layers in floors on the basis of nondestructive tests. This is of practical importance since in this way the condition of the surface of the tested floor is not impaired...|$|E

Contrary to these models, the fluid thickness between two parallel plates {{was found to have}} little effect on the adhesive failure strength and a positive effect on time to failure. Target surface roughness was found to have a detrimental effect on <b>pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> and a positive effect for shearing loads.

In the present letter, we characterize the metallic nanopore structure of nickel using an atomic force microscope.

Accelerated weathering {{has been used to}} expose coatings and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transformed Infrared) and <b>pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> measurements have been successfully used to study the primers and the following intercoat adhesion. Different variables have been investigated, being the chemical composition of the coating the most influent one. The intercoat adhesion has proved to decrease after short exposures to weathering and IR data have been used to assess the overcoatability of different formulations.

Results implied the key role of oxide layer in maintaining the high level of corrosion protection. Also the detrimental {{influence of}} the inherent contamination caused by wet abrasive blasting method was shown as a cause of early failure of protective properties.

40|$|A Thin Spray-on Liner (TSL) {{is defined}} as a {{chemically}} based layer or coating (3 - 5 mm) that is sprayed onto the rock surface to support mining excavations (Saydam and Docrat, 2007). Since the introduction, TSLs have received success in some applications in hard rock mines; however, their use has been slow in coal mining. The adhesion strength between a TSL and a rock surface is an important parameter controlling the design and performance of liner support systems. The in situ adhesion tests have been conducted to study the bonding between a TSL material and the coal substrate in an underground coal mine in NSW.

40|$|The adhesion, friction, and micromechanical {{properties}} of ceramics, both in monolithic and coating form, are reviewed. Ceramics are examined {{in contact with}} themselves, other harder materials, and metals. For the simplicity of discussion, the tribological {{properties of}} concern in the processes are separated into two parts. The first part discusses the <b>pull-off</b> force (<b>adhesion)</b> and the shear force required to break the interfacial junctions between contacting surfaces. The role of chemical bonding in adhesion and friction, {{and the effects of}} surface contaminant films and temperature on tribological response with respect to adhesion and friction are discussed. The second part deals with abrasion of ceramics. Elastic, plastic, and fracture behavior of ceramics in solid state contact is discussed.

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} repulsion between similar surfaces with ionizable surface groups interacting across aqueous solutions is calculated for plane parallel and curved surfaces {{for the case}} in which the solution phase is at thermodynamic equilibrium, but the charged surface is not in equilibrium with the solution. Simulations are made for approaching and retracting oxidic surfaces for which the (equilibrium) surface chemistry is described by a standard 2 -pK model. Population balances describe the concentration of each surface species {{as a function of the}} rates of the different reactions with the ions in solution. Approaching surfaces experience a higher repulsion than predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium, with the upper limit being the repulsion at a constant surface charge (at very high approach velocities). For retracting surfaces the {{electrostatic repulsion}} is lower than that for equilibrium and may decrease to zero when the surfaces are sufficiently discharged at contact and pulled apart fast enough. In that case, and with the attractive van der Waals force still operating, a net attractive force is predicted, which might explain the <b>pull-off</b> force (<b>adhesion</b> force) often measured in the atomic force microscope and the surface force apparatus...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) {{has attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention for upgrading and/or rehabilitating steel structures following its successful application for the strengthening of concrete structures. It is vital to maintain a sound bond between the CFRP and the steel substrate during service by selecting appropriate adhesives. The effect of dynamic loading (e. g. impact) on such bond is not well understood. This paper describes an experimental investigation of the efficiency of the bond between steel and normal modulus CFRP sheets under dynamic tensile loads of various loading speeds. The <b>pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> testing method was adopted. It was found that significant enhancement in adhesion bond strength for two types of resins was achieved at high strain rates.

40|$|Fusion Bond Epoxy (FBE) {{coating system}} {{was exposed to}} 5 % sodium {{hydroxide}} at elevated temperature for 30 days. The result of exposure showed formation of adhere deposit layer, a discolored zone underneath and remaining un-affected bulk of the coating. The deterioration of the coating was characterized using analytical techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), <b>pull-off</b> <b>adhesion,</b> and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results obtained indicated chemical deterioration of the coating in the discolored zone and leaching of low molecular weight coating component forming deposit layer. Although the adhesion strength and barrier property were not affected, the polymer matrix in the affected zone undergoes severe changes in its surface microstructure, primary chemical structure, and glass transition temperature. This may inflict serious impairment of the coating functional properties and premature failure of the coating in long term exposure...|$|E

By varying process parameters, tuneable thicknesses, from 5 to 20 Î¼m, have been obtained with uniform and homogeneous surface without crack or bridges. Surface characteristics of pHEMA coating onto metal surface have been investigated through FTIR-ATR, contact angle measurement, SEM, EDS and AFM. Moreover, results from Single-Lap-Joint and <b>Pull-Off</b> <b>adhesion</b> tests as well as calorimetric analysis of glass transition temperature suggested that pHEMA deposition is firmly adhered on metallic surface.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{and removal}} of particles from surfaces is a contemporary problem in many industrial applications like Semiconductor manufacturing, Bioaerosol removal, Pharmaceuticals, Adhesives and Petroleum industry. The {{complexity of the}} problem is due to the variety of factors like roughness, temperature, humidity, fluid medium etc. that affect pull-off of particles from surfaces. In particle removal from surfaces using fluid motion, the dynamic effects of particle separation will play an important role. Thus it is essential to study the dynamic effects of particle removal. Velocity of pull-off and force duration effects are two important dynamic factors that might affect <b>pull-off.</b> Particle <b>adhesion</b> studies can be made using the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The velocity of pull-off and force duration can be varied while making the AFM measurements. The objective of the current work is to obtain the dependence of pull-off force on pull-off velocity. Experiments were conducted using AFM and the data obtained from the experiments is processed to obtain plots for pull-off force vs. particle size and pull-off force vs. pull-off velocity. The pull-off force is compared with the predictions of previous contact adhesion theories. A velocity effect on pull-off force is observed from the experiments conducted...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} shortcoming in {{the majority}} of commercially-available acrylic water-borne copolymer systems for exterior wood is their inability to maintain their good adhesion properties to the wood substrate under the influence of moisture (wet adhesion). The formation of covalent bonds between water-borne acrylic dispersions and softwood (European pine heart- and sapwood) and hartwood (dark red meranti, mahogany) species mainly comprise polar-reactive hydroxyl-groups at the cellulose, and hemi-cellulose polymeric chains are highlighted. The improvement in early wet adhesion bonding by adding functional monomers into acrylic polymeric chains and alternatively by wood surface activation are analysed, interpreted and discussed by a modified <b>adhesion</b> <b>pull-off</b> test method following ISO 24624 and by surface tension measurements.

40|$|A new {{torsion balance}} for study of {{adhesion}} in ceramics is discussed. A torsion wire and a linear variable differential transformer {{are used to}} monitor load and to measure <b>pull-off</b> force (<b>adhesion</b> force). The investigation suggests that this torsion balance is valuable in studying the interfacial properties of ceramics in controlled environments such as in ultrahigh vacuum. The pull-off forces measured in dry, moist, and saturated nitrogen atmosphere demonstrate that the adhesion of silicon nitride contacts remains low at humidities below 80 percent but rises rapidly above that. The adhesion at saturation is 10 times or more greater than that below 80 percent relative humidity. The adhesion in a saturated atmosphere arises primarily from the surface tension effects of a thin film of water adsorbed on the surface. The surface tension of the water film was 58 x 10 to the minus 5 to 65 x 10 to the minus 5 power. The accepted value for water is 72. 7 x 10 to the minus 5 power N/cm. Adhesion characteristics of silicon nitride in contact with metals, like the friction characteristics of silicon carbide to metal contacts, {{can be related to}} the relative chemical activity of metals in ultrahigh vacuum.

The potential of palm oil to be used as coatings raw material such as alkyd is limited due to low unsaturated side on fatty acid chains. To overcome this limitation, palm oil was modified through transesterification process to produce polyol. Acrylated isocyanate (urethane oligomer) was then grafted onto polyol to produce polyurethane with vinylic ends. The polyurethane was formulated with different cross-linkers (reactive diluents) and cured under UV radiation. The effect of three different diluents; monoacrylate, diacrylate and triacrylate on the properties of cured polymer were studied in this research.

I to I mN in a vacuum of 10 (exp - 1) to 10 (exp - 9) Pa (approx. 10 (exp - 10) to 10 (exp - 11) torr) at room temperature. An Auger electron spectroscopy analyzer incorporated directly into an adhesion-measuring vacuum system was primarily used to define the chemical nature of the surfaces before and after adhesion measurements. The surfaces were cleaned by argon ion sputtering. With a clean aluminum-clean -sapphire couple the mean value and standard deviation of pull-off forces required to separate the surfaces were 3015 and 298 micro-N, respectively. With a contaminated aluminum-clean sapphire couple these values were 231 and 241 micro-N. The presence of a contaminant film on the aluminum surface reduced adhesion {{by a factor of}} 13. Therefore, surfaces cleanliness, particularly aluminum cleanliness, {{played an important role in}} the adhesion of the aluminum-sapphire couples.

The Fourier transform infrared spectra and the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the plasma coatings were compared with those of conventionally synthesised poly(AMA). The influence of the monomer feed on the ester, the vinyl and the allyl functionalities of the coatings were investigated. Plasma coatings showed lower concentration of non-reacted allyl groups than conventional poly(AMA) suggesting a more cross-linked network. <b>Pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> tests were performed after the deposition of the a topcoat to evaluate the potential use of the AMA based coatings as adhesion promoter.

Full-coupled solutions are obtained through the Griffith energy balance between elastic and surface energies. The analysis shows that, for a special case, i. e., the direction of pulling normal to the contact interface, the full-coupled solution can be approximated by a non-oscillatory one, in which the critical pull-off force, pull-off contact half-width and adhesion strength can be expressed explicitly. For the other cases, i. e., the direction of pulling inclined to the contact interface, tangential tractions have significant effects on the pull-off process, it should be described by an exact full-coupled solution. The elastic anisotropy leads to an orientation-dependent <b>pull-off</b> force and <b>adhesion</b> strength.

Improvements in thermal and mechanical properties have been found by incorporation of small amounts of nanosize materials in to such adhesives.

This paper presents {{part of an ongoing}} research to address the effect of adding nanomaterials to modify a thermosetting adhesive used for bonding carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites to concrete members. Vapour grown carbon fiber (VGCF) was chosen to modify the adhesive. Different concentrations of carbon nanofibres PR- 24 XT-LHT were adopted for modification. The effect of nanomaterials inclusion on the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesives was investigated using the dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) technique. It was found that a slight reduction occurred in the Tg by adding 0. 5 to 2 wt% of VGCF to the adhesive.

Some samples were examined metallographically to help elucidate {{and explain the}} results. As deposited coatings exhibit pull-off strengths typically between 16 and 20 MPa with failure occuring (cohesively) within the coating. Heat treatment in argon at 650 C results in {{a slight increase in}} coating (cohesive) strength of about 30 percent to 21 to 27 MPa. Heat treatment in air at 650 C results in a dramatic increase in strength to over 30 MPa, exceeding the strength of the epoxy used in the pull test. Cross section metallographic analyses show that no microstructural coating changes occur following the argon heat treatments, however, exposure to air at 650 C gives rise to the formation of a second chromium-rich phase precipitate within the PS 304 NiCr constituent which provides a strengthening effect and a slight (approximately 5 percent) coating thickness increase. Subsequent heat treatments do not result in any further coating changes.

40|$|Styrene-acrylic {{emulsion}} polymers {{are widely}} used for exterior coatings because of their good exterior durability. Different monomer combinations can produce a variety of copolymer products for coating applications. A broad range of functional chemical groups can also {{be incorporated into the}} polymer chain to improve coating adhesion to the substrate, sites for crosslinking, as well as compatibility with other polymer materials. The versatility of styrene-acrylic latex chemistry, {{from the point of view}} of polymer chain microstructure, polymerization process manipulation, and molecular weight and particle size control, leaves much to be exploited to meet the challenges of producing products with desired structures and application-related material properties and minimizing cost and waste. Systematic studies, as well as newer and more sophisticated chemical, physical, colloidal and computer-oriented analytical and modelling tools will allow the correlation of synthesis, microstructure and performance properties. This study looks at the semi-continuous emulsion polymerization of styrene (St) -butyl acrylate (BA) with methacrylic acid (MAA) to produce latex for coating applications. The objectives were to investigate the factors influencing the polymerization process, latex polymer and coating adhesion properties. Statistical experimental design techniques were used to study their relations in order to improve coating adhesion. An experimental screening design was first used to investigate the effects of five variables, i. e., St/BA ratio, MAA contents, pH, emulsifier content, and chain transfer agent (CTA) content on various product properties. The impact of these variables on the carboxylic acid distribution in the latex, the average latex particle diameter, the molecular weight and distribution of the polymer products, and the glass transition temperature of the polymer were studied using a 25 - 1 IV fractional factorial experimental design. The results from the screening design also showed that inside the chosen experimental region, the <b>pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> between the latex coating and a polycarbonate substrate was influenced by the pH of the emulsion polymerization. Reactions under increased pH produced latexes with higher adhesion forces to the polycarbonate substrate. Following the screening design of experiments, three variables, i. e., St/BA ratio, MAA content, and pH, were further investigated through a Box-Behnken design over a wider experimental region. Their influence on the latex polymer properties when the CTA and the emulsifier contents were held constant was studied. Copolymers with a broader range of Tg were produced. Experimental results also showed how the pH affected the distribution of carboxylic acid in the polymer particles. An empirical model was obtained through the regression analysis to correlate <b>pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> to the three variables. The viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer products was studied by dynamic mechanic analysis (DMA). This was a step to correlate the polymer structural properties, which were affected by variables in the emulsion polymerization with their performance properties such as the adhesion to polycarbonate substrate. It was found that ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions which led to the interfacial crosslinking of particles improved the cohesive strength of the latex film and hence the coating adhesion performance. This was also affected by the carboxylic group distribution in different St/BA/MAA emulsion polymerization systems. This work shows that a combination of techniques offers the opportunity to investigate the influence of different variables to improve the coating adhesion properties of St/BA/MAA based latexes. The empirical model based on the extensive experimental program has led to an improved understanding of the St/BA/MAA emulsion polymerization and its latex polymer product properties...|$|E
40|$|Plastics {{have become}} a {{universal}} material {{for use in a}} myriad of commercial and consumer products. One such product, exterior siding, is the focus of this project. Although siding products were originally made from wood, vinyl siding, which offered superior performance, was introduced in the 1950 â€™s. More recently, polypropylene (PP) siding has been introduced; PP provides a stronger product, which allows for deeper patterns and better edge detailing. PP siding, compared to traditional wood siding, doesnâ€™t warp, crack, or degrade as easily with extended exposure to the elements, and is cheaper to maintain. However, even plastic siding must be coated. The requirements of a coating for siding are good adhesion, durability, and a suitable appearance. However, polypropylene, like many plastics, has a low surface energy, making wetting and coating adhesion difficult. One of the many ways to increase the surface energy of polypropylene, thus increasing wettability and adhesion, is plasma treatment. The primary focus of this project was to study how plasma treatment improved adhesion of a water-reducible coating. This coating represented a product used in commercial siding. The surface tension of the panels was increased from ~ 30 dynes/cm to 60 + dynes/cm with plasma treatment. This increased the adhesion of the coating to the polypropylene panel from virtually no adhesion to almost perfect adhesion. Adhesion was tested according to ASTM D 3359, the crosscut adhesion test. <b>Pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> testing (ASTM D 4541 - 09) was also conducted, using a Deflesko PosiTest AT-A automatic adhesion tester. The average force needed to remove a dolly from a plasma treated panel was 233 Â± 47 psi (1, 605 Â± 325 kPa), compared to 92 Â± 26 psi (634 Â± 179 kPa) for non-treated and corona treated panels. The sponsor of the project provided Cal Poly with 16 different compositions of polypropylene containing different amounts of UV stabilizers, adhesion promoters, and lubricants. The effect of substrate composition on coating adhesion and performance was measured. Crosscut adhesion testing results revealed all polypropylene compositions improved from virtually no adhesion to perfect adhesion after plasma treatment. <b>Pull-off</b> <b>adhesion</b> testing revealed the adhesion force of all compositions improved from less than 100 psi to greater than 200 psi. One polypropylene composition, Category 16, resulted in unusually high pull-off forces. This composition was investigated using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and FT-IR spectroscopy. XPS was used to examine the surface composition between non-treated and plasma treated PP panels. It was observed that plasma treatment provides a larger amount of oxygen species and nitrogen when compared to untreated panels. The category 16 panels did not reveal any significant surface differences compared to the category 7 panels (which represented the standard production material). FT-IR spectroscopy of the category 16 panels also showed no unusual characteristics. The secondary focus of this project was to study the durability of coated, plasma treated polypropylene siding. Accelerated weathering testing was conducted on 12 of the 16 different compositions of polypropylene. Changes in gloss and the LAB colorspace of coated, plasma treated polypropylene panels of different compositions, upon exposure to long-term weathering conditions, were monitored via ASTM G 53 using a Q-Panel lab product QUV/se weathering tester. After 2400 hours, all PP compositions tested shared negligible changes in color, but the gloss of each category panel showed a steady increase. An approach to improve durability of siding is to apply a clearcoat over already coated PP panels. This approach was tested in a limited manner by adding a clearcoat to coated, plasma treated polypropylene panels. These panels were then exposed to a variety of common, household cleaning agents using a modified double rub test (ASTM D 4752 and ASTM D 5402). The samples with a clearcoat showed improved cleaning agent resistance compared to samples without the clearcoat...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{generalized}} {{plane strain}} JKR model is established for non-slipping adhesive contact between an elastic transversely isotropic cylinder and a dissimilar elastic transversely isotropic half plane, {{in which a}} pulling force acts on the cylinder with the pulling direction at an angle inclined to the contact interface. Full-coupled solutions are obtained through the Griffith energy balance between elastic and surface energies. The analysis shows that, for a special case, i. e., the direction of pulling normal to the contact interface, the full-coupled solution can be approximated by a non-oscillatory one, in which the critical pull-off force, pull-off contact half-width and adhesion strength can be expressed explicitly. For the other cases, i. e., the direction of pulling inclined to the contact interface, tangential tractions have significant effects on the pull-off process, it should be described by an exact full-coupled solution. The elastic anisotropy leads to an orientation-dependent <b>pull-off</b> force and <b>adhesion</b> strength. This study could not only supply an exact solution to the generalized JKR model of transversely isotropic materials, but also suggest a reversible adhesion sensor designed by transversely isotropic materials, such as PZT or fiber-reinforced materials with parallel fibers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the thermal and mechanical properties of nanoclay-modified adhesives {{for use in}} civil engineering applications, in particular {{in relation to the}} strengthening of concrete members with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP). In this paper, the effect of the addition of different percentages of a layered silicate nanoclay, Nanomer I. 30 E (0, 1, 2. 5, 5, and 7. 5 wt%), to an epoxy adhesive used to bond CFRP to concrete members was explored. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the adhesive structure. The glass transition temperature (Tg), measured by DSC, was found to decrease with nanoclay addition. Measurements from XRD and TEM identified an intercalated/exfoliated structure of the nanoclay, Nanomer I. 30 E in the epoxy matrix. The adhesive tensile strength showed a reduction with the addition of nanoclay at elevated temperatures, however, improvement in tensile modulus was found for all nanoclay addition. The bond-loss temperature of CFRP/concrete systems with modified adhesive was observed to be lower than for the control (0 % NC) using <b>adhesion</b> (<b>pull-off)</b> tests at elevated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The JKR (Johnsonâ€“Kendallâ€“Roberts) {{method is}} widely {{used to measure the}} work of {{adhesion}} between soft materials. In this article, the JKR theory is summarized and three-dimensionless parameters are proposed to design a proper JKR experiment. The study of adhesion between two commonly used soft elastomers PDMS (Sylgard 184) and Ecoflex 0300 are obtained with the measured pull-in and pull-off forces from a dynamical mechanical analyzer. The effect of base-polymer-to-curing-agent mixing ratio, i. e., crosslinking density, and solvent extraction are examined. It is found that the pull-in adhesion stays more or less constant for all contact pairs we measured. Although the effect of crosslinking density is not significant for pristine PDMS, it is very obvious that the higher self-adhesion can be found in less crosslinked PDMS after solvent extraction. Such an effect is even more drastic for PDMS-to-Ecoflex adhesion. An adhesion mechanism is proposed to explain these complex adhesion behaviors. It is concluded that the entanglement and interpenetration of tethered chains could enhance the <b>pull-off</b> work of <b>adhesion,</b> whereas those of free chains cannot. As a byproduct of the JKR experiment, Youngâ€™s moduli of PDMS of different mixing ratios are also obtained by a two point formula and the results are comparable with those obtained by standard tensile tests...|$|R
