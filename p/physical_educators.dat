40|$|As {{teachers}} and society become {{more comfortable with}} various technologies, {{it is likely that}} technology will be implemented in all areas of the educational curriculum as well as physical education. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the extent to which individual physical education teachers in public schools were using technology as a tool for their students' education. Individuals who were currently teaching physical education in public schools in Indiana completed the Computer Usage Survey on the web (N = 400). To determine types of technology used, potential uses for technology, difference in the implementation of technology by gender and teaching experience, usage of the Internet, and physical educators' attitudes toward technology, statistics including descriptive statistics, Chi-square (X), and One-way ANOVA were used (p <. 05). The results of this study show that <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> were more likely to use PC computers (both desktop and laptop) over Apple computers. Participant responses demonstrated a high usage of hardware devices such as Printers, hard drives, and CD drives, however, 5. 25 floppy drives, external hard drives, Hand-held computers (i. e. Pocket PC or Companion PC), Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and smart boards were rarely used by <b>physical</b> <b>educators.</b> A significant positive relationship resulted between use of technology at school and at home. Significant differences were observed between male and female <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> in types of technology used and purposes for using technology. Use of technology was significantly lower in the experienced <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> group. Most of the <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> use the Internet and they usually use it for research and teaching/assessment ideas. <b>Physical</b> <b>educators</b> in Indiana believed that technology has an important role and can enhance their teaching with implementation of technology.

40|$|BACKGROUND: At school, {{physical}} education (PE) teachers and coaches may be key supports for physical activity. Unfortunately, PE teachers may endorse negative stereotypes {{and attitudes toward}} overweight youth. These biases may influence the amount of instruction <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> provide to students and their participation in PE or other physical activity. METHODS: This study assessed <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> ’ (N = 162) ability and performance expectations, attributions, and attitudes toward overweight and non-overweight students. RESULTS: <b>Physical</b> <b>educators</b> endorsed inferior ability expectations for overweight students compared to non-overweight students. Poorer performance expectations were limited to overweight female targets, but when controlling for participant characteristics, this effect became marginally significant for overweight male targets. There was a trend such that participants endorsed more external attributions for the abilities and performance of overweight female students, yet this effect was reduced to marginal significance when controlling for participant characteristics. Participants endorsed more negative attitudes for both overweight males and females compared to non-overweight youth. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> ’ expectations, attributions, and attitudes regarding students may be negatively influenced by youth body weight, and differ by student gender. The potential effect of <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> ’ weight bias on adolescent participation in physical activity {{and its implications for}} students ’ physical health, academic achievement, and social development are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} competencies which are perceived as important by Thai adapted <b>physical</b> <b>educators,</b> to determine the differences that exist in the way physical education professors and adapted <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> judge the level of each competency, and to recommend a set of competencies for adapted <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> in Thailand. The questionnaire, Competencies for an Adapted Physical Educator in Thailand containing 59 competencies based on 6 - point Likert type scales, was used in this study. The fifty-nine competencies were translated from the Competencies for an Adapted Physical Education Specialist, modified by Dempsey (1986) from the 1981 AAHPERD Guidelines for Adapted Physical Education. The meaning equivalence of the competencies was validated by using the Delphi method along with the back translation technique. The computed reliability coefficients of the questionnaire, using the Hoyt-Stunkard's technique was. 9577. The study's population consisted of 31 College and university professors who have taught adapted physical education courses to college/university students and 40 adapted <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> who have conducted physical activities for people with disabilities in schools and institutions for the disabled in Thailand. Data collection was completed in an eight-week period. Means, standard deviations, a t-test and the Bonferroni Method of Multiple Comparisons were used to treat these data. The results showed that 1) the competencies were perceived as extremely important by professors and adapted <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> in Thailand, 2) the perceptions of professors and <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> on the competency statements individually and overall were similar since the null hypotheses were not rejected, and 3) the relationship of both groups on the importance of each competency and competency category was high with a Spearman rank correlation of. 7842, and. 8857 respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The role {{of schools}} and {{physical}} education curriculum in the promotion of physical activity (PA) has been widely recognized {{in recent years and}} schools have been identified as an appropriate setting for the promotion of PA (Cale, 2000). <b>Physical</b> <b>educators</b> have the unique role of working with children in a physically active environment, and have been called upon to work towards increasing PA behaviors of children outside of the school-based environment. Thus, {{this study was designed to}} examine the factors associated with out-of-school PA promotion by <b>physical</b> <b>educators.</b> The purpose of the first study was to identify the predictive factors associated with <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> assigning PA homework. The results revealed that the most important factors associated with physical educators' assigning homework behavior were (a) knowledge of how to assign PA homework; (b) teachers' attitude toward PA homework; and (c) expectations from significant others including; school administrators, parents, other teachers, and people of importance to the physical educator. The second study tested a theoretical model of physical educators' intention and behavior promoting out-of school PA using a framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The results of the study indicated that the importance of (a) knowledge of available PA programs for students; (b) physical educators' attitude toward physical activity promotion; and (c) subjective norm. It is recommended that <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> have knowledge of local community-based PA programs and extracurricular-based PA programs. <b>Physical</b> <b>educators</b> also need to have an understanding of how to age-appropriate PA homework to their students. Given the importance of subjective norm including support from school administrators, parents, other teachers, and people of importance to the physical educator, it is recommended that <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> work towards gaining support from these people regarding PA promotion...|$|E
