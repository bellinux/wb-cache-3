Further finds come from the advanced civilisation preserved in the pile dwellings in Switzerland. Another extant fragment from the Neolithic was found in Fayum, at a site dated to about 5000 BCE. This fragment is woven at about 12 threads by 9 threads per cm in a plain weave. Flax was the predominant fibre in Egypt at this time (3600 BCE) and continued popularity in the Nile Valley, though wool became the <b>primary</b> <b>fibre</b> used in other cultures around 2000 BCE. Weaving was known in all the great civilisations, but no clear line of causality has been established. Early looms required two people to create the shed and one person to pass through the filling. Early looms wove a fixed length of cloth, but later ones allowed warp to be wound out as the fell progressed. The weavers were often children or slaves. Weaving became simpler when the warp was sized.|$|E

40|$|Commonly, {{fibre hemp}} (Cannabis sativa) is not {{considered}} {{for the production of}} soft and easy-care textiles. However, initial tests in the textile industry have shown that certain processes allow improvement in the everyday-wear characteristics of hemp textiles. In the framework of the EU R&D project Hemp-sys [QLRT- 01 - 01363] the potential of hemp as a feedstock in textile processing is investigated. Therefore, a detailed study on the effects of agronomy and fibre extraction processing on fibre properties for textile processing has been carried out. To relate the crop growing conditions with fibre quality and productivity it is required that information is obtained on hemp bast fibre formation. At various stages of the plant development the fibre development has been monitored by microscopic techniques. The two distinct bast fibre types occurring in hemp-the so called primary and secondary fibres-show different and independent development. The <b>primary</b> <b>fibres</b> appear earlier in the development in the rapid growth stage and are formed from the primary meristem in the outer layers (phloem). <b>Primary</b> <b>fibres</b> are thick, extremely long and with compact cell walls and small lumen and are present from bottom to top of the plant. In contrast, the secondary fibres are formed in later stages during thickness growth from the secondary meristem. Secondary fibres are thinner, shorter and with higher lignin content than the <b>primary</b> <b>fibres.</b> In early developmental stages secondary fibres only occur {{at the bottom of the}} stem. Substantial secondary fibre formation is observed at the start of flowering or when the plants grow taller than 2. 25 m and/or thicker than approximately 1 cm. Based upon these observations a selection of conditions can be made for growing and harvesting of hemp to obtain the best quality fibre for textile processing. To produce a crop with maximum amount of <b>primary</b> <b>fibres</b> free from secondary fibres, the recommended practice is to grow hemp at high seed density to avoid thickness growth and to harvest the hemp stems around flowering of the plants...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we try to}} model the spatial pattern formed by slow {{oxidative}} (SO) fibres in pig muscle. Unlike the other mammals, the muscle fibre pattern in porcine muscle is characterised by cluster of SO fibres dispersed throughout the tissue. The biological interests of modelling such a configuration are, on one hand, its peculiarity, and, on the other hand, the effective contribution of such fibre patterns {{to the quality of}} pork meat. Transverse sections of muscle samples are stained to enable discrimination of the fibres of interest. The distribution of the SO clusters is investigated in low magnification cross-sectional images (x 5). Each image is regarded as a spatial point process where points are the centroid of the corresponding clusters. Edge effects are minimised by discarding from the analysis those clusters that are touching the edges of the image. The minimum distance found between cluster centres suggests that clusters are distributed throughout the tissue according to some repulsive process. Higher magnification images (x 10) are used to study SO fibre clusters in terms of their characteristics, namely the number of constituent fibres,  total area and shape. One arrangement of particular interest is that, given the number of constituent fibres, cluster cells are arranged in a concentric configuration. It is believed that the most centrally located fibre in a cluster corresponds to its respective <b>primary</b> <b>fibre,</b> the first constituent cell in any cluster. In this thesis, we suggest models to fit the porcine pattern of fibres based on the minimum inter-cluster distance.   All these models are based on using the minimum inter-primary distance established in {{the very beginning of the}} cluster process. These models vary essentially in the way in which cells are added to the <b>primary</b> <b>fibre.</b>   Basically, cluster cells are either (1) members of the primary’s neighbourhood or are (2) neighbour cells of any of the fibres in the cluster. For each of the methods described above we consider a nearest neighbour (NN) version, i. e., (1) from the primary’s neighbourhood cells are added in increasing order and (2) each new cell added to the cluster is the NN of a fibre of the cluster.

40|$|The anisotropic, inhomogeneous, {{multiply}} collagenous {{architecture of}} the annulus reflects the complex pattern of mainly tensile stresses developed in this region of the disc during normal function. Structural and mechanical responses of fully hydrated in-plane sections taken from within single lamellae of the outer annulus of healthy bovine caudal discs have been investigated using a micromechanical technique in combination with simultaneous high-resolution differential interference contrast optical imaging. Responses both along and across (i. e. transverse to) the primary direction of the mono-array of collagen fibres were studied. Stretching along the alignment direction revealed a biomechanical response consistent with the behaviour of an array whose overall strength is governed primarily by the strength of embedding of the fibres in the vertebral endplates, rather than from interfibre cohesion along their length. The mono-aligned array, even when lacerated, is highly resistant to any further tearing across the alignment direction. Although not visible in the relaxed mono-arrays, transverse stretching revealed a highly complex set of interconnecting structures embodying hierarchical relationships not previously revealed. It is suggested that these structures might {{play an important role}} in the containment under pressure of the nuclear contents. The dramatic differences in rupture behaviour observed along vs. across the <b>primary</b> <b>fibre</b> direction are consistent with the known clinical consequences arising from varying degrees of annular wall damage, and might also explain various types of disc herniation.

In common with many species of adult lens, the embryonic fibres possessed a remarkable array of interlocking devices which were present from {{an early stage of}} development. The <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>fibres</b> both acquired projections during the maturation process, although the types of interlocking devices were different in the two populations.

Transmission electron microscope grids placed beneath the lenses allowed a direct assessment of lens transparency during development. In the early stages, the lens appeared opaque, uniform transparency becoming apparent between 6 - 7. 5 days of incubation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{short-term}} maternal feed intake during the peri-conception period {{on the development}} of ovine fetal muscle at mid-gestation was investigated. Superovulated donor Merino ewes (n = 24) were fed a roughage/grain pelleted diet (10. 1 MJ ME/kg dry matter) at either 1. 5 × maintenance (H; high) or 0. 5 × maintenance (L; low) from 18 days before until 6 days after ovulation. Embryos were transferred to recipient ewes (n = 60) on day 6. Singleton fetuses were collected on day 75 of gestation and placental weights, fetal body dimensions and fetal organ and muscle weights recorded. The number, type and size of muscle fibres and the dry matter, RNA, DNA and protein content in the semitendinosus muscle were determined. Maternal feed intake did not influence body dimensions, organ development or muscle weights in the fetus. However, L feed intake decreased total muscle fibre number in the fetus by approximately 20 % (P = 0. 06) compared to H feed intake. This resulted from a reduced secondary to <b>primary</b> <b>fibre</b> ratio (P < 0. 05) and indicated that secondary fibre formation occurred at a reduced rate in L fetuses. In addition, protein:DNA ratio tended to be lower in muscles of L fetuses (P < 0. 1).

The potential mechanisms by which nutritional availability during this period may influence subsequent myogenic development are discussed. S. P. Quigley, D. O. Kleemann, M. A. Kakar, J. A. Owens, G.

Reduction of structural weight at safe design is one possibility {{to reach this}} objective which is aimed by the following two running research projects: the EC project “COCOMAT” and the ESA study “Probabilistic Aspects of Buckling Knock Down Factors”. These projects develop improved concepts and tools for a fast and reliable simulation of the buckling and the postbuckling behavior of thin-walled structures up to collapse, respectively, which allow the exploitation of considerable reserves in <b>primary</b> <b>fibre</b> composite structures in aerospace applications. For the validation of the concepts and tools, a sound database of experiments is needed which is also performed within these projects. This paper focuses on the experimental activities within these projects performed at the buckling test facility of the Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems (DLR). It presents an overview about the DLR buckling, postbuckling and collapse tests which are already finished and gives an outlook to the results which are expected {{until the end of}} the running projects.

The unstiffened cylinders are more related to space applications (e. g.
