40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a new SH operation, called spherical {{harmonics}} scaling, to shrink or expand a spherical function in frequency domain. We show that this problem can be elegantly formulated as a linear transformation of SH projections, which is efficient to compute and easy to implement on a GPU. Spherical harmonics scaling is particularly useful for extrapolating visibility and radiance functions at a sample point to points closer to or farther from an occluder or light source. With SH scaling, {{we present a}}pplications to lowfrequency shadowing for general deformable object, and to efficient approximation of <b>spherical</b> <b>irradiance</b> functions within a mid-range illumination environment...|$|R

40|$|There is a well-known, {{intuitive}} geometric {{correspondence between}} high-frequency QNMs of Schwarzschild black holes and null geodesics that reside on the light-ring : the real {{part of the}} mode's frequency relates to the geodesic's orbital frequency, and the imaginary part of the frequency corresponds to the Lyapunov exponent of the orbit. For slowly rotating black holes, the QNM real frequency is a linear combination of a the orbit's precessional and orbital frequencies, but the correspondence is otherwise unchanged. In this paper, we find {{a relationship between the}} QNM frequencies of Kerr black holes of arbitrary (astrophysical) spins and general <b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> orbits, which is analogous to the relationship for slowly rotating holes. To derive this result, we first use the WKB approximation to compute accurate algebraic expressions for large-l QNM frequencies. Comparing our WKB calculation to the leading-order, geometric-optics approximation to scalar-wave propagation in the Kerr spacetime, we then draw a correspondence between the real parts of the parameters of a QNM and the conserved quantities of <b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> orbits. At next-to-leading order in this comparison, we relate the imaginary parts of the QNM parameters to coefficients that modify the amplitude of the scalar wave. With this correspondence, we find a geometric interpretation to two features of the QNM spectrum of Kerr black holes: First, for Kerr holes rotating near the maximal rate, a large number of modes have nearly zero damping; we connect this characteristic to the fact {{that a large number of}} <b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> orbits approach the horizon in this limit. Second, for black holes of any spins, the frequencies of specific sets of modes are degenerate; we find that this feature arises when the <b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> orbits corresponding to these modes form closed (as opposed to ergodically winding) curves.

40|$|Sea ice {{may be an}} {{oxidising}} medium {{owing to}} sunlight-driven reactions occurring within the ice. UV light transmission and albedo (320 - 450 nm) are reported for first-year sea ice in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, in conjunction with depth integrated photolysis rates for OH radical production from photolysis of hydrogen peroxide (H O) and nitrate anion (NO). The albedo is 0. 70 - 0. 75 and the transmission is characterised by an e-folding depth of ∼ 50 cm or an extinction coefficient of ∼ 2 m. A coupled atmosphere-snowpack radiation-transfer model (TUV-snow) {{was applied to the}} experimental measurements so that scattering and absorption cross-sections of the ice could be deduced. These cross-sections were used to model actinic flux (<b>spherical</b> <b>irradiance)</b> profiles in the ice, and thus illustrate the enhancement of actinic flux around a depth of 10 cm in the sea ice for zenith angles smaller than 50 °. The actinic flux-depth profiles demonstrate how extinction coefficients (measured at solar zenith angles greater than 50 °) for the top 10 - 20 cm of sea ice are much larger than extinction coefficients measured deeper in the ice. The TUV model was also used to calculate photolysis frequencies for nitrate anions and hydrogen peroxide, which produce hydroxyl radicals within the sea ice. The depth integrated photolysis rate of hydrogen peroxide is an order of magnitude larger than the depth integrated photolysis rate of nitrate. However, the low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in sea water and ice relative to nitrate result in a higher rate of production of OH radicals for nitrate than hydrogen peroxide. Approximate upper limits for depth integrated rate of production OH from nitrate photolysis in a 1 m deep sea ice block were found to be 0. 06 - 2 μmol m h for solar zenith angles of 85 - 45 °, respectively. The depth integrated production rate of OH radical from hydrogen peroxide photolysis is 0. 01 - 0. 3 μmol m h for solar zenith angles of 85 - 45 °, respectively. Photolysis of nitrate in ice is an efficient route to the production of hydroxyl radicals and an oxidising ice. It must be stressed that these depth integrated rates of production are, however, approximate upper limits because the low porosity and the microphysical, chemical and photochemical process occurring in sea ice may reduce the depth integrated rate of production. In conclusion we suggest that first-year sea ice may be an efficient medium for photochemistry and that 85 % of ice photochemistry may occur in the top 1 m of sea ice, assuming that the concentration of chromophore (nitrate or hydrogen peroxide) and photochemical efficiency are independent of depth in the sea ice. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Environment-mapped {{rendering}} of Lambertian isotropic surfaces is common, and a popular technique {{is to use}} a quadratic spherical harmonic expansion. This compact irradiance map representation is widely adopted in interactive applications like video games. However, many materials are anisotropic, and shading is determined by the local tangent direction, rather than the surface normal. Even for visualization and illustration, it is increasingly common to define a tangent vector field, and use anisotropic shading. In this paper, we extend <b>spherical</b> harmonic <b>irradiance</b> maps to anisotropic surfaces, replacing Lambertian reflectance with the diffuse term of the popular Kajiya-Kay model. We show that there is a direct analogy, with the surface normal replaced by the tangent. Our main contribution is an analytic formula for the diffuse Kajiya-Kay BRDF in terms of spherical harmonics; this derivation is more complicated than for the standard diffuse lobe. We show that the terms decay even more rapidly than for Lambertian reflectance, going as l − 3, where l is the spherical harmonic order, and with only 6 terms (l = 0 and l = 2) capturing 99. 8 % of the energy. Existing code for irradiance environment maps can be trivially adapted for real-time rendering with tangent irradiance maps. We also demonstrate an application to offline {{rendering of}} the diffuse component of fibers, using our formula as a control variate for Monte Carlo sampling.

Consistent with experimental observations, the Geant 4 -simulated values of absorbed fractions show a decreasing trend with an increase in radiation energy. Compared with NIST XCOM and ICRU data, the Geant 4 -based simulated values of the absorbed fraction remain within a 4. 2 % and 1. 6 % deviation, respectively. For electrons and g-photons, the relative difference between the Geant 4 -based comprehensive model predictions and those of Stabin and Konijnenberg's re-evaluation remains within a 6. 8 % and 7. 4 % range, respectively.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that there is}} a geometric correspondence between high-frequency quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and null geodesics (<b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> orbits). In this paper, we generalize such correspondence to charged scalar field in Kerr-Newman space-time. In our case, the particle and black hole are all charged, so one should consider non-geodesic orbits. Using the WKB approximation, we find that the real part of quasi-normal frequency corresponds to the orbits frequency, the imaginary part of the frequency corresponds to the Lyapunov exponent of these orbits and the eigenvalue of angular equation corresponds to carter constant. From the properties of the imaginary part of quasi-normal frequency of charged massless scalar field, we can still find that the QNMs of charged massless scalar field possess the zero damping modes in extreme Kerr-Newman spacetime under certain condition which has been fixed in this paper.

The count data are collected by detectors mounted at the spherical boundary of the detection volume. We neglect absorption, but account for Rayleigh scattering.

Here, we develop spatial Maximum Likelihood methods for event reconstruction, and study their performance in computer simulation experiments.

The nature of effective potential is discussed in radial as well as latitudinal direction. A special class of <b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> orbits is obtained along with the expression for the turning point for radial photons. Dependence of photon motion within this class of solution is discussed explicitly in view of the different Black Hole parameters. We have discussed the allowed regions for geodesic motion of massless test particles around Kerr- Sen Black Hole in more generalised way by including non-equatorial motion of the photons into the account. The conditions for different types of possible orbits are discussed with specific parameter values along with the corresponding orbit structure. No terminating orbits are possible for photons due to non-zero Black Hole charge. Observables on the angular plane (viz. bending of light and perihelion precession for massive test particles) are analysed as special cases.

40|$|A {{solar eclipse}} {{is a rare}} but {{spectacular}} natural phenomenon and furthermore {{it is a challenge}} for radiative transfer modeling. Whereas a simple one-dimensional radiative transfer model with reduced solar irradiance {{at the top of the}} atmosphere can be used to calculate the brightness during partial eclipses a much more sophisticated model is required to calculate the brightness (i. e. the diffuse radiation) during the total eclipse.

40|$|At {{present the}} {{expanding}} universe is observed {{to be dominated}} by the not fully under- stood concepts of dark energy and matter, in a conceived almost flat Euclidian geometry. As one of the possible efforts to understand the global behaviour of the expanding uni- verse, the present paper attempts to explain these concepts in terms of the pressure force and gravity of a <b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> gas cloud of zero point energy, in a flat geometry. A difficult point of the conventional theory concerns the frequency distribution of the zero point energy oscillations which leads to the unacceptable result of an infinite total en- ergy per unit volume. A modification of this distribution is therefore proposed which results in finite energy density. A corresponding equilibrium state is investigated, as well as small dynamic deviations from it, to form a basis for a model of the expanding universe. Provided that the crucial points of the present approach hold true, the model satisfies the requirements of cosmic linear dimensions, results in an estimated accelera- tion of the expansion being of the order of the observed one, presents a possible solution of the coincidence problem of dark energy and matter, and provides one of the possible explanations of the observed excess of high-energy electrons and positrons in recent balloon and satellite experiments...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results from {{axisymmetric}} time-dependent HD calculations of gas flows which are {{under the influence of}} gravity of a black hole in quasars. We assume that the flows are non-rotating and exposed to quasar radiation. We take into account X-ray heating and the radiation force due to electron scattering and spectral lines. To compute the radiation field, we consider a standard accretion disk as a source of UV <b>photons</b> and a <b>spherical</b> central object as a source of X-rays. The gas temperature and ionization state in the flow are calculated self-consistently from the photoionization and heating rate of the central object. We find that for a 10 e 8 MSUN black hole with an accretion luminosity of 0. 6 of the Eddington luminosity the flow settles into a steady state and has two components: (1) an equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar inflow/outflow with the outflow leaving the system along the disk rotational axis. The inflow is a realization of a Bondi-like accretion flow. The second component {{is an example of a}} non-radial accretion flow which becomes an outflow once it is pushed close to the rotational axis where thermal expansion and the radiation pressure accelerate it outward. Our main result is that the existence of the above two flow components is robust to the outer boundary conditions and the geometry and spectral energy distribution of the radiation field. However, the flow properties are not robust. In particular, the outflow power and collimation is higher for the radiation dominated by the UV/disk emission than for the radiation dominated by the X-ray/central engine emission. Our most intriguing result is that a very narrow outflow driven by radiation pressure on lines can carry more energy and mass than a broad outflow driven by thermal expansion.

40|$|The non-equatorial spherical null geodesics of {{rotating}} Kerr {{black holes}} are studied analytically. Unlike the extensively studied equatorial circular orbits whose radii are known analytically, no closed-form formula {{exists in the}} literature for the radii of generic (non-equatorial) spherical geodesics. We provide here an approximate formula for the radii r_ph(a/M;cos i) of these spherical null geodesics, where a/M is the dimensionless angular-momentum of the black hole and cos i is an effective inclination angle (with respect to the black-hole equatorial plane) of the orbit. It is well-known that the equatorial circular geodesics of the Kerr spacetime (the prograde and the retrograde orbits with cos i=± 1) are characterized by a monotonic dependence of their radii r_ph(a/M;cos i=± 1) on the dimensionless spin-parameter a/M of the black hole. We use here our novel analytical formula to reveal that this well-known property of the equatorial circular geodesics is actually not a generic property of the Kerr spacetime. In particular, we find that counter-rotating spherical null orbits in the range (3 √(3) -√(59)) / 4 ≲cos i< 0 are characterized by a non-monotonic dependence of r_ph(a/M;cos i=const) on the dimensionless rotation parameter a/M of the black hole. Furthermore, it is shown that <b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> orbits of rapidly-rotating black holes are characterized by a critical inclination angle, cos i=√(4 / 7), above which the coordinate radii of the orbits approach the black-hole radius in the extremal limit. We prove that this critical inclination angle signals a transition in the physical properties of the spherical null geodesics: in particular, it separates orbits which are characterized by finite proper distances to the black-hole horizon from orbits which are characterized by infinite proper distances to the horizon.

40|$|The {{predictions}} of the frequency-domain standard diffusion equation (SDE) model for light propagation in an infinite turbid medium diverge from the more complete P 1 approximation to the linear Boltzmann transport equation at intensity modulation frequencies greater than several hundred MHz. The P 1 approximation is based on keeping only the terms l= 0 and l= 1 in {{the expansion of the}} angular <b>photon</b> density in <b>spherical</b> harmonics, and the nomenclature P 1 approximate is used since he spherical harmonics of order l = 1 can be written in terms of the first order Legendre polynomial which is traditionally represented by the symbol P 1. Frequency-domain data acquired in a quasi-infinite turbid medium at modulation frequencies ranging from 0. 38 to 3. 2 GHz using a superheterodyning microwave detection system were analyzed using expressions derived from both the P 1 aproximation equation and the SDE This analysis shows that the P 1 approximation provides a more accurate description of the data over this range of modulation frequencies. Some researchers have claimed that the P 1 approximation predicts that a light pulse should propagate with an average speed of c/√ 3 in a thick turbid medium. However, an examination of the Green's function that we obtained from the frequency-domain P 1 approximation model indicates that a photon density wave phase velocity of c/√ 3 only asymptotically approached in a regime where the light intensity modulation frequency aproaches infinity. The Fourier transform of this frequency-domain result shows that in the time domain, the P 1 approximation predicts that only {{the leading edge of the}} pulse (i. e., the photons arriving at the detector at the earliest time) appreaches a speed of c/√ 3...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The bioluminescent enzyme firefly {{luciferase}} (Luc) or {{variants of}} {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) in transformed cells can be effectively used to reveal molecular and cellular features of neoplasia in vivo. Tumor cell growth and regression in response to various therapies can be evaluated by using bioluminescent imaging. In bioluminescent imaging, light propagates in highly scattering tissue, and the diffusion approximation is sufficiently accurate to predict the imaging signal around the biological tissue. The numerical solutions to the diffusion equation take large amounts of computational time, and the studies for its analytic solutions have attracted more attention in biomedical engineering applications. Methods Biological tissue is a turbid medium that both scatters and absorbs photons. An accurate model for the propagation of photons through tissue can be adopted from transport theory, and its diffusion approximation is applied to predict the imaging signal around the biological tissue. The solution to the diffusion equation is formulated by the convolution between its Green's function and source term. The formulation of <b>photon</b> diffusion from <b>spherical</b> bioluminescent sources in an infinite homogeneous medium can be obtained to accelerate the forward simulation of bioluminescent phenomena. Results The closed form solutions have been derived for the time-dependent diffusion equation and the steady-state diffusion equation with solid and hollow spherical sources in a homogeneous medium, respectively. Meanwhile, the relationship between solutions with a solid sphere source and ones with a surface sphere source is obtained. Conclusion We have formulated solutions for the diffusion equation with solid and hollow spherical sources in an infinite homogeneous medium. These solutions have been verified by Monte Carlo simulation for use in biomedical optical imaging studies. The closed form solution is highly accurate and more computationally efficient in biomedical engineering applications. By using our analytic solutions for spherical sources, we can better predict bioluminescent signals and better understand both the potential for, and the limitations of, bioluminescent tomography in an idealized case. The formulas are particularly valuable for furthering the development of bioluminescent tomography. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{theories}} of relativity and quantum mechanics, {{the two most}} important physics discoveries of the 20 th century, not only revolutionized our {{understanding of the nature of}} space-time and the way matter exists and interacts, but also became the building blocks of what we currently know as modern physics. My thesis studies both subjects in great depths [...] - this intersection takes place in gravitational-wave physics. Gravitational waves are "ripples of space-time", long predicted by general relativity. Although indirect evidence of gravitational waves has been discovered from observations of binary pulsars, direct detection of these waves is still actively being pursued. An international array of laser interferometer gravitational-wave detectors has been constructed in the past decade, and a first generation of these detectors has taken several years of data without a discovery. At this moment, these detectors are being upgraded into second-generation configurations, which will have ten times better sensitivity. Kilogram-scale test masses of these detectors, highly isolated from the environment, are probed continuously by photons. The sensitivity of such a quantum measurement can often be limited by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and during such a measurement, the test masses can be viewed as evolving through a sequence of nearly pure quantum states. The first part of this thesis (Chapter 2) concerns how to minimize the adverse effect of thermal fluctuations on the sensitivity of advanced gravitational detectors, thereby making them closer to being quantum-limited. My colleagues and I present a detailed analysis of coating thermal noise in advanced gravitational-wave detectors, which is the dominant noise source of Advanced LIGO in the middle of the detection frequency band. We identified the two elastic loss angles, clarified the different components of the coating Brownian noise, and obtained their cross spectral densities. The second part of this thesis (Chapters 3 - 7) concerns formulating experimental concepts and analyzing experimental results that demonstrate the quantum mechanical behavior of macroscopic objects - as well as developing theoretical tools for analyzing quantum measurement processes. In Chapter 3, we study the open quantum dynamics of optomechanical experiments in which a single photon strongly influences the quantum state of a mechanical object. We also explain how to engineer the mechanical oscillator's quantum state by modifying the single photon's wave function. In Chapters 4 - 5, we build theoretical tools for analyzing the so-called "non-Markovian" quantum measurement processes. Chapter 4 establishes a mathematical formalism that describes the evolution of a quantum system (the plant), which is coupled to a non-Markovian bath (i. e., one with a memory) while at the same time being under continuous quantum measurement (by the probe field). This aims at providing a general framework for analyzing a large class of non-Markovian measurement processes. Chapter 5 develops a way of characterizing the non-Markovianity of a bath (i. e.,whether and to what extent the bath remembers information about the plant) by perturbing the plant and watching for changes in the its subsequent evolution. Chapter 6 re-analyzes a recent measurement of a mechanical oscillator's zero-point fluctuations, revealing nontrivial correlation between the measurement device's sensing noise and the quantum rack-action noise. Chapter 7 describes a model in which gravity is classical and matter motions are quantized, elaborating how the quantum motions of matter are affected by the fact that gravity is classical. It offers an experimentally plausible way to test this model (hence the nature of gravity) by measuring the center-of-mass motion of a macroscopic object. The most promising gravitational waves for direct detection are those emitted from highly energetic astrophysical processes, sometimes involving black holes - a type of object predicted by general relativity whose properties depend highly on the strong-field regime of the theory. Although black holes have been inferred to exist at centers of galaxies and in certain so-called X-ray binary objects, detecting gravitational waves emitted by systems containing black holes will offer a much more direct way of observing black holes, providing unprecedented details of space-time geometry in the black-holes' strong-field region. The third part of this thesis (Chapters 8 - 11) studies black-hole physics in connection with gravitational-wave detection. Chapter 8 applies black hole perturbation theory to model the dynamics of a light compact object orbiting around a massive central Schwarzschild black hole. In this chapter, we present a Hamiltonian formalism in which the low-mass object and the metric perturbations of the background spacetime are jointly evolved. Chapter 9 uses WKB techniques to analyze oscillation modes (quasi-normal modes or QNMs) of spinning black holes. We obtain analytical approximations to the spectrum of the weakly-damped QNMs, with relative error O(1 /L^ 2), and connect these frequencies to geometrical features of <b>spherical</b> <b>photon</b> orbits in Kerr spacetime. Chapter 11 focuses mainly on near-extremal Kerr black holes, we discuss a bifurcation in their QNM spectra for certain ranges of (l,m) (the angular quantum numbers) as a/M &# 8594; 1. With tools prepared in Chapter 9 and 10, in Chapter 11 we obtain an analytical approximate for the scalar Green function in Kerr spacetime. </p...|$|R
