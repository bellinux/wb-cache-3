500|$|Innovations {{during the}} reign of Andrianampoinimerina were to have long-standing {{consequences}} for the structure of Malagasy society in the 19th century. [...] Madagascar specialist Francoise Raison-Jourde attributes the widespread conversions of the masses following the conversion to Christianity of Ranavalona II in 1869 to the precedent established by Andrianampoinimerina of a state religion in which the sovereign is the head and the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> follow. Similarly, Andrianampoinimerina's decision to empower the hova and the two families of advisers in particular led over the next fifty years to the strengthening of the hova middle class that formed the backbone of the merchant, craftsman, farming and administrative cadres. By the reign of Radama II, hova power rivaled and ultimately exceeded the power of the nobles, leading to the aristocratic coup d'etat that ended Radama's reign and the absolute power of the monarch, and established a joint system of government in which the hova Prime Minister and his cabinet governed while the sovereign was reduced to a symbolic figurehead of ancestral power and authority. [...] Ambohimanga, which Andrianampoinimerina declared the spiritual capital of Madagascar, remains among the country's most important spiritual and cultural sites, and was recognized as Madagascar's only cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. [...] A major street in Antananarivo, running parallel to the Avenue de l'Independence and one block east, is named after him.|$|E

Thus, on the one hand, we were abused for having leased our land, and, on the other, for not having leased it.
