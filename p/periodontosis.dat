5000|$|Hans Josef Sachs {{was born}} in Breslau, Germany, now Wrocław, Poland, on August 11, 1881. He began {{collecting}} posters {{when he was only}} 16, possibly inspired by a gift to his father of three life-size prints of Sarah Bernhardt signed by Alphonse Mucha. In 1903-4 he served a year in the army, and again for some months in 1914-15. He was educated as a chemist, receiving his doctorate in 1904 in chemistry, physics, and mathematics; and then another in dentistry. He then interned for six months in the United States. He was married {{for the first time in}} 1910. While he was successful as a dentist, with Albert Einstein among his patients, and wrote a number of standard works on <b>periodontosis,</b> his avocation was posters. He regularly worked from three o'clock in the afternoon into the night on his passion, making a detailed index card for each poster, each of which was identified by a numbered label. His poster collection grew, and in 1905 he was one of the principal founders and then the president of the Verein der Plakatfreunde (Society of Poster Friends), which soon had regional chapters. In 1910 it founded a quarterly Das Plakat (The Poster), with Sachs as both editor and publisher. [...] The purpose of Das Plakat was to promote poster art, for both collectors and scholars. While there were a number of magazines devoted to posters, of Das Plakat it was said “And the clarion of this German poster exuberance was a magazine called Das Plakat, which not only exhibited the finest poster examples from Germany and other European countries, but its high standards underscored its exquisite printing, established qualitative criteria that defined the decade of graphic design between 1910 and 1920.” Moreover, “[...] [...] [...] given its focus on conventional and avant garde sensibilities (it) emerged as a more historically influential review than any of the others.” During its short life from 1910 to 1921, its circulation grew from 200 to over 10,000. The Verein der Plakatfreunde ended a year later. It is unclear why the poster group and its magazine ended, possibly because of conflicts between collectors, art lovers, commercial artists, and business.|$|E
40|$|These {{studies were}} made {{for the purpose of}} finding out the {{relationship}} of <b>periodontosis</b> to histamine and the etiologic factors of the disease since the pharmacological action of histamine is very similar to the inflammatory state of <b>periodontosis.</b> The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) Gingivae of 51 cases of <b>periodontosis</b> showed a threefold increase in histamine, compared with those of 20 control cases operated surgically in the oral cavity. It is suggested by these results, in conjunction with the histopathological observations, that <b>periodontosis</b> has a certain relationship to allergy. 2) In cases of <b>periodontosis</b> an increase in mast cells and their morphologic changes were noticed in the microscopic specimens when stained with a one per cent solution of toluidine blue. These findings are known to be positively correlated with an increase of histamine. 3) In the animal experiments an increase of gingival histamine could not be attributed to physico-chemical stimulation alone and it was not noted when a local anaphylaxis (allergy) was induced. However, it became particularly marked when the local anaphylaxis was compounded by the above-mentioned strong stimulation. These animals showed both macroscopic and microscopic changes suggestive of <b>periodontosis.</b> 4) In slight or early cases of <b>periodontosis</b> favorable results were obtained by topical applications of sinomenine and an anti-histamine ointment which were administered in order to eliminate excessive amounts of histamine in the gingiva. Therefore it may be concluded that <b>periodontosis</b> has a close relationship to histamine and allergy...|$|E

40|$|Age {{estimation}} in unknown adult skeletons {{remains a}} considerable problem in forensic anthropology. In 1992, Lamendin et al. published a non-destructive method of age estimation on single rooted teeth.

The {{aim of this study}} was to test the accuracy of the Lamendin method on a large sample of canines of South Africans, and if necessary to adapt the formulae for this population. A sample of known sex, age and population group was used. This included 537 upper and lower canines from 498 skulls, and included black males, black females, white males and white females. The age of the individuals ranged from 20 to 90 years. The original formulae gave relatively poor results, and in an attempt to obtain better accuracy the formulae were adapted with the current data. Even after adaptation of the formulae, the highest correlation between estimated age and actual age remained low (R 2 = 0. 41), with mean errors ranging between 12 and 15 years. <b>Periodontosis</b> was better correlated with age than root transparency.

40|$|Introduction. Vulvo-vaginal-gingival {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} variant of lichen planus. The disease affects mucous membranes of the oral cavity and genitals. It usually affects middle-aged females and most frequently presents as painful erosions. First-line treatment includes topical and systemic corticosteroids. If untreated, the disease may result in mucocutaneous scarring and stricture formation in affected organs. Therefore early diagnosis and appropriate treatment is essential. Objective. To present a patient with vulvo-vaginal-gingival syndrome treated with methylprednisolone, cyclosporin and tacrolimus ointment. Case report. A 54 -year-old female patient with a several-year history of oral and genital complaints, formerly treated for <b>periodontosis</b> and candidiasis, {{was admitted to the}} Department of Dermatology in Lublin, where on the basis of clinical features and laboratory findings a diagnosis of vulvo-vaginal-gingival syndrome was established.

The effect of periodontal treatment on PMNL chemotaxis was studied in nine LJP patients. The chemotactic response was measured with the Boyden chamber procedure, and patient's peripheral PMNL were compared with those of control subjects, using endotoxin-activated serum, bacterial factor, N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine, and leukocyte-derived chemotactic factor as the standard chemoattractants. Based upon statistical analysis of chemotaxis assays, most carried out on at least two and often three or more separate occasions, 26 of 32 LJP patients, 7 of 10 post-LJP patients, and 5 of 8 GJP patients exhibited cellular defects of chemotaxis, whereas only 2 of 23 of the patients with adult periodontitis exhibited depressed chemotaxis. Elevated PMNL chemotaxis was occasionally found in subjects with juvenile periodontitis (2 of 32 with LJP and two of eight with GJP); however, it was found in a significant number (10 of 23) of patients with adult periodontitis. In eight of nine LJP patients, depressed PMNL chemotaxis was observed before and after periodontal therapy. The results indicate that the PMNL chemotaxis defect observed in juvenile periodontitis is due to a cell-associated defect of long duration.

40|$|Abstract The herb Lythrum salicaria L. (Lythraceae) {{is used in}} {{traditional}} medicine to treat diseases with an inflammatory background, such as haemorrhoidal disease, dysentery, chronic intestinal catarrh, eczema, varicose veins, <b>periodontosis</b> and gingivitis. Because these diseases are closely associated with an excessive inflammatory response of stimulated neutrophils, the influence of aque-ous extract and isolated C-glucosidic ellagitannins (dimeric salicarinins A, B and C, vescalagin, castalagin) on their pro-inflammatory functions was examined. Lythrum sali-caria aqueous extract was shown to modulate lipopoly-saccharide (LPS) -triggered production of IL- 8 (at 20 lg/ mL, 16. 6 ± 4. 2 % inhibition) but had no influence on MMP- 9 production. It was active towards cytochalasin A/f-MLP- stimulated elastase release (at 20 lg/mL, 21. 5 ± 3. 9 % inhibition), myeloperoxidase release (at 1 lg/mL, 26. 5 ± 5. 4 % inhibition) and f-MLP- and PMA-induced reactive oxygen species production (at 20 lg/mL, 67. 0 ± 3. 9 and 66. 5 ± 1. 9 % inhibition, respectively). The extract was also shown to inhibit expression of integrin CD 11 b on the neutrophil surface without influencing selectin CD 62 L shedding. Dose-dependent inhibition of hyaluronidase activity was observed with IC 50 = 10. 1 ± 1. 2 lg/mL. The main C-glucosidic ellagit-annins were shown {{to be responsible for}} all these activities with more significant participation attributable to dimeric salicarinins A, B, C.

40|$|Dental anthropologists {{study the}} {{variation}} around the common shared patterns of teeth. These {{differences in the}} development, size and morphology of teeth are often used to help estimate the age and sex of unknown individuals. The aim {{of the study was}} two-fold. Firstly, it was determined whether sexually dimorphic characteristics exist in the size of permanent canines of South Africans, and whether these differences are of sufficient magnitude to make them usable as a method to determine sex from unknown remains. For this purpose the mesiodistal and buccolingual crown diameters and the maxillary/mandibular canine index were used. Secondly, the Lamendin technique of age estimation was tested and adapted to a South African sample. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the usability of human permanent canines in the determination of two demographic characteristics, namely sex and age, in a South African sample. A sample of known sex, age and population group was obtained from the Pretoria Bone Collection (University of Pretoria, South Africa) and the Raymond A. Dart Collection (University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa). The canines of 498 skulls were measured from four groups namely, black males, black females, white males and white females. The age of the sample ranged from 20 to 90 years. Using discriminant function analysis, it was possible to differentiate between the sexes with a relatively good accuracy of up to 87 %. It was also evident that the two populations differed from one another as far as tooth size is concerned. Lamendin’s method of age estimation yielded poor precision and accuracy. <b>Periodontosis</b> was better correlated with age than root transparency, where the highest R 2 value was 0. 35. In summary it seems that the dimensions of the canine are useful in estimation of sex, should the population group be known. The Lamendin technique, however, gave relatively poor results even though new population specific formulae were created for the black and white populations of this sample. It could only estimate the age of the sample with an R 2 value of 0. 41 and mean errors ranging from 12. 02 to 15. 76 years.
