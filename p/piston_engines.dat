5|$|However, Chase had {{designed}} the aircraft {{to allow for}} the easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already been modified with two radial <b>piston</b> <b>engines,</b> becoming the XC-123, the prototype of the long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports. Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase Aircraft, to be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 turbojets, becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The North American AJ Savage (later A-2 Savage) was a carrier-based medium bomber {{built for}} the United States Navy by North American Aviation. The {{aircraft}} was designed shortly after World War II to carry atomic bombs and {{this meant that the}} bomber was the heaviest aircraft thus far designed to operate from an aircraft carrier. It was powered by two <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> and a turbojet buried in the rear fuselage. The AJ-1 first became operational in 1950 and several were based in South Korea during 1953 as a deterrent against the Communists. Of the 140 built, plus three prototypes, 30 were reconnaissance aircraft. Inflight-refueling equipment was deployed on the Savage in the mid-1950s. The bomber was replaced by the Douglas A3D Skywarrior beginning in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Production of Rolls-Royce {{designed}} aircraft <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> ceased in 1955 {{with the}} last variants of the Griffon. Between 1961 and 1981 Rolls-Royce was licensed to build the Teledyne Continental range of light aircraft <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> including the Continental O-520.|$|E

50|$|A {{gas turbine}} offers some {{advantages}} over a <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b> There are few moving parts, decreasing {{the need for}} lubrication and potentially reducing maintenance costs, and the power-to-weight ratio is much higher. A turbine of a given power output is also physically smaller than an equally powerful <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> often allowing the power car to accommodate passengers or cargo as well. However, a turbine's power output and efficiency both drop dramatically with rotational speed, unlike a <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> which has a comparatively flat power curve.|$|R

50|$|The motorjet was a {{very early}} design which used a <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> {{in place of the}} {{combustion}} chamber, similar to a turbocharged <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> except that the thrust is derived from the turbine instead of the crankshaft. It was soon superseded by the turbojet and remained a curiosity.|$|R
25|$|A {{gas turbine}} offers some {{advantages}} over a <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b> There are few moving parts, decreasing {{the need for}} lubrication and potentially reducing maintenance costs, and the power-to-weight ratio is much higher.

25|$|The surface-to-volume-ratio in {{the moving}} {{combustion}} chamber is so complex that a direct comparison cannot {{be made between}} a reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> and a Wankel engine. The flow velocity and the heat losses are quite different. Surface temperature characteristics are completely different; the film {{of oil in the}} Wankel engine acts as insulation. Engines with a higher compression ratio have a worse surface-to-volume ratio. The surface-to-volume ratio of a reciprocating <b>piston</b> diesel <b>engine</b> is much poorer than a reciprocating <b>piston</b> gasoline <b>engine,</b> but diesel engines have a higher efficiency factor. Hence, comparing power outputs is a realistic metric. A reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> with equal power to a Wankel will be approximately twice the displacement. When comparing the power-to-weight ratio, physical size or physical weight to a similar power output <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> the Wankel is superior.|$|R
