40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{information collected}} from waste <b>pickers</b> in the southern, south-eastern and north-eastern regions of Brazil {{to guide the}} development of a collection vehicle and a support system for the definition of collecting routes. The study had three objectives: to specify the profile of waste <b>pickers</b> of recyclable materials in the three surveyed regions; to diagnose the working conditions of individuals linked to associations and cooperatives of waste <b>pickers</b> and to identify the physical and operational structure of the waste <b>picker</b> organizations. To reach these objectives questionnaires were issued to waste <b>pickers</b> linked to associations and cooperatives that collect recyclables using human- or animal-powered vehicles and to the waste <b>picker</b> organizations themselves. Based on the results of this study, we are able to provide the requirements {{for the development of the}} collection vehicle, to draw a profile of the waste <b>pickers</b> in the three study regions and have better understanding of the working and physical conditions and the organizational structure of waste <b>picker</b> entities.

5|$|In 1900 and 1901, Harvard College Observatory {{director}} William Henry <b>Pickering</b> led two {{searches for}} trans-Neptunian planets. The first was begun by Danish astronomer Hans Emil Lau who, {{after studying the}} data on the orbit of Uranus from 1690 to 1895, concluded that one trans-Neptunian planet alone could {{not account for the}} discrepancies in its orbit, and postulated the position of two planets he believed were responsible. The second was launched when Gabriel Dallet suggested that a single trans-Neptunian planet lying at 47AU could account for the motion of Uranus. <b>Pickering</b> agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets.

The main {{goal of this}} research was to evaluate performance parameters of fresh tomato harvesting aid equipment and compare it to traditional harvest, in the state of São Paulo. Therefore, an equipment was developed and the harvest process was evaluated in four different ways: traditional system (harvest system used in Santa Luzia farm, Brotas, SP, Brazil), <b>picker</b> walking with a harvesting aid equipment, <b>picker</b> seated in a harvesting aid equipment and a composition of both systems: two <b>pickers</b> seated and one <b>picker</b> walking in two different velocities ranges. The different systems using harvesting aid showed an average yield by <b>picker</b> more efficient than reference. Harvest system using three <b>pickers</b> showed an increase of 290 % on yield average by <b>picker,</b> on the range of 0. 5 - 1. 0 fruit per plant, followed by the systems with a walking <b>picker,</b> that increased productivity in 41 %, and <b>picker</b> seated harvester, that showed an increase of 35 %.

40|$|Batching {{orders and}} routing order <b>pickers</b> is a {{commonly}} studied problem in many picker-to-parts warehouses. The impact {{of individual differences}} in picking skills on performance has received little attention. In this paper, we show that taking into account differences in the skills of individual <b>pickers</b> when assigning work has a substantial effect on total batch execution time and <b>picker</b> productivity. We demonstrate this for {{the case of a}} Finnish retailer. First, using time-stamped picking data, multilevel modeling is used to forecast batch execution times for individual <b>pickers</b> by modeling individual skills of <b>pickers.</b> Next, these forecasts are used to minimize total batch execution time, by assigning the right <b>picker</b> to the right order batch. We formulate the problem as a joint order batching and generalized assignment model, and solve it with an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm. For the sample company, we are able to improve state-of-the-art batching and routing methods by almost 10 % taking skill differences among <b>pickers</b> into account and minimizing the sum of total order processing time. Compared to assigning order batches to <b>pickers</b> only based on individual <b>picker</b> productivity, savings of 6 % in total time are achieved...|$|R
