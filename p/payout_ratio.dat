This study hypothesizes that since dividends represent a tax disadvantaged form of income relative to capital gains, then in response to an increase in incremental tax costs, corporations would decrease their dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios.</b> The response is expected to be stronger for corporations owned by shareholders with long investment horizons because the tax cost saved from decreasing dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> is an increasing function of shareholdersâ€™ investment horizon.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} CEO power and government monitoring on bank dividend policy for a sample of 109 European listed banks for the period 2005 - 2013. We employ three main proxies for CEO power: CEO ownership, CEO tenure, and unforced CEO turnover. We show that CEO power has {{a negative impact on}} dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> and on performance, suggesting that entrenched CEOs do not have the incentive to increase <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> to discourage monitoring from minority shareholders. Stronger internal monitoring by board of directors, as proxied by larger ownership stakes of the board members, increases performance but decreases <b>payout</b> <b>ratios.</b> These findings are contrary to those from the entrenchment literature for non-financial firms. Government ownership and the presence of a government official {{on the board of directors}} of the bank, also reduces <b>payout</b> <b>ratios,</b> in line with the view that government is incentivized to favor the interest of bank creditors before the interest of minority shareholders. These results show that government regulators are mainly concerned about bank safety and this allows powerful CEOs to distribute low payouts at the expense of minority shareholders...|$|R

The main thrusts of the hypothesis are that high cash-dividend payouts may reduce agency costs, and that high stock-dividend payouts provide a signal of optimism. The empirical evidence shows that a significant positive association between dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> and subsequent earnings growth exists only in the dual-dividend payouts sample.

The results of multinomial logit analysis reveal that the KLSE companiesâ€™ dividend actions {{are sensitive to the}} changes in earnings. Probabilities of dividend increases, decreases and omissions are high, respectively, with earnings increases, decreases and losses. This causes volatility in dividend payments. The KLSE firms appear reluctant to omit dividend except when they suffer losses. Further, using Lintnerâ€™s framework and panel regression methodology, we find evidence in favour of regular, but less stable, dividend policies being pursued by the KLSE companies. This is contrary to the experiences of companies in the developed capital markets. The results of the two-way fixed firm and time effects model reveal that there are significant differences in dividend policies across individual firms and time. ...|$|R

Growth in sales and market-to-book value are also used as proxies for investment opportunities. Findings â€“ The results show positive relationships between dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> and profitability, cash flow, and tax. The results also show negative associations between dividend payout and risk, institutional holding, growth and market-to-book value. However, the significant variables in the results are profitability, cash flow, sale growth and market-to-book value.

40|$|There {{are various}} {{hypotheses}} for explaining why firms repurchase shares. In the Malaysian environment, the leverage hypothesis best explains the share repurchasing behavior of firms. The pre-dominance of the leverage hypothesis {{is due to}} share repurchases being financed with additional debt or excess cash, both of which increase the debt/equity ratio. In relation to payout policy, analysis of payout trends reveal that repurchasing firms generally do not cut their dividends, {{and replace them with}} repurchases. They increase dividends in tandem with increase in earnings, and repurchase shares to augment <b>payout</b> <b>ratios.</b> Repurchasing firms generally have higher dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> than nonrepurchasing firms. Share repurchases have not replaced special dividends, and they increase firmâ€™s financial flexibility. In comparing the financial characteristics of repurchasing firms with nonrepurchasing firms, repurchasing firms are observed to have slightly lower market to book ratios, lower levels of liquidity, and higher leverage ratios. Additionally,repurchasing firms pay higher dividends, and are marginally more profitable than nonrepurchasing firms...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the patterns of}} payout policies worldwide. Utilizing data from a sample of more than 17, 000 companies, from 33 different countries, we {{show that there is}} a significant worldwide decline in the propensity to pay dividends. Most of the decline is due to the payout policies of smaller and less profitable firms with comparatively more investment opportunities. We find that larger firms, firms with higher profitability, and firms with low growth opportunities have a greater propensity to pay dividends. The proportion of dividend payers varies substantially across industries as well. However, the proportion of firms paying dividends has declined over time, even after firmsâ€™ characteristics are controlled for. Moreover, aggregate dividends are highly concentrated, in that they are paid only by a small group of firms. Our findings indicate {{that there has been a}} significant decline in the average dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> over the years. The decline in the mean dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> as well as the proportion of payers is much more pronounced in civil law countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the payout policies of UK firms {{listed on the}} London Stock Exchange during the 1990 s. It complements the existing literature by analyzing the trends in both dividends and total payouts (including share repurchases). In a dynamic panel data regression setting, we relate target <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> to control structure variables. Profitability drives payout decisions of the UK companies, but the presence of strong block holders or block holder coalitions considerably weakens the relationship between corporate earnings and payout dynamics. While {{the impact of the}} voting power of shareholders coalitions on <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> is found to be always negative, the magnitude of this effect differs across different categories of block holders (i. e. industrial firms, outside individuals, directors, financial institutions). The controlling shareholders appear to trade off the agency problems of free cash flow against the risk of underinvestment, and try to enforce payout policies that optimally balance these two costs. Finally, the paper improves upon some methodological flaws of the recent empirical studies of payout policy. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the disciplinary role of dividend in the Tunisian context. Based on the agency theory predictions, we consider the effect of two conflicting model of dividend: the outcome and the substitute model. Using a sample of 528 firm-years listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange over the period 1998 - 2009, our results highlight the deficiency of the disciplinary role of dividend. Empirical evidence shows that dividend policy is the result of large shareholders preferences. We find a positive relationship between dividend <b>payout</b> <b>ratios</b> and the voting powers of financial institutions and the second largest shareholder. In contrast, the control stakes of family and the largest shareholder are negatively related to the <b>payout</b> <b>ratios.</b> We also find a positive association between the free cash flow, the return on assets, the business sector and dividend to earnings ratio.
