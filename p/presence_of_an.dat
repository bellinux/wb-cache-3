30|$|In {{the domain}} {{personnel}} and resources, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> box trainer is considered relatively {{more important than}} the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virtual reality (VR) trainer. This finding is consistent with recent results of Palter et al., who found in their inventory that residents prefer box trainers above VR simulators for training the more advanced laparoscopic skills [13]. Regarding the assessment of laparoscopic skills, both trainer models have an equally good correlation [14]. VR trainers have the advantage as they allow solitary training while the supervisor can monitor the resident's skills level electronically. On the other hand, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supervisor required during box training has the advantage that surgical knowledge can be transmitted. Furthermore, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> laboratory technician is rated low. This could be {{explained by the fact that}} an enthusiastic laparoscopic expert can fulfil this role.

40|$|Objective To {{test whether}} the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peer {{or a friend}} {{increases}} the motivation to be physically active in overweight and non-overweight youth in a laboratory setting.  Methods Youth motivation to be physically active as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> the social context was measured using a computerized relative reinforcing value task to earn points exchangeable for physical and/or sedentary activities.  Results The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend (p<. 001) increased youth's; motivation to be physically active. The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peer increased overweight youth's; motivation to be physically active, whereas {{this was not the}} case for lean youth (p=. 47).

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} N= 1 supersymmetric {{theories}} in four dimensions in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary. We demonstrate {{that it is}} possible to preserve half the supersymmetry of the original theory by suitably modifying it in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary. This is done by adding new boundary terms to the original action, such that the supersymmetric variation of the new terms exactly cancels the boundary terms generated by the supersymmetric transformation of the original bulk action. We also analyze the boundary projections of such supercharges used in such a theory. We study super-Yang–Mills theories in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary using these results. Finally, we study the Born–Infeld action in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary. We analyze the boundary effects for the Born–Infeld action coupled to a background dilaton and an axion field. We also analyze the boundary effects for a non-abelian Born–Infeld action. We explicitly construct the actions for these systems in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary.

Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core {{ought to have}} sufficiently cooled {{to the point where}} fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
