40|$|Abstract Background Accurate {{estimation}} of statistical {{significance of a}} pairwise alignment is an important problem in sequence comparison. Recently, a comparative study of pairwise statistical significance with database statistical significance was conducted. In this paper, we extend the earlier work on pairwise statistical significance by incorporating with it {{the use of multiple}} <b>parameter</b> <b>sets.</b> Results Results for a knowledge discovery application of homology detection reveal that using multiple <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> for pairwise statistical significance estimates gives better coverage than using a single <b>parameter</b> <b>set,</b> at least at some error levels. Further, the results of pairwise statistical significance using multiple <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> are shown to be significantly better than database statistical significance estimates reported by BLAST and PSI-BLAST, and comparable and at times significantly better than SSEARCH. Using non-zero <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> change penalty values give better performance than zero penalty. Conclusion The fact that the homology detection performance does not degrade when using multiple <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> is a strong evidence for the validity of the assumption that the alignment score distribution follows an extreme value distribution even when using multiple <b>parameter</b> <b>sets.</b> <b>Parameter</b> <b>set</b> change penalty is a useful parameter for alignment using multiple <b>parameter</b> <b>sets.</b> Pairwise statistical significance using multiple <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> can be effectively used to determine the relatedness of a (or a few) pair(s) of sequences without performing a time-consuming database search. </p...|$|R

30|$|Because foreshocks {{are driven}} by the {{background}} aseismic slip of the nucleation process, their seismic slip should be active around the stability boundary of the fault, where the background aseismic slip is most active in Fig.  6 b. The cumulative energy is actually negligible for <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> A, where the background aseismic slip is very small, but larger around the stability boundary of the fault where the background aseismic slip is also larger. Comparing <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> B and C, the former has larger values of cumulative energy, which indicates that seismic slip is more active during the precursory period of <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> B. However, the nucleation level is higher in <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> C (Fig.  6). This inconsistency between aseismic and seismic slip during the precursory period around the stability boundary of the fault should {{be related to the}} frictional <b>parameters.</b> The <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> B has larger values of both ξw and ψs. A large value of ξw makes the nucleation size smaller and better facilitates seismic slip of individual VWZs. In contrast, <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> C has smaller values of both ξw and ψs, which facilitates simultaneous slip across a larger region of the fault. This difference is also reflected in the amount of seismicity between mainshocks (Fig.  2), i.e., many smaller events occur between mainshocks for <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> B, whereas no seismic events occur for <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> C. These same tendencies should also exist in precursory slip.|$|R
