40|$|Inoculation {{of adult}} C 57 /BC mice with 10 (6) red cells {{infected}} with Plasmodium chabaudi induces an acute primary parasitaemia peaking around the 8 th or 9 th day and lasting 10 - 14 days. Concomitantly, the spleen enlarges to reach 6 - 7 times its normal weight by the 11 th day. The {{major component of}} this increase is between day 9 and 11, due primarily {{to an increase in}} erythropoietic cells in the red pulp. Although initially the white pulp increases in size, by day 11 it shows <b>partial</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion</b> which coincides with the occurrence of massive absolute lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood. 3 H-Thymidine labelling in vivo suggests that this lymphocytosis is not due to lymphocytopoiesis. Collectively, these findings suggest a redistribution of lymphocytes. Lymphocyte migration was investigated around peak parasitaemia, using enriched populations of T and B cells labelled with 51 Cr. The traffic patterns of these cells were followed over 36 h. These studies show decreased uptake (or decreased retention) of T and B cells by spleens of infected mice. Concomitantly, there is increased retention of T and B cells in the liver and lungs of infected mice, suggesting a complex redistribution of these cells. Lymphocyte migration to lymph nodes was unimpaired in these animals. Similar changes in T and B cell migration do not occur in Babesia microti infections in C 57 /BL mice. We relate our findings to histological and histochemical changes in the liver and spleen of malarious mice and discuss the significance of these findings to immunosuppression in malaria and to the development of parasiticidal immunity...|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{have shown}} {{previously}} in mice, that infection with live viruses, including influenza/A and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), induces systemic <b>partial</b> activation of <b>lymphocytes,</b> characterized by cell surface expression of CD 69 and CD 86, but not CD 25.

We have shown that CD 8 + lymphocyte-mediated immunity in rhesus monkeys can be selectively eliminated using the mouse-human chimeric anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibody cM-T 807. In vitro, this antibody completely blocked antigen-specific expansion of cytotoxic T cells and decreased major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted, antigen-specific lysis of target cells but did not mediate complement-dependent cell lysis. In vivo administration of cM-T 807 in rhesus monkeys resulted in near total depletion of CD 8 + T cells from the blood and lymph nodes for up to 6 weeks. This depletion was not solely complement-dependent and persisted longer in adults than in juveniles. Preservation of B cell and CD 4 + T cell function in monkeys depleted of CD 8 + lymphocytes was demonstrated by their ability to develop humoral immune responses to the administered chimeric monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, during CD 8 + <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion,</b> monkeys developed delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions comprised only of CD 4 + T cells but not CD 8 + T cells.

40|$|The major {{complication}} after allogeneic {{bone marrow}} transplantation is the occurrence of acute GvHD. This complication can be successfully prevented when T lymphocytes are depleted from a bone marrow graft. The beneficial effect of prevention of acute GvHD is counterbalanced by an increased frequency of engraftment failures. In view of this problem several experiments were planned to unravel whether the engraftment failures after T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion</b> were attributable {{to the loss of}} the trophic function of T lymphocytes or were attributable to the loss of the immunosuppressive action of donor Tlymphocytes.

40|$|The {{chimeric}} anti-CD 20 {{monoclonal antibody}} rituximab {{has been used}} extensively {{in the treatment of}} B cell malignancies, and more recently it has emerged as a potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), via selective B <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion.</b> Experience in oncology shows that rituximab is well tolerated in a variety of settings, with mild-to-moderate infusion related reactions following the first infusion being the most common adverse event. Current data suggest that the safety profile of rituximab in patients with RA is similar to that in oncology, but that the adverse events are less frequent and less severe in patients with RA...|$|R
40|$|Many {{features}} of T-cell homeostasis in primates are still unclear, thus limiting {{our understanding of}} AIDS pathogenesis, in which T-cell homeostasis is lost. Here, we performed experiments of in vivo CD 4 + or CD 8 + <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletion</b> in 2 nonhuman primate species, rhesus macaques (RMs) and sooty mangabeys (SMs). Whereas RMs develop AIDS after infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), SIV-infected SMs are typically AIDS-resistant. We found that, in both species, most CD 4 + or CD 8 + T cells in blood and lymph nodes were depleted after treatment with their respective antibodies. These CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>depletions</b> were followed by a largely lineage-specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell proliferation, involving mainly memory T cells, which correlated with interleukin- 7 plasma levels. Interestingly, SMs showed a faster repopulation of naive CD 4 + T cells than RMs. In addition, in both species CD 8 + T-cell repopulation was faster than that of CD 4 + T cells, with CD 8 + T cells reconstituting a normal pool within 60 days and CD 4 + T cells remaining below baseline levels up to day 180 after depletion. While this study revealed subtle differences in CD 4 + T-cell repopulation in an AIDS-sensitive versus an AIDS-resistant species, such differences may have particular relevance {{in the presence of}} active SIV repli cation, where CD 4 + T-cell destruction is chronic...|$|R
