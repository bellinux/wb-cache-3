40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of varying {{maternal}} intake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3), {{in the absence of}} other dietary polyunsaturates, on breast milk fatty acids. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: Lactating mothers were randomised on day 5 post-partum to groups consuming equal numbers of capsules but containing either placebo or an oil containing DHA (43 %) as its only <b>polyunsaturate</b> to receive 0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 9, 1. 3 g DHA/day. Breast milk fatty acids as well as maternal plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids were assessed at 12 weeks post partum by capillary gas chromatography. RESULTS: Breast milk DHA levels ranged from 0. 2 to 1. 7 % of total fatty acids and increased in a dose dependent manner (r 2 = 0. 89, P < 0. 01). Maternal plasma (r 2 = 0. 71, P < 0. 01) and erythrocyte (r 2 = 0. 77, P < 0. 01) phospholipid DHA levels increased and were also strongly associated with dietary dose of DHA.

We wished {{to determine the}} role of interferon (IFN) –g signaling in this increased disease susceptibility. Methods. A feeding trial was conducted with mice unable to produce IFN-g (IFN-gKO); we provided ex-ogenous recombinant IFN-g during L. monocytogenes challenge. The experimental diets were nutritionally complete and differed only in fat source: lard (devoid of n- 3 PUFAs) or menhaden fish oil (rich in n- 3 PUFAs). Results. The administration of IFN-g significantly enhanced bacterial clearance in IFN-gKO mice fed a diet devoid of n- 3 PUFAs but had no effect in mice fed a diet rich in n- 3 PUFAs. Ex vivo analysis of immune cells showed that n- 3 PUFAs did not affect IFN-g receptor expression on immune cells. However, on IFN-g treatment, the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 was significantly reduced in peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice fed n- 3 PUFAs. Conclusions. These data suggest that diminished IFN-g signaling in murine macrophages is one mechanism by which n- 3 PUFAs impair host resistance to L. monocytogenes.

40|$|Abstract: Replacement {{of dietary}} {{saturated}} fatty acids (SFA) by polyun{{saturated fatty acids}} (PUFA) has been consistently shown {{to reduce the amount}} of abdominal fat in broiler chickens, but the metabolic basis for this effect is unknown. It was hypothesized that the feeding of PUFA instead of SFA would induce more heat expenditure, this effect being associated with less deposition of abdominal fat. Broiler chickens were given one of five diets in which the beef tallow component, which is rich in SFA, was replaced by increasing amounts of soybean oil, which is rich in PUFA. The variable fat content of the diets was 3 % (w/w). There were neither significant nor systematic effects on weight gain and feed:gain ratio. The amount of body fat was reduced significantly (p< 0. 05) when about 75 % of the tallow was replaced by soybean oil, but there was no further decrease after the incorporation of more soybean oil into the diet. Calculated energy expenditure, either expressed as absolute amount or percentage of intake, trended to enhance but was not significantly affected by the amount of soybean oil in the diet.

Here, we describe the effect of the <b>polyunsaturate</b> arachidonic acid (AA) on the function of the clonal pancreatic β-cell line BRIN-BD 11 and demonstrate AA dependent attenuation of PA effects. When added to β-cell incubations at 100 uM AA can stimulate cell proliferation and chronic (24 h) basal insulin secretion. Microarray analysis and/or real time PCR indicated significant AA dependent up-regulation of genes involved in proliferation and fatty acid metabolism (e. g. Angptl, ECH 1, COX- 1 and COX- 2, p< 0. 05). Experiments using specific COX and LOX inhibitors demonstrated the importance of COX- 1 activity for acute (20 min) stimulation of insulin secretion, suggesting that AA metabolites may be responsible for the insulinotropic effects. Moreover, concomitant incubation of AA with PA dose-dependently attenuated the detrimental effects of the saturated fatty acid, so reducing apoptosis and decreasing parameters of oxidative stress (ROS and NO levels) while improving the GSH/GSSG ratio. AA decreased the protein expression of iNOS, the p 65 subunit of NF-κB and the p 47 subunit NADPH oxidase in PA treated cells.

To investigate this we have examined sodium pump molecular activity and microsomal membrane lipid composition in the brain of five mammalian and eight avian species ranging in size from 30 g mice to 280 kg cattle and 13 g zebra finches to 35 kg emus, respectively. Sodium pump (Na+,K+-ATPase) activity was higher in the smaller species and showed a significant allometric decline with body mass in both the mammals (μmol Pi h- 1 mg wet mass- 1 = 6. 2 ×mass- 0. 06) and birds (μmol Pi h- 1 mg wet mass- 1 = 5. 4 ×mass- 0. 07). In small mammals, the elevated enzyme activity was related to allometric changes in both the concentration and the molecular activity (turnover rate) of sodium pumps, while in birds, no significant body-size-related variation was observed for either sodium pump concentration or molecular activity. Microsomal phospholipid fatty acid profile displayed little allometric variation in both the mammals and birds and was not correlated with molecular activity in either group.

The smoke opacity of SME 50 (Soybean oil methyl ester) is higher than that of RME 50 (Rapeseed oil methyl ester) and PME 50 (Palm oil methyl ester). There is no obvious relationship between total unsaturate fraction and smoke opacity, while smoke opacity is linear with <b>polyunsaturate</b> fraction of fuel at all test modes, which means that the unsaturated ester with two or three double bonds have greater influence in smoke formation than the counterpart with only one double bond. The SOF (soluble organic fraction) proportion of RME 50, PME 50 and SME 50 is 5 times or 4 times larger than that of diesel fuel and ultra-low-sulfur diesel respectively. The overall sequence of SOF is PME 50 >SME 50 >RME 50. SOF fraction is linear with saturate fraction of fuel at all test modes. PME 50 has higher nucleation particle number concentration than that of RME 50 and SME 50.

Approximately 10 % and 30 % of the initial egg lipids are respectively recovered in the residual yolk and the fat body of the hatchling.

The main aim {{of the study was to}} contribute to the problematics of metabolic interrelationships between serum lipoprotein TAG and HDL in human, focused on TAG lipolysis and consequent changes of HDL lipid components as involved in the determination of pathobiochemically important metabolic function of HDL. The model of enhanced intravascular TAG lipolysis and that of decelerated intravascular TAG lypolysis were made use of. Lipase release into the circulation provoked by heparin caused TAG lipolysis enhancement and was confirmed by a decrease of total and VLDL-TAG values, together with an increase of the molar ratio cholesterol/TAG in VDL. Heparin did not influence significantly the concentration of cholesterol in plasma or in individual lipoprotein fraction, due probably to the inhibitory effect of heparin on binding of plasma lipoproteins. In HDL, the distribution of TAG in HDL subfractions changed - a decrease in HDL_ 2 and an increase in HDL_ 3. The enhancement of lipolysis by hepatic lipase was related to the supply of HDL_ 2 -TAG, to HDL_ 2 cholesterol decrease and to the lipid depletion of HDL_ 3 nucleus, and it could be involved in the formation of so-called "small" HDL with consequent deceleration of the reverse cholesterol transport. The results evidenced TAG distribution among HDL subfractions determined by activity of both lipases: HDL_ 3 can act as acceptors of non-lipolysed TAG during increased activity of hepatic lipase. These conclusions are supported by results of determination of Tag distribution between HDL_ 2 and HDL_ 3 in hyper- and hypoalphalipoproteinemia with hypertriglyceridemia.

40|$|The {{long-chain}} <b>polyunsaturated</b> {{fatty acids}} {{are considered to}} be of major health importance, and recent studies indicate that their endogenous metabolism is influenced by B-vitamin status and smoking habits. We investigated the associations of circulating B-vitamins and smoking habits with serum <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids among 1, 366 patients who under-went coronary angiography due to suspected coronary heart disease at Haukeland Univer-sity Hospital, Norway. Of these, 52 % provided information on dietary habits by a food frequency questionnaire. Associations were assessed using partial correlation (Spearman’s rho). In the total population, the concentrations of most circulating B-vitamins were positive-ly associated with serum n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids, but negatively with serum n- 6 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. However, the associations between B-vitamins and polyunsat-urated fatty acids tended to be weaker in smokers. This could not be solely explained by differences in dietary intake. Furthermore, plasma cotinine, a marker of recent nicotine ex-posure, showed a negative relationship with serum n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids, but a positive relationship with serum n- 6 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. In conclusion, circulatin...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Several {{studies have reported}} beneficial cardiovascular effects of marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. To date, no large studies have investigated {{the potential benefits of}} marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids in recipients of renal transplants. Design, setting, participants, & measurements In this observational cohort study of 1990 Norwegian recipients of renal transplants transplanted between 1999 and 2011, associations between marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid levels and mortality were investigated by stratified analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis adjusting for traditional and transplant-specific mortality risk factors. Marine n- 3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid levels in plasmaphospholipidsweremeasured bygas chromatography in a stable phase 10 weeks after transplantation. Results There were 406 deaths (20. 4 %) during a median follow-up period of 6. 8 years. Mortality rates were lower in patients with high marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid levels ($ 7. 95 weight percentage) compared with low levels (, 7. 95 weightpercentage) for all age categories (pooledmortality rate ratio estimate, 0. 69; 95 %confidence interval, 0. 57 to 0. 85). Whendivided intoquartiles according tomarinen- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fattyacid levels, patients in theupperquartile comparedwith the lowerquartile hada 56 % lower riskofdeath (adjustedhazard ratio, 0. 44; 95 %confidence interval, 0. 26 to 0. 75) usingmultivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Therewas a lower hazard ratio for death from cardiovascular diseasewith high levels ofmarine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid and a lower hazard ratio for death from infectious diseasewith high levels of themarine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid,whereas therewas no association between total or individual marine n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid levels and cancer mortality.

40|$|SUMMARY Studies {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} the mechanisms underlying the reduction of hepatocellular necrosis observed when <b>polyunsaturated</b> phosphatidylcholine was administered to patients with HBsAg negative chronic active hepatitis. After oral administration of the agent, the susceptibility of rabbit hepatocytes to both antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and mitogen induced lymphocyte cytotoxicity was substantially reduced. Short term in vitro incubation of either the hepatocytes or lymphocytes with <b>polyunsaturated</b> phosphatidylcholine {{had no effect on}} antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. As {{it has been shown that}} orally administered <b>polyunsaturated</b> phosphatidylcholine can be incorporated into the liver cell membrane, it is possible that <b>polyunsaturated</b> phosphatidylcholine exerts its effect by blocking the interaction between immune effector cells and hepatocytes. In a double-blind, placebo controlled randomised trial, <b>polyunsaturated</b> phosphatidylcholine (1. 8 g/ day) was used as adjunctive therapy in 30 patients with HBsAg negative chronic active hepatitis who were inadequately controlled on conventional dose...|$|R

40|$|Consumption of n- 6 <b>polyunsaturated</b> {{fatty acids}} greatly exceeds that of n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. The n- 6 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid arachidonic {{gives rise to}} the {{eicosanoid}} family of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes and related metabolites) and through these regulates the activities of inflammatory cells, the production of cytokines and the various balances within the immune system. Fish oil and oily fish are good sources of long chain n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. Consumption of these fatty acids decreases the amount of arachidonic acid in cell membranes and so available for eicosanoid production. Thus, n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids act as arachidonic acid antagonists. Components of both natural and acquired immunity, including the production of key inflammatory cytokines, can be affected by n- 3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids. Although some of the effects of n- 3 fatty acids may be brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, it is possible that these fatty acids might elicit some of their effects by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms. Such n- 3 fatty acid-induced effects may be of use as a therapy for acute and chronic inflammation, and for disorders which involve an inappropriately activated immune response. <br/...|$|R
