5000|$|An IBM 7750 {{transmission}} control unit capable of supporting up to 112 teleprinter terminals, including IBM 1050 Selectrics and Teletype Model 35s. Some of the terminals were located remotely, and the system could be accessed using the <b>public</b> <b>Telex</b> and TWX <b>networks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Teleprinters {{could use}} a variety of {{different}} communication media. These included a simple pair of wires, dedicated non-switched telephone circuits (leased lines), switched networks that operated similarly to the <b>public</b> telephone <b>network</b> (<b>telex),</b> and radio and microwave links (telex-on-radio or TOR). A teleprinter attached to a modem could also communicate through standard switched public telephone lines. This latter configuration was often used to connect teleprinters to remote computers, particularly in time-sharing environments.|$|R
50|$|Modern cablegrams or telegrams {{actually}} operate over dedicated <b>telex</b> <b>networks,</b> using TOR whenever required.|$|R

50|$|The first wide-coverage <b>Telex</b> <b>network</b> was {{implemented}} in Germany during the 1930s as a network used to communicate within the government.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, Western Union {{started to}} build a <b>telex</b> <b>network</b> in the United States. This <b>telex</b> <b>network</b> started as a {{satellite}} exchange located in New York City and expanded to a nationwide network. Western Union chose Siemens & Halske AG, now Siemens AG, and ITT to supply the exchange equipment, provisioned the exchange trunks via the Western Union national microwave system and leased the exchange to customer site facilities from the local telephone company. Teleprinter equipment was originally provided by Siemens & Halske AG and later by Teletype Corporation. Initial direct international telex service was offered by Western Union, via W.U. International, {{in the summer of}} 1960 with limited service to London and Paris. In 1962, the major exchanges were located in New York City (1), Chicago (2), San Francisco (3), Kansas City (4) and Atlanta (5). The <b>telex</b> <b>network</b> expanded by adding the final parent exchanges cities of Los Angeles (6), Dallas (7), Philadelphia (8) and Boston (9) starting in 1966.|$|R
25|$|Automatic {{teleprinter}} exchange {{service was}} introduced into Canada by CPR Telegraphs and CN Telegraph in July 1957, and in 1958, Western Union started {{to build a}} <b>Telex</b> <b>network</b> in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Telex {{provided}} the first common medium for international record communications using standard signalling techniques and operating criteria as {{specified by the}} International Telecommunication Union. Customers on any telex exchange could deliver messages to any other, around the world. To lower line usage, telex messages were normally first encoded onto paper tape and then read into the line as quickly as possible. The system normally delivered information at 50 baud or approximately 66 words per minute encoded using the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2. In the late days of the <b>telex</b> <b>networks,</b> end-user equipment was often replaced by modems and phone lines as well, reducing the <b>telex</b> <b>network</b> to what was effectively a directory service running on the phone network.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in 1956, telegrams {{begun to}} be {{transmitted}} over the <b>Telex</b> <b>network</b> using the [...] standard named Gentex in order to lower the costs for some European telecommunications companies by allowing the sending telegraph station to connect directly to the receiving station.|$|R
50|$|Gentex is an {{international}} standard (ITU F.20) for the transmission of telegrams over the <b>Telex</b> <b>network.</b> It replaces fixed telegraph connections between stations and means instead that the telegraph station that transmits the telegram connects directly to the receiving station and transmits the telegram with a remote typewriter.|$|R
25|$|The ACARS {{equipment}} on the aircraft {{is linked to}} that on the ground by the datalink service provider. Because the ACARS network is modeled after the point-to-point <b>telex</b> <b>network,</b> all messages come to a central processing location to be routed. ARINC and SITA are the two primary service providers, with smaller operations from others in some areas. Some areas have multiple service providers.|$|R
25|$|A {{telegraph}} message sent by {{an electrical}} telegraph operator or telegrapher using Morse code (or a printing telegraph operator using plain text) {{was known as}} a telegram. A cablegram was a message sent by a submarine telegraph cable, often shortened to a cable or a wire. Later, a Telex was a message sent by a <b>Telex</b> <b>network,</b> a switched network of teleprinters similar to a telephone network.|$|R
50|$|COREU (French: Correspondance Européenne - <b>Telex</b> <b>network</b> of European correspondents, also EUKOR-Netzwerk in Austria) is a {{communication}} network of the European Union for the communication of the Council of the European Union, the European correspondents of the foreign ministries of the EU member states, permanent representatives of member states in Brussels, the European Commission, and the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union. It is striking that the European Parliament is not among the participants.|$|R
50|$|Telex {{systems were}} adapted to short-wave radio by sending tones over single sideband. CCITT R.44 (the most {{advanced}} pure-telex standard) incorporated character-level error detection and retransmission {{as well as}} automated encoding and routing. For many years, telex-on-radio (TOR) was the only reliable way to reach some third-world countries. TOR remains reliable, though less-expensive forms of e-mail are displacing it. Many national telecom companies historically ran nearly pure <b>telex</b> <b>networks</b> for their governments, and they ran many of these links over short wave radio.|$|R
5000|$|The militants {{entered the}} country through Lisbon Airport as {{tourists}} bearing Lebanese passports. They reserved hotel rooms from a <b>public</b> <b>telex</b> in Beirut and rented three cars in Lisbon. From the documents found in the hotel rooms, the police identified the five as Setrak Ajamian, 19 years old; Ara Kuhrjulian, 20; Sarkis Abrahamian, 21; Simon Yahniyan, 21, and Vache Daghlian, 19 (known in Armenian sources as [...] "The Lisbon five"). They were buried in Beirut at the Armenian national cemetery in Bourj Hammoud.|$|R
50|$|ROTOR was a {{huge and}} {{elaborate}} air defence radar system built by the British Government in the early 1950s to counter possible attack by Soviet bombers. In order to get it operational as quickly as possible, it was initially made up primarily of WWII-era systems, notably the original Chain Home radars for early warning role, and the AMES Type 7 for plotting and interception control. The system built a network of control stations, mostly built underground, and connected with an extensive telephone and <b>telex</b> <b>network.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Teletype or Telex and the automatic printer, beginning around 1915, {{and the development of}} the <b>Telex</b> <b>network</b> in the 1920s, greatly increased the speed and efficiency of message transmission, as well as changing the work of the telegraph operator. Instead of using a telegraph key to transmit messages in Morse code, the Teletype operator simply typed messages on a standard typewriter keyboard. At the receiving end, an automatic printer printed out the text on paper sheets or tape. Introduction of the Teletype greatly increased the number of women employed as telegraphers; however, the predominantly female Teletype operators were generally paid less than the mainly male Morse operators.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>telex</b> <b>network</b> {{does not}} give {{feedback}} to a sender about when a message is delivered, and a shortwave ARQ link {{may or may not}} be available, systems with ARQ links set them up to be store and forward half duplex systems. This means that a telex sender transmits their telegram in full to the message centre that then stores and forwards the message over the shortwave link when it is available. Call charges were calculated for the time when the link was running without errors, either at six or ten second increments. CCITT recommended not charging if reliability was below 80%, and to give a busy signal if reliability was not satisfactory.|$|R
50|$|Hubbard {{determined}} {{at the end}} of 1966 that {{he would}} leave these problems behind by relocating Scientology's leadership, and himself, aboard a small fleet of ships that would travel around the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, out of reach of governments and the media. An elite group of the most committed Scientologists - the Sea Organization, or Sea Org - accompanied Hubbard, crewed the ships and received training in the most advanced levels of Scientology as they were being developed by Hubbard. He resigned as President and Executive Director of the HASI, though this supposed relinquishment of management was a fiction; he continued to issue a stream of executive directives and policy instructions and managed Scientology from his ship via a worldwide <b>telex</b> <b>network.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>telex</b> <b>network</b> is a {{switched}} network of teleprinters {{similar to a}} telephone network, {{for the purposes of}} sending text-based messages. The term refers to the network, not the teleprinters; point-to-point teleprinter systems had been in use long before telex exchanges were formed starting in the 1930s. Teleprinters evolved from telegraph systems, and, like the telegraph, they used {{the presence or absence of}} a pre-defined level of current to represent the mark or space symbols. This is as opposed to the analog telephone system, which used differing voltages to encode frequency information. For this reason, telex exchanges were entirely separate from the telephone system, with their own signalling standards, exchanges and system of [...] "telex numbers" [...] (the counterpart of a telephone number). When telephone and telex exchange equipment was co-located, which was not uncommon, the different signalling systems would sometimes cause interference.|$|R
50|$|Project Cybersyn {{was based}} on viable system model theory and a neural network {{approach}} to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a <b>network</b> of <b>telex</b> machines (Cybernet) in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (Cyberstride) that would monitor production indicators (such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism) in real time, and alert the workers in the first case, and in abnormal situations also the central government, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges. The information would also be input into economic simulation software (CHECO, for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (Opsroom) would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the <b>telex</b> <b>network.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1945 as {{the traffic}} {{increased}} {{it was decided}} to have a separate <b>network</b> for <b>Telex</b> traffic and the first manual exchange opened in London. By 1954 the <b>public</b> inland <b>Telex</b> service opened via manually switched exchanges. A number of subscribers were served via automatic sub-centres based on Post Office relays and Type 2 Uniselectors acting as concentrators for the manual exchange.|$|R
50|$|The {{telegraph}} and <b>telex</b> communication <b>networks</b> {{have been}} phased out, so interconnection among existing global networks arise at several points, such as between the voice telephony and digital data networks, and between these and satellite networks. Many applications run now on several networks, such as VoIP (voice over IP). Mobile communication (voice and data) networks are also intimately intertwinned, {{because the majority}} of 21st century cell phones have both voice and data (internet navigation and emailing) capabilities.|$|R
25|$|Allende also {{undertook}} Project Cybersyn, {{a system}} of <b>networked</b> <b>telex</b> machines and computers. Cybersyn was developed by British cybernetics expert Stafford Beer. The network was supposed to transmit data from factories to the government in Santiago, allowing for economic planning in real time.|$|R
5000|$|ARQ {{was first}} used commercially in 1947 with a link from Amsterdam to New York with the master station in Amsterdam. In May 1950 the TEX (Overseas {{teleprinter}} exchange) service between New York and Amsterdam started. TEX was an early name for TELEX which is a system to allow automatic routing of private messages from a sender to a receiver on the <b>TELEX</b> <b>network.</b> Prior to the introduction or ARQ-M {{there were so many}} errors in the messages received that staff from the telecommunications companies had to manually check messages and conform correct receipt. Once ARQ-M was introduced, messages could be automatically and reliably sent over long distances via shortwave radio, and so was introduced into automatic systems. By 1956 ARQ radio circuits were running from New York to Amsterdam, Berne, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Paramaribo, Paris, Rome, and Wien, with plans for Copenhagen, Lisbon, Madrid, and Oslo. Amsterdam had radio links to Berne, Curaçao, Jakarta, Paramaribo and Rome. Brussels linked to Leopoldville. Frankfurt was connected to Madrid and Rome with plans for Buenos Aires. A link from Madrid to Canary Islands was planned. [...] By 1959 most radio circuits for Telex were using ARQ. International shortwave ARQ data links have been replaced by undersea cables and satellite circuits.|$|R
5000|$|The telex {{numbering}} plan, {{usually a}} six-digit {{number in the}} United States, {{was based on the}} major exchange where the customer's telex machine terminated. For example, all telex customers that terminated in the New York City exchange were assigned a telex number that started with a first digit [...] "1". Further, all Chicago-based customers had telex numbers that started with a first digit of [...] "2". This numbering plan was maintained by Western Union as the telex exchanges proliferated to smaller cities in the United States. The Western Union <b>Telex</b> <b>network</b> was built on three levels of exchanges. The highest level was made up of the nine exchange cities previously mentioned. Each of these cities had the dual capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections to multiple distant telex exchanges. The second level of exchanges, located in large cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Miami, Newark, Pittsburgh and Seattle, were similar to the highest level of exchanges in capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections. However, these second level exchanges had a smaller customer line capacity and only had trunk circuits to regional cities. The third level of exchanges, located in small to medium-sized cities, could terminate telex customer lines and had a single trunk group running to its parent exchange.|$|R
40|$|In the 25 -years {{period of}} Polish People's Republic the {{achievements}} of the Communication Department including its basic divisions: the post-office and the telecommunication were remarkable and become still more spectacular if we take into consideration the fact that communication facilities had to be completely rebuilt because of the tremendous destruction caused by the war and the devastation of facilities done by the Nazi occupant. Owing to the rebuilding and developing of communication facilities their actual potential exceeds the pre-war state very remarkably. The increase in post-office services of transport and bank types compared to the level of 1938 is illustrated with the following data: ordinary letters — 151 %, registered letters — 342 %, magazines — 215 %, parcels — 182 %, postal and telegraphic orders — 253 %, savings put in the post-office — 188 %. In 1968 there were almost 960. 000 telephone subscribers (in 1939 only 225, 400), 2, 95 telephone subscribers and 5, 09 telephones to 100 inhabitants (in 1938 0. 64 and 0, 86 respectively), 1063 trunk calls and 43 telegrams to 100 inhabitants (in 1939 80 and 11. 4 respectively). Telex service that was unknown in this country in the pre-war period covered 3100 subscribers and 9. 4 teleprinters of the <b>telex</b> <b>network</b> to 100. 000 inhabitants in 1968. General development of post-office and telecommunication services was accompanied by a simultaneous leveling or reducing of differences in that field in towns and villages, in the provinces and their capitals, in accordance with the economic and cultural development of the whole country.

50|$|The {{night before}} the October 21, 1967 March on the Pentagon, Bloom, Mungo and the other staffers convened a chaotic meeting in a Washington loft with {{underground}} press editors {{from around the country}} who were in town to cover the march; but they failed to reach an agreement to create a democratic structure in which LNS would be owned and run by its member papers. Operating on their own with a volunteer staff of 12, Bloom and Mungo moved forward with ambitious plans for the expansion of LNS. In December they opened an international Telex line to Oxford, England; and later that winter LNS merged with the Student Communications Network (SCN), based in Berkeley, which had its own nationwide <b>Telex</b> <b>network</b> with terminals in Berkeley, Los Angeles, New York, Ann Arbor, Ames, Iowa, Chicago and Philadelphia, leased from Western Union. In February 1968 LNS took over the SCN office in New York, which had just been opened by former Columbia graduate student George Cavalletto and others in a converted Chinese restaurant on Claremont Avenue in Harlem. Walking by, Steve Diamond saw a brand new Telex machine sitting in an otherwise empty storefront and a sign seeking volunteers, and attended a meeting shortly afterward at which the New York staff was formed. Two months after it opened the New York office became a central focus for LNS activity during the Columbia University student uprising in April 1968, as a continual stream of bulletins going out over the Telex kept underground papers and radio stations across country up to the minute on the latest developments in the Columbia strike. To young radicals across the country {{it seemed as if the}} revolution had come.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{existing}} communication methods to deliver {{data from the}} satellite laser ranging (SLR) station to the SLR data center and back: telephonmodem, <b>telex,</b> and computer <b>networks.</b> The SLR scientific community has been exploiting mainly INTERNET, BITNET/EARN, and SPAN. The total of 56 countries are connected to INTERNET {{and the number of}} nodes is exponentially growing. The computer networks mentioned above and others are connected through E-mail protocol. The scientific progress of SLR requires the increase of communication speed and the amount of the transmitted data. The TOPEX/POSEIDON test campaign required to deliver Quick Look data (1. 7 kB/pass) from a SLR site to SLR data center within 8 hours and full rate data (up to 500 kB/pass) within 24 hours. We developed networking for the remote SLR station in Helwan, Egypt. The reliable scheme for data delivery consists of: compression of MERIT 2 format (up to 89 percent), encoding to ASCII Me (files); and e-mail sending from SLR station [...] e-mail receiving, decoding, and decompression at the center. We do propose to use the ZIP method for compression/decompression and the UUCODE method for ASCII encoding/decoding. This method will be useful for stations connected via telephonemodems or commercial networks. The electronics delivery could solve the problem of the too late receiving of the FR data by SLR data center...|$|R
