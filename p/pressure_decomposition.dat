40|$|Accurate {{representation}} of geostrophic and hydrostatic balance {{is an essential}} requirement for numerical modelling of geophysical flows. Potentially, unstructured mesh numerical methods offer significant benefits over conventional structured meshes, including the ability to conform to arbitrary bounding topography in a natural manner {{and the ability to}} apply dynamic mesh adaptivity. However, {{there is a need to}} develop robust schemes with accurate {{representation of}} physical balance on arbitrary unstructured meshes. We discuss the origin of physical balance errors in a finite element discretisation of the Navier-Stokes equations using the fractional timestep pressure projection method. By considering the Helmholtz decomposition of forcing terms in the momentum equation, it is shown that the components of the buoyancy and Coriolis accelerations that project onto the non-divergent velocity tendency are the small residuals between two terms of comparable magnitude. Hence there is a potential for significant injection of imbalance by a numerical method that does not compute these residuals accurately. This observation is used to motivate a balanced <b>pressure</b> <b>decomposition</b> method whereby an additional "balanced pressure" field, associated with buoyancy and Coriolis accelerations, is solved for at increased accuracy and used to precondition the solution for the dynamical pressure. The utility of this approach is quantified in a fully non-linear system in exact geostrophic balance. The approach is further tested via quantitative comparison of unstructured mesh simulations of the thermally driven rotating annulus against laboratory data. Using a piecewise linear discretisation for velocity and pressure (a stabilised P 1 P 1 discretisation), it is demonstrated that the balanced <b>pressure</b> <b>decomposition</b> method is required for a physically realistic representation of the system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

On the basis of a very limited number of independent kinetic parameters it is then possible to properly describe this degradation process. The simplifying hypotheses needed to describe this decomposition process in a closed form are carefully discussed. Unfortunately, the enhancing effect of the intermediate formation of unsaturated species forces the use of a numerical approach.

Engine cylinder pressure measurements {{provide insight into the}} combustion process and the accuracy of these measurements governs the quality of analyses of different combustion modes of the engine. Since the in-cylinder pressure increases abruptly after the start of combustion, non-flush mounting of the pressure transducer creates standing/resonant waves in the access passage which severely affect the recorded pressure fidelity by introducing undesired noise. The challenge is to get rid of these pressure pulsations and characterize the unaccounted noise which can lead to erroneous determination of different combustion parameters and characteristics. This work focuses on online filtering of the noisy pressure data so as to obviate the need of any post-processing for combustion and noise analysis. An online filtering algorithm is defined which is a combination of a five-point moving average filter and a forward and reverse Butterworth digital filter. The filter is tested for its robustness over different engine operating conditions such as engine load, speed, boost etc. The cut-off frequency of the filter is determined on a cycle-by-cycle basis using an algorithm based on the power spectral density of the pressure signal. The noise component is segregated from the pressure trace by means of <b>pressure</b> <b>decomposition</b> technique and the peak noise power is attributed to the access passage resonance frequency.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of atmospheric and oceanic flows are fundamentally limited {{by a lack}} of model resolution. This thesis describes the application of unstructured mesh finite element methods to geophysical fluid dynamics simulations. These methods permit the mesh resolution to be concentrated in regions of relatively increased dynamical importance. Dynamic mesh adaptivity can further be used to maintain an optimised mesh even as the flow develops. Hence unstructured dynamic mesh adaptive methods have the potential to enable efficient {{simulations of}} high Reynolds number flows in complex geometries. In this thesis, the thermally driven rotating annulus is used to test these numerical methods. This system is a classic laboratory scale analogue for large scale geophysical flows. The thermally driven rotating annulus {{has a long history of}} experimental and numerical research, and hence it is ideally suited for the validation of new numerical methods. For geophysical systems there is a leading order balance between the Coriolis and buoyancy accelerations and the pressure gradient acceleration: geostrophic and hydrostatic balance. It is essential that any numerical model for these systems is able to represent these balances accurately. In this thesis a balanced <b>pressure</b> <b>decomposition</b> method is described, whereby the pressure is decomposed into a ``balanced'' component associated with the Coriolis and buoyancy accelerations, and a ``residual'' component associated with other forcings and that enforces incompressibility. It is demonstrated that this method can be used to enable a more accurate representation of geostrophic and hydrostatic balance in finite element modelling. Furthermore, when applying dynamic mesh adaptivity, there is a further potential for imbalance injection by the mesh optimisation procedure. This issue is tested in the context of shallow-water ocean modelling. For the linearised system on an $f$-plane, and with a steady balance permitting numerical discretisation, an interpolant is formulated that guarantees that a steady and balanced state remains steady and in balance after interpolation onto an arbitrary target mesh. The application of unstructured dynamic mesh adaptive methods to the thermally driven rotating annulus is presented. Fixed structured mesh finite element simulations are conducted, and compared against a finite difference model and against experiment. Further dynamic mesh adaptive simulations are then conducted, and compared against the structured mesh simulations. These tests are used to identify weaknesses in the application of dynamic mesh adaptivity to geophysical systems. The simulations are extended to a more challenging system: the thermally driven rotating annulus at high Taylor number and with sloping base and lid topography. Analysis of the high Taylor number simulations reveals a direct energy transfer from the eddies to the mean flow, confirming the results of previous experimental work.

40|$|In {{the course}} of this work the excited state {{dynamics}} of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were studied by a combination of confocal PL spectroscopy and time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. Nonradiative decay channels dominate the excited state dynamics of SWCNTs leading to low photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and PL decay times on the picosecond timescale. Knowledge about the microscopic nature of these decay channels is crucial to improve the material properties. The measurements on the single nanotube level revealed large tube-to-tube variations of PL decay times, which could be attributed to different defect densities for different tubes. For the present SWCNT material the PL decay times only depend weakly on the nanotube length. SWCNT material synthesized by using a cobalt-molybdenum catalyst (CoMoCAT) systematically display short monoexponential PL decays, while the PL decay dynamics of SWCNTs produced high <b>pressure</b> <b>decomposition</b> of carbon monoxide process (HiPco) is either mono or biexponential depending on the respective local environment of the nanotube. The transition from a bi- to monoexponential PL decay can be explained by synthesis-dependent differences in defect densities. This defect related nonradiative decay channels reduce the amplitude of one decay component below the experimental detection limit. It is further shown, that photo-induced defects and gold atoms adsorbed to the sidewalls of SWCNTs are shown to alter the PL properties of individual SWCNTs. Additional low-energy PL satellite bands arise in the spectra. Their origin can be attributed to emission from nominally dark excitons which are ”brightened” due to defect facilitated mixing of intrinsic states with different parity/spin. The role of defects in the brightening process was investigated by time-resolved PL measurements and complementary Raman spectroscopy. Based on its energy separation and the unusually slow PL decay dynamics the lowest energy satellite band can be assigned to the radiative recombination of a triplet exciton. In a second project a common-path interference scattering approach (iSCAT) utilizing a conventional inverted laser scanning confocal microscope combined with a photonic crystal fibre as a supercontinuum white light source is successfully tested for its capabilities for elastic scattering imaging and spectroscopy of individual SWCNTs. Finally, it is shown that single layer graphene can selectively be turned luminescent upon exposure to a mild oxygen plasma. The treatment leads to a strong and spatially uniform PL which is characterized by a single, broad PL band extending from the visible to the near infrared spectral region.

The energy released by cleaving either a phosphate (Pi) or pyrophosphate (PPi) unit from ATP at standard state of 1 M are: ...|$|R

Based on the experimental parameters studied herein, it appears that 5  h was the optimal time and 1, 000 psig the optimal pressure to produce a catalyst with the largest specific surface area. Increasing H 2 pressure was also found to produce larger pore volumes in the catalyst (Figure  3) leading {{to the conclusion that}} textural properties of the catalyst can be controlled by optimizing ATM <b>decomposition</b> time and <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
