5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated {{at the base}} of a magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and <b>patterned</b> <b>ground.</b> On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost heaving into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E

Riiser-Larsen (about 1150 m above the surrounding sea level) area, Amundsen Bay, Enderby Land, East Antarctica, were described and presented in a geomorphological map compiled from the result of field work and aerial photographic interpretation. Major landforms, primarily of glacial and periglacial origin, include aretes, cirques, free faces, slopes covered with frost-shattered rock fragments, talus and/or tills, moraines at several levels, glacio-fluvial channels and ponds, and sorted <b>patterned</b> <b>grounds</b> (mostly polygons).

During the last glacial maximum the Patagonian Ice Sheet extended over the Andes from about 35°S to Tierra del Fuego at 55°S.

The objective has been to identify and characterize land surface covers that mainly include periglacial and glacial landforms, using fully polarimetric SAR C band RADARSAT- 2 data, on Fildes Peninsula that forms part of King George Island, and Ardley Island. Polarimetric parameters obtained from the SAR data, a selection of field based training and validation sites and a supervised classification approach, using the support vector machine were chosen to determine the spatial distribution of the different landforms. Eight periglacial and glacial landforms were characterized according to their scattering mechanisms using a set of 48 polarimetric parameters. The mapping of the most representative surface covers included colluvial deposits, stone fields and pavements, <b>patterned</b> <b>grounds,</b> glacial till and rock outcrops, lakes and glacier ice. The overall accuracy of the results was estimated at 81 %, a significant value when mapping areas that are within isolated regions where access is limited.

Sorted <b>patterned</b> <b>ground</b> and erosion patterns in polygonal terrain in the region support ice-rich material; hence a lake. Also, the presence of streamlined islands, cataracts, and dendritic channel systems suggest formation by water from a lake. [...] Some surfaces here show [...] "Rootless cones" [...] which are mounds with pits. They {{can be caused by}} explosions of lava with ground ice when lava flows on top of ice-rich ground. The ice melts and turns into a vapor that expands in an explosion that produces a cone or ring. Features like these are found in Iceland, when lavas cover water-saturated substrates. The western Elysium Planitia basin can be described as almost a perfect equipotential surface because it slopes only about 10m over a 500km distance—that’s about as level as the Earth’s ocean. [...] This very gentle slope argues against a lava flow. [...] In places, it has been found that the flow surface has been lowered by 50% which is expected if the flow was of water, but not if it were lava.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this project, {{independent}} component analysis has been applied to extract word clusters from two Farsi corpora. Both word-document and word-context matrices have been considered to extract such clusters. The application of ICA on the word-document matrices extracted from these two corpora led to the detection of syntagmatic word clusters, while the utilization of word-context matrix resulted in the extraction of both syntagmatic and paradigmatic word clusters. Furthermore, we have discussed some potential benefits of this automatically extracted thesaurus. In such a thesaurus, a word is defined by some other words without being connected to the outer physical objects. In order to fill such a gap, symbol grounding has been proposed by philosophers as a mechanism which might connect words to their physical referents. From their point of view, if words are properly connected to their referents, their meaning might be realized. Once this objective is achieved, a new promising horizon would open in the realm of artificial intelligence. In the second part of the project, we have offered a simple but novel method for grounding words based on the features coming from the visual modality. Firstly, indexical grounding is implemented. In this naïve symbol grounding method, a word is characterized using video indexes as its context. Secondly, such indexical word vectors have been normalized according to the features calculated for motion videos. This multimodal fusion has been referred to as the <b>pattern</b> <b>grounding.</b> In addition, the indexical word vectors have been normalized using some randomly generated data instead of the original motion features. This third case was called randomized grounding. These three cases of symbol grounding have been compared in terms of the performance of translation. Besides that, word clusters have been excerpted by comparing the vector distances and from the dendrograms generated using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method. We have observed that <b>pattern</b> <b>grounding</b> exceled the indexical grounding in the translation of the motion annotated words, while randomized grounding has deteriorated the translation significantly. Moreover, <b>pattern</b> <b>grounding</b> culminated in the formation of clusters in which a word fit semantically to the other members, while using the indexical grounding, some of the closely related words dispersed into arbitrary clusters...|$|R
