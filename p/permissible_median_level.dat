40|$|Background: Differentiating {{cerebral}} malaria (CM) from other causes of serious illness in African children is problematic, {{owing to the}} non-specific nature of the clinical presentation and the high prevalence of incidental parasitaemia. CM is associated with endothelial activation. In this study we tested the hypothesis that endothelium-derived biomarkers {{are associated with the}} pathophysiology of severe malaria and may help identify children with CM. Methods and Findings: Plasma samples were tested from children recruited with uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 32), {{cerebral malaria}} with retinopathy (CM-R; n = 38), clinically defined CM without retinopathy (CM-N; n = 29), or non-malaria febrile illness with decreased consciousness (CNS; n = 24). Admission levels of angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2), Ang- 1, soluble Tie- 2 (sTie- 2), von Willebrand factor (VWF), its propeptide (VWFpp), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble ICAM- 1 (sICAM- 1) and interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP- 10) were measured by ELISA. Children with CM-R had significantly higher <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> of Ang- 2, Ang- 2 :Ang- 1, sTie- 2, VWFpp and sICAM- 1 compared to children with CM-N.

The frequencies and <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> of IgG antibodies to CSP and TRAP were similar in children and adults in the rainy season, but they were lower in children than in adults in the dry season.

Antibodies to LSA- 1 and CSP did not correlate with protection in children or adults.

The median and 95 th percentile exposure biomarker levels with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Multivariate regression analyses were performed on log transformed exposure biomarker levels adjusted for age, sex, area, household income, and father’s education <b>level.</b> The <b>median</b> exposure biomarker <b>levels</b> were compared with data from Germany, the US, and Canada, {{as well as the}} levels of Korean children measured at different times. ResultsThe <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> of blood lead and mercury, as well as urinary cadmium were 1. 23 μg/dL, 1. 80 μg/L, and 0. 40 μg/L (95 % CIs, 1. 21 – 1. 25, 1. 77 – 1. 83, and 0. 39 – 0. 41, respectively). The blood lead levels were significantly higher in boys and younger children (p< 0. 0001) and children with less educated fathers (p= 0. 004) after adjusting for covariates. Urinary cadmium level increased with age (p< 0. 0001). The <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> of blood mercury and urinary cadmium were much higher in Korean children and adolescents than those in their peers in Germany, the US, and Canada.

In this prospective study, we measured miR- 21, miR- 10 b, and miR- 19 a levels using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the serum of 113 breast cancer patients and determined their association with clinicopathologic factors and clinical outcome. Thirty healthy donors with no history of cancer were enrolled as controls. Patients with non-metastatic HER 2 (+) breast cancer had higher serum miR- 21 <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> than patients with non-metastatic HER 2 (-) disease (p =  0. 044); whereas patients with metastatic HER 2 (+) breast cancer had higher serum miR- 10 b <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> than patients with metastatic HER 2 (-) disease (p =  0. 0004). There {{were no significant differences in}} serum miR- 19 a <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> between HER 2 (+) and HER 2 (-) groups, regardless of the presence of metastases.
