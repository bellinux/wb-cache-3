5|$|Pilecki's show {{trial and}} {{execution}} {{was part of}} a wider campaign of repression against former Home Army members and others connected with the Polish Government-in-Exile in London. In 2003, the prosecutor, Czesław Łapiński, and several others involved in the trial were charged with complicity in Pilecki's murder. Józef Cyrankiewicz, the chief <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness,</b> was already dead, and Łapiński died in 2004, before the trial was concluded.|$|E
5|$|The four {{civilians were}} tried on December 13. The {{principal}} <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness,</b> a servant {{of one of}} the accused, made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. In the face of this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.|$|E
5|$|The government's first witness, U.S. Attorneys' Office clerk Gordon Morgan {{testified that}} Glasser had {{suggested}} that Sidney S. Eckstone be appointed foreperson of a grand jury that returned only eight out of twenty indictments and that Glasser and Eckstone had conferred frequently. Another <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness,</b> illegal distillery landlord William F. Workman, testified that Capone-affiliated Louis Schiavone had posted approximately $1,000,000 in bail bonds.|$|E

5|$|From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven Wehrmacht {{servicemen}} {{were tried}} by a Soviet military court in Leningrad. One of them, Arno Düre, who {{was charged with}} murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness</b> during the Nuremberg trials. He later recanted his confession, claiming that {{he was forced to}} confess by the investigators.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} that issues relating to time would be {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. A <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness,</b> Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.|$|E

50|$|During the 13 {{years that}} the trial dragged on, a number of judges were {{appointed}} to hear the murder case. The change of judges {{is one of the}} many reasons behind the delay in disposal of the present case. Other reasons include a lack of interest of the <b>prosecution</b> <b>witnesses</b> and long adjournments sought by the counsel for President Asif Ali. The acquitted included Mazhar Memon, Asghar Ali, Asif Ali Jatoi, Mehmood Bhallai, Ghulam Mustafa Chandio and Akhter Ali Mirani. The police personnel acquitted include Shoaib Suddle, Wajid Durrani, Masood Sharif, Rai Tahir and others who were <b>prosecution</b> <b>witnesses</b> in this case.|$|R

25|$|During Libby's trial, Libby's lawyers {{argued that}} Libby's {{testimony}} {{to the grand jury}} and his interviews with the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have contained inaccuracies but that they were the result of innocent memory lapses explained by his pressing schedule of national security issues. Libby's defense lawyers also challenged the memory and recollections of each <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Psychologists {{hired by}} the defense {{believed}} Loukaitis suffered from either depression or bipolar disorder, while <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness</b> Dr. Alan Unis, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington, diagnosed him with dysthymic disorder.

He also suffered from clinical depression, a mental illness present in the last three generations of the Loukaitis family, and last four generations of the Phillips family.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Winfrey, who was 15 {{years old}} at the time, confessed to the murder in the {{presence}} of police and his parents. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and forcible rape and testified against the other three in their trials. He received a 30-year sentence. He testified that Clemons and Richardson were the ones who had pushed the two girls. Winfrey was the only white member of the convicted group, which has been raised as a criticism since he was the main <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Five {{years after}} the trial, former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser, who issued the arrest {{warrants}} in 1991, was alleged to have {{said that he was}} not entirely happy with the evidence presented against Megrahi during his trial in 2000, and in his subsequent appeal in 2002. However, {{he made it clear that}} this did not mean that he believed Megrahi to be innocent. According to The Sunday Times of 23 October 2005, Lord Fraser allegedly cast doubt upon the reliability of the main <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness,</b> Tony Gauci.|$|E
25|$|The defense called two {{government}} {{witnesses who}} countered <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness</b> testimony about the duct tape.

Cindy Anthony testified that their family buried their pets in blankets and plastic bags, using duct tape to seal the opening. Additionally, an FBI forensic document examiner found no evidence of a sticker or sticker residue on the duct tape found near the child's remains.|$|E
50|$|Under the new SOSMA legislation, the {{prosecutor}} at a trial {{is permitted to}} keep secret the identity of <b>prosecution</b> <b>witnesses,</b> thus preventing cross examination.

50|$|Incredibly, after filing the chargesheet in 2000, the CBI took 7 {{years to}} record {{evidence}} from 16 <b>prosecution</b> <b>witnesses.</b> On the other hand, the defence counsel took {{nine months to}} complete examination of 13 out of the total 17 witnesses.|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of this ruling, Overland had been denied the {{opportunity}} to cross-examine Mark Safarik, the last <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness</b> and an FBI expert on burglaries, who had testified that the crime scene suggested a staged burglary, as opposed to a real one that had been interrupted in progress. Since the prosecution had told the court at a sidebar prior to Safarik's testimony that they intended to limit their questioning to supporting this theory, Perry similarly limited the defense on cross. However, Tickle argued, since Safarik's own report had considered the other burglary, testimony about that should have been allowed.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Eyler's death from AIDS, he was {{awaiting}} his execution. He was represented by attorney Kathleen Zellner, who had made an appeal disputing the conviction in the Bridges' murder. This was pending in the Illinois Supreme Court. The appeal maintained that one of Eyler's trial lawyers, David Shippers, had {{a conflict of interest}} as he had received $16,875 from a <b>prosecution</b> <b>witness,</b> Robert David Little. Little and Eyler had long been associated. Eyler had claimed that Little {{was the one who had}} killed Bridges. After Eyler's death, Zellner confirmed that she would proceed with filing the appeal to clarify various legal issues.|$|E
