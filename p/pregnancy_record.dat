40|$|Immunization against pertussis, influenza, and rubella reduces {{morbidity}} and mortality in pregnant women and their offspring. Health care professionals (HCPs) caring for women perinatally are uniquely placed to reduce maternal vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). Despite guidelines recommending immunization during the perinatal period, maternal vaccine uptake remains low. This qualitative study explored the role of obstetricians, general practitioners, and midwives in maternal vaccine uptake. Semi-structured interviews (n = 15) were conducted with perinatal HCPs at a tertiary maternity hospital in South Australia. HCPs were asked {{to reflect on their}} knowledge, beliefs, and practice relating to immunization advice and vaccine provision. Interviews were transcribed and coded using thematic analysis. Data collection and analysis was an iterative process, with collection ceasing with theoretical saturation. Participants unanimously supported maternal vaccination as an effective way of reducing risk of disease in this vulnerable population, however only rubella immunity detection and immunization is embedded in routine care. Among these professionals, delegation of responsibility for maternal immunization was unclear and knowledge about maternal immunization was variable. Influenza and pertussis vaccine prevention measures were not included in standard <b>pregnancy</b> <b>record</b> documentation, information provision to patients was “ad hoc” and vaccinations not offered on-site. The key finding was that the incorporation of maternal vaccinations into standard care through a structured process is an important facilitator for immunization uptake. Incorporating vaccine preventable disease management measures into routine obstetric care including incorporation into the <b>Pregnancy</b> <b>Record</b> would facilitate HCPs in implementing recommendations. Rubella prevention provides a useful “template” for other vaccines. Heather Webb, Jackie Street, Helen Marshal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In cross sectional, case {{control and}} {{retrospective}} cohort studies, duration of Exclusive Breastfeeding (EBF) usually depends on maternal recall. Retrospective data are often subjected to recall bias and {{could lead to}} a potential for exposure misclassification. The purpose of the present paper is to assess the validity of maternal recall of EBF duration during infancy, after cessation of EBF and to evaluate the two methods to collect retrospective data on EBF. Methods A cohort study was carried out in Naula Medical Officer of Health (MOH) area. Study cohort included all infants born during the months of February to April 2008 and currently residing in Naula MOH area. Baseline data collection was carried out using the <b>pregnancy</b> <b>record,</b> the child health development record and by using an interviewer administered structured questionnaire. Data extraction from the <b>pregnancy</b> <b>record</b> and the child health development record were carried out by public health midwives. The interviewer administered structured questionnaire was administered by the MOH during the follow-up visits. Duration of EBF was assessed in three ways; based on prospective data since birth: Retrospective data based on an event calendar: and the Mother reported EBF duration. Results A total of 114 mother-infant pairs were recruited and followed up. Proportion of infants receiving EBF up to the completion of the sixth month by the three methods were; data since birth (actual EBF rate) - 23. 9 %; mother reported data - 77. 7 % and event calendar method - 41. 3 %. Median duration of EBF reported in the three methods was 5, 6, and 5 respectively. A statistically significant difference was observed in these differences from Kaplan-Meire Survival analysis (Log rank test - Chi square- 63. 4, p Conclusions Retrospective evaluation methods systematically overestimate the duration of EBF. Maternal recall data provide highly unspecific data whereas use of an event calendar provided more valid data. Reporting of data accrual methods in breastfeeding studies will allow the readers to interpret findings accurately and the use of event calendars rather than direct questioning as a valid method of determining EBF is recommended. </p...|$|E

40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} objectives: Primary {{health care and}} {{maternity}} services in New Zealand are delivered via independent self-employed practitioners and separate organisations with no requirement to co-ordinate care. There are disparate immunisation timeliness and rates between ethnic groups. The aim of this practice development initiative {{is to improve the}} health of pregnant women and infants. The objectives are to link the general practice enrolled pregnant women with a midwife on confirmation of their <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>record</b> the date of delivery in the general practice notes, enrol the infant with the general practice shortly after birth and so increase the timeliness and rates of immunisations. Methods: Following an initial audit, information is now recorded on the engagement of pregnant women with a midwife in early pregnancy. Contact is made with the midwife and recorded in the general practice notes around the expected delivery date. An invitation to enrol the infant with the general practice is sent to the family four weeks post natal. Immunisation timeliness and rates of infants are audited monthly.

40|$|Background: {{fetal alcohol}} {{syndrome}} (FAS) {{has been identified as}} a major cause of impairment to normal physical and intellectual development among Indigenous children in Far North Queensland; however, little is known of the pregnancy characteristics of mothers of those children diagnosed with FAS or of interventions that might assist in lowering the prevalence of the syndrome. Aim: to review the <b>pregnancy</b> <b>records</b> of women whose infants were subsequently diagnosed with FAS by the Paediatric Outreach Service (POS) of the Cairns Base Hospital, and to determine how such women might be identified prospectively in pregnancy and offered intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. Methods: a retrospective case–control study involving all children diagnosed with FAS by the POS between 1994 and 2006; maternal <b>pregnancy</b> <b>records</b> were accessed and details obtained. Results: mothers of cases were older, of higher parity, smoked more cigarettes, attended fewer antenatal visits and experienced more antenatal and delivery complications than mothers of controls. The average gestational age at booking was not statistically significant between the two groups. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two groups in self-reported alcohol consumption both before and during pregnancy and in numbers of women who decreased alcohol consumption once the diagnosis of pregnancy was known to them.

40|$|Objective. To {{characterize}} {{female adolescents}} {{who have been}} pregnant, and to analyze the association between adolescent pregnancy and educational gaps. Materials and methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted. Data come from the Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición (Ensanut 2012), a Mexican representative survey. The set of data used is related to sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics from 1 790 women from 12 to 19 years who had begun their sexual life and had a <b>pregnancy</b> <b>record.</b> Three statistical models were adjusted to observe the association between variables. The dependent variable of the first model was the condition of previous pregnancy, the second to be pregnant {{at the time of}} data collection, and the third, educational gap. Results. A 74. 9 % of the adolescents with history of pregnancy has educational gap. To have the condition of previous pregnancy is associated with living with sexual partner (OR= 8. 4), educational gap (OR= 2. 4), low socioeconomical level (OR= 2. 0) and school assistance (OR= 0. 5). To be pregnant at the time of data collection has related only to living with sexual partner (OR= 9. 4).

40|$|AbstractThe {{thyroid gland}} {{has long been}} {{recognized}} as an important modulator of reproductive function. Both hyper- and hypo-thyroidism are associated with reproductive dysfunction and infertility. In addition, thyroid hormones appear to {{play a key role}} in the expression of events that underlie seasonal reproductive cycles. Despite the considerable information is available on the histology of thyroid gland in some of the bats, literature related to study is very few, and further information available on the ultrastructure is also scanty. The specimen of Taphozous kachhensis was collected from Ambai Nimbi. Many collections were made during the breeding season so as to coincide with the time of reproductive cycle and to get an accurate <b>pregnancy</b> <b>record.</b> Thyroid is removed from the bat and cut into 1 – 2 mm piece and immersed in fresh ice-cold 3 % gluteraldehyde solution for 2 – 4 h and send for further process. The thyroid gland is more active during estrus than the pregnancy and lactation. The cell organelles observed in follicular cell of thyroid gland indicate more synthetic activity. While during pregnancy and lactation the thyroid gland is not synthetically active but the appearance of more lysosomal bodies during pregnancy indicate the utilization of stored colloid and release of thyroid hormone in blood stream. The parafollicular cells are more developed during pregnancy and lactation than estrus as indicated by ultrastructural characteristics. These cells may secrete calcitonin, serotonin, and somatostatin and may be responsible for controlling the seasonal changes in plasma calcium concentration in this bat...|$|E

Three studies were conducted: (a) antenatal staff surveys pre- and post-training to deliver the brief intervention; (b) retrospective audit of pregnancy records; (c) post-intervention follow-up interviews with a cohort of pregnant women who smoked at baseline. Setting. South Australia. Sample. (a) Antenatal health professionals at two major birthing hospitals (n = 117 pre-survey and n = 62 post-survey); (b) 1, 024 pregnancy records; (c) follow-up interviews with women at one month (n = 58), 6 months (n = 40) and 12 months (n = 31) post-intervention. Methods. (a) Staff surveys about current practice prior to training (via written questionnaire) and 12 months post-training (by telephone); (b) <b>pregnancy</b> <b>record</b> audit for presence {{and use of the}} Smoke-Free Assessment & Intervention Form (SFA&IF) conducted at 12 months; (c) telephone surveys assessing smoking behavior. Main Outcome Measures. Staff practice change and compliance with the intervention. Cessation rates among pregnant women. Results. At 12 months, 89 % of staff reported that the intervention integrated well into their work; The SFA&IF was physically present in 80 % of pregnancy records and 89 % had been completed. Over 65 % of current smokers were offered advice about the benefits of quitting; quit rates were highest at 6 months (18, 13 % conservative estimate), but women tended to relapse after the birth of their baby.

40|$|In 1935, Burr and Musselman {{reported}} a correlation of the menstrual cycle {{in women with}} the difference in potential of the index fingers. Small daily fluctuations were noted. However, once in each cycle there occurred a marked increase in potential difference which was many times the usual determination. The right index finger showed an increase in positive polarity to several thousands of microvolts between the fourteenth and seventeenth days preceding {{the onset of the}} subsequent menses. For nine successive months this observation was repeated with great accuracy. A <b>pregnancy</b> <b>record</b> failed to show such cydic phenomena. A further study (1938) on a group of fourteen women showed that the voltage rises occurred most frequently {{in the middle of the}} cycle and some immediately after menstruation, but there were no unequivocal cases of peaks just preceding catamenia. There was evidence that cycles occur without the appearance of significant voltage rises. These findings have been confirmed by Parmenter. 6 In the rabbit, sharp rises in potential differences between the vagina and symphysis had been demonstrated in association with ovulation by Burr, Hill, and Allen ' and were confirmed by Reboul, Friedgood, and Davis. 8 The marked variations in the electric potential between the index fingers in women and at the time of ovulation in the rabbit suggested that these phenomena are related. A continuous graph of the changes in electric gradients between the vagina and symphysis associated with ovulation in women was secured by Burr, Musselman, Barton, and Kelly. 4 The voltage rise occurred nine days preceding the subsequent expected period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is {{more common}} than P. falciparum {{as a cause of}} malaria {{in many parts of the}} tropics outside Africa. P. falciparum {{infection}} has harmful effects in pregnancy, but the effects of P. vivax have not been characterised. We investigated the effects of P. vivax infection during pregnancy. METHODS: Since 1986, pregnant Karen women living in camps for displaced people on the western border of Thailand have been encouraged to attend antenatal clinics. Karen women were screened for malaria and anaemia at each week of pregnancy until delivery, and <b>pregnancy</b> outcome <b>recorded.</b> We compared the effects of P. vivax infection on anaemia and pregnancy outcome with those of P. falciparum and no malaria infection in the first <b>pregnancy</b> <b>recorded</b> at the antenatal clinics. FINDINGS: There were 634 first episodes of pure P. vivax malaria in 9956 women. P. vivax malaria was more common in primigravidae than in multigravidae and was associated with mild anaemia and an increased risk of low birthweight (odds ratio 1. 64 [95 % CI 1. 29 - 2. 08], p< 0. 001). The birthweight was a mean of 107 g (95 % CI 61 - 154) lower in women with P. vivax infection than in uninfected women. By contrast with P. falciparum malaria, the decrease in birthweight was greater in multigravidae. P. vivax malaria was not associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or with a shortened duration of pregnancy. INTERPRETATION: P. vivax malaria during pregnancy is associated with maternal anaemia and low birthweight. The effects of P. vivax infection are less striking than those of P. falciparum infection, but antimalarial prophylaxis against P. vivax in pregnancy may be justified...|$|R

White and non-White patients were characterized by age, sex, socioeconomic status, pandemic wave and indicators of pre-morbid health status. Logistic regression examined differences by ethnicity in patient characteristics, care pathway and clinical outcomes; multivariable models controlled for potential confounders. Whites (n = 630) and non-Whites (n = 510) differed by age, socioeconomic status, pandemic wave of admission, <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>recorded</b> obesity, previous and current smoking, and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After adjustment for a priori confounders non-Whites {{were less likely to}} have received pre-admission antibiotics [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0 · 43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0 · 28 - 0 · 68, P < 0 · 001) but more likely to receive antiviral drugs as in-patients (aOR 1 · 53, 95 % CI 1 · 08 - 2 · 18, P = 0 · 018). However, {{there were no significant differences}} by ethnicity in delayed admission, severity at presentation for admission, or likelihood of severe outcome. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{phthalates}} and phenols are hormonally {{active and}} are suspected {{to alter the}} course of development. OBJECTIVE: We investigated prenatal exposures to phthalate and phenol metabolites and their associations with body size measures of the infants at birth. METHODS: We measured 5 phenol and 10 phthalate urinary metabolites in a multiethnic cohort of 404 women in New York City during their third trimester of <b>pregnancy</b> and <b>recorded</b> size of infants at birth...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The <b>Pregnancy</b> Health <b>Record</b> (PHR) is a {{functional}} tool {{that allows the}} sharing of pregnancy data among health care professionals. This information is particularly important {{in the assessment of}} the newborn immediately after delivery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyse the quality of these records. Methods: PHR data were collected from a convenience sampling of puerperal women admitted in the Obstetrics Service between March and June 2014. The quality of the records was evaluated according to the recommendations of Direção Geral de Saúde (DGS). SPSS 20 ® was used for data analysis (statistically significant p< 0. 05) Results: The final sample was composed by 468 puerperae. The pregnancy was monitored in 98 % of the cases, 44 % of which in a Health Care Center (HCC), 21 % in a private obstetrician (PO), 24 % in the hospital and 11 % in multiple places. Correct records were found for blood type in 96 % of the cases, blood count in 60 %, gestational diabetes screening in 59 %, group B streptococcus screening in 76 %, ultrasounds in 87 %, HIV in 64 %, HBV in 72 %, and for toxoplasmosis in 66 %. No significant differences in these records considering the care unit where pregnancy was monitored. There was a statistically significant association between pregnancy surveillance in the HCC and correct records for syphilis and tetanus vaccination (p< 0. 001). Although the DGS does not recommend routine screening for CMV and VHC, a relationship between these serology <b>records</b> and <b>pregnancy</b> monitoring in PO was found (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 03) Conclusion: The majority of records were considered correct, however a greater completeness and uniformity of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>records</b> is still necessary, so that the paediatrician can have accurate pregnancy clinical information for the first observation of the newborn...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pre-eclampsia is {{associated}} with an increased risk of development of cardiovascular disease later in life. It is not known how general practitioners in the Netherlands care for these women after delivery with respect to cardiovascular risk factor management. Methods Review of medical records of 1196 women in four primary health care centres, who were registered from January 2000 until July 2007 with an International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) code indicating <b>pregnancy.</b> <b>Records</b> were searched for indicators of pre-eclampsia. Of those who experienced pre-eclampsia and of a random sample of 150 women who did not, the following information on cardiovascular risk factor management after pregnancy was extracted from the records: frequency and timing of blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose measurements - and vascular diagnoses. Additionally the sensitivity and specificity of ICPC coding for pre-eclampsia were determined. Results 35 women experienced pre-eclampsia. Blood pressure was more often checked after pregnancy in these women than in controls (57. 1 % vs. 12. 0 %, p Conclusion Despite the evidence of increased risk of future cardiovascular disease in women with a history of pre-eclampsia, follow-up of these women is insufficient and undeveloped in primary care in the Netherlands. </p...|$|R
