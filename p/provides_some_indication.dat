Primary school enrolment has increased substantially but only about half of those enrolled manage to complete both cycles. There are a large number of over-age children enrolling for grade 1 although this has been declining. This is shown by the difference between gross intake rate (GIR) and net intake rate (NIR). GIR is the percentage of children enrolled for grade 1, regardless of age, out {{of the population of the}} appropriate age of 7 years. NIR is the percentage of children of appropriate age out of the population of that age.|$|E

50|$|The {{length and}} {{width of the}} ski define its total surface area, which <b>provides</b> <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> of the ski's float, or ability to remain {{on top of the}} snow instead of sinking into it. Cross-country skis must be narrow to reduce drag, and thus must be long to produce the {{required}} float. Alpine skis are generally not designed to reduce drag, and tend to be shorter and wider. Skis used in downhill race events are longer, with a subtle side cut, built for speed and wide turns. Slalom skis, as well as many recreational skis, are shorter with a greater side cut to facilitate tighter, easier turns. For off-piste skis the trend is towards wider skis that better float on top of powder snow. The ski width of all-mountain and off-piste skis has generally increased since the 1990's when 85 mm width was considered a wide powderski. From 2010 and onwards, many well known ski manufacturers sell all-round freeride skis for the general public starting in the 90mm range and going up to 120 mm or more.|$|E

30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that senior business students are consequent in using private-sector logic for all decision tasks, even in the public-sector context. Therefore, business students transfer their learning from business studies, even to a public-sector decision-making context.

The resulting system significantly outperforms previous work in such automatic conversion. We also achieve comparable results to a system using a phrase-structure parser for the conversion.

An historical analysis <b>provides</b> <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> that regional disparities have characterised the Scottish Health Service in the twentieth century.
