5|$|Louis XVIII {{signed the}} Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814. The treaty gave France her 1792 borders, which {{extended}} {{east of the}} Rhine. She had to <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> war indemnity, and the occupying armies of the Sixth Coalition withdrew instantly from French soil. These generous terms would be reversed in the next Treaty of Paris after the Hundred Days (Napoleon's return to France in 1815).|$|E
5|$|Several Acts of Parliament then followed. The Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates {{proposed}} that the clergy <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> more than 5% of their first year's revenue (annates) to Rome. This was initially controversial, and required that Henry visit the House of Lords three times to browbeat the Commons.|$|E

Just as with undergraduate studies, students <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> tuition fees. While the programs are coordinated by the rectorship, the individual institutions have a lot of freedom on defining the focus, length and admission process of each program.|$|E
25|$|If {{your income}} {{is less than}} €13,000 you <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> Universal Social Charge (USC). (This limit was €4,004 in 2011, €10,036 from 2012 to 2014 and €12,012 in 2015.) Once your income is over this limit, you pay the {{relevant}} rate of USC on all of your income. For example, if you have income of €13,000 you will <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> USC.

25|$|The {{losses of}} {{income from the}} Diocese of Africa were {{equivalent}} to the costs of nearly 40,000 infantry or over 20,000 cavalry. The imperial regime had to increase taxes.

In even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named trioxidanediyl.|$|E
25|$|A running gag {{throughout}} {{the series is}} that Namiko is extremely clumsy, and will very often fall in holes, fall out of buildings (usually out of her classroom window), or off of cliffs. While the students in her class are initially concerned about her many falls, they become jaded by how often it occurs and <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> attention to her potentially getting injured {{later on in the}} series.

25|$|In childhood, Vātsyāyana says, {{a person}} should {{learn how to}} make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass one should {{concentrate}} on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth. The Kama Sutra acknowledges that the senses can be dangerous: 'Just as a horse in full gallop, blinded by the energy of his own speed, pays no attention to any post or hole or ditch on the path, so two lovers, blinded by passion, in the friction of sexual battle, are caught up in their fierce energy and <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> attention to danger' (2.7.33).|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Helmut Simon died. Two years later, in June 2006, {{an appeals}} court affirmed that the Simons had indeed {{discovered}} the Iceman and were therefore entitled to a finder's fee. It also ruled that the provincial government had to pay the Simons' legal costs. After this ruling, Mrs. Erika Simon reduced her claim to €150,000. The provincial government's response was that the expenses it had incurred to establish a museum {{and the costs of}} preserving the Iceman should be considered in determining the finder's fee. It insisted it would <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> more than €50,000. In September 2006, the authorities appealed the case to Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation.|$|E
25|$|Class A {{workers are}} {{employees}} aged under 66 in industrial, commercial, and service-type employment who are {{paid more than}} €38 a week from all employments, {{as well as to}} public servants recruited from 6 April 1995. Class A employees earning under €352 per week are placed in subclass AO, and <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> PRSI/ Class A employees earning between €352 and €356 are in subclass AX; those earning over €356 but {{less than or equal to}} €500 are in subclass AL. Both subclasses pay 4% PRSI, and the first €127 of earnings are no longer disregarded for this calculation, so therefore PRSI is 4% on all earnings/ Class A employees earning over €500 per week are in subclass A1 and pay 4% on all their weekly earnings.|$|E

25|$|The university, the City of Mankato and the Mankato Transit System {{coordinate}} transit {{service for}} students, staff and visitors along 8 bus lines, {{as well as}} intercity transit between Mankato and the Twin Cities on private service via Land to Air Express and Jefferson Bus Lines. The Minnesota State Student Association, the undergraduate student association at Mankato, approved in 2012 a $0.75 cent Green Transportation fee that would allow all students to <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> cost to use the bus system throughout the year. In addition to this, the student association also organizes the Maverick Shuttle a paratransit option and Stomper Express which runs exclusively at night. With the changes to the fee structure for fares, bus ridership doubled {{in a manner of}} two years.|$|E

25|$|When {{the kidnappers}} finally reduced their demands to $3 million, Getty senior agreed to <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> more than $2.2 million—the maximum {{that would be}} tax deductible. He lent his son the {{remaining}} $800,000 at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in a filling station of Lauria, {{in the province of}} Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone. Nine people associated with 'Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted. Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed {{for the rest of his}} life. He died 30 years later on February 5, 2011 at the age of 54.|$|E
25|$|The system {{remained}} essentially unchanged {{until the}} completion of the West RailLine in December 2003. Many changes were made, mainly around the new railway stations. The KCRC designed most railway stations in the LRT area to interchange with the new West Rail line. The idea was to encourage passengers to use the West Rail Line instead of the Light Rail for longer journeys to free up LRT vehicles for passengers making shorter journeys. For this purpose, an interchange discount system was launched with the introduction of the West Rail Line system, meaning that passengers would <b>pay</b> <b>no</b> more (and in some cases less) to travel on West Rail Line instead of the LRT for the main part of their journey. Although this most recent extension is the largest ever, no new vehicles were purchased. And although rearrangements were made, some infrequent and unreliable services resulted, causing passengers to blame the lack of vehicles and poor arrangement of new services. The KCRC has since modified the inside of some vehicles to allow more standing room for passengers during peak hours. They have also several route alterations to arrange them better.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September Charles III reluctantly left Barcelona to take {{possession}} of the Austrian hereditary lands and the Imperial crown, leaving behind his wife Elizabeth as a pledge to the Spanish. In order to facilitate the Imperial election at Frankfurt – and keep the electors loyal to the Habsburgs – Eugene and the troops still in Austrian <b>pay</b> (<b>no</b> more than 16,000 men) had already moved from Flanders to the Rhine where the French were massing for a new offensive (or to at least disrupt the Imperial election). In the event Eugene's campaign proved uneventful and in October, shortly after his embarkation at Genoa, Archduke Charles was elected Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI. Yet even before he had left Barcelona Charles knew the Allies were {{on the point of}} making peace and that Spain was no longer within the dynasty's grasp. Vendôme sought to hasten the Allied departure from Catalonia by moving on Tarragona and Barcelona; several small towns fell as a prelude, but Starhemberg fought back, and the Bourbons were unable to secure a military solution that year. Meanwhile, on the Spanish-Portuguese border Vila Verde had replaced Fronteira as commander of the Portuguese army, and the Earl of Portmore succeeded Galway as British commander. However, the campaign against de Bay proved uneventful as {{it became clear that the}} momentum was now with the peace negotiations.|$|E
