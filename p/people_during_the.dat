Lucien's punishment is to be condemned into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans' world. While Kirk states that humanity has progressed infinitely since 1691, the Megans ignore his words.

5|$|Willis {{faced the}} {{challenge}} of having Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly and strong Democratic leadership in each. In the House, Democrats held a 56–44 majority, and Harry Lee Waterfield served as Speaker of the House. In the Senate, Democrats held a 23–15 majority, and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate was Earle C. Clements. Both Waterfield and Clements were preparing to make gubernatorial runs in 1947. Willis did not make wholesale dismissals of Democrats in the state government, owing in part to shortages of experienced <b>people</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> war. This cost him some Republican support, and both his lieutenant governor and attorney general began to oppose him on many matters. However, his refusal to make wholesale dismissals may have been responsible the legislature not stripping the bulk of his gubernatorial powers as it had done to Flem D. Sampson, the last Republican governor.|$|E
5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning <b>people</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> spring period, {{though it is}} unlikely that vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E
