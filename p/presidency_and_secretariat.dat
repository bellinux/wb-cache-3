The secretariat headquarters would, according to the deal, be shifted to Germany. At the congress several delegations from European countries opposed moving the headquarters out of Amsterdam. Fear {{of the consequences of}} the rise of National Socialism in Germany {{was one of the reasons}} cited in their argumentation against the move. However, in July 1931, the headquarters of IFTU were shifted to Hansahaus, Köpernickestrasse, Berlin.|$|E

25|$|The Council was {{composed}} of one national minister from each member state. However the Council met in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture was being discussed, the Council would be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represented their governments and were accountable to their national political systems. Votes were taken either by majority (with votes allocated according to population) or unanimity. In these various forms they share some legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament. Since the 1960s the Council also began to meet informally {{at the level of}} national leaders; these European summits followed the same <b>presidency</b> system <b>and</b> <b>secretariat</b> as the Council but was not a formal formation of it.|$|R
40|$|Headline issue: The 2009 Conference of Parties (COP 15) in Copenhagen, which {{aimed to}} deliver a first-ever {{comprehensive}} global climate deal, ended without agreement {{in part because of}} poor management of the negotiations by the Danish host <b>and</b> the UNFCCC <b>Secretariat.</b> Significantly altered management practices a year later at COP 16 in Cancun, Mexico, were a major factor in an agreement being reached. This policy paper looks at how negotiations management can contribute to successful negotiation outcomes by analysing evidence from 55 confidential interviews with senior negotiators from all coalitions involved in the UNFCCC process, high-level UN officials, lead host organisers and summit observers. Key findings: The evidence suggests that the COP <b>Presidency</b> <b>and</b> UNFCCC <b>Secretariat</b> can make an important contribution to achieving a successful negotiation outcome by: Creating a transparent and inclusive process. Transparency and inclusivity are crucial to ensure that all parties understand the negotiation process and its content. This enhances their ability to contribute and to compromise. It also reduces the possibility that parties attempt to obstruct negotiations because of procedural issues. Ensuring the capabilities of the organising institutions and individuals. Organisational cohesion within <b>and</b> between the <b>Presidency</b> <b>and</b> the UNFCCC <b>Secretariat</b> {{plays a key role in}} successful COPs. Individuals with key organisational roles, for example the President, the Head of the UNFCCC <b>Secretariat</b> <b>and</b> their advisors, must have expert understanding of the negotiation process, as well as being skilled networkers and communicators. Securing broad acceptance for the COP President. Building acceptance and trust in the authority of the COP President engenders a sense of goodwill among parties and empowers the President with sufficient leeway to take crucial decisions. It also reduces the potential for parties to block decisions. Enabling constructive arguing. Organisers from host nations <b>and</b> the UNFCCC <b>Secretariat</b> can facilitate constructive arguing that lets negotiators from different parties mutually reveal information about the interests that underlie their positions and provide a rationale for possible solutions. By doing so, constructive arguing allows those involved in negotiations to consider interests more comprehensively and to craft a deal that is acceptable to all. It can also make parties more amenable to new solutions and compromises...|$|R
40|$|It is an {{academic}} truism that enlargement affected {{the functioning of}} the European Union and its institutions, and that effects of enlargement are especially noticeable in the Council and its sub-structures. Many researchers expected procedures in the Council to become more intergovernmental and decision-making to become more complicated. However, enlargement also contributed to institutional change in the Committee of Permanent Representatives in quite another—unexpected—way: it strengthened the influence of supranational and “quasi-supranational” actors within the Council, such as the Commission, the <b>Presidency</b> <b>and</b> the General <b>Secretariat,</b> <b>and</b> it made decision-making considerably easier in cases where profound national interests of the newcomers were not directly concerned. Four institutional mechanisms can be identified that contributed to this unexpected institutional evolution: The mechanism of socialization, the mechanism of specific and unspecific reciprocity, the mechanism of lack of interest and the mechanism of presidential impartiality. These mechanisms helped to overcome the cleavage between old and new as well as to uphold the strong and often cited esprit de corps within the Council and its preparatory bodies. The paper analyzes these processes and tries to answer the question: how did these mechanisms contribute to a kind of supranationalization of the Council and its substructures after the last rounds of enlargement? The analysis is based on 51 semi-structured, intensive interviews with experts from the Council General <b>Secretariat</b> <b>and</b> from member states’ Permanent Representations...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{the development}} of the concept of flexible integration in the 1996 - 97 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) of the European Union (EU) and outlines an array of ideas, interests and issues at stake for the actors in the negotiations. The thesis has two objectives: (1) to explain the 1996 - 97 IGC process of negotiation which led to the institutionalisation of flexible integration in the Amsterdam Treaty and (2) to analyse the substance of the flexibility debate from the early 1970 s to the present day. The research aims to show that flexibility comes to the fore whenever {{at least one of the}} following five issues is debated on the European level: (1) economic and monetary union, (2) free movement, (3) defence, (4) enlargement and (5) the exclusion of recalcitrant member states. The 1996 - 97 IGC was exceptional in that it met all the five criteria which have a tendency to trigger the flexibility debate. The thesis has three basic lines of argumentation. The first relates to the ICC process, the argument being that the 1996 - 97 IGC negotiations on flexibility were m incremental learning process where the basic positions of the member governments illustrated some continuity, but the specific positions of the negotiators fluctuated with the dynamics of the negotiations. The second line of argumentation relates to the concept of flexibility itself (substance), the argument being that one of the main difficulties with the flexibility negotiations was that flexibility meant different things to different people. Member governments did not necessarily agree about its purpose. The final strand of argumentation relates to the key players in the flexibility debate. Although all member states, large and small, played an important role in the IGC process, the most influential actors in the 1996 - 97 IGC were the civil servants of the respective <b>Presidencies</b> <b>and</b> the Council <b>Secretariat...</b>|$|R
