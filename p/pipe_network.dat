40|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>networks</b> are an {{essential}} part of the world's infrastructure. The construction and operation of these networks, as it is for gas, sewer, irrigation, electricity and communication, are very costly. A relatively small decrease in the construction and component cost of these networks, therefore, leads to a huge total saving. These can be considerably reduced through optimal design of the networks. Optimization of water distribution networks is a multidisciplinary task, involving hydraulics, quality, reliability and availability of the components' requirements. In spite of all the progress made, the optimization of <b>pipe</b> <b>networks</b> fulfilling all these requirements seems to be out of reach at the present time. Most of the current investigations are, therefore, restricted to considering the hydraulic and availability requirements, leading to the so-called optimal pipe sizing of the <b>pipe</b> <b>networks.</b> The reliability requirement is usually addressed by considering a predefined fixed, usually looped, layout for the networks to be designed. All these investigations neglect the influence of the layout on the pipe sizing of the <b>pipe</b> <b>networks.</b> The aim of the present work is to establish a new algorithm for the optimization of the design of water distribution networks...|$|R

5000|$|For these reasons, a {{probabilistic}} method for <b>pipe</b> <b>network</b> analysis {{has recently been}} developed, based on the maximum entropy method of Jaynes. [...] In this method, a continuous relative entropy function is defined over the unknown parameters. This entropy is then maximized subject to the constraints on the system, including Kirchhoff's laws, pipe friction properties and any specified mean flow rates or head losses, to give a probabilistic statement (probability density function) which describes the system. This {{can be used to}} calculate mean values (expectations) of the flow rates, head losses or any other variables of interest in the <b>pipe</b> <b>network.</b> This analysis has been extended using a reduced-parameter entropic formulation, which ensures consistency of the analysis regardless of the graphical representation of the network. A comparison of Bayesian and maximum entropy probabilistic formulations for the analysis of pipe flow networks has also been presented, showing that under certain assumptions (Gaussian priors), the two approaches lead to equivalent predictions of mean flow rates.|$|E
