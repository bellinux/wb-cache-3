40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{interconnection}} of vertical networks using GPS and gravimetric geoid models, and give some examples how {{this can be}} done in practice. We also discuss several error sources of GPS-based methods which degrade the accuracy of height determination. GPS can be used for interpolation of heights, and some medium/low <b>precision</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling</b> may be replaced by GPS. It can also be utilised in maintaining country-wide levelling networks or connecting national levellings. However, many ordinary <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling</b> errors cannot be con-trolled by GPS and it will not replace precise levelling over relatively short distances...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{one of the}} {{techniques}} {{used in the study}} of vertical movements of soil is that of high <b>precision</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling.</b> Nowadays, this technique is often accomplished by satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) analysis that requires a calibration phase, i. e. through the connection to a <b>spirit</b> <b>levelling</b> network or by means of a long time series acquired by global navigation satellite systems permanent stations in order to transform relative velocities derived by SAR in absolute terms. An important aspect of this process consists of the materialization of the object used as a control point, while its selection may depend on the geological context. Typically, due to the inevitably high cost of installation, very accurate monumentation is reserved only for a limited density of points on the territory; therefore, a type of negative correlation exists, in terms of reliability in the monumentation of the control points, with respect to their density in a real distribution within a specific monitoring technique. For example, in levelling networks, a density of one benchmark every 700 – 1000  m of line is often desired in order to reach a compromise among costs, practical operative requirements and precision. Levelling benchmarks are usually fixed on existing structures (i. e. buildings or concrete structures). This aspect is even more evident in the case of SAR interferometric analysis, where the persistent scatterers (PS) are identified based on the coherence in the radar response. Therefore, the PS display movements are measured by a variety of different structures, characterized by foundations fixed at different depths. Starting from repeated levelling measurements, we verified the order of magnitude of movements of control points characterized by shallow foundations in cohesive soils. In practice, we observed their behaviour in relation to the depth of the foundation under simple and very common conditions, such as the presence of periods of drought or rainfall. The results indicate movements in the order of 3 – 7  mm in the first metre of depth that occurred in a week during the transition between the period of summer drought and the first rains. The magnitude of the total uplift observed between {{the end of the summer}} drought and the beginning of successive springtime (30 / 08 / 2012 – 18 / 04 / 2013) exceeded 10  cm of movement in very shallow layers of the soil surface for the same test field...|$|R

40|$|Over half {{a century}} ago, social policy {{research}} clearly demonstrated the problem of poverty in an unequal society, a problem that has never really gone away (Titmuss, 1938).

That book is of course The <b>Spirit</b> <b>Level</b> by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett – a book that has made a rare transfer from the academic world into the public domain, selling over 200, 000 copies and with translations in more than twenty languages. The <b>Spirit</b> <b>Level</b> (currently) has over 2, 000 citations on Google scholar and Richard’s TED talk has over 1. 6 million viewings, making {{the importance of this}} work beyond question.
