This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> staff.

5|$|In 1697 Gale {{translated}} Louis Jobert's La science des medailles into English, {{with the}} title of The Knowledge of Medals. This was designed as an instruction to the beginning coin collector, and also contained information to protect the new collector from fraud. Gale then in 1709 published his father's work on the Antonine Itinerary, which Gale supplemented with his own notes and commentary. His last major published work was as {{the editor of a}} 12th-century manuscript register of the Honour of Richmond that was contained in the Cotton library.

5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension {{and a brief}} stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>The</b> Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure {{one or both of the}} Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's Park Oval Cricket Club leased the Queen's Park Oval in 1896, moving {{there from}} its first {{home at the}} Queen's Park Savannah, where it had existed since its {{founding}} in 1891. The natural soil at the ground prevented turf wickets from being laid down, due to the damage caused by the mole crickets that inhabited it, so when the club moved to its new ground the groundsmen laid a pitch of clay with a wicket made of matting prepared on top. A popular venue due to its capacity (7,000 when first constructed, the highest in the Caribbean) the ground was very profitable for the owning cricket club. The first match recorded by Cricket Archive, CricInfo and Wisden took place on 29 January 1897, between Lord Hawke's touring party and a team <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Queen's Park Oval Club. The match, which was a draw but saw the ground's first century—119 by Plum Warner—was not counted as first-class. Only a few days later on February 1 the ground's maiden first-class fixture took place between Trinidad and the same Lord Hawke's XI. The home team won by 137 runs. The two teams met at the Oval again on 5 February, when Trinidad were victorious once more. Arthur Priestley's touring eleven then played a Queen's Park XI on February 12, with the game drawn.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} the other Big Five studios, RKO relied on B {{pictures}} to fill up its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million dollars. A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while it also limited the potential for reward (Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside), RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and low-cost product than with its A movies. The studio's low-budget films offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson, Robert Wise, and Anthony Mann. Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton, whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director Jacques Tourneur. The Lewton unit's moody, atmospheric work—represented by films such as Cat People (1942), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945)—is now highly regarded. Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production The Ghost Ship. Tim Holt was RKO's cowboy star of the era, appearing in forty-six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio. In 1940, Chester Lauck and Norris Goff brought their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six-film run. The Falcon detective series began in 1941; the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO. The Falcon was first played by George Sanders, who had appeared five times as the Saint. He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. Johnny Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by Lex Barker.|$|E

25|$|In summer 1916, Romania {{disappointed}} Arbore by rallying {{with the}} Entente. After a short-lived offensive into Transylvania, the Romanian Land Forces were defeated, and the Central Powers invaded southern Romania. Arbore stayed behind in German-occupied Bucharest while the legitimate government withdrew to Iași, and maintained a generally friendly but discreet {{attitude toward the}} occupiers. He was less active as a journalist and militant, but contributed to the Germanophile daily Lumina, <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bessarabian activist Constantin Stere, and once lectured on the Bessarabian question during April 1918. Arbore also kept a low profile during the 1918 truce, when, with German acquiescence, Romania united with Bessarabia. Reputedly, Stere, who negotiated the union with the Bessarabian Assembly, mistrusted and sidelined Arbore during the events.|$|E
25|$|Mille's group found {{a friend}} in Constantin Stere, by then a {{maverick}} member of the PNL, who began maneuvering against the PNL's right-wing from the inside. Managing a literary sheet <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pro-PNL Evenimentul, Stere supported Adevărul in its campaign for literary didacticism, and organized rallies of solidarity with the Bucharest socialists. This happened just as Toni was publishing satirical pieces targeting Evenimentul owner George A. Scorțescu, which left Stere in an awkward position. Stere was consequently accused by Evenimentul of being a spy and a tool for the Conservatives. The incidents were reviewed with caution by Adevărul, whose panelists feared that a Conservative conspiracy was in the making, but Toni also criticized the PNL papers for suggesting the same.|$|E

25|$|The energy {{efficiency}} {{of a system}} or device that converts energy {{is measured by the}} ratio of the amount of useful energy <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> system ("output energy") to the total amount of energy that is put in ("input energy") or by useful output energy {{as a percentage of the}} total input energy. In the case of fuel cells, useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system. Input energy is the energy stored in the fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells are generally between 40–60% energy efficient. This is higher than some other systems for energy generation. For example, the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25% energy efficient. In combined heat and power (CHP) systems, the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use, increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85–90%.|$|E
25|$|In {{their work}} as {{cultural}} campaigners, Vinea and Janco even collaborated with 75 HP, a periodical edited by poet Ilarie Voronca, which was nominally anti-Contimporanul and pro-Dada. Janco was also an occasional presence {{in the pages of}} Punct, the Dadaist-Constructivist paper <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> socialist Scarlat Callimachi. It was here that he notably published articles on architectural styles and a lampoon, in French and German, titled T.S.F. Dialogue entre le bourgeois mort et l'apôtre de la vie nouvelle ("Cablegram. The Dialogue between a Dead Bourgeois and the Apostle of New Living"). In addition, his graphic work was popularized by Voronca's other magazine, the Futurist tribune Integral. Janco was also called upon by authors Ion Pillat and Perpessicius to illustrate their Antologia poeților de azi ("The Anthology of Present-Day Poets"). His portraits of the writers included, drawn in sharply modernist style, were received with amusement by the traditionalist public. In 1926, Janco further antagonized the traditionalists by publishing sensual drawings for Camil Baltazar's book of erotic poems, Strigări trupești lîngă glezne ("Bodily Exhortations around the Ankles").|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of his wife, eldest son and two of his nephews in the wreck of the White Ship (1120), Rotrou {{returned}} to Spain. His parting may have been an act of penitence (perhaps he believed his sins had brought on the tragedy), or perhaps a public demonstration of grieving, since his wife was a daughter of the king, who had also lost his heir, William Adelin, in the wreck. According to the Chronicle of San Juan de la Peña, Rotrou took part in the conquests of Zaragoza (1118) and Tudela (1119), but this account {{has been shown to be}} apocryphal. Many French barons can be connected with the expedition against Zaragoza, but although his Anales de la Corona de Aragón name Rotrou as fighting under Alfonso of Aragon on several occasions, Jerónimo Zurita does not mention him by name when recording the call for transpyrenean assistance <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Battler. Likewise Rotrou is attested fighting for Henry I in Normandy in 1119 and so could not have had any hand in the conquest of Tudela, although the Chronicle of San Juan makes him out to be the chief conqueror and the first and independent ruler of the town. Neither is he mentioned in the charter of surrender of Tudela.|$|E

25|$|However, the Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh, {{which was}} {{arranged}} onomastically, is undisputedly Stutchkoff’s main achievement. It remains even today {{the most extensive}} dictionary of the Yiddish language, containing approximately 90,000 single-word entries and 8,000 idioms (because of multiple designations it amounts to nearly 175,000 entries). The dictionary was meant to ‘store’ the Yiddish language, which {{was in danger of}} extinction after the Holocaust. Peter Mark Roget’s English thesaurus served as an example; nonetheless, Stutchkoff reduced Roget’s 1000 onomastic categories to 650. The dictionary received critical acclaim and 2000 copies were sold within the first year of its publication alone. It does not project purist language views; instead it includes 1500 Americanisms, 3000 Germanisms, 1000 Slavisms, 500 vulgarisms, 700 funny expressions, and 700 archaisms, dialectal words, slang words and Sovietisms. This inclusion of modern lexicon distinguished Stutchkoff’s dictionary from other publications <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Institute for Jewish Research YIVO (Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut). Stutchkoff’s decision to include those terms went against the advice of his publisher, Max Weinreich. However, some reviewers – among others Isaac Bashevis Singer – criticised the fact that Weinreich had designated certain terms as “not recommended”, while others regretted that the Oytser included many artificial terms invented by the YIVO that were not in use in other circles.|$|E
