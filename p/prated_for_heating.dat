40|$|Abstract Background Temperature {{adaptation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important determinants of distribution and population size of organisms in nature. Recently, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and gene expression profiling approaches have been used for detecting candidate genes <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> resistance. However, the resolution of QTL mapping is not high enough to examine the individual effects of various genes in each QTL. Heat stress-responsive genes, characterized by gene expression profiling studies, are not necessarily responsible <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> resistance. Some of these genes may be regulated in association with the heat stress response of other genes. Results To evaluate which heat-responsive genes are potential candidates <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> resistance with higher resolution than previous QTL mapping studies, we performed genome-wide deficiency screen <b>for</b> QTL <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> resistance. We screened 439 isogenic deficiency strains from the DrosDel project, covering 65. 6 % of the Drosophila melanogaster genome in order to map QTL for thermal resistance. As a result, we found 19 QTL <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> resistance, including 3 novel QTL outside the QTL found in previous studies. Conclusion The QTL found in this study encompassed 19 heat-responsive genes found in the previous gene expression profiling studies, suggesting that they were strong candidates <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> resistance. This result provides new insights into the genetic architecture of heat resistance. It also emphasizes the advantages of genome-wide deficiency screen using isogenic deficiency libraries. </p...|$|R
