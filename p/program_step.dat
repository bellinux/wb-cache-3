25|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the stored program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which had programs hard coded into the machines with function tables that each contained 1200 ten way switches. The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due {{to the complexity of}} mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the <b>program</b> <b>step</b> by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what a program on the ENIAC looked like.|$|E

The TI-59 was the first programmable pocket calculator where the manufacturer provided a system for sharing memory between data registers and program storage. The memory is only about twice as large as in the SR-52, but more flexible, and thus the possible number of <b>program</b> <b>steps</b> was four times as high.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a new algorithm for solving the explicit/multi- parametric model predictive control (or mp-MPC) problem for linear, time-invariant discrete-time systems, based on dynamic programming and multi-parametric programming techniques. The algorithm features two key steps: (i) a dynamic <b>programming</b> <b>step,</b> {{in which the}} mp-MPC problem is decomposed into a set of smaller subproblems in which only the current control, state variables, and constraints are considered, and (ii) a multi-parametric <b>programming</b> <b>step,</b> in which each subproblem is solved as a convex multi-parametric programming problem, to derive the control variables as an explicit function of the states. The key feature of the proposed method is that it overcomes potential limitations of previous methods for solving multi-parametric programming problems with dynamic programming, such {{as the need for}} global optimization for each subproblem of the dynamic <b>programming</b> <b>step.</b> © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

At most five <b>programming</b> <b>steps</b> in the proposed method is required if adaptive testing scheme is used. For non-adaptive test, eight <b>programming</b> <b>steps</b> is re-quired to diagnose all the possible faults under the given single fault model. The accuracy of the fault diagnosing is one segment for a segment stuck-at or stuck-open fault, a segment pair for a bridge fault, a switch for switch stuck-on or stuck-off fault...|$|R
