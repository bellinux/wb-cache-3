25|$|The trimerization {{of a part}} of a nitrile {{molecule}} and {{two parts}} of acetylene into pyridine is called Bönnemann cyclization. This modification of the Reppe synthesis can be activated either by heat or by light. While the thermal activation requires high pressures and temperatures, the <b>photoinduced</b> cycloaddition proceeds at ambient conditions with CoCp2(cod) (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) as a catalyst, and can be performed even in water. A series of pyridine derivatives can be produced in this way. When using acetonitrile as the nitrile, 2-methylpyridine is obtained, which can be dealkylated to pyridine.|$|E
25|$|The {{covalent}} pair-wise {{interaction between}} boronic acids and hydroxy groups {{as found in}} alcohols and acids is rapid and reversible in aqueous solutions. The equilibrium established between boronic acids and the hydroxyl groups present on saccharides has been successfully employed to develop a range of sensors for saccharides. One of the key advantages with this dynamic covalent strategy lies {{in the ability of}} boronic acids to overcome the challenge of binding neutral species in aqueous media. If arranged correctly, the introduction of a tertiary amine within these supramolecular systems will permit binding to occur at physiological pH and allow signalling mechanisms such as <b>photoinduced</b> electron transfer mediated fluorescence emission to report the binding event.|$|E
2500|$|Metal {{substrates}} {{for use in}} SAMs can {{be produced}} through physical vapor deposition techniques, electrodeposition or electroless deposition. Thiol or selenium SAMs produced by adsorption from solution are typically made by immersing a substrate into a dilute solution of alkane thiol in ethanol, though many different solvents can be used besides use of pure liquids. While SAMs are often allowed to form over 12 to 72 hours at room temperature, SAMs of alkanethiolates form within minutes. Special attention is essential in some cases, {{such as that of}} dithiol SAMs to avoid problems due to oxidation or <b>photoinduced</b> processes, which can affect terminal groups and lead to disorder and multilayer formation. In this case appropriate choice of solvents, their degassing by inert gasses and preparation in the absence of light is crucial and allows formation of [...] "standing up" [...] SAMs with free –SH groups. Self-assembled monolayers can also be adsorbed from the vapor phase. In some cases when obtaining an ordered assembly is difficult or when different density phases need to be obtained substitutional self-assembly is used. Here one first forms the SAM of a given type of molecules, which give rise to ordered assembly and then a second assembly phase is performed (e.g. by immersion into a different solution). This method has also been used to give information on relative binding strengths of SAMs with different head groups and more generally on self-assembly characteristics.|$|E

They defined the <b>photoinduced</b> entropy as a thermodynamic quantity that represents the unavailability of a system's energy for conversion into useful work due to carrier recombination and photon emission. They have also related the change in entropy generation to the change in photocarrier dynamics in the InGaN active regions using results from time-resolved photoluminescence study. They hypothesized {{that the amount of}} generated disorder in the InGaN layers eventually increases as the temperature approaches room temperature because of the thermal activation of surface states. To study the <b>photoinduced</b> entropy, the scientists have developed a mathematical model that considers the net energy exchange resulting from photoexcitation and photoluminescence.|$|E

Upon photoexcitation,charge separation takes place from the excited singlet state of ZnPc to SWNHox. This findings may broaden the range of utilization of SWNHox in photochemistry, as well as photobiology. Zinc porphyrin could also bind to oxidized SWNHs through covalent bonding with a spacer and a crown ether. This nanohybrid showed similar <b>photoinduced</b> electron-transfer processes.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>photoinduced</b> charge {{separation}} has taken place, the P680 molecule carries a positive charge.
