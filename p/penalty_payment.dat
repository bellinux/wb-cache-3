40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} the surplus of a non-life insurance company and assume that it follows either the classical Cramér-Lundberg model or its diffusion approximation. That is, we consider a continuous time model, where premiums are cashed at a constant rate and claims occur randomly with random sizes modelled by a compound Poisson process. In actuarial mathematics the risk of an insurance company is traditionally measured by the probability of ruin, where the time of ruin {{is defined as the}} first time when the surplus becomes negative. Using the ruin probability as a risk measure has been criticised because it is unrealistic to assume that an insurance company is ruined as soon as the surplus becomes negative. In this thesis, we assume that the insurer is not ruined although the surplus becomes negative. In order to avoid ruin, <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> occur, depending on the level of the surplus. For example, <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> occur if the insurance company needs to borrow money. In {{the first part of this}} thesis {{we consider the}} diffusion approximation to the Cramér-Lundberg model and we aim to determine a dividend strategy that maximises the difference between the expected discounted dividend and <b>penalty</b> <b>payments,</b> where <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> are either modelled by an exponential, linear or quadratic function. We show that the optimal strategy is a so-called barrier strategy and calculate the optimal barrier. The second part studies the analogous problem where the surplus process of an insurance company is given by a Cramér-Lundberg model. Here, similar results are obtained. In conclusion, we consider the problem where we have to determine an optimal investment and reinsurance strategy and the surplus follows the diffusion approximation. The insurance company can invest in several risky assets and reduce the insurance risk either by excess of loss or proportional reinsurance. The aim is to find a strategy which minimises the <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> that are necessary to avoid ruin. Various penalty functions are considered and closed form solutions are derived...|$|R

Maria Fernanda said that the delay in the payment of interest rate equalization of the Plan Safra (government's plan to support agriculture) for 2015, did not configure a credit operation, since the non-compliance was not subject to <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> in the contract terms. According to former Secretary, the values were only monetarily adjusted. The prosecution lawyer Janaína Paschoal rejected the claims of Maria Fernanda and said that the remuneration per [...] (a benchmark interest rate of the Brazilian economy) is a proof that there was a credit operation. The prosecution reiterated that this statement confirmed the infringement materially, she concluded. Aldo Rebelo rejected the accusations that the government spent wantonly in 2015, and that year was characterized by fiscal adjustments and efforts to reduce public spending.|$|E
40|$|The subject. This paper {{deals with}} {{problems}} related to tax law with a special focus on legal regulation of the tax procedure contained in the Czech Tax Procedure Code. Attention is paid in particular to tax penalty payments and the “non bis in idem” principle. The purpose to identify ratio between penalty payments in tax procedure and in criminal procedure in context of “non bis in idem” principle. The methodological basis of the article is analysis of legislation and court practice of Czech republic, Austria, European Union, including formal legal analysis, comparative analysis, synthesis, systematic approach. The results and scope of application. The existing case law of the Czech criminal courts and of the Supreme Court {{was based on the}} legal opinion that a <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> imposed by the tax administration in a tax procedure constitutes no punishment, i. e. it is no sanction of criminal nature, so that even the final (enforceable) decision of the tax administration does not create a “ne bis in idem” 1 barrier in relation to criminal sanctions for the same taxesrelated non-compliant action (tax evasion) in respect of the <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> imposed by the tax administration. Conclusions. It would probably be advisable for the legislation to amend the relevant provisions of the Tax Procedure Code {{in a way that the}} tax authorities concentrate within the limits of their powers on proper tax collection and that the law enforcement authorities are authorized to punishments for deliberate tax evasion. A suggested amendment may therefore be the removal of the penalty payments from the Tax Procedure Code as the default interest itself is sufficient instrument enough to penalize the taxpayers. Another option is to keep the tax <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> in the Tax Procedure Code, but its imposition would only be considered after making sure that the result of any criminal proceedings does not constitute a “ne bis in idem” prohibition within the meaning of Art. 40 (5) of the Charter and Art. 4 (1) of the Protocol No. 7 to the Convention, Section 11 (1) f), g), h), (2) and Section 11 a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{an optimal}} dividend distribution problem for {{an insurance company}} which risk process evolves as a spectrally negative Lévy process (in the absence of dividend payments). The management of the company is assumed to control timing and size of dividend payments. The objective is to maximize {{the sum of the}} expected cumulative discounted dividend payments received until the moment of ruin and a <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> at the moment of ruin which is an increasing function {{of the size of the}} shortfall at ruin; in addition, there may be a fixed cost for taking out dividends. A complete solution is presented to the corresponding stochastic control problem. It is established that the value-function is the unique stochastic solution and the pointwise smallest stochastic supersolution of the associated HJB equation. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition is identified for optimality of a single dividend-band strategy, in terms of a particular Gerber-Shiu function.

We model the supplier’s trade-off between the option value to defer the contract execution and the <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> in the event of delays. We also take into account the issue of penalty enforcement, which in turn depends on both the discretion of the court of law in voiding contractual clauses and the “efficiency” of the judicial system (i. e. the average length of civil trials). We test our main results on Italian public procurement data showing that the supplier’s incentive to delay is greater the higher the volatility of production costs and the lower the “efficiency” of the judicial system. We then calibrate the model using parameters that mimic the Italian scenario on public works procurement and calculate the maximum amount that a supplier is “willing to pay” (per day) to postpone the delivery date and infringe the contract provisions. Our calibration results are consistent with the theoretical model’s predictions and the empirical findings...|$|E
