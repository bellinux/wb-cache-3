5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia,</b> Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E
500|$|O'Connor, still {{a sitting}} justice, died from <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia</b> at St Vincent's Hospital in the suburb of Darlinghurst on 18 November 1912, aged 61; he had {{suffered}} from chronic nephritis for some years. He {{was buried in the}} Anglican section of Rookwood Cemetery, though with Catholic rites. He was survived by his wife Sarah, who died in 1925, and by six of his seven children. Of his two daughters, Winifred married Alexander Maclay (son of the Russian anthropologist and explorer Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay), and Kathleen married the pianist and composer Roy Agnew. His eldest and youngest sons, Richard and Roderic, were killed at Armentières in 1916; the others, Arthur and Desmond, survived. After his death he received tributes from, among others, Barton, who believed [...] "that assiduous toil did much to shorten a life that was most precious", and Griffith, who described O'Connor as [...] "absolutely fearless in the performance of his judicial duties". Billy Hughes, then serving as Attorney General in the Fisher Labor government, recalled that O'Connor [...] "never exhibited any trace of personal enmity". The suburb of O'Connor in Canberra is named in his honour.|$|E

2500|$|William Bosworth Castle, in 1926, ate minced raw beef every morning, regurgitated it an hour later, {{and then}} fed {{it to his}} {{patients}} suffering from <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia.</b> [...] Castle was testing his theory {{that there was an}} intrinsic factor produced in a normal stomach that hugely increased the uptake of the extrinsic factor (now identified as vitamin B12), lack of which leads to <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia.</b> [...] Beef is a good source of B12, but patients did not respond with beef alone. [...] Castle reasoned they lacked production of intrinsic factor and he could provide it from his own stomach.

2500|$|In late-1912, McClusky became mysteriously ill {{while in}} charge of the Fourteenth Inspection District. It was first {{believed}} he had become sick with ptomaine poisoning after eating shellfish at a recent shore dinner and took a leave of absence on September 18. His condition did not improve however and a physical examination found he was suffering from acute anemia. The following day, a more thorough examination by Dr. Charles E. Nammack found his blood contained only 27% of red corpuscles found in normal blood. McClusky's health grew continually worse over the next few months. Dr. Nammack later diagnosed his condition as a rare form of anemia. The doctor later explained further [...] "Little is known of the rare form of anemia from which the Inspector suffered. It is called progressive <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia,</b> and of the 1,200 cases known to the medical profession, only six recoveries are reported". A blood transfusion, he claimed, would be been ineffective as McClusky's heart and other organs were undergoing a general breakdown. In the last weeks of his life, the red corpuscles in his blood fell to 9%.|$|E

50|$|He {{suffered}} from <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia,</b> and on February 9, 1916, had his spleen removed. He {{died a few}} weeks later at the General Hospital in Rochester after pleurisy developed. He was buried at the Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester.|$|E
50|$|This anaemia {{was then}} known as ‘pernicious anaemia of pregnancy’. However, Lucy Wills was able to {{demonstrate}} that the anaemia she observed differed from true <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia,</b> as the patients did not have achlorhydria, an inability to produce gastric acid. Furthermore, while patients responded to crude liver extracts, they did not respond to the ‘pure’ liver extracts (vitamin B12) which had been shown to treat true <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia.</b> She postulated that there must have been another nutritional factor responsible for this macrocytic anaemia other than vitamin B12 deficiency. For some years this nutritional factor was known as the ‘Wills Factor’, and it was later shown, in the 1940s, to be folate, of which the synthetic form is folic acid.|$|E
50|$|Demyelination is {{the loss}} of the myelin sheath {{insulating}} the nerves, and is the hallmark of some neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica, transverse myelitis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, central pontine myelinosis, inherited demyelinating diseases such as leukodystrophy, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Sufferers of <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia</b> can also suffer nerve damage if the condition is not diagnosed quickly. Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord secondary to <b>pernicious</b> <b>anaemia</b> can lead to slight peripheral nerve damage to severe damage to the central nervous system, affecting speech, balance, and cognitive awareness. When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. A more serious case of myelin deterioration is called Canavan disease.|$|E

50|$|The risk of {{toxicity}} from {{folic acid}} is low, because folate is a water-soluble vitamin and is regularly {{removed from the}} body through urine.
