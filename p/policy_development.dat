After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} {{migration}} <b>policy</b> and <b>development</b> <b>policy</b> are interrelated and influence each other has gained ground {{over the past}} few years. The EU has been keen to link migration <b>policy</b> to <b>development</b> <b>policy</b> in several of its policy initiatives. Based on a discussion of the notion of 'migration and development', this article identifies four policy dilemmas facing policy-makers who aim to link migration <b>policy</b> and <b>development</b> <b>policy.</b> It then goes on to examine four EU policy initiatives (the Global Approach to Migration; the Policy Plan on Legal Migration; the thematic programme for the cooperation with third countries in the areas of migration and asylum; and the Mobility Partnerships) to determine how these initiatives aim to link migration <b>policy</b> and <b>development</b> <b>policy.</b> It finds that none of the policy initiatives adequately address the policy dilemmas. Only the two most recent initiatives (the thematic programme and the Mobility Partnerships) address the broad range of suggested policies which link migration <b>policy</b> and <b>development</b> <b>policy.</b> Generally, {{it is clear from the}} initiatives that the EU prioritises the reduction of illegal immigration to its territory.
