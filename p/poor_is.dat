25|$|Widening income {{inequality}} is the defining challenge of our time. In advanced economies, {{the gap between}} the rich and <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> at its highest level in decades. Inequality trends have been more mixed in emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs), with some countries experiencing declining inequality, but pervasive inequities in access to education, health care, and finance remain.|$|E
25|$|Other {{parts of}} the {{developing}} world, such as China, India and Brazil remain largely rural but are rapidly urbanising and industrialising. In these areas a motorised infrastructure is being developed alongside motorisation of the population. Great disparity of wealth means that {{only a fraction of}} the population can motorise, and therefore the highly dense multimodal transportation system for the <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> cross-cut by the highly motorised transportation system for the rich.|$|E

25|$|Funding varies {{based on}} the {{population}} covered, {{although the majority of}} funds flow from general taxation. Premiums from the formal sector reach up to 3% of monthly income. Premiums from both the poor and the informal sector are 2,400 pesos annually (about 50 USD). However, the cost of insurance for the <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> fully subsidized by the central and local governments. The National government allocates more than 9 billion pesos annually to meet its target.|$|E
25|$|The {{gap between}} rich and <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> {{enormous}} in a country that was once the most egalitarian nation in the world. In the youth movements, Zionism was seen as the Jewish way of achieving social justice that would encompass the whole world. That ideal has been shattered. Now we have the pretension of being an open and attentive socialist welfare state, but in fact, that message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human element has disappeared from the system.|$|E
25|$|Latin America and the Caribbean {{have been}} cited by {{numerous}} sources {{to be the most}} dangerous regions in the world. Studies have shown that Latin America contains the majority of the world's most dangerous cities. Many analysts attribute the reason to why the region has such an alarming crime rate and criminal culture is largely due to social and income inequality within the region, they say that growing social inequality is fueling crime in the region. Many agree that the prison crisis will not be resolved until the gap between the rich and the <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> addressed.|$|E

25|$|The gap {{in income}} {{between rich and}} <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> greater in the United States {{than in any other}} {{developed}} country. Starting in the 1980s relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations, though analyses using a common data set for comparisons tend to find that the U.S. has a lower absolute poverty rate by market income than most other wealthy nations. Extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2 per day before government benefits, doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011, including 2.8 million children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels. As of 2015, 44 percent of children in the United States live with low-income families.|$|E
25|$|The main {{argument}} against the concept of reservation is that it goes against the idea of merit and would dilute the IITs {{as one of the}} basic reasons behind their success is the excellent students they get via IIT-JEE. It is also being argued by the opposers that the irreparable damage caused during the childhood of the individual, cannot be rectified at a later stage. Also, the primary education provided by the government to the economically <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> highly inadequate, and this negligence by the government is the root cause of the problem. Statistics across the IIT's reveal that while about 4–5% of general category students do not complete their degree program, the number goes up to about 20% for reserved category students. This is used as an {{argument against}} reservations claiming that the reserved class candidates are not adequately prepared to face the challenging academic life in IITs.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{substantial}} improvements in {{access to water}} supply, {{and to a lesser}} extent to sanitation, over the past fifteen years. Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater is being treated), lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighborhoods, and limited sustainability of rural systems (20 percent of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005 a National Sanitation Program was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020. The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> being addressed as part of the National Human Development Initiative, under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network.|$|E

25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E
500|$|In 1815, the {{government}} increased taxation on imported wheat and grain {{to help pay}} for the costs of the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). Poor laws, such as the Speenhamland system, were designed to help alleviate financial distress of the poorer communities, but such systems helped to keep wages artificially low as the farmers knew labourers' wages would be supplemented by the system. Basic commodities, like cereals and bread, became heavily over-priced, creating widespread social unrest. The worst hit were the families of the men returning from the Battle of Waterloo (1815) who arrived home at a time when unemployment was already high. One reply to a questionnaire circulated by the Board of Agriculture in February, March, and April 1816 reported that [...] "the state of the labouring <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> very deplorable, and arises entirely from the want of employment, which they are willing to seek, but the farmer cannot afford to furnish." ...|$|E
500|$|In theses 41–47 Luther criticizes indulgences on {{the basis}} that they {{discourage}} works of mercy by those who purchase them. Here he begins to use the phrase, [...] "Christians are to be taught..." [...] to state how he thinks people should be instructed on the value of indulgences. They should be taught that giving to the <b>poor</b> <b>is</b> incomparably more important than buying indulgences, that buying an indulgence rather than giving to the poor invites God's wrath, and that doing good works makes a person better while buying indulgences does not. In theses 48–52 Luther takes the side of the pope, saying that if the pope knew what was being preached in his name he would rather St. Peter's Basilica be burned down than [...] "built up with the skin, flesh, and bones of his sheep." [...] Theses 53–55 complain about the restrictions on preaching while the indulgence was being offered.|$|E

He also noted that films like Mullum Malarum stereotype the poor as representing [...] "all that is pristine and traditional", adding, [...] "The overall socio-economic system, which has made them <b>poor,</b> <b>is</b> unchallenged. Within the system, however, the hero will be 'richer' in terms of his moral uprightness." [...] The 2012 book Grand Brand Rajini by P. C. Balasubramanian and Ram N. Ramakrishnan describes Kali as [...] "the loving brother, the angry worker and despondent physically challenged person rolled into one." [...] Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen compared the film to Pasamalar (1961) for providing [...] "a low-key version of the orphaned brother and sister theme".|$|E
