25|$|The International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a {{joint project}} of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s {{following}} substantial environmental studies, treats 25million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped {{across the border from}} the central collection point in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by <b>permit</b> <b>conditions,</b> although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.|$|E

2500|$|While {{efficient}} {{energy use}} and resource efficiency are growing as public policy issues, more than 70% of coal {{plants in the}} European Union are more than 20 years old and operate at an efficiency level of between 32–40%. Technological developments in the 1990s have allowed efficiencies {{in the range of}} 40–45% at newer plants. However, according to an impact assessment by the European Commission, this is still below the best available technological (BAT) efficiency levels of 46–49%. With gas-fired power plants the average efficiency is 52% compared to 58–59% with best available technology (BAT), and gas and oil boiler plants operate at average 36% efficiency (BAT delivers 47%). According to that same impact assessment by the European Commission, raising the efficiency of all new plants and the majority of existing plants, through the setting of authorisation and <b>permit</b> <b>conditions,</b> to an average generation efficiency of 51.5% in 2020 would lead to a reduction in annual consumption of [...] of natural gas and [...] of coal.|$|E
