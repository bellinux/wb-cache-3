5|$|Svalbard Satellite Station {{was built}} because of Longyearbyen's {{excellent}} location to download data from satellites in <b>polar</b> <b>orbit.</b> Located at Platåberget above Hotellneset, {{it was built}} as a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre, but has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services. EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds. The facility {{has been designed to}} protect against natural and human disasters, including global warming, floods and fires and nuclear holocaust. The site was chosen for a number of factors including its remoteness, sound geology and the ambient temperature of the permafrost.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly <b>polar</b> <b>orbit,</b> but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{satellite}} deorbit using electrodynamic tether (EDT) propulsion. Gaussian perturbation equations {{are used}} to model the orbital dynamics of EDT with environmental perturbations of electrodynamic force, aerodynamic drag {{and the effect of}} Earth’s oblateness. Differential equations for the induced voltage-current across EDT are derived and solved with boundary conditions determined by mission objectives and hardware devices. A simplified analytical method for solving the equations is proposed to improve computational efficiency. Simulations find that the orbit of a satellite deorbited by EDT will become elliptical in near <b>polar</b> <b>orbits</b> due to the higher-order perturbation of Earth’s magnetic field. This is beneficial for the near <b>polar</b> <b>orbits</b> where the electrodynamic force is less effective, because the atmosphere at a lower perigee will provide larger air drag to dissipate the orbital kinetic energy of satellite faster. Moreover, we proved that the polarity reverse of the induced voltage/current across EDT in near <b>polar</b> <b>orbits</b> does not affect the kinetic energy dissipation by the current induced Lorentz force. Compared the decay by air drag only, the orbit decaying time of a satellite with EDT will be reduced by three and two orders of magnitudes in the equatorial and <b>polar</b> <b>orbits</b> respectively...|$|R
