40|$|Occupational hepatic {{disorders}} are classified into toxic hepatitis, viral hepatitis, and chemical-induced malignancy in Korea. Toxic hepatitis cases {{were reported in}} workers {{who were exposed to}} dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, or trichloroethylene. <b>Preplacement</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> and regular follow-up are necessary to prevent the development of toxic hepatitis. Viral hepatitis was chiefly reported among health care workers such as doctors, nurses and clinical pathology technicians who could easily be exposed to blood. Preventive measures for these groups therefore include vaccination and serum monitoring programs. Hepatic angiosarcoma caused by vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) exposure is a very well known occupational disease and it has not been officially reported in Korea yet. Some cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were legally approved for compensation as an occupational disease largely by overwork and stress, but not supported by enough scientific evidence. Effort to find the evidence of its causal relationship is needed...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{testing in}} the {{workplace}} is raising growing concern in light of increasingly available genetic tests and what {{is perceived as a}} general assault on individual privacy in the United States. Almost seventy percent of major U. S. firms require individuals who receive job offers to undergo medical testing prior to the commencement of employment, and the law does not restrict the scope of these examinations. Thus, employers test job candidates not only for fitness for duty and use of illegal substances, but also for a variety of conditions including susceptibility to workplace hazards, breast and colon cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV infection, sickle cell anemia, pregnancy, and Huntington Disease. Over fifteen percent of employers require applicants to provide family medical histories, nearly forty percent utilize psychological testing, and a small percentage already conduct genetic testing. This article explores the legal and policy implications of <b>preplacement</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examinations.</b> It recommends that the Americans with Disabilities Act be amended so that it would prohibit employers from conducting preplacement examinations that are not job-related. The author argues that non-job-related medical testing constitutes an unjustifiable invasion of the examinee 2 ̆ 7 s privacy and creates temptations and opportunities for discrimination on the part of employers. Furthermore, individuals who undergo testing and receive unexpected and distressing results without obtaining appropriate counseling may suffer significant psychological trauma. For employers, <b>medical</b> <b>examinations</b> that are not job-related constitute an unnecessary financial expenditure and create a risk of litigation based on invasion of privacy, discrimination, and other theories. In addition, invasive medical testing can erode morale and productivity in the workplace...|$|R

Labeling requirements were listed. Protective clothing should include respiratory protective devices, gloves, gig type aprons, boots, and overshoes. Workers should be instructed as to the hazards associated with benzyl-chloride exposure. Work practices, sanitation and housekeeping requirements were listed. Exposure of humans has resulted in weakness, rapid fatigue, persistent headaches, increased irritability, hot feeling, loss of sleep and appetite, and itching skin.

40|$|NIOSH {{recommends}} in {{this document}} that worker exposure to ethylene- dichloride (107062) be controlled so that no worker is exposed in excess of 5 parts per million (ppm) determined as a time weighted average {{for up to a}} 10 hour workday, 40 hour workweek, or to peak concentrations above 15 ppm as determined by a 15 minute sample. Nursing mothers should not work with ethylene-dichloride. Medical provisions include the offering of comprehensive <b>preplacement</b> and annual <b>medical</b> <b>examinations,</b> proper <b>medical</b> management for exposed workers, and the keeping of medical records. Labeling requirements are defined. Personal protective equipment and clothing for workers includes respiratory protection, gloves, boots, overshoes, and bib type aprons, and eye protection. Employees shall be informed of the hazards from ethylene-dichloride exposure. Good work practices shall be maintained and emergency procedures and confined space entry procedures fully outlined. Documented effects on humans from exposure included death as a result of ingestion, preceded by dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and unconsciousness. Autopsies revealed hyperemia and hemorrhagic lesions of most organs. Inhalation of vapors has also resulted in death with similar pathological findings. Repeated and chronic occupational exposures have resulted in anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, irritation of the mucous membranes, and liver and kidney dysfunction. A delay in the onset of symptoms following inhalation exposures may signify the metabolism of the parent compound to more toxic metabolites.

40|$|Background: In Nigeria, as in {{the rest}} of {{equatorial}} Africa, sickle cell disease (SCD) has its highest incidence and continues to cause high morbidity and early death. The condition is a major public health problem among the black race. The aim of this survey is to determine the level of knowledge about SCD and the factors associated with its prevention among local government workers in Ile- Ife. Method: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of the knowledge about SCD, attitude towards premarital sickle cell screening and marital decisions among local government workers in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: 69 % of study subjects had poor knowledge of SCD, while attitude towards premarital screening was favourable in 95 % of the study subjects. Knowledge and attitude were significantly better among subjects with tertiary education. There was a strong positive association between attitude towards sickle cell screening and a history of undergoing screening or partner screening. Most (86. 7 %) of the respondents and 74. 0 % of their partners have had sickle cell screening. One-quarter of married and engaged respondents did not know their partner’s sickle cell status. One-third to two-thirds of study subjects will continue the relationship with their partner when either or both have haemoglobinopathy. Conclusion: This study showed poor knowledge of SCD among the studied subjects. There is a need for more emphasis on health education through programmes promoting sickle cell education. In addition, the development of multifaceted patient and public health education programmes, the intensification of screening for the control of SCD by heterozygote detection, particularly during routine <b>preplacement</b> and premarital <b>medical</b> <b>examinations,</b> and the provision of genetic counselling to all SCD patients and carriers are vital to the identification and care of the couples at risk. These will enhance the capacity of the intending couples to make informed decisions and be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Policies are needed to ensure easily accessible community-wide sickle cell screening and premarital and genetic counselling to achieve the desired decline in new births of children with SCD. </p...|$|R

40|$|The use of air {{conditioning}} {{as an alternative}} to replace natural ventilation may improve comfort and work productivity. However {{air conditioning}} that is not well maintained may become a good media for microbial growth. This condition may result in decreased indoor air quality and induce health impairment known as Sick Building Syndrome. The objectives of this study were to analyze the effects of physical and microbiological qualities on health impairment. This study was carried out in an air conditioned, two-story building of PT. Infomedia Nusantara in Surabaya. This was an observational study with cross-sectional approach. This study was carried out by means of interview, observation and measurements including air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and the number of colony forming units in a cubic meter of air (germs, fungi, and bacteria). The number of population was 94 employees and the number of samples taken was 89 employees using purposive sampling technique. Data collected were analyzed either descriptively (tabulation) and analytically using logistic regression test (Î± = 0. 05). The results of this study showed that air temperatures measured were still within the recommended temperature range, while relative humidity, air velocity and total germs colonies measured in two locations had exceeded the recommended standards. The total colonies of fungi were 0, 87 (first floor) and 1, 94 (second floor), and total colonies of bacterial were 6, 87 (first floor) and 3, 21 (second floor) respectively. Complaints experienced by employees were skin irritation (75, 28 %), eye irritation (74, 16 %), nasal irritation (73, 03 %), neurological dissorder (66, 29 %), sore throat (46, 07 %), and nausea (21, 35 %) respectively. Fungus had significant influence (p = 0. 048) on nasal irritation, nausea were significantly affected (p = 0. 020) by germs whereas the other variables did not influence (p > 0. 05) on health problems. It is suggested that the company provide training on indoor air quality (SBS/BRI) to all employees and conduct environmental monitoring as well as performing either <b>preplacement</b> or periodic <b>medical</b> <b>examination.</b> The air conditioning available should be checked and maintained at regular intervals, manager and employees should always participate in keeping the work place clean.
