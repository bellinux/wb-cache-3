5|$|The invitations were {{distributed}} among 450leading citizens and {{officials in the}} capital. The Cabildo compiled the guest list, and tried to guarantee the result, inviting <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be likely to support the Viceroy. The revolutionaries countered this move with a similar one, so {{that most people would}} be against Cisneros instead. The printer Agustín Donado, supporting the revolutionaries, printed nearly 600invitations instead of the 450requested, and distributed the surplus among the criollos. During the night, Castelli, Rodríguez, French and Beruti visited all the barracks to harangue the troops and prepare them for the following day.|$|E

25|$|Coleridge and Southey {{came up with}} a {{theoretical}} political government named Pantisocracy. Originally named Pantocracy, the system was intended be a perfect, egalitarian society formed in America. Poole discussed their ideal government during their visit, and had hope for what the system would accomplish. However, Poole thought that the system would have little chance for succeeding, and he advised Coleridge and Southey that there would be problems regarding females and marriage contracts within the society. As plans were developed, they formed a group of <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> become part of the society, including Southey's mother, Southey's fiancee and her family, and a few others that they knew. Coleridge and Southey also encouraged the group to study agriculture and carpentry to help with the settlement.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the coup}} failed, {{the death of}} the King and heir {{apparent}} was responsible for continuing instability which was ultimately a success for the republicans. The traditional parties were able to impose an acclamation solution, with the establishment of a unity government presided by an independent (Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral), the ostracising of João Franco's supporters, and the repeal of Francist decrees. In fact, the acclamation policies was a rendition: many of the conspirators were liberated from prison, the assassins (who were killed in the square) were eulogized as martyrs and the criminal investigation was rendered ineffective. These events only encouraged the republicans to attempt another coup d'état 33 months later, led by the same <b>people,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> succeed in establishing the Portuguese First Republic. The events that gave rise to the attempted coup on January 28 were the last attempts to reform the constitutional monarchy.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 2013 {{during a}} meeting with {{evacuees}} from the Miyakoji district of Tamura, Fukushima Prefecture and central government officials, the announcement was made that the residents {{would be allowed to}} return to their homes in mid-August 2013, although the radiation levels in residential areas still ranged between 0.32 and 0.54 microsieverts per hour, much higher than the government's goal of 0.23 microsieverts per hour. However, decontamination efforts in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, arguing that exposure to radiation would differ for every person. The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 millisievert for <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> stay outdoors for eight hours a day. Instead the officials offered the evacuees a new type of dosimeter so that they could check their own radiation exposures, and in this way take responsibility for their own safety.|$|E

[...] Tohuvabohu was on Billboards Dance/Electronic Albums Chart for just three weeks and peaked at No.4. It appeared on the Independent Albums Chart for one week at No.29. [...] Tohuvabohu also had a companion, Brimborium, a full length remix album released in 2008 that barely made it onto Billboards Dance/Electronic Albums Chart, hitting No.20 for a single week.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{and after}} the mandate, all Xbox One {{consoles}} initially shipped with the Kinect sensor included. On June 9, 2014, cheaper Xbox One bundles were introduced, which {{did not include the}} Kinect sensor. Microsoft stated the decision to offer Xbox One bundles without Kinect was to [...] " [...] a choice to <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow people to buy an Xbox One and then ramp up to Kinect when they can afford to", while also allowing games to use processing power that was previously reserved for Kinect. An updated Xbox Development Kit issued in June 2014 allows developers to explicitly disable motion tracking functionality in games, allowing access to additional system resources that represent about 10% of the GPU processing power. These resources were previously reserved for Kinect skeletal tracking, regardless of whether the Kinect sensor was attached or in use.|$|E

They added that they also wanted to make an Advance Wars title that even veterans of the series would find fresh. The setting was also {{a reason for the}} design change, being a [...] "not-so-distant future science fiction" [...] setting, which the developers felt didn't fit well with the style of previous titles. When asked whether they feared that gamers would be turned off by the changes, the developers responded by saying that they have to [...] "fight against" [...] this fear. The developers felt that without innovation, the series would turn players off, so they introduced new gameplay mechanics as well as the new setting.|$|E

5000|$|Besides {{its value}} {{as a source of}} tax revenue, {{industrial}} output and military recruits, Silesia was strategically important to Prussia because its seizure [...] "significantly blunted the capacity of Prussia's two chief foes—Austria and Russia—to meddle in Prussian affairs." [...] Capture of Silesia, furthermore, prevented Augustus III of Poland from uniting Poland and Saxony (via a land bridge through Silesia), of which he was King and Elector, respectively. Prussia's repeated victories (and possession of Silesia) foreshadowed a wider struggle for hegemony over the German-speaking <b>peoples</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> culminate in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.|$|R
500|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, American Continental's profits {{were in the}} {{millions}} and it had become the biggest single-family home builder in Phoenix and Denver. At its peak it would have $6 billion in assets, {{a large number of}} subsidiaries, 2,500 employees, and a headquarters complex on Phoenix's Camelback Road. It had three corporate jets and a helicopter. He was a very hard worker and a strong presence to his employees; one later said, [...] "It's almost magnetic. When he moves, things happen. The office would come alive when he walked in." [...] He inspired both camaraderie and fervent loyalty in them. While he demanded long hours, he often rewarded employees monetarily and with gifts. Businesspeople outside his company often found Keating arrogant and difficult to deal with. Congressman William Keating, who was well-liked, said of his brother: [...] "Charlie is impatient, aggressive, always on the move. He has clearly defined goals. I don't think he worries about the popularity of his positions." [...] A Fortune profile in 1977 reported, [...] "It seems almost impossible to find anyone who actually likes Charlie Keating." [...] The story rankled Keating, who later had over five thousand large yellow [...] "I Like Charlie Keating" [...] buttons made up which he handed out to employees and visitors. Keating said, [...] "There are a lot of <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> say nasty things, I'm sure, about me, but it ain't true that nobody ever liked Charlie Keating." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 Cooney took {{a leave of absence}} from WNDT and, funded by Carnegie Corporation, {{traveled}} the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. [...] She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled [...] "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education". [...] The report, which Gikow called [...] "a schematic for the show Sesame Street would become", described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). [...] Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with credibility in the eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show's funding sources. [...] Davis credited Cooney's motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, as she put it, [...] "make a difference". [...] She later told an interviewer, [...] "I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be watched by a handful of the convinced, but I was never really going to have an influence on my times". [...] She later told Davis, [...] "Preschoolers were not necessarily my thing. [...] It was using television in a constructive way that turned me on".|$|E
500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person, living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E
