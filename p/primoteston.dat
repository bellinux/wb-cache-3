We studied sex reversal and growth for 120 days in 10 -gallon tanks, without aeration, with densities of 1 fry per liter. Temperature varied between 28, 2 and 28, 7 Â°C. The pH was 8, 1 to 8, 8 and oxygen concentration 6, 2 to 6, 8 mg/l. Aba Api-balanced food with 25 % protein was used and three different hor-mones were added to the treatments: (1) Sten (2) <b>Primoteston</b> and (3) Sos-tenon 250. Sex reversal in males was 85, 0 %, 92, 5 % and 80, 0 % respectively. Fishes with treatments 1 and 3 gained an average of 0, 48 g and 4, 2 cm (with treatment 2 : 0, 44 g and 4 cm). Survival was 85 %, 92, 5 % and 80 %; however, these differences were not significant. The three treatments gave the ex-pected results of sex reversal, growth and survival...|$|E
