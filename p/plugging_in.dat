5|$|Springfield is in {{the midst}} of a massive heat wave. Every {{building}} in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by <b>plugging</b> <b>in</b> his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. Eventually, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.|$|E

25|$|In mid-2015, {{several new}} color schemes {{for all of}} the current iPod models were spotted in the latest version of iTunes, 12.2. Belgian website Belgium iPhone {{originally}} found the images when <b>plugging</b> <b>in</b> an iPod for the first time, and subsequent leaked photos were found by Pierre Dandumont.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} a curve tracer <b>plug</b> <b>in,</b> the 7CT1N ($1,385 in 1983), and {{spectrum}} analyzer <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> (e.g., 7L14, 7L18, 7L5, 7L12).

40|$|The {{need for}} a {{mechanism}} to control and filter subscriptions to control system variables by the client was described in a paper at the ICALEPCS 2009 conference [1]. The implementation follows a <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> design that allows the insertion of <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> instances into the event stream on the server side. The client can instantiate and configure these <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> when opening a subscription, by adding modifiers to the channel name using JSON notation [2]. This paper describes the design and implementation of a modular server side <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> framework for Channel Access, and shows examples for <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> {{as well as their}} use within an EPICS control syste...|$|R
50|$|In {{practical}} use, a V-6 engine {{would only}} need three coil packs instead of six. Each individual coil fires the spark <b>plugs</b> <b>in</b> two cylinders simultaneously, the spark <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> one cylinder on a compression stroke where the power comes from, and the spark <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> the other cylinder on an exhaust stroke.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{simplest}} problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point. The most straightforward approach, of just <b>plugging</b> <b>in</b> the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient. For polynomials, a better approach is using the Horner scheme, since it reduces the necessary number of multiplications and additions. Generally, {{it is important to}} estimate and control round-off errors arising from the use of floating point arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|Several {{manufacturers}} have made deliberately incompatible variants for use where connection with standard plugs is not acceptable. Common uses include filtered supplies for computer equipment and cleaners' supplies in public buildings and areas (to prevent visitors <b>plugging</b> <b>in</b> unauthorised equipment). Examples are one design made by MK {{which has a}} T-shaped earth pin, and the Walsall Gauge 13A plug, which has each pin rotated 90°, the latter being in use on parts of the London Underground for 110V AC supply. and also in some British Rail offices for filtered computer supplies.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{standard}} BS1363 plugs {{found in the}} UK, the earth pin is on a horizontal axis and the line and neutral pins on a vertical axis. This style of plug/socket was used by university laboratories (from batteries) and the BBC, and is still in use on parts of the London Underground for 110 V AC voltage supply. In the 1960s they were used for 240 V DC in the Power laboratory of the Electrical Engineering department of what was then University College, Cardiff. Power was supplied by the public 240 V DC mains which remained available {{in addition to the}} 240 V AC mains until circa 1969, and thereafter from in-house rectifiers. They were also used in the Ministry of Defence Main Building on circuits powered from the standby generators to stop staff from <b>plugging</b> <b>in</b> unauthorised devices, e.g. kettles. They were also known to be used in some British Rail offices for the same reason.|$|E
50|$|The 7Bnn <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> were {{intended}} as time bases. There were several choices {{to match the}} mainframe's bandwidth. Two time base <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> could communicate to obtain a delayed sweep feature (e.g., 7B80 and 7B85, $1,335 and $1,605 in 1983). Some time base <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> included a delayed sweep in one module, such as the 7B53A or 7B92A ($1,430 and $3,175 in 1983).|$|R

25|$|The device {{featured}} a small 1.55inch multi-touch screen {{with a lower}} resolution of 240×240 pixels but a higher pixel density of 220 pixels per inch, as opposed to the larger 2.2inch screen on the fifth-generation iPod Nano. The device had a 0.39 watt-hour battery rated at 3.7 volts, giving a capacity of 105 mAh, and specified to give 24 hours of music playback on a single full charge. The device took about three hours for one full charge. The device retained the same 30-pin dock connector as previous generations. This Nano lost the previous generation's video camera, built-in voice recorder microphone (although <b>plugging</b> <b>in</b> headphones with a built in microphone revealed a Voice Memos app) and built-in speaker, and games. It also lost support for video playback, but music videos and video podcasts (vodcasts) could be synced onto the device, and the audio from them would play on the device, with a single key-frame shown on the screen. It still included the Nike+iPod fitness option as well as an FM radio tuner with RDS (Radio Data System). It had a black on white screen contrast option and other accessibility options. The 6th generation iPod Nano had the same price point as the 5th generation device.|$|E
500|$|The G2 {{ships with}} Android 4.2.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] with a custom {{interface}} and software. It contains {{a number of}} features {{that are designed to}} [...] "learn" [...] from users by predicting future actions, and allow for flexibility and customization. The G2 retains features from previous LG models such as the Optimus G and G Pro, including QuickMemo (which allows users to write notes on top of a screenshot), QuickRemote (a feature which allows the device to serve as a universal remote), QSlide pop-up apps, and Voice Mate. New features introduced by the G2 include TextLink, which analyzes text messages to detect content such as addresses and times that can be passed to other apps (such as the calendar, a note, or Google Maps), a pop-up menu of relevant apps triggered when <b>plugging</b> <b>in</b> headphones or a USB cable (Plug & Pop), the ability to answer a phone call by holding the phone to the user's head (AnswerMe), Slide Aside, a multitasking feature which allows users to [...] "slide" [...] away apps onto cards with a three-finger gesture, the Clip Tray (which collects content that had been copied to the clipboard), and Guest Mode. The G2 uses on-screen buttons; users can change their background color (which includes black and white options, either solid colored or with a gradient), customize the order of the buttons, or add additional buttons for opening QuickMemo or the notification shade. The G2's default music player supports the playback of WAV and FLAC files with 24-bit/192kHz audio.|$|E
500|$|The Hunger Games has {{received}} critical acclaim. In a review for The New York Times, John Green {{wrote that the}} novel was [...] "brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced", and that [...] "the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine." [...] However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the allegorical potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing [...] "described the action and little else." [...] Time magazine's review was also positive, stating that it [...] "is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book" [...] and praising what it called the [...] "hypnotic" [...] quality of the violence. In Stephen King's review for Entertainment Weekly, he compared it to [...] "shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames {{in the lobby of}} the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep <b>plugging</b> <b>in</b> quarters anyway." [...] However, he stated that there were [...] "displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults" [...] and that the love triangle was standard for the genre. He gave the book a B grade. Elizabeth Bird of School Library Journal praised the novel, saying it is [...] "exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns", and called it one of the best books of 2008. Booklist also gave a positive review, praising the character violence and romance involved in the book. Kirkus Reviews gave a positive review, praising the action and world-building, but pointed out that [...] "poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers–a crying shame". Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, claims it is the [...] "closest thing to a perfect adventure novel" [...] he has ever read.

50|$|There {{were several}} digital or meter <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> (7Dnn). For {{the first time}} in commercially {{available}} oscilloscopes, the 7000 series had a digital read-out system, so a <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> could display its settings or display the value of a measurement on the CRT. The 7D11 ($2,915 in 1983) was a digital delay, the 7D15 ($3,020) was a 225 MHz counter/timer, the 7D13 ($1,105) was a multimeter, and the 7D12/M2 ($2,815) was a sample-and-hold with an analog-to-digital converter. More exotic digital <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> used the mainframe oscilloscope as a mere display unit. The 7D01 and 7D02 were logic analyzer <b>plug</b> <b>ins.</b> The triple-wide 7D20 programmable digitizer with GPIB ($7,750 in 1983) would turn an analog mainframe into a digital scope.|$|R
