25|$|Other {{possible}} treatments {{include a}} combination of <b>praziquantel</b> with metrifonate, artesunate, or mefloquine. A Cochrane review found tentative evidence that when used alone, metrifonate was as effective as <b>praziquantel.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> is {{administered}} as a racemate, {{but only the}} (R)-enantiomer is biologically active; the enantiomers may be separated using a resolution of an amine obtained from <b>praziquantel.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> {{treatment}} is ineffective.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{cimetidine}} heightens <b>praziquantel</b> bioavailability.|$|E
25|$|Chloroquine {{reduces the}} {{bioavailability}} of <b>praziquantel.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> has a {{particularly}} dramatic effect on patients with schistosomiasis. Studies of those treated {{have shown that}} within six months of receiving a dose of <b>praziquantel,</b> up to 90% of {{the damage done to}} internal organs due to schistosomiasis infection can be reversed.|$|E
25|$|In {{cats and}} dogs whose {{gastrointestinal}} tract is infected with the tapeworms Dipylidium caninum or Taenia taeniaeformis, respectively; <b>praziquantel</b> is also often used in fixed combination with pyrantel embonate against the roundworms (ascarids): Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina. <b>Praziquantel</b> is also effective against Echinococcus multilocularis.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifampicin decreases plasma {{concentrations of}} <b>praziquantel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carbamazepine and {{phenytoin}} {{are reported}} to reduce the bioavailability of <b>praziquantel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Schistosomiasis is treatable {{by taking}} by mouth a single {{dose of the}} drug <b>praziquantel</b> annually.|$|E
25|$|Methods {{to prevent}} the disease include {{improving}} access to clean water and {{reducing the number of}} snails. In areas where the disease is common, the medication <b>praziquantel</b> may be given once a year to the entire group. This is done to decrease the number of people infected and, consequently, the spread of the disease. <b>Praziquantel</b> is also the treatment recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for those who are known to be infected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most}} {{important}} medications needed in a basic health system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> is FDA {{approved}} in the US {{for the treatment}} of schistosomiasis and liver fluke, although it is effective in other infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> was {{developed}} in the laboratories for parasitological research of Bayer AG and Merck KGaA in Germany (Elberfeld and Darmstadt) in the mid 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Echinostomiasis can {{be treated}} with the {{anthelmintic}} drug <b>praziquantel,</b> as for other intestinal trematode infections. Side effects of anthelmintic drug treatment may include nausea, abdominal pain, headaches or dizziness.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{studies have}} failed to reveal {{evidence}} of fetal harm. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. <b>Praziquantel</b> should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed; caution is recommended.|$|E
25|$|There are two drugs available, <b>praziquantel</b> and oxamniquine, for the {{treatment}} of schistosomiasis. They are considered equivalent in relation to efficacy against S. mansoni and safety. Because of praziquantel's lower cost per treatment, and oxaminiquine's lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by S. haematobium, in general <b>praziquantel</b> is considered the first option for treatment. The treatment objective is to cure the disease and to prevent the evolution of the acute to the chronic form of the disease. All cases of suspected schistosomiasis should be treated regardless of presentation because the adult parasite can live in the host for years.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects may}} include poor coordination, {{abdominal}} pain, vomiting, headache, and allergic reactions. While {{it may be}} used during pregnancy, it is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. <b>Praziquantel</b> is in the anthelmintic class of medications. It works partly by affecting {{the function of the}} worm's sucker.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{concerning the}} mechanism of action of <b>praziquantel</b> has been recently reported. The drug seems to interfere with adenosine uptake in cultured worms. This effect may have therapeutical relevance given that the schistosome, as the Taenia and the Echinococcus (other praziquantel-sensitive parasites), is unable to synthesize purines such as adenosine de novo.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} are working towards eradicating the disease. The WHO is promoting these efforts. In some cases, urbanization, pollution, {{and the consequent}} destruction of snail habitat have reduced exposure, with a subsequent decrease in new infections. Furthermore, the drug <b>praziquantel</b> is used for prevention in high-risk populations living {{in areas where the}} disease is common.|$|E
25|$|<b>Praziquantel,</b> {{sold under}} the brandname Biltricide among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} a number of types of parasitic worm infections. Specifically it is used for schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, tapeworm infections, cysticercosis, hydatid disease, and other fluke infections. It {{should not be used}} for worm infections of the eye. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.4 to 18.15 USD per day. In the United States a typical course of treatment costs 100 to 200 USD.|$|E
25|$|Broad-spectrum benzimidazoles (such as {{albendazole}} and mebendazole) are {{the first}} line treatment of intestinal roundworm and tapeworm infections. Macrocyclic lactones (such as ivermectin) are effective against adult and migrating larval stages of nematodes. <b>Praziquantel</b> is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and most types of food-borne trematodiases. Oxamniquine is also widely used in mass deworming programmes. Pyrantel is commonly used for veterinary nematodiasis. Artemisinins and derivatives are proving to be candidates as drugs of choice for trematodiasis.|$|E
25|$|The mode {{of action}} is not exactly known at present, but {{experimental}} evidence indicates <b>praziquantel</b> increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.|$|E
25|$|Another method {{targeting}} the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried {{in some areas}} of North America and Lake Annecy in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering <b>praziquantel</b> to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans. Work on schistosomiasis showed that water-resistant topical applications of the common insect repellent DEET prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice. Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the aforementioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> is well absorbed (about 80%) {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, only {{a relatively small}} amount enters systemic circulation. <b>Praziquantel</b> has a serum half-life of 0.8 to 1.5 hours in adults with normal renal and liver function. Metabolites have a half-life of 4 to 5 hours. In patients with significantly impaired liver function (Child-Pugh score B and C), the serum half-life is increased to 3 to 8 hours. <b>Praziquantel</b> and its metabolites are mainly excreted renally; within 24 h after a single oral dose, 70 to 80% is found in urine, but less than 0.1% as the unchanged drug. <b>Praziquantel</b> is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 pathway via CYP3A4. [...] Agents that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 such as phenytoin, rifampin, and azole antifungals will affect the metabolism of <b>praziquantel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Bayer's Animal Health Division website states, [...] "Praziquantel {{is active}} against cestodes (tapeworms). <b>Praziquantel</b> is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and {{excreted}} in the bile. Upon entering {{the digestive tract}} from the bile, cestocidal activity is exhibited. Following exposure to <b>praziquantel,</b> the tapeworm loses its ability to resist digestion by the mammalian host. Because of this, whole tapeworms, including the scolices (plural of [...] "scolex"), are very rarely passed after administration of <b>praziquantel.</b> In many instances, only disintegrated and partially digested pieces of tapeworms will {{be seen in the}} stool. The majority of tapeworms are digested and are not found in the feces." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> is used {{to treat}} {{diseases}} caused by infection with several types of internal/gastrointestinal, and external parasites, including: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another way of combating drug {{resistance}} in adult horses is to deworm less frequently, by performing fecal egg counts on manure and deworming only horses {{with a high}} count. This strategy is now recommended by most veterinarians and parasitologists, as it reduces the probability of resistance. For horses that are consistently deemed [...] "low shedders," [...] it is still recommended to deworm at least 1-2 times per year with ivermectin + <b>praziquantel</b> or moxidectin + <b>praziquantel</b> to target tapeworms, bots, and small strongyles. This is typically done {{in the fall and}} spring.|$|E
2500|$|Schistosomiasis {{caused by}} trematodes {{of the genus}} Schistosoma. As of 2005, <b>praziquantel</b> is the primary {{treatment}} for human schistosomiasis, {{for which it is}} usually effective in a single dose.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> is not {{licensed}} for use {{in humans}} in the UK {{but it can be}} imported when necessary on a named patient basis. [...] It is available in the UK as a veterinary anthelmintic.|$|E
2500|$|Hydatidosis {{is caused}} by a cestode Echinococcus. This is usually noticed among dogs, wild dogs, foxes, etc. Due to its {{importance}} as a zoonosis, these worms are important to treat. [...] Preventing hydatidosis is an easier task than treating the same. Anthelmintics such as <b>praziquantel</b> may help prevent this condition. Prohibition of the feeding of dogs with uncooked offals may be the best prophylactic measure against these tapeworms.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parasite, as adult F. hepatica: [...] or adult F. gigantica: 25–75×12mm, fasciolosis is a big concern. The amount of {{symptoms}} depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans. Treatment with triclabendazole has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages. <b>Praziquantel</b> is not effective, and older drugs such as bithionol are moderately effective but also cause more side effects. Secondary bacterial infection causing cholangitis [...] has also been a concern and can be treated with antibiotics, and toxaemia may be treated with prednisolone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Praziquantel,</b> a {{quinolone}} derivative. The {{effect of}} <b>praziquantel</b> on H. heterophyes causes deep legions on the tegument, and {{when exposed to}} <b>praziquantel</b> {{over a longer period}} of time lead to even deeper legions.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} drug {{option is}} Tetrachloroethylene, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, but its use has been superseded by new antihelminthic drugs (like <b>Praziquantel).</b> A 1978 study {{also looked at}} the efficacy of several drugs on metagonimiasis infection, including bithionol, niclosamide, nicoflan, and <b>Praziquantel.</b> All drugs showed lower prevalence of eggs in feces, however only <b>Praziquantel</b> showed complete radical cure. Therefore, the authors concluded <b>Praziquantel</b> was the most highly effective, was very well tolerated, and was the most promising drug against metagonimiasis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Praziquantel</b> is {{administered}} as a racemate, {{but only the}} (R)-enantiomer is biologically active; the enantiomers may be separated using a resolution of an amine obtained from <b>praziquantel.</b>|$|E
