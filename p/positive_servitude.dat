50|$|A {{servitude}} cannot {{impose the}} performance of a positive duty on the owner of the burdened property but only duties either to refrain from exercising certain rights to which an owner could be otherwise entitled (negative servitude) or to suffer certain things to be done to his property which an owner otherwise could be entitled to forbid or resist (<b>positive</b> <b>servitude).</b> Servitudes arise from express agreement, adverse possession, or as a matter of law.|$|E
5000|$|Servitudes are {{classified}} {{according to whether}} or not they benefit successive owners. Two types are recognised: praedial servitudes and personal servitudes. Whether a servitude should be classified as a personal or a praedial servitude depends on whether it benefits a particular piece of land or a particular person: If the benefit favours land, then, regardless of the identity of the owner at any given point, successive owners will benefit from the interest in the servient land; if the benefit favours a particular person, then, at best, the benefit will exist for the lifetime of that person. Both praedial and personal servitudes are limited real rights, as they burden ownership, and both may be either positive or negative. <b>Positive</b> <b>servitudes</b> confer on the servitude-holder the entitlement [...] "to enter upon the servient proprietor's land to do something positive," [...] to perform a <b>positive</b> act; negative <b>servitudes</b> restrict the entitlements of the owner of the servient tenement.|$|R
50|$|Servitudes may be {{terminated}} by agreement. They {{can usually be}} abandoned (although proof of the intention to abandon is necessary) and may also be extinguished by the effluxion of time (although different rules pertain to <b>positive</b> and negative <b>servitudes).</b> A servitude terminates if the property to which it relates is destroyed, but it will revive if the property is restored.|$|R
