40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the photosensitization of isolated membranes of pigmented and non-pigrmented Sarcina lutea in the presence and absence of an exogenous photosensitizer has been made. Illumination of Membranes at low light intensities with tolaidine blue resulted in <b>photoinactivation</b> of malate, succinate, lactate and ascorbate oxidases. Methylene blue and DCPIP reductions, cytochrome c and ascorbate-TMPD oxidase activities also showed photoinactivations. <b>Photoinactivation</b> was always greater in non-pigmented than in pigmented membranes. 20 minutes' illumination caused reversible inactivation, while 60 minutes' illumination caused irreversible <b>photoinactivation</b> of malate oxidase activity in the non-pigraented membranes. 5 minutes' illumination at high light intensity, without exogenous photosensitizer, caused reversible <b>photoinactivation</b> of malate and succinate oxidases and malate s DCPIP and succinate : DCPIP reductions in pigmented membranes. Non-pigmented membranes showed irreversible <b>photoinactivation</b> of these enzyme activities. <b>Photoinactivation</b> of malate : vitamin K reductase was reversible in all membranes. 15 minutes illumination irreversibly photoinactivated malate and succinate oxidases, but reversibly photoinactivated malate and succinate : DCPIP reductions in the pigmented membranes. Non-oigmented membranes showed irreversible <b>photoinactivation</b> of these enzyme activities. Malate and succinate : vitamin K reductases of both strains showed reversible <b>photoinactivation.</b> 25 minutes illumination with ultraviolet-filtered light showed no <b>photoinactivation</b> of PMS or methylene blue reductions, but showed reversible <b>photoinactivation</b> of malate oxidase activity in the pigmented strain and irreversible <b>photoinactivation</b> in non-pigmented cells and membranes.

40|$|For plants, {{light is}} an {{indispensable}} resource. However, it also causes {{a loss of}} photosynthetic activity associated with <b>photoinactivation</b> of photosystem II (PSII). In studies of the mechanism of this <b>photoinactivation,</b> there are two confl icting hypotheses at present. One is that excess energy received by leaves, being neither utilized by photosynthesis nor dissipated safely in non-photochemical quenching, causes the <b>photoinactivation.</b> The other involves a two-step mechanism in which excitation of Mn by photons is the primary cause. In the former hypothesis, <b>photoinactivation</b> of PSII should not occur in low light that provides little excess energy, but in the latter hypothesis it should. Therefore, we tested these two hypotheses in different irradiances. We used a system that can measure the fraction of functional PSII complexes under natural conditions and {{over a long period}} in intact leaves, which were attached to a plant treated with lincomycin taken up via the roots. The leaves were photoinactivated in low, medium or high light (30, 60 or 950 µmol m − 2 s − 1) with white, blue, green or red light-emitting diode arrays. Our results showed that the extent of <b>photoinactivation</b> per photon exposure was higher in high light than in low light, consistent with the abundance of excess energy. However, <b>photoinactivation</b> did occur in low light with little excess energy, and blue light caused the greatest extent of <b>photoinactivation</b> followed by white, green and red light in this order, an order that can be predicted from the Mn absorbance spectrum.

Although evolutionarily related they are ecologically distinct, with different strategies to harvest, manage and exploit light. We grew representative strains of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus and tracked their susceptibility to <b>photoinactivation</b> of Photosystem II under {{a range of}} light levels. As expected blue light provoked more rapid <b>photoinactivation</b> than did an equivalent level of red light. The previous growth light level altered the susceptibility of Synechococcus, but not Prochlorococcus, to this <b>photoinactivation.</b> We resolved a simple linear pattern when we expressed the yield of <b>photoinactivation</b> {{on the basis of}} photons delivered to Photosystem II photochemistry, plotted versus excitation pressure upon Photosystem II, the balance between excitation and downstream metabolism. A high excitation pressure increases the generation of reactive oxygen species, and thus increases the yield of <b>photoinactivation</b> of Photosystem II. Blue photons, however, retained a higher baseline <b>photoinactivation</b> across a wide range of excitation pressures. Our experiments thus uncovered the relative influences of the direct <b>photoinactivation</b> of Photosystem II by blue photons which dominates under low to moderate blue light, and <b>photoinactivation</b> as a side effect of reactive oxygen species which dominates under higher excitation pressure. Synechococcus enjoyed a positive metabolic return upon the repair or the synthesis of a Photosystem II, across the range of light levels we tested. In contrast Prochlorococcus only enjoyed a positive return upon synthesis of a Photosystem II up to 400 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1.

40|$|Utilization of absorbed {{light energy}} by photosystem (PS) II for O 2 {{evolution}} {{depends on the}} light-harvesting antenna size, but the role of antenna size in the <b>photoinactivation</b> of PSII seems controversial. To address this controversy, pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants were grown in low (50 [mu]mol m- 2 s- 1) or high (650 [mu]mol m- 2 s- 1) light. The doubled functional antenna size of PSII in low light allows each PSII to utilize twice as many photons at given flash light energies for O 2 evolution. The application of a target theory to depict the photon dose dependency of PSII <b>photoinactivation</b> measured by repetitive-flash O 2 yield and the ratio of variable to maximal chlorophyll fluorescence indicates that <b>photoinactivation</b> of PSII is probably a single-hit process in which repair or photoprotective mechanisms are only slightly involved.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAmong {{the most}} {{prominent}} molecular constituents of a recycling synaptic vesicle is the clathrin triskelion, composed of clathrin light chain (Clc) and clathrin heavy chain (Chc). Remarkably, it remains unknown whether clathrin is strictly necessary for the stimulus-dependent re-formation of a synaptic vesicle and, conversely, whether clathrin-independent vesicle endocytosis exists at the neuronal synapse. ResultsWe employ FlAsH-FALI-mediated protein <b>photoinactivation</b> to rapidly (3 min) and specifically disrupt Clc function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We first demonstrate that Clc <b>photoinactivation</b> does not impair synaptic-vesicle fusion. We then provide electrophysiological and ultrastructural evidence that synaptic vesicles, once fused with the plasma membrane, cannot be re-formed after Clc <b>photoinactivation.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that stimulus-dependent membrane internalization occurs after Clc <b>photoinactivation.</b> However, newly internalized membrane fails to resolve into synaptic vesicles. Rather, newly internalized membrane forms large and extensive internal-membrane compartments that are never observed at a wild-type synapse. ConclusionsWe make three major conclusions. (1) FlAsH-FALI-mediated protein <b>photoinactivation</b> rapidly and specifically disrupts Clc function with no effect on synaptic-vesicle fusion. (2) Synaptic-vesicle re-formation does not occur after Clc <b>photoinactivation.</b> By extension, clathrin-independent “kiss-and-run” endocytosis does not sustain synaptic transmission during a stimulus train at this synapse.

The flash energy and the time interval between the flashes were varied between the experiments, and <b>photoinactivation</b> was measured with oxygen evolution and the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm). The photoinhibitory efficiency of saturating xenon flashes {{was found to be}} directly proportional to flash energy and independent of the time interval between the flashes. These findings indicate that a low-light-specific mechanism, based on charge recombination between PSII electron acceptors and the oxygen-evolving complex, is not the main cause of <b>photoinactivation</b> caused by short flashes in vivo. Furthermore, the relationship between the rate constant of <b>photoinactivation</b> and photon flux density was similar for flashes and continuous light when Fv/Fm was used to quantify <b>photoinactivation,</b> suggesting that continuous-light <b>photoinactivation</b> has a mechanism in which the quantum yield does not depend on the mode of delivery of light. A similar quantum yield of photoinhibition for flashes and continuous light is compatible with the manganese-based photoinhibition mechanism and with mechanisms in which singlet oxygen, produced via a direct photosensitization reaction, is the agent of damage. However, the classical acceptor-side and donor-side mechanisms do not predict a similar quantum yield for flashes and continuous light...|$|E

40|$|<b>Photoinactivation</b> of Photosystem II (PS II), the light-induced loss {{of ability}} to evolve oxygen, inevitably occurs under any light {{environment}} in nature, counteracted by repair. Under certain conditions, the extent of <b>photoinactivation</b> of PS II depends on the photon exposure (light dosage, x), rather than the irradiance or duration of illumination per se, thus obeying the law of reciprocity of irradiance and duration of illumination, namely, that equal photon exposure produces an equal effect. If the probability of <b>photoinactivation</b> (p) of PS II is directly proportional to an increment in photon exposure (p = kDeltax, where k is the probability per unit photon exposure), it can be deduced {{that the number of}} active PS II complexes decreases exponentially as a function of photon exposure: N = Noexp(-kx). Further, since a photon exposure is usually achieved by varying the illumination time (t) at constant irradiance (I), N = Noexp(-kI t), i. e., N decreases exponentially with time, with a rate coefficient of <b>photoinactivation</b> kI, where the product kI is obviously directly proportional to I. Given that N = Noexp(-kx), the quantum yield of <b>photoinactivation</b> of PS II can be defined as -dN/dx = kN, which varies with the number of active PS II complexes remaining. Typically, the quantum yield of <b>photoinactivation</b> of PS II is ca. 0. 1 micromol PS II per mol photons at low photon exposure when repair is inhibited. That is, when about 10 (7) photons have been received by leaf tissue, one PS II complex is inactivated. Some species such as grapevine have a much lower quantum yield of <b>photoinactivation</b> of PS II, even at a chilling temperature. Examination of the longer-term time course of <b>photoinactivation</b> of PS II in capsicum leaves reveals that the decrease in N deviates from a single-exponential decay when the majority of the PS II complexes are inactivated in the absence of repair. This {{can be attributed to the}} formation of strong quenchers in severely-photoinactivated PS II complexes, able to dissipate excitation energy efficiently and to protect the remaining active neighbours against damage by light...|$|E

In this study, {{we examined the}} mechanisms involved in enzyme inactivation. We first explored the possibility of direct <b>photoinactivation.</b> The quantum yield spectrum (��) for the direct <b>photoinactivation</b> of Pase increased exponentially with decreasing wavelength, with a much steeper slope relative to other ��. This, combined with modeled half-life values for direct <b>photoinactivation</b> in excess of 5 d, indicates that direct <b>photoinactivation</b> of Pase by natural sunlight in lakes is negligible. Nonetheless, <b>photoinactivation</b> of enzymes occurred rapidly in light-exposed natural waters and suggested an indirect mechanism. The pH of natural waters greatly affected <b>photoinactivation.</b> In acid humic lake water exposed to ultraviolet radiation, the half-lives of both Pase and Gase were 4 h. The half-life of these enzymes under the same conditions were twofold higher for lake waters obtained from a limed humic lake (8 h). The higher rate of inactivation in acid water was likely caused by a pH-mediated increase in Fe photoreduction and enzyme binding. Solutions of Pase with Fe(II) and H 2 O 2 resulted in rapid inactivation (half-life 7 min at 8. 9 �mol L� 1 Fe). There was no significant inactivation of controls without H 2 O 2, indicating that enzymes are inactivated through Fe(III) /enzyme binding, which is enabled through the oxidation of Fe(II) by H 2 O 2 to Fe(III).

Formation of the P 680 radical (P 680 +), through charge separation at PS II, generation of triplet-state P 680 (3 P 680 *), through intersystem crossing and charge recombination, and double reduction of the primary stable electron acceptor of PS II (the plastoquinone, Q(A)) are all potentially critical steps in the triggering of <b>photoinactivation.</b> In this paper, these processes are assessed using fluorescence data from attached leaves of higher plant species, in the context of a Stern-Volmer model for downregulation and the reversible radical pair equilibrium model. It is shown that the yield of P 680 + is very sensitive to PPFD and that downregulation has very little effect on its production. Consequently, it is unlikely to be the trigger for <b>photoinactivation.</b> The yields of 3 P 680 * generated through charge recombination or intersystem crossing are both less sensitive to PPFD than the yield of P 680 + and are both decreased by down regulation. The yield of doubly reduced Q(A) increases with incident photon flux density at low levels, but is relatively insensitive at moderate to high levels, and is greatly decreased by downregulation.

Methods and Results: Eight bacterial species were exposed to simulated sunlight with greatly reduced UVB light intensity {{in the presence of}} three synthetic photosensitizers and two natural photosensitizers. Inactivation curves were fit with shoulder-log linear or first order kinetic models, from which the presence of a shoulder and magnitude of inactivation rate constants were compared. 84 % reduction in the UVB light intensity roughly matched a 72 - 95 % reduction in the overall bacterial <b>photoinactivation</b> rate constants in sensitizer-free water. With the UVB light mostly reduced, the exogenous indirect mechanism contribution was evident for most bacteria and photosensitizers tested, although most prominently with the Gram-positive bacteria.

We investigated the molecular mechanism responsible for this phenomenon in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. When the Calvin cycle was interrupted by glycolaldehyde, which is known to inhibit phosphoribulokinase, the extent of <b>photoinactivation</b> of PSII was enhanced. The effect of glycolaldehyde was {{very similar to that}} of chloramphenicol, which inhibits protein synthesis de novo in chloroplasts. The interruption of the Calvin cycle by the introduction of a missense mutation into the gene for the large subunit of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) also enhanced the extent of <b>photoinactivation</b> of PSII. In such mutant 10 - 6 C cells, neither glycolaldehyde nor chloramphenicol has any additional effect on <b>photoinactivation.</b> When wild-type cells were incubated under weak light after photodamage to PSII, the activity of PSII recovered gradually and reached a level close to the initial level.

Wild-type cells photoinactivated in the presence of diuron exhibit a fluorescence induction transient {{similar to that of the}} LF- 1 mutant. Removal of diuron allows rapid turnover of photoinactivated RCII-D 1 (pD 1) in the dark. The protective effect of diuron is gradually lost in photoinactivated cells even when incubated in the dark.

The deceleration of the <b>photoinactivation</b> kinetics is ascribed to electrostatic interaction of polylysine with OPg probably resulting in OPg clustering. The latter can stabilize the channel state by reducing the rotational and lateral mobility of OPg monomers and dimers, and thus increase the single channel lifetime...|$|E

It is still controversial, however, whether <b>photoinactivation</b> of photosystem II is completely avoided in high light-acclimated grapevines {{growing in the}} field. This study examines the functional stability of PSII in leaf discs (floated on water) of field-grown, high light-acclimated grapevines {{as a function of}} photon exposure. Measuring functional PSII units by flash-induced oxygen evolution, {{it was found that the}} susceptibility of PSII to <b>photoinactivation</b> was less in sun-exposed leaves than shade leaves of Vitis riparia Michaux, and enhanced by lincomycin, an inhibitor of chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis. Vitis vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay, grown in a glasshouse with slightly lower irradiance, exhibited an intermediate susceptibility. Significantly, the dark-relaxed quantum efficiency of PSII, measured as (Fm – Fo) /Fm, where Fm and Fo are the chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence yields for closed and open reaction centres, respectively, declined much more slowly than did the number of functional PSII units in V. riparia. Thus, measurements of (Fm – Fo) /Fm may give an impression of little <b>photoinactivation</b> of PSII, even when nearl...|$|E
40|$|In {{the rice}} leaves treated with methyl viologen (MV), the {{photochemical}} efficiency of PSII (or Fv/Fm) was significantly decreased, and {{significant portion of}} the <b>photoinactivation</b> process was reversible during the dark-recovery. The dark-reactivation process was relatively slow, reaching its plateau after 2 - 2. 5 h of dark incubation. The damaged portion of functional PSII was 13 %, based on the value of 1 /F 0 - 1 /Fm after this dark-recovery period. The reversible <b>photoinactivation</b> process of PSII function in the MV-treated leaves consisted of a xanthophyll cycle-dependent development of NPQ and a xanthophyll cycle-independent process. The latter process was reversible in the presence of nigericin. As well as the increase in the values of Chl fluorescence parameters, the epoxidation process during the dark-recovery after the MV-induced photooxidation was very slow. These results suggest that the photooxidative effect of MV is partly protected by the down-regulation of PSII before inducing physical damages in core proteins of PSII. key words: methyl viologen, chlorophyll fluorescence, down-regulation of PSII, reversible <b>photoinactivation,</b> dark-recovery, photosynthesi...|$|E
40|$|Merocyanine 540 (MC 540) -mediated {{photodynamic}} therapy (PDT) inactivates experimental leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma cells by a singlet oxygen-mediated mechanism but is rel-atively well tolerated by normal pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM). MC 540 is currently undergoing phase I clinical testing for the extracorpo-real purging of autologous bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells. We report here that per-forming MC 540 -mediated PDT at 4. 7 °C (hypothermia) instead of {{at ambient temperature}} enhanced the <b>photoinactivation</b> of L 1210 cells and CFU-GM but left the <b>photoinactivation</b> of K 562 cells un-changed. Hypothermia reduced dye binding in K 562 but not in L 1210 cells, whereas the photogen-eration of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) was affected in neither cell line. Post-PDT incubation at 4 °C delayed the decay of LOOH and enhanced the <b>photoinactivation</b> of CFU-GM as well as L 1210 and K 562 cells. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} hypothermia interfered with the repair of potentially lethal photodynamic damage.

40|$|<b>Photoinactivation</b> of photosystem II (PSII), the light-induced loss {{of ability}} to evolve oxygen, is an {{inevitable}} event during normal photosynthesis, exacerbated by saturating light but counteracted by repair via new protein synthesis. The <b>photoinactivation</b> of PSII {{is dependent on the}} dosage of light: in the absence of repair, typically one PSII is photoinactivated per 10 (7) photons, although the exact quantum yield of <b>photoinactivation</b> is modulated by a number of factors, and decreases as fewer active PSII targets are available. PSII complexes initially appear to be photoinactivated independently; however, when less than 30 % functional PSII complexes remain, they seem to be protected by strongly dissipative PSII reaction centres in several plant species examined so far, a mechanism which we term 'inactive PSII-mediated quenching'. This mechanism appears to require a pH gradient across the photosynthetic membrane for its optimal operation. The residual fraction of functional PSII complexes may, in turn, aid in the recovery of photoinactivated PSII complexes when conditions become less severe. This mechanism may be important for the photosynthetic apparatus in extreme environments such as those experienced by over-wintering evergreen plants, desert plants exposed to drought and full sunlight and shade plants in sustained sunlight...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{photosynthetic}} apparatus can {{be damaged}} by light {{energy in the}} process of photoinhibition. The target of this photoinhibition is mainly photosystem II (PSII). The mechanism leading to photoinhibitory damage is not yet known. We have characterized photoinhibition by measuring the <b>photoinactivation</b> of electron transport rates using the electron acceptors silicomolybdate and ferricyanide at different irradiance levels and different pH values. The effects of light on the donor side of PSII were measured with silicomolybdate, the effects on the acceptor side were measured with ferricyanide. We observed that <b>photoinactivation</b> of both donor and acceptor side of PSII are light dose-dependent, donor and acceptor side inactivation being independent processes. The donor side of PSII is less sensitive to photoinhibition than the acceptor side. The difference in pH dependence of donor and acceptor side <b>photoinactivation</b> leads us to propose that light-induced release of bicarbonate from PSII is a primary event leading to photoinhibition. In addition, we report that a photoinhibitory treatment increases the proton permeability of thylakoid membranes. This increase seems {{to be related to the}} presence of inactivated PSII reaction centers. It is suggested that radicals formed by inactivated PSII reaction centers causing lipid peroxidation are responsible...|$|E

40|$|<b>Photoinactivation</b> {{of ammonia}} {{oxidation}} in cells of Nitrosomonas {{was shown to}} follow first-order kinetics with a rate constant proportional to incident light intensity. The action spectrum for <b>photoinactivation</b> consisted of a broad peak in the ultraviolet range, where both hydroxylamine and ammonia oxidation were affected, and a shoulder at approximately 410 nm where only ammonia oxidation was affected. In photoinactivated cells, hydroxylamine but not ammonia was oxidized to nitrite and hydroxylamine but not ammonia caused reduction of cytochromes in vivo. The amount per cell of the following constituents was not measurably altered by photoinactivation: cytochromes b, c, a, and P 460; ubiquinone; phospholipid; free amino acids; hydroxylamine-dependent nitrite synthetase; nitrite reductase; p-phenylenediamine oxidase; and cytochrome c oxidase. Malonaldehyde or lipid peroxides were not detected in photoinactivated cells. <b>Photoinactivation</b> was prevented (i) under anaerobic conditions, (ii) {{in the presence of}} methanol, allylthiourea, thiosemicarbazide, hydroxylamine, ethylxanthate, or CO at concentrations wich caused 100 % inhibition of ammonia oxidation, and (iii) at concentrations of ammonia or hydroxylamine which gave a rapid rate of nitrite production.

40|$|AbstractThe {{photodynamic}} {{activity of}} sulfonated aluminum phthalocyanines (AlPcSn, 1 ≤n≤ 4) {{was found to}} correlate with their affinity for membrane lipids. Adsorbing {{to the surface of}} large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), aluminum phthalocyanine disulfonate induced the highest changes in their electrophoretic mobility. AlPcS 2 was also most efficient in mediating <b>photoinactivation</b> of gramicidin channels, as revealed by measurements of the electric current across planar lipid bilayers. The increase in the degree of sulfonation of phthalocyanine progressively reduced its affinity for the lipid bilayer as well as its potency of sensitizing gramicidin channel <b>photoinactivation.</b> The portion of photoinactivated gramicidin channels, α, increased with rising photosensitizer concentration up to some optimum. The concentration at which α was at half-maximum amounted to 80 nM, 30 nM, 200 nM, and 2 μM for AlPcS 1, AlPcS 2, AlPcS 3, and AlPcS 4, respectively. At high concentrations α was found to decrease, which was attributed to quenching of reactive oxygen species and self-quenching of the photosensitizer triplet state by its ground state. Fluoride anions were observed to inhibit both AlPcSn (2 ≤n≤ 4) binding to LUVs and sensitized <b>photoinactivation</b> of gramicidin channels. It is concluded that photosensitizer binding to membrane lipids is a prerequisite for the photodynamic inactivation of gramicidin channels...|$|E
