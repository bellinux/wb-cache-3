Inside the room was 12 envelopes, and each houseguest could only claim one envelope.

Document handling within logistics, supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi-automatically using bar code scanners, software and tabletop laser printers. There are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed wallet/pouch to the shipping container (usually a flexible polybag or corrugated fiberboard/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and Identity Theft are major concerns, especially {{with the increase of}} e-Commerce, Internet/Online shopping and Shopping channel (other, past references are catalogue and mail order shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time.
