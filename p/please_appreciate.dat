Comments and {{feedbacks}} would be greatly <b>appreciated.</b> <b>Please</b> contact the author {{for the latest}} version. Extending the L 1 -IV estimator proposed by Sakata (1997, 2007), we develop a method, named the ρτ-IV estimator, to estimate structural equations based on the conditional quantile restriction imposed on the error terms. We study its asymptotic behavior and show how to make statistical inferences on the regression parameters. Given practical importance of weak identification, a highlight of the paper is proposal of a test robust to the weak identification. The statistics used in our method {{can be viewed as}} a natural counterpart of the Anderson and Rubin’s (1949) statistic in the ρτ-IV estimation. As is the case for the Anderson-Rubin test in the standard IV regression, our test can have a low power, when there many instruments excluded from the regression equation. We show how we could avoid such problem 1 by taking for instruments a small number of linear combinations of all available instruments that are suitably selected based on data. ...|$|R

We found that in all countries the average annual growth rate of energy productivity is significantly lower than the growth rate of labour productivity and in contrast to patterns of total factor productivity where the USA is the leading country, the USA performs on average in Manufacturing while in Transport, Services and Agriculture the USA face an energy productivity disadvantage to most other OECD countries.

However, the distribution or {{concentration of the}} benefits in subgroups {{of the population is}} unknown. In this paper, the question of differential welfare impacts, across and within gender, post democratic reform in Nigeria is explored. I test two null hypotheses. First, there is no disparity in the income and returns to education benefits of democratic reform across gender in Nigeria. Second, there are no within gender disparities in the impact of democratic reform on in-come and returns to education in Nigeria. From the results, both null hypotheses are rejected.

Brown 2 Abstract The decision to deploy military assets and personnel onto the territory of another sovereign state is among the most enduring and widely studied aspects of international politics. Yet, the equally important and arguably more risky policy decision to host a foreign military presence has received comparatively little scholarly attention. To address this gap in the literature, this paper poses two questions. First, under what conditions are potential host state leaders more or less likely to agree to enter into strategic access negotiations and to host a foreign military presence? Second, once in negotiations, what do potential host state leaders bargain and negotiate for, and ultimately agree to? To gain traction on these questions, this article constructs a domestic politics model of foreign policy decision-making. Drawing on insights from selectorate theory...|$|R

Brown and Marcum- 2 -An important corollary to integrating domestic politics into international relations theory is the increased emphasis placed on political leaders in rationalist analyses of foreign policy. With few exceptions, these theoretical works suppose an unquestioned assumption about the motivations of political leaders: namely, that they seek to gain and retain political office. 1 The importance of the proposition leads Randolph Siverson and Bruce Bueno de Mesquita to argue that this “venerable axiom of political analysis ” is the “linchpin ” connecting domestic and international politics. 2 Many scholars of American politics, however, have questioned the venerability and dominance of the office-seeking proposition, indicating the existence of alternative and equally plausible policy- and profit-seeking motivations. 3 Despite increasing calls for greater integration and cross-fertilization among the subfields of American, comparative, and international politics,...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{reported}} {{of the performance}} and attainment of 32 students from overseas studying elementary Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) in a Chinese university. With an AB-BA design, {{they were asked to}} use two forms of writing media to present two essays: one a word-processed essay entitled “My Favourite Female” and the other a conventional hand-written essay entitled “My Favourite Male”. The essays were marked by experienced Chinese language experts and the learners’ impression of using each type of writing medium was gathered via questionnaires and interviews. Inferential statistics showed that the students performed significantly better when using a word-processor, and they thought that completing writing tasks using pencil-and-paper and word-processors were markedly different. Most of them felt that their work was more professional when produced on a word-processor. A small number of students considered that writing by hand in Chinese was aesthetically <b>pleasing,</b> but they <b>appreciated</b> the convenience of writing in words spelled and written correctly by the computer. Inter-marker consistency was more homogeneous for essays written on the computer. In conclusion, word-processors are suggested as the preferred writing medium for beginning learners of CFL...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} (QM) {{has attracted}} {{a considerable amount of}} mysticism, in public opinion and even among academic researches, due to some of its conceptually puzzling features, such as the modification of reality by the observer and entanglement. We argue that many popular "quantum paradoxes" stem from a confusion between mathematical formalism and physics; We demonstrate this by explaining how the paradoxes go away once a different formalism, usually inconvenient to perform calculations, is used. we argue that some modern developments, well-studied in the research literature but generally overlooked by both popular science and teaching-level literature, make quantum mechanics (that is, "canonical" QM, not extensions of it) less conceptually problematic than it looks at first sight. When all this is looked at together, most "conceptual puzzles" of QM are not much different from the well-known paradoxes from probability theory. Consequently, "explanations of QM" involving physical action of consciouses or an infinity of universes are conceptually unnecessaryComment: This article, written as a result of many debates with academic colleagues and non-academic friends, expresses the author's view of quantum mechanics and its interpretation.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} impact of home country’s economic status on immigrant self-employment probability in the U. S. We estimate a probability model and find that, consistent across race, immigrants from developed countries {{are more likely to}} be self-employed in the U. S than are immigrants from developing countries. This result is unexpected given previous re-search which suggests that immigrants from countries with high levels of self-employment tend to be more involved in self-employment in the U. S. Developing countries, on average, have higher self-employment rates than do developed countries but our research shows that immigrants from developing countries have similar or lower self-employment probabilities relative to that of na-tive born White-Americans. In contrast, immigrants from developed countries have significantly higher self-employment probabilities relative to that of native born White-Americans. We pro-vide evidence that this result cannot be explained by differences in wealth or savings of imigrant. Instead, we hypothesize that institutional arrangements in the developed world may be similar across countries allowing immigrants from developed countries to have an informational or rele-vant skill advantage over immigrants from developing countries. This informational or skill ad-vantage makes it easier for immigrants from developed countries to transition to self-employment in the U. S.

We develop an analytical model which illustrates how producers make decisions on long-term investment and short-term input use, and clarifies {{the relationship between these}} choices. From the empiri-cal analysis, we find that including the indirect effects of water price changes on output and technology choices, as well as the direct effect of improved water management leads to a significantly more elastic estimate of water demand than found in previous work. The estima-tion results provide a direct measurement of the conservation benefits of investment in precision irrigation technology, which can be as high as 35 percent. ∗The author would like to thank David Sunding for invaluable support of this work, and the Giannini Foundation for financial support of this project.
