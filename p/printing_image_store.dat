40|$|International audienceIn Visual Cryptography, several images, called "shadow images", that {{separately}} {{contain no}} information, are overlapped {{to reveal a}} shared secret message. We develop a method to digitally register one <b>printed</b> shadow <b>image</b> acquired by a camera with a purely digital shadow <b>image,</b> <b>stored</b> in memory. Using Fourier techniques derived from Fourier Optics concepts, {{the idea is to}} enhance and exploit the quasi periodicity of the shadow images, composed by a random distribution of black and white patterns on a periodic sampling grid. The advantage is to speed up the security control or the access time to the message, in particular in the cases of a small pixel size or of large numbers of pixels. Furthermore, the interest of visual cryptography can be increased by embedding the initial message in two shadow images that do not have identical mathematical supports, making manual registration impractical. Experimental results demonstrate the successful operation of the method, including the possibility to directly project the result onto the <b>printed</b> shadow <b>image...</b>|$|R

50|$|Controlling {{the print}} size {{and quality of}} digital images {{requires}} {{an understanding of the}} pixels-per-inch (ppi) variable that is <b>stored</b> in the <b>image</b> file and sometimes used to control the size of the <b>printed</b> <b>image.</b> Within Adobe Photoshop's Image Size dialog, the image editor allows the user to manipulate both pixel dimensions {{and the size of the}} <b>image</b> on the <b>printed</b> document. These parameters work together to produce a <b>printed</b> <b>image</b> of the desired size and quality. Pixels per inch of the image, pixel per inch of the computer monitor, and dots per inch on the printed document are related, but in use are very different. The Image Size dialog can be used as an image calculator of sorts. For example, a 1600 × 1200 image with a resolution of 200 ppi will produce a <b>printed</b> <b>image</b> of 8 × 6 inches. The same image with 400 ppi will produce a <b>printed</b> <b>image</b> of 4 × 3 inches. Change the resolution to 800 ppi, and the same <b>image</b> now <b>prints</b> out at 2 × 1.5 inches. All three <b>printed</b> <b>images</b> contain the same data (1600 × 1200 pixels), but the pixels are closer together on the smaller prints, so the smaller images will potentially look sharp when the larger ones do not. The quality of the image will also depend on the capability of the printer.|$|R

Specially surfaced plastic sheets can be laminated over a <b>printed</b> <b>image</b> to allow them to be safely written upon, such as with dry erase markers or chalk. Multiple translucent <b>printed</b> <b>images</b> may be laminated in layers to achieve certain visual effects or to hold holographic <b>images.</b> Many <b>printing</b> businesses that do commercial lamination keep a variety of laminates on hand, as the process for bonding many types is generally similar when working with arbitrarily thin material.|$|R

To demonstrate the technology and test its usability, we implemented several applications and performed a user evaluation.
