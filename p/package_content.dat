This included prioritizing the targeted nutrient intake and offering recommendations for specific changes to the WIC food packages. To do this, the committee was charged with making recommendations that were “culturally suitable, non-burdensome to administration, efficient for nationwide distribution and vendor checkout, and cost-neutral.” [...] These recommendations were implemented in the form of supplemental foods that would counteract the deficiencies and excesses of the WIC food package within the bounds of cost and cultural requirements.This change to the food package was done again in 2009, which put the food package in compliance with the 2005 Dietary Guideline for Americans. This change introduced an inclusion of cash-value vouchers for fruits, vegetables, whole-wheat bread, corn or whole-wheat tortillas, brown rice, oats, bulgur, and barley. Milk purchase options were also altered to only include lower-fat milk for all women and all children over 2 years of age. The adjustment in the food package had a significant effect on participant nutrition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the distribution of}} live and scheduled multimedia content (e. g., radio or TV broadcasts) through multiple aggregators. An aggregator is an access-controlled redistributor that operates a pool of proxy servers to aggregate content from source content providers and forward it to mobile hosts. Aggregators <b>package</b> <b>content</b> into channels (e. g., BBC 9 o’clock news) and offer them at various quality levels (e. g., using different encodings) and prices. Mobile hosts receive channels via a ‘beyond 3 G ’ wireless Internet, which consists {{of different types of}} wireless networks (e. g., 802. 11 and UMTS networks). In this paper, we investigate how a mobile host can switch to another aggregator and an associated quality level while it is receiving a channel. This situation can for instance occur when a mobile host roams into a (different type of) wireless network through which a new aggregator is available, or when the mobil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Streaming media content {{providers}} face {{a variety}} of adver-saries. At the large scale at which they operate, they can justify defense in breadth: different techniques against different adversaries. Existing analysis techniques awkwardly handle questions about a distribution of adversaries against an evolving series of protocols. Contemporary streaming-media protocols eschew full-stream DRM in favor of token-based authentication {{at the start of}} each connection. Very recent protocols from several vendors <b>package</b> <b>content</b> in chunks of a few seconds each, rather than a stream continuing for an entire film or live event. Practical attackers work by copy and paste of these authentication tokens, sharing URLs to pay-per-view content in chat rooms or web forums. Others use “deep links ” to chunks or lists of chunks to view freely available media in ways that violate the wishes of the providers. Accidental behaviors of so-called transparent proxies similarly violate the goals of the providers. We formalize these attacker descriptions in terms of an adversary who can only comprehend some tags in a tagged-concatenation Strand Spaces model. We use this model to show how current streaming protections work and fail, and suggest directions for new streaming media protocols. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding or comprehending {{source code}} {{is one of}} the core {{activities}} of software engineering. Understanding object-oriented source code is essential and required when a programmer maintains, migrates, reuses, documents or enhances source code. The source code that is not comprehended cannot be changed. The comprehension of object-oriented source code is a difficult problem solving process. In order to document object-oriented software system there are needs to understand its source code. To do so, it is necessary to mine source code dependencies in addition to quantitative information in source code such as the number of classes. This paper proposes an automatic approach, which aims to document object-oriented software by visualizing its source code. The design of the object-oriented source code and its main characteristics are represented in the visualization. <b>Package</b> <b>content,</b> class information, relationships between classes, dependencies between methods and software metrics is displayed. The extracted views are very helpful to understand and document the object-oriented software. The novelty of this approach is the exploiting of code dependencies and quantitative information in source code to document object-oriented software efficiently by means of a set of graphs. To validate the approach, it has been applied to several case studies. The results of this evaluation showed that most of the object-oriented software systems have been documented correctly...|$|E
