40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect that {{changing}} demographic patterns have had on the household saving rate in China.

40|$|There {{is no more}} {{important}} issue in {{the economics of the}} family than the impact of parents on the behavior of their children. By providing rewards and imposing constraints, parents seek to affect their children’s behavior. The explanation of these actions is that the child’s conduct directly enters into the <b>parent’s</b> <b>utility</b> function. In this paper, we use that framework to explore the role of parental control over his or her child’s delinquent behavior. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we estimate the impact of family income and various dimensions of family structure on a youth’s contact with the criminal justice system between the ages of 14 and 22. From this analysis, we conclude that the single most important factor affecting these measures of delinquency is the presence of his father in the home.

40|$|On {{the issue}} of women's status, the {{objectives}} of this paper are twofold. First, it attempts to make precise some of the claims and allegations regarding the existence of bias against females in the allocation of resources within the household. The idea is to formulate these questions explicitly, {{so that it is}} possible to identify whether and to what degree there is evidence of this bias. Second, it identifies causes of this bias with the objective of isolating key factors that can be used for policy. In contrast to earlier studies that attemptto account for male-female differences in human capital, the authors do not assume any discrimination against females either at home (in the <b>parent's</b> <b>utility</b> function) or in the market (in the returns to human capital). It is assumed, however, that women have a comparative advantage in working in some sectors of the economy. Thus, increases in the shares of these sectors will increase the demand for female human capital. This explicit attention to factors that can be used as policy instruments [...] and the relative neglect of factors reflecting gender bias in tastes [...] is the point of departure from earlier literature. This paper develops the theory, tests the hypotheses, and concludes with a discussion of the policy implications.

40|$|Standard homo economicus {{lives in}} a world of {{complete}} markets and maximizes utility which is a function of his personal consumption. This approximation cannot account for parents making transfers to adult children, children taking care of old parents, nor for gifts, inheritance and many other services exchanged within families. Such behavior can be derived from three main mechanisms. Firstly, in the so-called pure altruism model, the <b>parent's</b> <b>utility</b> is augmented by the utility of his child. This leads to transfers from the parent to his child. An important feature of this model is the strong property of redistributive neutrality: since parents and child pool their income, any government transfer to one will be undone by the other adjusting his transfer. In a second model, altruism is impure as the parents want the child to behave in a certain way: exchange and strategic considerations enter the picture, as both parents' and child's income become endogenous. Thirdly, in a non-altruistic setting, with imperfect credit market, transfers to children and to old parents correspond to a reciprocity contract and are an investment for old age. Families embody long term and widespread commitments: born as a needy child, one becomes a parent and ultimately a (perhaps) needy grandparent. Moreover for much of what is exchanged within families, there is no market substitute. These features explain why the network of reciprocities can be large both in time and space, why those transfers change but do not disappear as market or public insurance develop, and why displacing them can have perverse side effects. Family transfers influence intra- and inter-generational inequality, hence the importance to assess their motivation. Tests usually conclude that the income pooling predicted by pure altruism is not observed, but family transfers are also far from being entirely motivated by direct exchange considerations. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the issue of why some parent {{companies}} of U. S. electric utilities have expanded into domestic independent power production (IPP) but not others. We evaluate the conjecture that the parent companies who have chosen to participate in recently restructured U. S. wholesale electricity markets are those with the most generation cost advantages. Specifically, we empirically investigate the link between apparent advantages in two types of generation costs, operation & maintenance (O&M) and capital, and the IPP participation decision. We use electric utility data from FERC Form 1 and combine it with IPP data collected from various industry sources. The data is analyzed using both a descriptive approach and the estimation of a simple competitive entry model. The results indicate that <b>utility</b> <b>parent</b> companies that expand into domestic IPP do tend to have much lower reported utility generation O&M costs.

40|$|We {{simulate}} a two-sectoral, three-period OLG-model with endogenous fertility and endogenous education. <b>Parents</b> receive <b>utility</b> from {{quantity and quality}} (education) of their offspring, generating a trade-off between the former and the latter. Since education governs efficiency in production, hence wage income and growth, labour supply and education per child increase and fertility declines dur- ing the process of economic development. Therefore, the model is able to explain the recent fertility decline, in all developed countries, and to single out the determinants for long-run growth in per capita terms. The transition speed towards the steady state is governed by {{the growth rate of}} the wage rate, which in turn depends on education investments and fertility of previous generations, leading to an intergenerational persistence in these variables. Due to this effect, social discrimination in the education sector leads to high fertility and low education in the low-income percentiles, while the opposite is true for the upper ones. Hence, the average level of education declines and hinders growth. ...|$|R
