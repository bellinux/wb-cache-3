5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> have been proposed, {{sometimes}} in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
25|$|Research on 'protective factors', {{which are}} {{characteristics}} of children or situations that particularly help {{children in the}} context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents). Children who have <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.|$|E

25|$|The use of strength-duration curves was {{developed}} in the 1930s, followed by the use of threshold current measurements for the study of human axonal excitability in the 1970s. Use of these methods in toxic neuropathies has enabled researchers to designate <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> for many peripheral nerve disorders, and several diseases of the central nervous system (see Clinical Significance).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the onset}} of the {{research}} on resilience, researchers have been devoted to discovering the <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> that explain people’s adaptation to adverse conditions, such as maltreatment, catastrophic life events, or urban poverty. The focus of empirical work then has been shifted to understand the underlying protective processes. Researchers endeavor to uncover how some factors (e.g. connection to family) may contribute to positive outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Longitudinal {{research}} studies have recently conducted genetic analyses of centenarians and their offspring to identify biomarkers as <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> against {{the negative effects}} of aging. In particular, the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene is linked to prevention of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, valine CETP homozygotes but not heterozygotes experienced a relative 51% less decline in memory compared to a reference group after adjusting for demographic factors and APOE status.|$|E
30|$|In {{the last}} year of primary school, peer support was the strongest {{protective}} predictor of wellbeing, while feeling less connected and less safe at school predicted mental wellbeing. Feeling safe at school was the strongest <b>protective</b> <b>factor</b> for student wellbeing {{in the first year of}} secondary school. In the second year of secondary school, peer support was the strongest <b>protective</b> <b>factor</b> for mental wellbeing, while feeling safe at school, feeling connected to school and having support from peers were predictive of emotional wellbeing.|$|R

DQA1*05:01, DQB1*02:01, and DRB1*03:01 alleles were identified as risk factors, while DQA1*02:01, DQA1*03:01 and DQB1*05:01 alleles {{were found to be}} <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> for the disease. The relationship between alleles and specific race was also established. HLA-DQ2 and HLA-B8 are generally found in Caucasian patients, while HLA-DR5 is related to Greek and Israeli patients. Multiple genome-wide association scans may be conducted in the future to identify key risk variants.|$|E
25|$|However, trauma differs between individuals, {{according}} to their subjective experiences. People will react to similar events differently. In other words, not all people who experience a potentially traumatic event will actually become psychologically traumatized. This discrepancy in risk rate {{can be attributed to}} <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> some individuals may have that enable them to cope with trauma, they are related to temperamental and environmental factors. Some examples are mild exposure to stress early in life, resilience characteristics, and active seeking of help.|$|E
25|$|Vicarious trauma affects workers being 'witnesses' {{to their}} clients' trauma. It {{is more likely}} to occur in {{situations}} where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and 'seeing oneself' in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms. May also result if we are witness to situations that happen in the course of our work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes, etc). Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of seeking <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.|$|E

30|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} year of {{secondary}} school, safety at school and connectedness were significant predictors of mental wellbeing (Table  2). Somewhat similar to the primary school results, school connectedness was the most significant <b>protective</b> <b>factor</b> against depression (β = − 3.14), whereas feeling safe at school was the most significant <b>protective</b> <b>factor</b> against anxiety (β = − 4.01) and stress (β = − 2.97). School connectedness was protective for all emotional difficulties subscales. However, feeling safe at school was most protective against emotional symptoms (β = − 0.74) and conduct problems (β = − 0.61).|$|R

25|$|The idea of '{{resilience}} building' is debatably at {{odds with}} the concept of resilience as a process, since it is used to imply that it is a developable characteristic of oneself. Those who view resilience as a description of doing well despite adversity, view efforts of 'resilience building' as method to encourage resilience. Bibliotherapy, positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building. In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.|$|E
25|$|Suppression of ovulation, {{which would}} {{otherwise}} cause {{damage to the}} ovarian epithelium and, consequently, inflammation, is generally protective. This effect {{can be achieved by}} having children, taking combined oral contraceptives, and breast feeding, all of which are <b>protective</b> <b>factors.</b> A longer period of breastfeeding correlates with a larger decrease in the risk of ovarian cancer. Each birth decreases risk of ovarian cancer more, and this effect is seen with up to five births. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 50%, and the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives can last 25–30 years after they are discontinued. Regular use of aspirin or acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer; other NSAIDs do not seem to have a similar protective effect.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, intense {{feelings}} of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may {{always seem to}} be present, {{as much as it is}} actually present and experienced from past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or flashbacks may haunt the person, and nightmares may be frequent. Insomnia may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generations, thus making genetics as one of the components of the causes of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.|$|E

500|$|According to Zeanah, [...] "ethological {{attachment}} theory, {{as outlined}} by John Bowlby ... 1969 to 1980 ... has provided {{one of the}} most important frameworks for understanding crucial risk and <b>protective</b> <b>factors</b> in social and emotional development in the first 3 years of life. Bowlby's (1951) monograph, Maternal Care and Mental Health, reviewed the world literature on maternal deprivation and suggested that emotionally available caregiving was crucial for infant development and mental health." [...] Beyond that broad statement, which is now generally accepted, little remains of the underlying detail of Bowlby's theory of maternal deprivation that has not been either discredited or superseded by attachment theory and other child development theories and research, except in the area of extreme deprivation.|$|E

50|$|Other {{theories}} {{that may explain}} this difference include <b>protective</b> or predisposing <b>factors</b> in men or women that may render them more (or less) susceptible to the disease {{at different points in}} life.

40|$|Studies of the {{relationship}} of <b>protective</b> serum <b>factor</b> to cellular resistance and to tuberculin skin sensitivity have demonstrated that <b>protective</b> serum <b>factor</b> may exist independently of a high level of cellular resistance, and that both <b>protective</b> <b>factor</b> and cellular resistance may be demonstrable without a concomitant hypersensitivity of the delayed type. The experiments with absorbed sera and the globulin fraction of immune serum indicated no specific association of <b>protective</b> serum <b>factor</b> with antibody globulin. The <b>protective</b> <b>factor</b> in immune serum was found to be thermostable and non-dialyzable. In vitro exposure of virulent tubercle bacilli to the immune serum from BCG-immunized animals failed to alter the bacterial capacity for destruction of monocytes and for intracellular proliferation. In vitro cultivation of normal and immune monocytes in normal or immune serum was not effective in changing the native susceptibility or resistance of these cells. Effective manifestation of resistance to virulent tubercle bacilli by immune monocytes was found to require the continuous presence of immune serum. The intracellular passage of virulent tubercle bacilli in an immune system (immune monocytes cultivated in immune serum) resulted in a decreased bacterial potential for destruction of normal monocytes when these were cultivated in the presence of immune serum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: How {{to protect}} the {{endangered}} languages is a typical and important social problem around the world. Now, the existing social computational models of language evolution are generally short of language endangerment warning and language recovery. These two parts are very important for language evolution. In this paper, an artificial society is culti-vated based on multi-agents with purpose of observing language endangerment and its recovery phenomenon. In view of endangerment factor of population language, resilience inner <b>protective</b> <b>factor</b> and resilience composite <b>protective</b> <b>factor,</b> corresponding social computational model is given. From experimental results {{we can see that}} the computational model draws the endangerment trend of the weaker one in the language competition and the recovery process of weaker endan-gered language under the effect of resilience composite <b>protective</b> <b>factor.</b> To break through research bottleneck for high cost of language endangerment experiment in real society, the proposed computational model is working in an artificial society. The introduction of artificial society plays an important and practical role in the design and evaluation of endan-gered language protection scheme...|$|R
