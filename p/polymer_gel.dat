50|$|A {{significant}} {{development in}} the field of gel dosimetry occurred when results of using an alternative <b>polymer</b> <b>gel</b> dosimeter formulation were published by Fong et al in 2001. This new type of <b>polymer</b> <b>gel</b> dosimeter, known as MAGIC gel, bound atmospheric oxygen in a metallo-organic complex thus removing the problem of oxygen inhibition and enabling polymer gels to be manufactured on the bench-top in the laboratory. This created what was to be known as a normoxic gel dosimeter, compared with the previous PAG formulation which subsequently became known as a hypoxic gel dosimeter. The MAGIC <b>polymer</b> <b>gel</b> formulation consisted of methacrylic acid, ascorbic acid, gelatine and copper. The principal behind the MAGIC gel is in the ascorbic acid oxygen scavenger. Ascorbic acid binds free oxygen contained within the aqueous gelatine matrix into metallo-organic complexes and this process is initiated by copper sulphate. It was subsequently shown by De Deene et al in 2002 that other antioxidants could be used in the manufacture of normoxic gels including tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride, having first been suggested to Baldock by Billingham in 1996. Numerous authors subsequently published results of work investigating different compositions and formulations of normoxic <b>polymer</b> <b>gel</b> dosimeters and were summarised by Senden.

A series of functional amine reagents, including N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (DMEDA), N,N-diethylethylenediamine (DEEDA), morpholine, 3 -morpholinopropylamine (MPPA) and tetrahydrofurfurylamine (THFA), were chosen as functional amines to produce <b>polymer</b> <b>gels</b> containing environmentally sensitive species. 13 C solid-state NMR and FTIR spectroscopic measurements conﬁrmed complete {{conversion of the}} reactive scaffolds. pH-dependent swelling behavior at ambient temperature was observed in DMEDA-, DEE-DA- and MPPA-modiﬁed hydrogels.

40|$|Many <b>polymer</b> <b>gels</b> undergo reversible, {{discontinuous}} volume {{changes in}} response {{to changes in the}} balance between repulsive intermolecular forces that act to expand the polymer network and attractive forces that act to shrink it. Repulsive forces are usually electrostatic or hydrophobic in nature, whereas attraction is mediated by hydrogen bonding or van der Waals interactions. The competition between these counteracting forces, and hence the gel volume(1 - 3), can thus be controlled by subtle changes in parameters such as pH (ref. 4), temperature(5), solvent composition(6) or gel composition(7). Here we describe a more direct influence on this balance of forces, by showing that the radiation force generated by a focused laser beam induces reversible shrinkage in <b>polymer</b> <b>gels.</b> Control experiments confirm that the laser-induced volume phase transitions are due to radiation forces, rather than local heating, modifying the weak interactions in the gels, in agreement with previous observations of light-induced chain association in polymer solutions(8, 9).

50|$|In 1992 a new gel {{dosimetry}} formulation {{was proposed}} by Maryanski et al, {{which was based}} on the polymerisation of acrylamide and N,N’-methylene-bis-acrylamide (bis) monomers infused in an aqueous agarose matrix. This system was given the acronym BANANA due {{to the use of the}} chemical components (bis, acrylamide, nitrous oxide and agarose). This type of gel dosimeter did not have the associated diffusion problem of Fricke gels and was shown to have a relatively stable post-irradiation dose distribution. The polymerisation reaction occurred by cross-linking of the monomers induced by the free radical products of water radiolysis. In 1994 the BANANA formulation was refined by replacing agarose with gelatine and given the acronym BANG (bis, acrylamide, nitrogen and aqueous gelatine), the first of a series of new <b>polymer</b> <b>gel</b> formulations. In 1994 this formulation was patented and became commercially available through MGS Research Inc. as BANG®.

40|$|In {{preparation}} of gelant solution for making crosslinked <b>polymer</b> <b>gels</b> for water shutoff applications unpublished experiments plus chemical intuition suggest that, unless hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymer is fully hydrated before addition of crosslinker, the final gel will have lower than optimum mechanical strength. It is suggested so because polymer chains {{need to be}} unfolded before proper crosslinking can occur. We have evaluated gel strengths of ?flowing? gels for water shut off in natural fractures and other non-matrix features {{as a function of}} time of addition of crosslinker relative to time of hydration of <b>polymer.</b> <b>Gels</b> were prepared from moderately high molecular weight HPAM crosslinked with chromium(III) acetate (CrAc) or polyethyleneimine (PEI). Crosslinker was added after either (1) initial wetting of solid polymer particles or (2) complete hydration of polymer. HPAM can be purchased as a fine particulate hydrocarbon slurry or as a solution concentrate, either of which, when diluted into makeup water, rapidly provides fully hydrated polymer solution. However, dry HPAM is often preferred because of lower overall cost of active material and smaller storage footprint than slurry or liquid concentrates. The down side of using the solid product is that it generally requires two or more large blending tanks in order to fully hydrate polymer for large volume gel treatments. However, if conditions exist where crosslinker can be added to wetted but not fully hydrated polymer, then dry polymer and crosslinker can be blended in a small continuous flow unit, with full hydration occurring downhole prior to gelation. Gel strengths were determined using a common qualitative coding system for gels prepared in identical manner except for timing of crosslinker addition. Crosslinker was added immediately after wetting of polymer or after polymer had been agitated until complete hydration. Samples were prepared in fresh water or 4 % NaCl brine and at ambient temperature or 122 ?F. For almost all samples of <b>polymer</b> <b>gels</b> prepared with identical concentrations of HPAM and CrAc, there was no observable difference in gel strength regardless of time of addition of crosslinker. HPAM/CrAc <b>polymer</b> <b>gels</b> with 4 wt% NaCl make up water were lower in strength by one code level with respect to those prepared with fresh water. For <b>polymer</b> <b>gels</b> hydrated at 122 ?F with 4 wt% NaCl there was no gel strength code level difference with respect to those prepared at ambient temperature with 4 wt% NaCl. For HPAM/PEI <b>polymer</b> <b>gels</b> the majority of the samples showed similar gel strengths regardless of the timing of crosslinker addition. A few <b>polymer</b> <b>gels</b> showed weaker gel strengths when prepared from partially hydrated polymer solution before crosslinker addition. Presence of 4 wt% NaCl in the makeup water gave weaker gel strengths than those prepared with fresh water with an average difference of four code levels. The pre-gel viscosity of a polymer solution was also compared to the timing of crosslinker addition at ambient temperature. For HPAM/PEI system the overall polymer solution viscosity decreased when PEI was added whereas for HPAM/CrAc system the polymer solution viscosity remained similar after crosslinker was added to the completely hydrated polymer solution but increased when crosslinker was added to partially hydrated polymer solution. The most significant result of this work is the demonstration that for most field applications optimum quality gel can be obtained using dry polymer and a small continuous mixing system for initial wetting of the polymer after which the crosslinker can be added to the polymer solution on the fly. This practice can decrease the footprint, equipment requirements and labor and thus the cost of large volume flowing gel treatments...|$|R
