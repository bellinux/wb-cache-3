25|$|The zipper is {{a popular}} device for {{temporarily}} joining two edges of fabric. Zippers are found on trousers, jeans, jackets, and luggage. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American mechanical engineer from Chicago {{who was the first}} to invent, conceive of the idea, and to construct a workable zipper. Using a hook-and-eye device, Judson intended for this earliest form of the zipper to be used on shoes. He also conceived the idea <b>of</b> the <b>slide</b> <b>fastener</b> mechanism in conjunction with the invention of the zipper. Patents were issued to Judson for the zipper in 1891, 1894, and 1905.|$|R

40|$|A {{strategy}} to regulate unstable processes using a modified Smith predictor based sliding mode controller (SP-SMC) is illustrated. The proposed scheme presents disturbance rejection and optimal control input usage with overall improved regulatory performances. The unstable process with time delay is first estimated using a simple measurement of limit cycle output {{obtained from a}} modified relay experiment. Then this paper extends a work on SP-SMC for unstable processes, which leads to significant improvements in its regulatory capacities of reference inputs and disturbances. A new control law is incorporated in the discontinuous <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> mode control such that the overall performance improves significantly. The metaheuristic search algorithm with some modifications has been implemented successfully to satisfy the new control performance index. The robustness of the controller is also tested under the process uncertainty.

Much {{of the collection}} consists of family photographs, but also includes various identification, official and educational documentation as well as statements from employers, family correspondence, notes and an essay. Grace Polk Family Collection, AR 25104 Harry Polk (originally Hans Günther Pollak) was born on May 3, 1894 in Vienna, Austria. His parents were Hugo Pollak (1866 - 1935) and Thekla Pollak (née Lichtenstadt; 1871 - 1939). During World War I, Harry served in the Austrian Army and was held as a Prisoner of War in Siberia until 1921. After his release, {{he worked for the}} Ephrussi Bank in the Stocks and Bonds Division. In 1936, he married Elizabeth Sofer. The couple left Austria in 1938 for London and then for New York. While in the United States, Harry worked for the Waldes Company in Long Island City, a manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>slide</b> <b>fasteners</b> with branches in Vienna and Prague, until his retirement in 1964. He separated from his wife the same year and began to travel, finally settling in Austria. Harry Polk died in Vienna on August 24, 1983. Elizabeth Sofer was born in Vienna on March 23, 1902 to parents Julius Sofer (1871 - 1957) and Katharina Skalla Sofer (1864 - 1944). She worked for her father at the Waldes Koh-i-noor Company in Vienna. Elizabeth was a dancer and a member of several modern dance companies. Like her husband, she first worked for the Waldes branch in New York. In 1957, she began to work as a dance therapist at the Lexington School for the Deaf in New York City, and in 1958 co-founded the National Dance Teacher's Guild. From 1960 to 1982, she was a staff member at the Children's Center for Creative Arts at Adelphi University. She specialized in working with handicapped and emotionally disturbed children. In 1966, she co-founded the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA). In 1995, Elizabeth was honored with a lifetime achievement award from the ADTA and noted as a chief pioneer in the field of dance and movement therapy. She died on October 29, 2001 in New York. Julius Sofer (Elizabeth Polk's father) was a manufacturers' representative at the Waldes Koh-i-noor Company in Vienna. His connections to the American branch of the Waldes Company helped him to obtain affidavits and visas for the Polks and other members of their family. In 1938, Julius Sofer transferred to the export department of Waldes in Prague and then immigrated to Cuba in 1941. His wife Katharina Sofer stayed behind in Vienna and died there in 1944. Julius finally arrived in the United States in 1943 and lived with the Polk family until his death in 1957. Processeddigitize...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Tjarnardalir {{landslide}} {{is located}} in the Almenningar area, in the outermost <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Skagafjordur fjord, in central north Iceland. The landslide is a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> extensive <b>sliding</b> area on {{the eastern side of the}} fjord. The Tjarnardalir landslide originally fell as a rockslide from the western side of the Manarfjall Mountain. The front of the landslide reaches the present coast, forming up to 60 m high coastal cliffs that show clear indications of extensive coastal erosion. Geomorphological indications show that the landslide mass has a constant westward movement towards the sea, with mean rate up to 69, 2 cm/year. The strati-graphical record confirms that glaciomarine fine grained (silt/fine sand) sediments underlie the sliding material. Groundwater, which penetrates through the coarse landslide material, stops on the fine grained material and thus forms a sliding plain. It is assumed that the main <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sliding</b> movement takes place on this boundary. There is a clear correlation between the landslide movement and weather conditions. The main sliding movement occurs during the snowmelt period and during the autumn rain period. It is suspected that extensive costal erosion also plays a role in the sliding movement, but the erosion rate is not known. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate that the moisture content in the debris mass is high, which indicates extensive ground water flow...|$|R

25|$|The 'slide', {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} trombone (cf. valve trombone), allows the player to extend {{the length of the}} air column, lowering the pitch.

Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process <b>of</b> the inner <b>slide</b> tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the <b>slide</b> must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend).

40|$|Abstract. The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) composites reinforced with carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) were studied. Sliding tests in a pin-on-disk configuration {{were used to}} study the tribological properties. The wear rate of reinforced composites in the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> was {{lower than that of}} PPS but over extended sliding the reinforcement was not effective in reducing the wear rate. The coefficient of friction was not greatly affected by the presence of CNF and CNT.

Intorduction The reinforcement of polyners with glass, carbon, and aramid fibers has proven to be very beneficial in terms of the improved physical, mechanical, and tribological properties[l- 3]. It has led to the wide use of these composites in industry. Dong et al.
