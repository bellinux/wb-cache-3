25|$|<b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> is {{a system}} {{designed}} by Kodak for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the Beige Book and conform to the CD-ROM XA and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> players and any computer with the suitable software irrespective of the operating system. The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format {{is not to be}} confused with Kodak Picture CD, which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.|$|E
25|$|Compact disc (CD) is {{a digital}} optical disc data storage format {{released}} in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for {{storage of data}} (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), <b>Photo</b> <b>CD,</b> PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. The first commercially available Audio CD player, the Sony CDP-101, was released October 1982 in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Games {{are stored}} on {{standard}} dual-layer DVD-ROMs with 6.8GB on the older XGD2 (Xbox Game Disc 2), but the newer XGD3 discs contain 7.8GB of usable space available for game content. The option {{to apply a}} regional lockout to games is available to publishers, although DVD region codes are always enforced for movies. Microsoft has implemented methods to prevent hacking through the drive. Later drive models have the external debug triggering removed and black hard glue added {{to cover all the}} chip and controller pins. The drive is able to read both DVD±R and DVD±RW in addition to being able to play DVD-Video out of the box, unlike its predecessor, which required the purchase of an add-on remote. The system is also capable of playing standard CDs along with CD-R/RW, CD-DA, CD-ROM XA, CD-Extra, WMA-CD, MP3-CD, and JPEG <b>Photo</b> <b>CD.</b> Some users reported problems with the disc drive, as when a user changes the console's orientation, the inserted disc may brush against the drive's pickup assembly and incur scratches to it. The users manual advises against changing the console's position while there is a disc in the drive. Other users report experiencing disc scratching during normal horizontal usage.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> {{system was}} {{announced}} by Kodak in 1990. <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> targeted {{a full range}} of photographic needs, ranging from consumer level point-and-shoot cameras to high-end professionals using large format 4x5 sheet film. The first <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> products, including scanners for processing labs and <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> players for consumers, became available in 1992. The project was expected to be a $600 million business by 1997 with $100 million in operational earnings. Kodak entered into a number of partnerships grow the usage of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD.</b> This included, for example, an arrangement with L.L. Bean in 1992 by which the catalog would be distributed in <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> format, and an arrangement with Silicon Graphics in 1993 to make all Silicon Graphics image-processing workstations capable of accepting Kodak <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> optical disks. These measures, together with the then relatively low cost of $3 per image and convenience, made <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> the digital imaging solution of choice for many photographers in the mid to late 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images {{nominally}} use a CCIR Recommendation 709 {{color space}} and a D65 white point. This color space, originally designed for analog PAL and NTSC television use, was chosen to allow easy playback of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images to televisions. However, in practice the color space of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images varies significantly from CCIR 709. Firstly, the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> encoding scheme allows greater than 100% values for color components, thus allowing <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images to display colors outside of the nominal CCIR 709 gamut. In addition, {{in order to achieve}} accurate color reproduction, especially when scanning reversal film, Kodak found it necessary to provide color profiles specific to film type and scanner. As a result, by the time that the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> format fell into disuse, five different color spaces were in common use in <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images (PCD 4050 refers to a scanner model number): ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{professional}} and advanced amateur segments, <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> had been eclipsed by low cost desktop scanners such as those from Nikon and Minolta in the mid range, and by drum scanners at the very high end. While the pixel resolution of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> was still comparable or better than the alternatives, <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> suffered {{from a number of}} other disadvantages. Firstly, the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> color space, designed for TV display, is smaller than what can be achieved by even a low cost desktop scanner. Secondly, the color rendition of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images changed over time and with different scanner versions; 4050 scanners had different color rendition to earlier versions. Thirdly, the dynamic range of scans was lower than for desktop scanners. Tests at the time indicated that the dmax rating (a measure of maximum density obtainable) of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> was 2.8-3.0, while commonly available desktop scanners were reaching 4.2, a substantial difference. As a result of this, and Photo CD’s problems with color rendering, by 2004 {{the professional}} segment of the user community had generally turned against <b>Photo</b> <b>CD.</b>|$|E

50|$|By 2000, over 140 <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> {{processing}} labs in the U.S. were active, {{with many}} more outside the U.S. However, {{by the late}} 1990s, <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> was being eclipsed by alternate formats, mainly based on the industry standard JPEG format. In the consumer segment, the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> format’s relatively inefficient compression scheme meant that <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> files were significantly larger than a JPEG files of similar quality, and thus less convenient for transmission across the internet, etc. For example, a 16Base <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> image of 5.5 Mb can be encoded as a JPEG image of 2.1 Mb at 80% quality, visually indistinguishable from the original. When the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> format was designed in the early 1990s, a design goal was to allow low cost playback-to-TV devices. At that time the available technology precluded 2-dimensional compression schemes such as JPEG, but by the late 1990s, advances in microprocessor technology had moved JPEG/PNG compression to well {{within the range of}} even very low cost consumer electronics.|$|E
50|$|Despite Kodak not {{releasing}} the specifications for the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> format, {{it has been}} reverse engineered, so allowing images to be converted to more modern formats. The original reverse engineering work was performed by Hadmut Danisch of the University of Karlsruhe, who deciphered the format by studying hex dumps of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> files, and subsequently wrote hpcdtoppm, which converts <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> Images to PPM format, in the early 1990s. During the early 1990s, hpcdtoppm was extensively distributed as part of various Linux distributions, but has since been almost entirely abandoned due to concerns about hpcdtoppm’s restrictive license conditions and lack of color management. However, Hadmut Danisch’s reverse engineering work {{has been used to}} create a number of other open source implementations of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> decoders such as ImageMagick. In 2009, pcdtojpeg was created under the GPL open source licence. Also acknowledged by the author to be based on Hadmut Danisch’s reverse engineering work, pcdtojpeg allows <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> metadata to be decoded, is color managed, and can decode all known variants of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> files. Currently hpcdtoppm and pcdtojpeg together form the core of information available in the public domain on the technical details of the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> format.|$|E

5000|$|An oddity of this {{encoding}} scheme {{is that it}} allows <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images to represent colors which are above 100%, [...] "whiter than white". At the time of Photo CD's introduction, this allowed the display of images on the analog televisions of the day to show brighter, more vivid colors than would otherwise be the case. This was acceptable as the analog televisions of the day were designed to be driven beyond their 100% level without abruptly clipping. However, this aspect of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> encoding is not compatible with modern image formats, and is the cause of the well documented [...] "Blown Highlights" [...] problem when converting <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images to more modern formats. All modern formats enforce hard clipping at 100%, resulting in highlight clipping in converted images unless some form of <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> specific luminance and chrominance mapping is performed.|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{while the}} use of the generic <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> color space will provide color {{reproduction}} that is acceptable for many purposes e.g., Web viewing of thumbnail images, in order to achieve fully accurate color reproduction, e.g., for photographic purposes, any <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> display or conversion software must use the correct color profile for the combination of the original media and scanner model.|$|E

5000|$|For {{practical}} use, any <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images {{will have}} to be converted to a modern format such as JPEG, TIFF or DNG. While there are a large number of image conversion programs available, both commercial and freeware or open source, most are capable of only basic, low resolution (often only to Base resolution, 512x768) conversions. The main distinguishing features between programs as regards <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> capabilities are: ...|$|E
50|$|The system {{failed to}} gain mass usage among {{consumers}} {{partly due to}} its proprietary nature, the rapidly decreasing scanner prices, {{and the lack of}} CD-ROM drives in most home personal computers of the day. Furthermore, <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> relied on CRT-based TV sets for home use. However, these were designed for moving pictures. Their typical flicker became an issue when watching still photographs. The <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> system gained a fair level of acceptance among professional photographers due to the low cost of the high quality film scans. Prior to <b>Photo</b> <b>CD,</b> professionals who wished to digitize their film images were forced to pay much higher fees to obtain drum scans of their film negatives and transparencies.|$|E
50|$|In {{the retail}} segment, while <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> was {{initially}} relatively popular with consumers, {{it was largely}} an economic failure for processing labs. At {{the time of its}} introduction, Kodak claimed that processing costs to labs would be close to $1 per image, which would allow the lab profitably sell at the $3 per image mark. However this promise was never realized, often resulting in the scanning process being rushed, with a resulting fall in quality.As a result of Photo CD’s loss of market share and substantial corporate losses, partially attributed by Kodak Management to its scanning business, Kodak abandoned the format over the period 2001-2004. By 2004, Kodak 4050 <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> scanners were being offered for free to anyone that would pay for their removal by more than one processing lab. This abandonment generated considerable controversy both at the time and subsequently as the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> format’s technical specifications have never been released by Kodak. <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> remains an often quoted example of an “orphan format” and of the dangers of proprietary image formats within photographic circles.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> images use three {{forms of}} {{compression}} {{in order to}} reduce image storage requirements. Firstly, chroma subsampling reduces the size of the images by approximately 50%. This subsampling is by a factor of 4 for 4Base images, and a factor of 2 for all other resolutions. Secondly an additional reduction in size is achieved by decomposing the highest-resolution image data, and storing the 4Base, 16Base and 64Base components as residuals (differences from pixels at the previous level of resolution). Thirdly and finally, the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> system employs a form of quantization and Huffman coding to further compress this residual data. This Huffman encoding is performed on an image-row-by-image-row basis. The Huffman tables are encoded into the <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b> image itself, and have different lengths depending on the compression class. These classes are: ...|$|E
