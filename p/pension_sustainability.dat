40|$|Driven by {{unfavorable}} demographic {{developments and}} unsustainable, outdated or fragmented systems, pension reform {{has been at}} the top of political agendas across the globe for many years now (Prinz, Stanovnik & Stropnik, 2000). Over the last two decades, almost all western European countries have been trimming their public pension systems in an effort to strengthen <b>pension</b> <b>sustainability.</b> One main target of reform was to increase the retirement age. Other measures (e. g. changing the pension calculation, broadening the assessment base, changing the adjustment mechanism) were designed to lower replacement rates. The reform process in the wide range of countries addressed by this survey differs considerably from country to country. This is why Allianz first introduced the <b>Pension</b> <b>Sustainability</b> Index (PSI), which combines the various characteristics of pension systems with the factors that influence them to help track and evaluate policy changes made in different countries around the world. In addressing the sustainability of a country’s public pension system, the PSI can give an indication of a country’s need for reforms to maintain long-term financial sustainability. This can be difficult to assess given the many country-specific institutional, technical and legal parameters. The PSI is able to evaluate the long-term sustainability of national pension systems and thus the pressure on governments to reform these (International pension Papers, 1. 2014). The speed of reform, however, differs between countries. Those which recently introduced major reforms were able to improve in the PSI ranking because of active steps taken, while others were lost in comparison due to their passive policymaking...|$|E

We argue for the use of pension wealth calculated using more realistic assumptions. Looking at ten EU countries, we find that while generosity decreased significantly, systems’ effectiveness in alleviating poverty remain strong in countries where minimum pensions were improved.

The first option involves increasing the pension contribution rates of workers to ensure sustainability of the typical pay-as-you-go pension system. The second option is the switch to a fully-funded plan, in which the government is required to incur debt to honour existing pension liabilities, with individuals making contributions into the new fully-funded pension system when working, but also paying income taxes to service government debt. The timing of this switch coincides with the baby boom generation entering the old worker stage of life which is consistent with the timing of the current pension reform debate. Simulation results suggest that economies facing no population growth in the future and without technological progress are not better off switching to a fully-funded pension system...|$|E

The simulation results show that in our baseline scenario the Polish move would permanently lower future pension-system debt, chiefly as a result of a cut in replacement rates. But using a combination of pessimistic assumptions including strong population ageing, low real wage growth and a high indexation of existing pension benefits, coupled with bringing in tax expenditures related to the third voluntary pension pillar and an increase in the share of minimum pensions leads to higher pension system deficits and eventually more public debt at a very long horizon. The simulations also suggest that the Hungarian pension reversal reduces deficit and debt only temporarily, mainly because of Hungary's costly defined-benefit first pension pillar: the weakening of the second pillar is tantamount to swapping low current replacement rates (in the defined-contribution second pillar) against high future replacement rates in the defined-benefit first pension pillar. Finally, results show that the Estonian move will increase public debt only very moderately in the long run, even though this result is sensitive to the effective interest rate on public debt...|$|E

We show that the model exhibits a unique interior steady state which is asymptotically stable under real wage adjustment dynamics of the type considered in Blanchard and Katz (1999), and under a type of Okun's Law that links the level of utilization of firms to their hiring and firing decision. The introduction of a company pension fund can be shown to contribute to the viability of the analyzed economic system. However, when credit is incorporated in the model, in place of savings-driven supply side fluctuations in economic activity, investment-driven demand side business cycle fluctuations (of a probably much more volatile type) can take place.

This paper attempts to ascertain whether individual immigration preferences – a demand side component of the immigration policy market – are affected by regional birth rates which are used as a proxy for aging. I concentrate on two transition economies – Latvia and Ukraine – which experienced a drastic fall in birth rates in the 1990 s. Currently, birth rates differ significantly across the regions in both countries, and I hypothesise that individuals, especially the elderly, should be more aware of pension financing problems and as a consequence more favourable to immigration in the areas with low birth rates. The empirical results support this hypothesis. In Latvia, pro-immigration sentiment if negatively related to municipal birth rates and older individuals are less favourable to immigration if birth rates are high. In Ukraine, age positively affects pro-immigration attitudes if regional births are low and negatively if births are high.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{long-term}} fiscal projections is self evident. Of these projections, pension expenditure {{is one of}} the most important since firstly it represents a large share of total expenditure, and secondly because of the positive correlation between this variable and demographic ageing. In this paper, we develop a model to project contributory pension expenditures in the Spanish Social Security System disaggregating the results by pension category and sex. The most salient of the results obtained is the expected steady growth of total expenditure in contributory pensions. This would lie around 15 % of GDP around 2045 compared to its initial level of barely 8 % even though the baseline scenario incorporates a substantial recovery of employment and female participation rates. By pension categories, retirement pensions are those that determine the tendency of total expenditure evolution. Interesting conclusions can also be extracted from the analysis by sex. For instance, even accounting for an increase in female retirement pensions due to their higher participation, the corresponding increase in widow male pensions implies a higher total increase of the total number of contributory pensions accruing to men. <b>Pensions</b> system, <b>sustainability,</b> public expenditure. ...|$|R
40|$|The topicality of the {{research}} subject. The foundations of the old-age pension scheme based on notional accounts, {{also referred to as}} the "notional defined contribution" or "non-financial defined contribution" (NDC) old-age pension scheme, were laid in Sweden in 1994, when the prevailing view was that a sus­tainable defined-contribution PAYG old-age pension scheme is impossible. Since then, the NDC system modifications have been implemented in several countries; since 2000, this scheme is also part of the Latvian pension system and works significantly better than {{the other part of the}} pension system - the funded pension scheme. However, the sustainability of NDC scheme is still being questioned. To prevent the NDC <b>pension</b> system <b>sustainability</b> problems, the authors (Pukis, M., & Dundure, I., 2012) in their publication "The <b>Sustainability</b> of the <b>Pension</b> System in Latvia" and (Dundure, I., 2015), the article "Sustainable Old-age Pension System by Developing Notional Defined Contribution Pension Scheme" have proposed a modified NDC model that provides <b>sustainability</b> of the <b>pension</b> system considering the known risks inherent in the pension system. The aim of the paper is to research and analyse the conditions for building a sustainable pension system by developing a Notional Defined Contribution pension scheme and working out an adjusted (modified) old-age pension calculation formula. In order to achieve the above mentioned aim, the authors set the following tasks:Define the old-age pension system based on NDC principles;Define the primary objectives of pension systems and perform analysis of pension adequacy;Define the conditions for achieving a sustainable old-age pension system based on NDC principles;Develop an adjusted (modified) old-age pension calculation formula based on NDC principles.
