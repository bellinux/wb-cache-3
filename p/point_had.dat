5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this <b>point</b> <b>had</b> been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E
5|$|Rougarou, {{formerly}} known as Mantis, is a floorless roller coaster located at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. Designed and built by Bolliger & Mabillard, the roller coaster originally opened in 1996 as a stand-up roller coaster called Mantis, {{which at the time}} was the tallest, fastest, and longest {{of its kind in the}} world. Cedar <b>Point</b> <b>had</b> planned to name the ride Banshee, but due to negative publicity following the announcement, the name was later changed to Mantis.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1865 by the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, {{and had a}} single {{platform}}. It later {{became part of the}} Clifton Extension Railway, and had a second platform built. The station was expanded over the years, and at one <b>point</b> <b>had</b> four porters staffing it. However the Severn Beach Line declined over {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century and by the 1970s the station had no staff and only one platform. Services however have increased since 2000.|$|E
5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this <b>point</b> <b>had</b> {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Belgian Eddy Merckx was the {{dominant}} figure during the 1970s. His first victory came in 1968; another triumph in 1970 {{was followed by}} three successive victories from 1972 to 1974, which is {{the record for the}} most successive victories in the Giro. Felice Gimondi was victorious in 1976 winning his third Giro. Belgians Michel Pollentier and Johan De Muynck won the two subsequent Giros in 1977 and 1978. In 1980, Frenchman Bernard Hinault who up to this <b>point</b> <b>had</b> won two Tours de France, became France's first winner since Anquetil in 1964. He would win another two Giros in 1982 and 1985.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, the Argentine {{government}} was {{dissatisfied with the}} lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this <b>point)</b> <b>had</b> made in expanding the rest of the network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constitución and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C's first section, Constitución railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agustín P. Justo, then President of Argentina.|$|E
5|$|In 1444 {{the major}} princes of the Albanian Principalities, which {{up to that}} <b>point</b> <b>had</b> been vassals of the Ottoman Empire, united and formed the League of Lezhë, an anti-Ottoman confederacy under Skanderbeg's lead. As a result, the Ottoman Empire sought to crush the League and re-establish control over Albania. As of 1448, all Ottoman expeditions into Albania had failed and Murad II chose lead a force in person into Albanian {{territory}} and fragment the League. The sultan decided to capture the fortress of Svetigrad. This fortress served the strategic purpose of protecting the Albanian eastern frontier, while also allowing the Albanians to launch their own assaults on Ottoman territory. In late 1447, war began between Venice and the League, but had not yet escalated into full-scale conflict. Skanderbeg had declared war on Venice {{as a result of}} a diplomatic impasse. This left him open to invasion from the East.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, Argentina made {{inquiries}} in Britain {{to buy a}} new, ocean-going capital {{ship for}} its navy, which to that <b>point,</b> <b>had</b> consisted of only coastal and riverine forces, centered on the two small s. Almirante Brown, the first large ironclad of the Argentine Navy, was ordered from the Samuda Brothers shipyard of London. She was launched on 6 October 1880, and cost the Argentine government £270,000. On 14 June 1881, she conducted speed trials on the Maplin Mile, and achieved her designed speed of 14knots at full power. Upon her delivery to Argentina, she was the largest vessel in the Argentine fleet, and remained so until the four Garibaldi-class armored cruisers were acquired in the late 1890s. Almirante Brown was present during the ceremonies {{for the opening of}} the south basin in the harbor of Buenos Aires on 28 January 1889.|$|E

40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{randomization}} for $(t,m,d) $-nets: Owen scrambling and random digital shift. In the previous paper [{Uniform Distribution Theory}, {&# 92;bf 2 } (2007), 93 - 105], we introduced a class of functions for which any Sobol' <b>points</b> <b>have</b> zero integration error, whereas Owen scrambling of Sobol' <b>points</b> <b>has</b> the same variance of integration error as that of simple Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, by using the same functions as the paper mentioned above, we construct an example of functions for which any Sobol' <b>points</b> <b>have</b> zero integration error, whereas not only Owen scrambling but also random digital shift of Sobol' <b>points</b> <b>have</b> variance of integration error no smaller than that of simple Monte Carlo methods...|$|R

5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute at that <b>point</b> <b>had</b> three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized {{the latter two}} into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E
5|$|The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party at one <b>point</b> <b>had</b> {{agreed to}} join as well, seeing that the ARF's {{political}} ideology was socialism. However, the Hunchakians claimed the new party was not Marxist enough and withdrew from the union. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in Tiflis, Russian Empire, in 1892. At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized modus operandi according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere. The party set its goal of a society based on the democratic principles of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and agrarian reform.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators met for {{the final}} time at 7p.m. Booth {{assigned}} Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house {{and then to a}} rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln with his single-shot Deringer, and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre. They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this <b>point</b> <b>had</b> involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue.|$|E

5|$|The game's success, {{which went}} against what Square Enix assumed would happen {{due to the}} title's {{identity}} as a traditional role-playing game, prompted them to reconsider their strategy for game making, which up to that <b>point</b> <b>had</b> been geared towards developing titles tailored for western markets {{rather than focusing on}} the Japanese market. According to the developers, none of them believed that the game would be released overseas, and were overwhelmed by the positive fan feedback they had received. A manga titled Bravely Default: Flying Fairy began serialization online through Famitsu. Two compilation volumes were released in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Two supplementary books, released under the title Bravely Default: The Pocketbook of R, were released in December 2013. In addition to this, two drama CDs containing supplementary stories were released through 2013 and 2014. Music from the game was featured Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as DLC.|$|E
5|$|The rolling-back of the {{progressive}} policies of the civilian governments resulted {{in a series of}} leftist insurgencies in the countryside, beginning in 1960. This triggered the 36-year Guatemalan Civil War between the U.S.-backed military government of Guatemala and the leftist insurgents, who frequently had a large degree of popular support. The largest of these movements was led by the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, which at its largest <b>point</b> <b>had</b> 270,000 members. During the civil war, atrocities against civilians were committed by both sides; 93% of these violations were committed by the U.S.-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s. The violence was particularly severe during the presidencies of Ríos Montt and Lucas García.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} Baptism of Poland and {{the attendant}} processes {{did not take}} place through Mieszko's German connections. At that time, Mieszko {{was in the process of}} fixing an uneasy relationship with the Bohemian state of Boleslaus I. The difficulties were caused mainly by Czech cooperation with the Veleti. Already in 964, the two parties arrived at an agreement on that and other issues. In 965, Mieszko married Boleslaus' daughter Doubravka. Mieszko's chosen Christian princess, a woman possibly in her twenties, was a devout Christian and Mieszko's own conversion had to be a part of the deal. This act in fact followed in 966 and initiated the Christianization of Greater Poland, a region that up to that <b>point</b> <b>had</b> not been exposed to Christian influence, unlike Lesser Poland and Silesia. In 968, an independent missionary bishopric, reporting directly to the pope, was established, with Jordan installed as the first bishop.|$|E
