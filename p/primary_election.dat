5|$|The {{mayor is}} elected in citywide {{election}}. Elections follow a two-round system. The {{first round of}} the election is called the <b>primary</b> <b>election.</b> The top-two candidates from the <b>primary</b> <b>election</b> advance to a runoff election, called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the <b>primary</b> <b>election</b> and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.|$|E
5|$|The murders {{occurred}} eleven {{days before}} the Maryland Democratic Party's <b>primary</b> <b>election</b> to determine its candidate for the Prince George's County sheriff. As there were no candidates running for sheriff in any other parties, {{the winner of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>election</b> would automatically run unopposed in the general election itself. The incumbent sheriff lost reelection to the union president, who vowed to implement new measures to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.|$|E

50|$|In the United States vote {{splitting}} commonly {{occurs in}} <b>primary</b> <b>elections.</b> The purpose of <b>primary</b> <b>elections</b> {{is to eliminate}} vote splitting among candidates in the same party. If <b>primary</b> <b>elections</b> or party nominations {{are not used to}} identify a single candidate from each party, the party that has more candidates is more likely to lose because of vote splitting among the candidates from the same party. <b>Primary</b> <b>elections</b> only occur within each party, so vote splitting can still occur between parties in the secondary election.|$|R

5|$|At the Republican State Convention on March 22, 2014, Baker {{received}} 2,095 votes (82.708%), Fisher received 374 votes (14.765%) {{and there}} were 64 blank votes (2.527%). The threshold for making the ballot is 15% and the party announced that Baker had thus received the nomination {{without the need for}} a <b>primary</b> <b>election.</b> However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot. He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy battle. In the <b>primary</b> <b>election</b> held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|For {{his first}} run for Governor of Oregon in 1958, the Republican Party opposed his {{candidacy}} {{going into the}} <b>primary</b> <b>election.</b> The large political base he had cultivated allowed him to win the party's primary despite the party's opposition. In the primary he defeated Oregon State Treasurer Sig Unander for the Republican nomination. In July 1958, after the <b>primary</b> <b>election,</b> Hatfield married Antoinette Kuzmanich, a counselor at Portland State College (now Portland State University). The marriage during the campaign drew some attention as the Catholic Kuzmanich converted to Hatfield's Baptist religion. The couple would have four children: Elizabeth, Mark Jr., Theresa and Vincent ("Visko"). He continued his campaign for the governor's office after the wedding, but avoided most public appearances with fellow Republican candidates for office and did not mention them during his campaign, despite requests by other Republicans for joint appearances.|$|E
5|$|Ford ran {{to succeed}} Mark Sanford as Governor of South Carolina in the 2010 gubernatorial election. His {{platform}} included reinstating video poker {{to the state}} to generate returns from taxes on the gaming industry {{in an effort to}} balance the state budget, something he has proposed since the late 1990s. A law Ford sponsored in 2008 to make gambling legal failed to advance; he planned a voter referendum to repeal the ban. Ford faced state senator Vincent A. Sheheen of Camden and State Superintendent of Education Jim Rex in a <b>primary</b> <b>election.</b> Sheheen's campaign has raised $33,000 as of January 2009, while Ford's campaign raised $6,000. On June 8, 2010, Ford finished in third place in the <b>primary</b> <b>election</b> with 18percent of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic <b>primary</b> <b>election,</b> Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary. However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial <b>primary</b> <b>election,</b> further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E
