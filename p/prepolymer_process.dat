40|$|Abstract:Waterborne {{polyurethane}} (WBPU) adhesive {{with varying}} amounts of dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA) was synthesized by <b>prepolymer</b> <b>process</b> and blended with polyisocyanate hardener. The mean particle {{size of the}} WBPU dispersion decreased with increasing DMPA content. 1 H NMR spectroscopy confirmed the formation of allophanate bonds and biuret bonds due to the reaction of hardener NCO with urethane/urea groups. The optimum NCO content with the greatest adhesive strength was dependent on the total content of urethane/urea groups in the WBPU molecules. The optimum NCO content increased with increasing number of urethane groups (DMPA content). The adhesion strength of WBPU adhesives was maximized at a molar ratio of hardener NCO to urethane/urea of about 0. 28...|$|E

A full thermal, mechanical and thermo-mechanical characterisation of TPUs synthesised with different hard segment (HS) contents was also carried out. Thermogravimetric analysis showed the presence of three degra- dation steps which varied between the different TPU structures depending on the HS content. Colour tests showed substantial differences between TPU samples which were related to degradation param- eters. Initial degradation temperatures were lower than the polyol's one and decreased with increasing HS contents. Tensile tests showed high deformation at break for these elastomeric TPU samples, except for the sample with 40 wt% of HS. Finally, rheology studies revealed that the melting temperature generally decreased with higher HS content...|$|E

Higher tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and thermal stability were recorded for WBPU/MLA adhesives with higher MLA contents. The WBPU/MLA adhesive materials were used to coat polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrates. The adhesive strength increased with increasing MLA content. More importantly, the MLA also enhanced the WBPU/MLA coating in terms of adhesive strength at moderately high temperatures as well as under natural weather exposed conditions. The adhesive strength was essentially unaffected with 6. 48 mol % MLA in the WBPU/MLA coating after exposure to natural weather conditions for 180 days...|$|R
40|$|A polyol {{containing}} long sulfonated side chain, {{designated as}} PESS, {{was used to}} prepare aqueous polyurethane (PU) dispersions through the <b>prepolymer</b> mixing <b>process</b> in this study. The effects of this sulfonated polyol on {{the properties of the}} resultant waterborne polyurethanes (WPUs) were studied. Structures and properties of the WPUs were examined by FTIR, GPC, particle sizer, viscometer, TGA, DMA, DSC, tensile tester and surface resistance meter. When the content of total hydrophilic groups (i. e. sodium sulfonate group of PESS and quaternary ammonium carboxylate group of neutralized dimethylol propionic acid, DMPA) remains unchanged, the WPU dispersion with higher PESS content possesses higher average particle diameter and film decomposition temperature due to its higher average molecular weight (Mw). The WPU with higher PESS content possesses higher dispersion viscosity and film ionic conductivity due to the higher dissociation degree or electrostatic interaction of sodium sulfonate groups than quaternary ammonium carboxylate groups. PESS enhances the antistatic property of the WPU films, which can be used in electronic, wrapping, and coating industries. Moreover, the WPU film with higher PESS content exhibits lower modulus but higher elongation at break due to the lower hard segment content. The glass transition temperature of these amorphous films is at about - 45 degrees C, irrespective of the PESS/DMPA ratio and hydrophilic group content (HGC). (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A number of novel water-dispersible and solution polyurethanes were prepared via the <b>prepolymer</b> mixing <b>process.</b> The principal diisocyanate, polyols and emulsifier used in these studies were isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), polytetrahydrofuran diol (PTHF), cyclohexane dimethanol (CHDM) and 2, 2 -bis(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid (DMPA), respectively. The carboxylic acid groups of the emulsifier were neutralised with either an organic base (triethylamine) or an inorganic base (sodium or potassium hydroxide). The dispersion molecular weight was built up through chain extension by use of aliphatic diamine chain extenders (hydrazine monohydrate, carbodihydrazide or adipic dihydrazide). The dispersions studied remained stable throughout {{the period of the}} research. Structure-property studies were carried out on polyurethanes of similar composition prepared in solution (THF) and in water. The effect of the degree of chain extension on the molecular weight of the dispersions, in addition to the physical properties and morphology, were investigated for hydrazine monohydrate, carbodihydrazide and adipic dihydrazide derived systems. Variations in the polyol, polyol molecular weight, ionic component and the diisocyanate used and their effect on the polyurethane properties were also investigated. The effects of the neutralising counter-ion and the degree of neutralisation were investigated in addition to a study of the effect of the hard segment content for samples prepared with a PTHF soft segment of molecular weight 2000. Each dispersion was thoroughly examined and characterised according to their appearance, pH, viscosity and particle size. The DMPA content is well documented as being a primary factor with respect to the dispersion stability, but also significantly affects the pH, viscosity and particle size of the dispersion. Hence, for purposes of the studies described here the DMPA component remained constant so that this could be neglected from the discussion of the results obtained. In a subsequent examination of the polyurethane films, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), tensile testing and solvent resistance were employed {{for the study of the}} solid state morphology and physical properties of the cast films. The results obtained suggest that the advantages of water-based polyurethane dispersions over more conventional solvent-borne systems lies in the molecular weight (chain extension) achievable in water. Hence, this was found to affect significantly the solid state properties of comparable water-borne and solvent-borne systems. Variation of the polyol and its molecular weight, and the diisocyanate types resulted in polyurethanes of considerably different properties and morphologies. It was discovered that synergistic properties could be achieved from the use of isocyanate blends. The degree of neutralisation and the counter-ion employed contributed to a range of colloidal properties. Hard segment content was also found to be contributory to the differing properties and morphologies encountered for PTIlF 2000 based polyurethanes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Polyurethane (PU) {{has been}} widely used in the adhesives, coatings, inks, textile {{finishings}} and artificial leathers, due to the properties of high quality and high variability of chemical structures. In this work, the anionic waterborne polyurethane (WPU) would be synthesized by the <b>prepolymer</b> mixing <b>process.</b> A series of WPUs were obtained by varying the amount {{of different kinds of}} hydrophilic groups, consisting of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), polyols including Aru 5620, a long chain polyester polyol, and D 3117, a long side chain polyether polyol with a sodium sulfonated group, dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA), and chain extender including EDA, a short —chain diamine or EES- 200 L, a short-chain diamine with a sodium sulfonated group. With the help of instruments, for instance, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), and surface resistivity/resistance meter, the mechanical and thermal properties, and surface resistance were investigated. The factors affecting the properties of the WPUs, such as the amount of hydrophilic groups、chain extender、the content of sulfonated groups and NaClO 4 are taken into account. It is found that the mechanical, thermal, and antistatic properties are significantly affected by the above-mentioned four factors in the WPUs. Moreover, the EES- 200 L-containing system is better than the EDA-containing system in terms of mechanical and thermal properties. This is because the presence of higher hard-segment content in the EES- 200 L-containing system. Furthermore, the higher content of sulfonated groups in the EES- 200 L-containing system also leads to higher physical crosslinking density. The surface resistivity of the EDA-containing system with a higher content of D 3117 is about 109 Ω/■. This would certainly meet the application requirement of the anti-electrostatic materials (109 〜 1012 Ω/■). The EDA-containing system with excellent antistatic properties is potentially useful in the package material of semiconductor. 摘 要 聚氨基甲酸酯(Polyurethane，PU) 具有優良的物性與高度化學結構可變異性，所以已廣泛應用於接著劑、塗料、油墨、纖維處理劑與人造纖維等。在本研究中主要是以預聚物法製備一系列水性聚氨基甲酸酯(WPU) 並探討高分子量親水基、不同分子結構的鏈延長劑包括短鏈雙胺結構的EDA及短鏈雙胺含磺酸鹽官能基的EES- 200 L，與加入不等量的過氯酸鈉(NaClO 4) ，對其熱性質、機械性質與抗靜電性的影響。 本研究中使用霍式轉換紅外線光譜儀(FTIR) 、熱重損失分析儀(TGA) 、熱差掃瞄卡計(DSC) 探討其熱劣解溫度與PU中的結構與結晶情形，同時也利用動態機械分析儀(DMA) 、電阻計、交流阻抗分析儀等測量與探討PU薄膜的機械性質、導電性與PU乳液的粒徑與黏度的關係。在水性聚氨基甲酸酯中改變某些組成成分如:親水基含量、鏈延長劑、磺酸根離子的含量、與過氯酸鈉的含量皆可得到不同機械性質、熱性質與抗靜電性質的水性聚氨基甲酸酯。最後，根據實驗結果，機械性質與熱性質方面，因EES- 200 L系列的硬鏈段含量增加與磺酸根離子增多而產生物理交聯的緣故，使得所呈現出的性質均比EDA系列佳。在表面電阻與體積電阻方面，EDA系列中所含D 3117 比例高之PU薄膜可得較低的表面電阻約為 109 Ω/■，此表面電阻值已符合抗靜電標準(109 〜 1012 Ω/■) ，使得具抗靜電性質的EDA系列可能應用於半導體的包裝材料上。目錄 中文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要…………………………………………………………… [...] .

40|$|Neste trabalho, fibras lignocelulósicas de diferentes fontes (bananeira e coco) foram utilizadas como agentes de reforço na preparação de compósitos de matriz fenólica e lignofenólica. O fenol, utilizado na formulação da matriz, foi substituído parcial e totalmente por lignina, extraída do bagaço de cana de açúcar por processo Organosolve, na preparação dos termorrígidos lignofenólicos. Os polímeros foram moldados sob compressão e aquecimento controlados. Para caracterização das fibras lignocelulósicas, além da análise da composição, foram utilizadas as seguintes técnicas: difração de raios-X, cromatografia gasosa inversa (IGC), espectroscopia na região de infravermelho (IV), calorimetria exploratória diferencial (DSC), termogravimetria (TG), microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV), resistência à tração. Os pré-polímeros (fenólicos e lignofenólicos) foram caracterizados via cromatografia de exclusão por tamanho (SEC), IV, DSC, TG. Os compósitos obtidos foram caracterizados através de ensaios de impacto Izod, análise dinâmico-mecânica (DMA), absorção de água, DSC, TG. Os resultados revelaram que: a substituição total do fenol por lignina é viável; das duas fibras utilizadas como reforço, fibras de coco e banana (não tratadas, ou tratadas com solução alcalina ou ar ionizado), estas últimas apresentaram melhores resultados como reforço de matriz fenólica, possivelmente devido ao mais alto teor de celulose, que é o componente das fibras lignocelulósicas presente nos domínios cristalinos, e que, portanto, exerce a maior influência sobre as propriedades mecânicas destas, e conseqüentemente sobre a ação como reforço em compósitos; em se tratando de compósitos lignofenólicos, principalmente naquele em que fenol foi totalmente substituído por lignina, embora a fibra de coco não tenha boas propriedades mecânicas devido ao baixo teor de celulose, o alto teor de lignina presente neste fibra passou a corresponder a propriedade importantíssima, pois aumentou consideravelmente a afinidade fibra/matriz (também com alto teor de estruturas típicas de lignina). A intensificação das interações na {{interface}} possivelmente facilitou a transferência de carga da matriz para a fibra durante o impacto, levando ao material com mais alta resistência ao impacto, dentre os considerados no presente trabalho. Os resultados de absorção de água no geral foram importantes, pois além de indicar a afinidade do material por água, trouxeram também, dentre outras, informações sobre {{a interface}} fibra/matriz. No caso dos compósitos preparados a partir de pré-polímeros em que fenol foi totalmente substituído por lignina, os testes de absorção de água também foram importantes no sentido de indicar o melhor processo a ser utilizado na preparação dos pré-polímeros, sendo os resultados condizentes com aqueles obtidos via ensaio de impacto. Deve-se destacar o fato de ter sido possível preparar um compósito com boas propriedades, em que lignina foi usada como macromonômero na preparação da matriz polimérica, sendo esta reforçada com fibras vegetais, ou seja, obteve-se um compósito a partir de alta porcentagem de material oriundo de fontes renováveisIn this work, lignocellulosic fibers from different sources (banana tree and coconut) {{were used as}} reinforcing agents {{in the preparation of}} phenolic and lignophenolic matrix composites. The phenol used in the matrix formulation was substituted both partially and totally by lignin, extracted from sugarcane bagasse by organosolv process, in the preparation of the lignophenolic thermosets. The composites were molded under controlled pressure and heating. Besides composition analysis, the following techniques were used to characterize the lignocellulosic fibers: X-ray diffraction, inverse gas chromatography (IGC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and tensile strength. The prepolymers (phenolic and lignophenolic) were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), IR, DSC, and TG. The composites obtained were characterized by Izod impact strength, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), water absorption, DSC, and TG. The results revealed that: -the total substitution of phenol by lignin is viable; - from the two reinforcing fibers used (banana tree and coconut, both treated and untreated with alkaline solution and ionized air), the former presented the best results as a phenolic matrix reinforcement, possibly due to their larger cellulose content, which is the component of the lignocellulosic fibers present in the crystalline domains. This has a greater influence on the mechanical properties of the fibers, and consequently on their action as composite reinforcement; -concerning the lignophenolic composites, mainly those in which phenol was completely substituted with lignin, although the coconut fibers do not have good mechanical properties due to their low cellulose content, their high lignin content contributed to a very important property, that is, a considerable increase in the affinity between the fiber and the matrix, which also has a high content of typical lignin structures. The intensity of the interactions at the interface may have made the load transfer from the matrix to the fiber during impact easier, resulting in a material with the highest impact strength, when compared to others prepared in the present study; -the water absorption results were generally important as besides information on the affinity of the material for water, they also gave further information on the fiber/matrix interface. In the case of composites prepared from prepolymers whose phenol was totally substituted by lignin, the water absorption tests were also important to indicate the best <b>prepolymer</b> preparation <b>process,</b> which was in agreement with impact assay results. It is important to highlight {{the fact that it is}} was possible to prepare a composite with good properties using lignin as a macromonomer in the preparation of a polymeric matrix reinforced with natural fibers, that is to say, with a high percentage of material derived from renewable source...|$|R
