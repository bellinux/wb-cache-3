40|$|In many {{low income}} African countries, three factors are placing an undue {{burden on the}} elderly. First, {{the burden on the}} elderly has {{enormously}} increased with the increase in mortality of prime age adults due to HIV AIDS pandemic and regional conflicts. Second, the traditional safety net of the extended family has become ineffective and unreliable for the elderly. Third, in a few countries, the elderly are called upon to shoulder the responsibility of the family as they became the <b>principal</b> <b>breadwinners</b> and caregivers for young children. While {{a number of studies have}} examined the welfare consequences of these developments on children, few studies have systematically analyzed the poverty situation among the elderly (relative to other groups) in low income countries Africa, and the role of social pensions.

50|$|Recently, Adovasio {{has worked}} to dispel gender bias in prehistoric archaeology. Traditionally, archaeologists have painted men in prehistoric {{cultures}} as the <b>principal</b> <b>breadwinners</b> and central figures in the economy of their respective populations. Adovasio, however, defends the importance of women to prehistoric lifeways in his book The Invisible Sex, coauthored with Olga Soffer and Jake Page. One of the primary reasons the androcentric view has persisted is the relative absence of women from the archaeological record: the durable evidence of male handiwork (lithics) endures, but softer technologies decompose. Since women were typically the ones who made and used perishable artifacts, their roles in prehistory are often undetected since these artifacts break down so quickly. Adovasio’s specialty lends him a unique window {{into the world of}} prehistoric women, providing a logical platform from which to attack traditional concepts about men’s and women’s roles in prehistoric North America.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to present a {{wholistic}} approach that would serve to empower the widows and orphans in the interfaith communities in City United Methodist Church in Harare, the Uniting Presbyterian Churches of Mabvuko and Mbare, and the African Apostolic Church of Johane Maranke in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe, who have been impacted by HIV!AIDS. This project, denominated as “Resurrection Ministry” by the writer, focused on iaheritance as recognized under the customary processes in Zimbabwe, {{as one of the}} resources that can be utilized to empower the widows and orphans. Forty (40) women comprised Group A and twenty (20) youths, between the ages of twelve (12) and nineteen (19), represented Group B. Group A participated in a tn-dimensional strategy that consisted of questionnaires, group sessions/workshops and experiential activities. The group sessions/workshops operated on the principles of informed pedagogy whose aim is to convey information to the widows that will assist them in knowing how to acquire and manage the estates of their deceased spouses. Retired judiciaries educated the participants on easy-to-understand versions of the inheritance laws as well as the customary processes concerning beneficiaries of estates. The commonality that presented in these endeavors is how {{to take advantage of the}} existing customary and judicial resources that would accord the widows and orphans the opportunities to return and re-assert themselves as beloved and contributing members of the community. The youth group was divided into two groups: one group for girls and the other group for boys. Senior women from the interfaith communities trained adolescent girls in the following areas: responsible management of their individual lives, personal hygiene. child development, independence and continuing/completing educational endeavors. These areas of emphasis provided much needed information to adolescent girls who assume the mothering tasks of their younger siblings. In a similar manner, men of integrity in the various churches were appointed as mentors for the young boys. The men encouraged the boys in the Christian faith in weekly sessions. Each session integrated orthodoxy with orthopraxy. The mentors accompanied and transported the young men to sporting events and visitations to needy persons. These opportunities engendered a role-model system for the youth and foster male-to-male relationships of positivism between the senior men and the young men. The project proceeded from a fundamental hypothesis that surmised that the customary inheritance processes in the Zimbabwean culture can be dynamically employed to empower widows and orphans who have been adversely affected by HIV/AIDS in ways that allow them to experience dignity and worth in the community. All of the above-mentioned activities in the Resurrection Ministry project focused on instilling self-worth. confidence and a sense of’ belonging in the participants. The model of ministry documented in the project worked to provide the support. education, inlbrmation and assistance needed to assist widows and orphans in their navigation of their lives after the death of the <b>principal</b> <b>breadwinners</b> in the family...|$|R

40|$|I {{argue that}} the {{neoliberal}} reforms brought on by structural adjustment appear to have contributed to a deterioration of the job market and a greater prevalence of female-headed households in the Dominican Republic. On the basis of data collected in 1994 among women working in a free trade zone, I show that structural adjustment increases the need for women to work, because of cuts in government programs, declining real wages, growing inflation, and a deterioration in male employment, which weakens the man's role as <b>principal</b> <b>breadwinner</b> and increases the importance and visibility of women's contribution to the household economy. This change in the gender composition {{of the labor force}} has encouraged some women to resist marriage and/or remarriage because the 'marriage market' of eligible men willing and able to support a family has been reduced, contributing to greater marital instability. ...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 121 - 130. Zimbabwe {{like many}} other {{countries}} in Sub-Saharan Africa is being ravaged by the effects of HIV/AIDS. Prevalence levels currently stand at between 15 - 35 % (for women aged between 25 - 29), {{and are expected to}} grow to 50 % by the year 2010. The economy is suffering from the loss of productive labour, the health sector is over-burdened and unable to cope with the increased demand for health services due to ADS related illnesses. Many households have lost their <b>principal</b> <b>breadwinners</b> to the disease and have become impoverished as a result. Despite a myriad of interventions aimed at preventing the spread of the infection, and mitigating its effects on the health system, the economy, and households, the infection still presents a problem for the country. Poor urban households in particular, are susceptible to poverty induced by the effects of this illness. It is therefore important to not only assess the costs of the disease on these households, but also to understand the strategies which. they employ to cope with the impact of the illness. The main aim {{of this study was to}} assess the costs (direct and indirect) incurred by poor households as a result of HIV /AIDS, and to explore the strategies which they make use of in dealing with the effects of the disease. Social capital was examined as a resource which households utilize in order to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS related ill health on the household. Data was collected from interviews of people living with HIV/AIDS (using a structured questionnaire), focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The sample of 110 people living with HIV/AIDS was drawn from two poor urban communities with different wealth proﬁles. The questionnaire was structured in order to obtain information on the costs incurred by households as a result of the disease and about the strategies employed to cope with the disease. The results indicate that HIV/AIDS places a heavy economic burden on affected households, many of whom already struggle to meet their basic needs. The results show that that most households (72 %) enter into debt, and few make use of household savings and Medical Insurance as mechanisms for coping with the high costs of ill health. Both communities exhibited high levels of certain types of social capital resources, with the lower income community exhibiting higher levels of social capital resources in general. A pattern in the results reveals that the resources and forms of assistance (ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial) that households in the two communities had available to them for coping with the disease differed according to the type of social capital held by the respondents in the each community. An analysis of these results suggests that introducing structures to assist affected households in meeting their basic needs such as food and education would improve the ability of households to cope with the economic impact of the disease. The institution of means tested exemption systems for health care services for these people would greatly improve the ability of their households to cope with the high illness costs. The results also suggest that organisations and actors involved in HIV/AIDS interventions should co- ordinate their efforts so as to be effective in mitigating the effects of the disease on these households. It is also suggested that policy makers develop capacity in the area of social capital and HIV/AIDS so that interventions targeted at assisting communities affected by AIDS are informed by an understanding of the complete resource set (including differing social capital endowments) that households have at their disposal...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a gendered {{perspective on the}} social and economic consequences of Sub-Saharan African migration to Australia. This mixed methods study draws on a Survey as well as in-depth interviews and participant observation of the Sub-Saharan African women in South Australia, as well as analyses of secondary data from the Department of Immigration Movements and Settlement Database and the Australian Census of Population and Housing 2006. It examines three interconnected thematic areas in the migrant women’s lives. First, African women’s labour force patterns based on visa of entry to Australia, show that African migrant skilled women in Australia are able to compete favourably in the labour market and are able to get jobs commensurate to their skills. However the study shows women who enter Australia on humanitarian visas, many of whom have very low human capital endowments, find themselves completely shut out of the Australian workforce. The second theme provides a gendered perspective on remittance sending practices of Sub-Saharan African women and how these affect settlement outcomes. The study shows that remittance sending does have an impact on settlement of humanitarian migrants with implications for an individual migrants’ poverty and raises interesting arguments for host countries, especially in the area of retirement planning of migrants. The third thematic area examines gender role changes of Sub-Saharan African migrant women {{as a result of their}} migration to Australia. It takes into consideration the increasing “Feminisation of Migration” as many Sub-Saharan African women are the principal applicants leading their family’s migration, and in many cases were the primary breadwinners when their partners were unable to find work. The study also examines division of labour within the household, especially in regards to domestic work as well as parenting. The study concludes with implications for migration theory and policy. The study urges that there is need to integrate what is known about migration settlement from different migration theories and perspectives. It draws from a conceptual framework that examines the settlement of Sub-Saharan migrants from a systems structure that looks at the Macro, Meso and Micro factors, as well as transnational factors that affect the settlement of Sub-Saharan Africans in Australia. It urges the importance of recognising skilled women migrants in the discourse on women and work since skilled migration flows of women have largely been ignored in theorising about women in migration. There are important policy implications for developed countries such as Australia. Those unskilled find themselves excluded from the modern industrialised labour market. The questions raised in the section on remittances have important implications for developed countries in regards to their understanding of migrant poverty and policy issues such as migrant retirement planning. While the section on gender roles and gender relations in migration, contributes to gender and migration theory by calling for a change in focus in how gender roles are examined. The study explains that most of what is understood about gender roles has been influenced by western feminist ideology, and urges an understanding of migrant gender roles from a structural perspective taking into account modern migration flows such as the ‘feminisation of migration’. As women become more likely to lead migration flows from developing to developed countries, women are no longer ‘tied migrants’ but rather <b>principal</b> <b>breadwinners</b> for their families and this has enormous implications for theories on gender roles and the wider study of gender and migration.

40|$|According to a {{range of}} authors and popular commentators, the post-Fordist {{socioeconomic}} order has produced a new category of female labourer, the 'female principal breadwinner'. This article opens out this category of worker to critical scrutiny. We suggest that while the very idea of the female <b>principal</b> <b>breadwinner</b> is open to all manner of existing lines of feminist critique, beyond this it forces a confrontation with a number of issues vital to feminist analyses of transformations to women's labour-both waged and unwaged-in contemporary financialised post-Fordism. We pursue two issues in particular. First, transformations to the labour of social reproduction-including transformations to the measurement and valuation of domestic labour-and second, the financialisation (and shifting capacities) of wages specifically and money more generally. We suggest that if transformations to women's labour are to be fully grasped and understood feminist theory must renew and rethink its analyses of domestic labour, wages and money...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} and validate a three-period sequential model of older workers' labor force transitions following a health|disability shock, using retrospective information from Spanish cross-section data. Central {{to the analysis}} are {{the effects of the}} various disabilities and their severity. We find that the probability of remaining employed decreases both with age and the severity of the shock. Moreover, we find strong interactions between age and severity for older workers and none for prime-age workers. Suffering any kind of disability reduces the probability of being employed immediately prior to retirement age, and in such cases it is severity which is the strongest indicator. With respect to demographics, we find that female gender, having a retired spouse or being married all reduce the probabilities of both remaining in employment and returning to work following a spell of inactivity; in turn, <b>principal</b> <b>breadwinner</b> status, education and skill levels increase this likelihood.
