50|$|It {{seems that}} {{the death of a}} bull by sword was practiced previously, {{specially}} by the employees of meat processing factories in Sevilla, but not in a bullring. In any case, if Francisco Romero is not the inventor of the modern bullfight, he is the first matador that became professional and made a living from bull fighting. His success implied a fundamental and radical change in the bullfight art: up to him, {{the main part of the}} corrida (bullfight or bullrun) was the <b>piking</b> of the bull from a horse, followed by bullfighting on horse and then some use of cape by helpers on foot, but the horse rider was the protagonist of the bull party. The death of the bull was only the end of the bullfight and it wasn't particularly celebrated. After Francisco Romero, and after some years when both bullfighting styles (on foot and riding a horse) fought for public support, on-horse bullfight started to lose the protagonist role it had and the death of the bull by a lonely man on foot, armed only with a sword, became the most important part of a bullfight.|$|E

5000|$|The Airflare, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} an Airtrack, is an advanced move {{that is similar}} in concept to a Halo, also known as Headtracks or just tracks.

(angle can differ. the smaller the angle, the greater the difficulty). his legs in a V-shape, and his arms straight. The hands are the only body part that touch the floor as the move is being performed. The bboy whips his legs, then arms around so that he travels in a circular path. Air Flares can also be referred to as Air Tracks: however, Air Tracks was originally a single 360 spin in the air that would be a transition move linking to another.

40|$|International audienceRelationships {{with animals}} are {{recognized}} as positive for children with ADHD, ASD or learning disabilities, {{both at home and}} during animal-assisted interventions. Based on these assumptions, the French association “Pas-à-pas avec Alexia” proposes equine-assisted psychotherapy to children with Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) since May 2012. This syndrome is a rare genetic disease, which has health consequences because of congenital malformations and sleeping troubles. It affects all areas of development: cognition, motor function and emotional skills. One of its characteristics is maladaptive behavior. We presented here a follow-up of three children with SMS: one girl aged 37 months old, two boys one aged 47 months old and the other one aged 74 months old (age {{at the beginning of the}} follow-up). They experienced weekly equine-assisted psychotherapy for 25 months with the same professional, a psychologist trained in equine-assisted psychotherapy. She wrote individual projects that took the child's personal issues and parental expectations into account. She analysed observation notes for each session to evaluate the effects and the relevance of this intervention. From this analysis, a feature appeared to be common in the three children, i. e. frustration intolerance which they express by tantrum for example. During those tantrums, the children could hurt themselves (e. g. hand biting, head banging, skin <b>piking,</b> slapping self), the pony, or even the psychologist involved. When the anger was out of control, the only way to stop it was to interrupt the relationship between the child and the dyad pony/psychologist. Without any outside stimulations, the child was able to calm himself and to “come back” with the human-animal dyad. At the end of the 25 months program, each child was able to manage frustrating events better in both equine-assisted psychotherapy and daily life. The horses’ non-verbal and non-judging characteristics helped these children to transmit their relationship issues that seem to be at the basis of their difficulties to tolerate frustration. As this equine-assisted psychotherapy was positive for these children, the program is being continued. Based on this pilot study, a wider research seems to be important to include more children with SMS in order to evaluate the quantitative effects of equine-assisted psychotherapy on their behavioral disabilities. Les interventions en médiation animale mettent en évidence les effets positifs des relations avec les animaux auprès des enfants présentant des TED, TDAH ou troubles des apprentissages. Ce postulat est à l’origine de la mise en place de séances d’équithérapie par l’association « Pas-à-pas avec Alexia » depuis mai 2012 auprès d’enfants présentant le syndrome Smith-Magenis (SMS). Ce syndrome est une maladie génétique rare qui affecte toutes les aires de développement de l’enfant. Les troubles du comportement font partie de son expression clinique. Cet article présente le suivi hebdomadaire en équithérapie réalisé auprès de trois enfants avec SMS durant 25 mois. Les séances ont été menées par la même équithérapeute qui a rédigé des projets thérapeutiques individuels en s’appuyant sur les difficultés de l’enfant et les attentes des parents. Les notes prises à l’issue de chaque séance ont été analysées mettant en évidence les effets de l’équithérapie auprès de ces enfants. Il en ressortait que chaque enfant manifestait une intolérance à la frustration. À la fin de ce suivi, chaque enfant présentait une meilleure capacité à gérer les situations frustrantes en équithérapie et dans leur quotidien. Le poney n’est pas inscrit dans le langage verbal et ni dans le jugement. Ainsi, les enfants ont pu projeter sur lui leurs problématiques relationnelles qui semblent être à l’origine de leur difficulté à tolérer la frustration. Cette étude pilote mériterait d’être développée auprès d’un échantillon significatif afin de mettre en évidence quantitativement les effets de l’équithérapie sur les troubles du comportement des enfants avec SMS...|$|E

40|$|Northern <b>pike</b> (Esox lucius) are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that can}} switch to alternative prey species after preferred prey have declined. This trophic adaptability allows invasive <b>pike</b> to have {{negative effects on}} aquatic food webs. In Southcentral Alaska, invasive <b>pike</b> are a substantial concern because they have spread to important spawning and rearing habitat for salmonids and are hypothesised {{to be responsible for}} recent salmonid declines. We described the relative importance of salmonids and other prey species to <b>pike</b> diets in the Deshka River and Alexander Creek in Southcentral Alaska. Salmonids were once abundant in both rivers, but they are now rare in Alexander Creek. In the Deshka River, we found that juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (O. kisutch) dominated <b>pike</b> diets and that small <b>pike</b> consumed more of these salmonids than large <b>pike.</b> In Alexander Creek, <b>pike</b> diets reflected the distribution of spawning salmonids, which decrease with distance upstream. Although salmonids dominated <b>pike</b> diets in the lowest reach of the stream, Arctic lamprey (Lampetra camtschatica) and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) dominated <b>pike</b> diets in the middle and upper reaches. In both rivers, <b>pike</b> density did not influence diet and <b>pike</b> consumed smaller prey items than predicted by their gape-width. Our data suggest that (1) juvenile salmonids are a dominant prey item for <b>pike,</b> (2) small <b>pike</b> are the primary consumers of juvenile salmonids and (3) <b>pike</b> consume other native fish species when juvenile salmonids are less abundant.
