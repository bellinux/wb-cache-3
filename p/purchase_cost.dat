5|$|In {{each of the}} {{countries}} involved in the South American dreadnought arms race, movements arose that advocated {{the sale of the}} dreadnoughts to redirect the substantial amounts of money involved toward what they viewed as more worthy pursuits. These costs were rightfully viewed as enormous. After the Minas Geraes class was ordered, a Brazilian newspaper equated the initial <b>purchase</b> <b>cost</b> for the original three ships as equaling 3,125 miles of railroad tracks or 30,300 homesteads. Naval historian Robert Scheina put the price at £6,110,100 without accounting for ammunition, which was £605,520, or necessary upgrades to docks, which was £832,000. Costs for maintenance and related issues, which in {{the first five years of}} Minas Geraess and São Paulos commissioned lives was about 60 percent of the initial cost, only added to the already staggering sum of money. The two Rivadavias were purchased for nearly a fifth of the Argentine government's yearly income, a figure which did not include the later in-service costs. Historian Robert K. Massie rounded the figure to a full quarter of each government's annual income.|$|E

25|$|The Fairey Ultra-light Helicopter {{emerged as}} a compact {{side-by-side}} two-seater, powered by a single Turbomeca Palouste turbojet engine, which was produced under licence by Blackburn. It was mounted semi-externally at floor level, behind the seats. The engine was furnished with an oversized compressor {{for the purpose of}} providing air to the tip-burners at 40 psi (275 kPa); this arrangement eliminated the necessity for a tail rotor in order to counteract torque, which was not a factor with the tip jet configuration adopted. The Palouste engine was by far the most costly element of the Ultra-light, reportedly comprising in excess of 50 per cent of the craft's <b>purchase</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sometimes called Kinetic Kill technology, the THAAD missile destroys {{missiles}} by {{colliding with}} them, using hit-to-kill technology, like the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3 (although the PAC-3 {{also contains a}} small explosive warhead). This is unlike the Patriot PAC-2 which carried only an explosive warhead detonated using a proximity fuse. Although the actual figures are classified, THAAD missiles have an estimated range of 125 miles (200km), and can reach an altitude of 93 miles (150km). A THAAD battery consists of at least six launcher vehicles, each equipped with eight missiles, with two mobile tactical operations centers (TOCs) and the AN/TPY-2 ground-based radar (GBR); the U.S. Army plans to field at least six THAAD batteries, at a <b>purchase</b> <b>cost</b> of $800 million per battery.

25|$|The new Methil dock {{was entirely}} successful, and {{mechanical}} handling equipment and other modern aids ensured rapid loading of shipping. Nonetheless Wemyss {{did not wish to}} be a long term operator of harbour facilities, particularly because he foresaw that considerable development would be needed in later years to keep abreast of the expansion of trade. Discussions took place with the North British Railway in 1888 which resulted in the sale of the facilities to that company. This became effective on 1 February 1889 and included the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and the Methil extension, the Methil and Leven docks, and the railways serving them. Wemyss undertook never to construct or allow a railway or dock on his lands that would compete with the transferred lines and harbours. This was a most significant concession, as he was handing monopoly control to the NBR; at the time he had an excellent relationship with the Chairman of the NBR, John Walker, and this may have influenced him. The <b>purchase</b> <b>cost</b> £225,000; the Wemyss Castle station was to be maintained by the NBR for the private use of Wemyss, and Wemyss was given a seat on the NBR board.|$|E
