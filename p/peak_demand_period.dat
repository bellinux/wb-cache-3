40|$|For years, power {{distribution}} companies (DISCOMs) have {{been struggling to}} cope with the anarchy at rural feeders which heightens during the peak irrigation period, with both farmers and non-farmer community suffering alike. One of the ways to tackle this situation is to give more power hours to farmers during the peak season which a few companies do. While states like Gujarat and Punjab opted for feeder separation to improve rural power quality, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh have resorted to giving temporary connections to farmers during peak irrigation period. This paper analyses whether the temporary agricultural connections mitigate the anarchy during <b>peak</b> <b>demand</b> <b>period</b> and how.

It is based on a separate modelling of the water supply and demand, including (i) a simplified representation of the hydraulic structure, characteristics and organizational parameters of the scheme, (ii) an assessment of the water demand of farms based on their total irrigated area, cropping pattern and irrigation practices, (iii) a farm typology, (iv) a confrontation between water demand and supply at each node of the scheme from pumping plants to tertiary canals, and (v) calculation of response factors between supply and demand during the <b>peak</b> <b>demand</b> <b>period.</b> "What-if" scenarios are simulated in order to enhance the stakeholders' capacity to plan strategic decisions such as water delivery allocation rules or infrastructure investments.

A new philosophy on basin -wide groundwater withdrawals was implemented along with additional programs designed to evaluate the effect of our continued dependence on local groundwater sources.

40|$|SIMIS (the FAO Scheme Irrigation Management Information System) is a {{decision}} support system that integrates tools and performance indicators to facilitate the planning and management of irrigation schemes. The authors used SIMIS to compute performance indicators in an irrigation scheme in Southern Spain {{that were used to}} identify distribution system constraints affecting the flexibility of water deliveries and to identify scheme sectors where deliveries could not meet the predicted crop water demands. Applying SIMIS, the authors and the irrigation scheme manager evaluated measures to overcome the constraints for future irrigation campaigns, and to refine the water orders made every 2 weeks to the basin authority. On the other hand, SIMIS presented limitations to the evaluation of on-demand delivery schedules. To overcome these limitations, an external model, developed outside SIMIS, showed that the current distribution network of the scheme has the capacity to deliver water on-demand only if a slight water deficit is accepted during the <b>peak</b> <b>demand</b> <b>period.</b> The analysis showed that by relaxing the stringency of the quality of operation of on-demand systems, rotation systems may be transformed into on-demand systems without changing their structures. This analysis could also be done using Clément's hypothesis, but doing so resulted in overestimates of the quality of operation and of the relative irrigation supply. ...|$|E
40|$|A brood {{manipulation}} {{experiment on}} great tits Parus major {{was performed to}} {{study the effects of}} nestling age and brood size on parental care and offspring survival. Daily energy expenditure (DEE) of females feeding nestlings of 6 and 12 days of age was measured using the doubly-labeled water technique. Females adjusted their brooding behavior to the age of the young. The data are consistent dth the idea that brooding behavior was determined primarily by the thermoregulatory requirements of the brood. Female DEE did not differ with nestling age; when differences in body mass were controlled for, it was lower during the brooding period than later. In enlarged broods, both parents showed significantly higher rates of food provisioning to the brood. Female DEE was affected by brood size manipulation, and it did not level off with brood size. There was no significant effect of nestling age on the relation between DEE and manipulation. Birds were able to raise a larger brood than the natural brood size, although larger broods suffered from increased nestling mortality rates during the <b>peak</b> <b>demand</b> <b>period</b> of the nestlings. Offspring condition at fledging was negatively affected by brood size manipulation, but recruitment rate per brood was positively related to brood size, suggesting that the optimal brood size exceeds the natural brood size in this population...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale {{solar thermal}} {{cogeneration}} shows promise {{as an effective}} way to get increased benefit out of a given solar availability, since it does not waste potential during summer after the water capacity is heated. In this paper a scroll expander is tested in a small organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and used to calibrate a static expander model. Validation of the scroll expander model shows agreement generally within 10 % for the shaft power, 5 % for the rotational speed and 6 K for the exhaust temperature, with some outliers at very low pressure ratios. This calibrated model is then incorporated into a larger dynamic model of a solar thermal cogeneration system, designed for some larger dwelling unit or small commercial establishment that requires a larger volume of hot water. An annual simulation is conducted using a collector area of 50 m 2, and the scroll expander shows a maximum isentropic efficiency of 59 % while the ORC efficiency is 3. 47 %. The total energy produced is 1710 kWh and the hot water available is on average 2540 L/day.

Therefore, pumped storage plants can be an ideal solution to meet the current energy needs of the country. Most of these storage plants make use of a single unit acting both as turbine as well as pump; hence aptly called Reversible Pump Turbine (RPT). This paper explains the new application concept for use of such RPTs as auxiliary unit to supplement the main power unit in hydropower plants of Nepal. It also summarizes the design process of such runner {{with reference to the}} parameters available at Chilime region in central part of Nepal. The design is performed in two steps. The first step is an analytical design, which gives an initial geometry of the RPT runner. The process resulted in a runner of larger size than a normal Francis runner for same parameters since it has to work as pump as well. The next step is an optimization procedure involving CFD analysis under which the simulation of the RPT in turbine mode yielded an efficiency of 88. 71 %. The detail laboratory experiments on a model RPT will be performed later to validate the results from CFD and determine the characteristics of the designed runner at different mode and operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{a production}} station that faces fluctuating demand with seasonal pattern. The cumulative capacity exceeds the cumulative demand in a one year period; however, its weekly capacity {{is not able}} to meet the weekly demand during the peak season. In addition, a Kanban system has been employed at the station, and the management is concerned about the appropriateness of the Kanban bin levels as well as the efficiency of the resulting production flow. Having characterized the station as a multiple part type system with mixed low and high volume manufacturing, the lead strategy for long-term capacity planning was applied to fulfill excess demand. In the second stage of the project, the Setup-Enhanced Control-Point Policy was adapted to derive an effective scheduling policy, and ultimately the production control parameters were employed to design a suitable Kanban system. With a proper planning technique and Kanban system developed for the station, it achieved a 30 % reduction in overall operation cost by avoiding extra workload during <b>peak</b> <b>demand</b> <b>period,</b> and its performance can be greatly improved with effective and automatic production scheduling, as well as better utilization of manufacturing resources at the station level.
