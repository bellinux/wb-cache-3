The second {{generation}} Smart Fortwo has been awarded 4 out of 5 stars in the Euro NCAP Adult Occupant Protection and 2 out of 4 stars in the Pedestrian <b>protection</b> <b>test,</b> but was not tested for Child Occupant Protection as it has no rear seats. The original Smart was awarded 3 out of 5 stars for Adult Occupant Protection. In American tests using a five-star rating, Smart cars received a four-star safety rating for the driver from a front impact, and a five-star safety rating for the driver for a side impact.

40|$|This white book {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the issues surrounding the impact of increasing levels of DER on the generator and network protection and the resulting necessary improvements in <b>protection</b> <b>testing</b> practices. Particular focus is placed on ever increasing inverter-interfaced DER installations and the challenges of utility network integration. This white book should {{also serve as a}} starting point for specifying DER <b>protection</b> <b>testing</b> requirements and procedures. A comprehensive review of international DER protection practices, standards and recommendations is presented. This is accompanied by the identiﬁ cation of the main performance challenges related to these protection schemes under varied network operational conditions and the nature of DER generator and interface technologies. Emphasis is placed on the importance of dynamic testing that can only be delivered through laboratory-based platforms such as real-time simulators, integrated substation automation infrastructure and ﬂ exible, inverter-equipped testing microgrids. To this end, the combination of ﬂ exible network operation and new DER technologies underlines the importance of utilising the laboratory testing facilities available within the DERlab Network of Excellence. This not only informs the shaping of new <b>protection</b> <b>testing</b> and network integration practices by end users but also enables the process of de-risking new DER protection technologies. In order to support the issues discussed in the white paper, a comparative case study between UK and German DER <b>protection</b> and scheme <b>testing</b> practices is presented. This also highlights the level of complexity associated with standardisation and approval mechanisms adopted by different countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{immunoglobulin}} {{response of}} rabbits to the flagells (H), somatic (O), and protective antigens {{of a highly}} protective strain of Clostridium chauvoei was studied using antisera that had been fractionated by Sephadex G- 200 chromatography. The H antigen elicited the characteristic agglutinin response to a protein antigen [...] early production of 19 S globulin followed by persistent 7 S globulin production. The O antigen stimulated a transient agglutinin response which was detected in both the 19 S and 7 S serum fractions. Protective antibody was assayed by passive <b>protection</b> <b>tests</b> in mice. Using these tests the protective activity of the rabbit sera {{was found to be}} confined exclusively to the 7 S serum fractions. Purified immunoglobulin G, prepared by DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the above sera, was also tested and found to confer considerable passive protection on mice.
