For though the {{supporters}} of the common hypothesis may argue {{that it was necessary}} for the sake of stability that the planets should go round the Sun in the same direction and nearly in one plane, they cannot thus account for the direction of the axial motions.[16] The mechanical equilibrium would not have been interfered with, had the Sun been without any rotatory movement; or had he revolved on his axis in a direction opposite to that in which the planets go round him; or in a direction at right angles to the average plane of their orbits. With equal safety the motion of the Moon round the Earth might have been the reverse of the Earth's motion round its axis; or the motions of Jupiter's satellites might similarly have been at variance with his axial motion; or those of Saturn's satellites with his. As, however, none of these alternatives have been followed, the uniformity must be considered, in this case as in all others, evidence of subordination to some general law--implies what we call natural causation, as distinguished from arbitrary arrangement.|$|E

40|$|Ramadan, {{the ninth}} month of Islamic lunar calendar, {{is marked by}} {{religious}} ritual of fasting from early dawn till sunset by Muslims. Islam has allowed many categories of people to be exempt totally or temporarily from fasting. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes face possible major metabolic risks including hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia {{with or without the}} risk of impending ketosis, dehydration, and thrombosis. Diabetics can be stratified into four categories based on their level of risk associated with fasting. The recommended ruling for persons in categories 1 and 2 is that they are prohibited from fasting to prevent harming themselves based on the certainty or the <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> that harm will occur, whereas the recommended ruling for those in categories 3 and 4 is that they should fast. The strategies to ensure safety of diabetics who are planning to fast include Ramadan-focused patient education, pre-Ramadan medical assessment, following a healthy diet and physical activity pattern, physician-recommended modifications in medication protocol and therapeutic recommendations and checking blood glucose as and when required...|$|E

40|$|In {{assessing}} delictual {{damages the}} plaintiff is burdened with {{the duty to}} prove loss with a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability,</b> including uncertain future loss. In quantifying such a claim an actuary {{is often used to}} make actuarial calculations based on proven facts and realistic assumptions regarding the future. The role of the actuary is to guide the court in the calculations to be made. Relying on its wide judicial discretion the court will have the final say regarding the correctness of the assumptions on which these calculations are based. The court should give detailed reasons if any assumptions or parts of the calculations made by the actuary are rejected. It should preferably refrain from making its own calculations if an actuary is involved and should rather instruct the actuary to do recalculations if necessary. It does, however, fall within the wide discretion of the court to make a general contingency adjustment after the basic calculations have been accepted. In assessing delictual damages it is the duty of the court to ensure that both objective and subjective factors are considered in such a manner that the assessment may be regarded as an application of "fair" mathematics...|$|E
40|$|Contingencies can be {{described}} as uncertain circumstances of a positive or negative nature which, independent of the defendant’s conduct and if they should realise, would probably influence a person’s health, income, earning capacity, quality of life, life expectancy or dependency on support in future or could have done so in the past, and which consequently {{must be taken into account}} in a fair and realistic manner in the quantification of damages. Essential to this definition is the element of certainty or uncertainty with which an incident can be predicted that is linked to the degree of probability that the occurrence will take place or would have taken place if it had not been for the accident. Two particular theories could be relevant in the establishment of the degree of probability, namely the Pascalian model in which a pure mathematical approach is followed and the Baconian model in which an inductive approach is followed. Because the Baconian model is less stringent, it appears to be more suitable for determining and applying contingencies. In civil law the burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff and the expected measure of proof is a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability.</b> It has become clear that the terms 'burden of proof' and 'measure of proof' according to their strict evidentiary meaning, do not fit naturally into the theory of proof in the case of contingencies. If the amount of damages has to be adjusted for contingencies, it does not mean necessarily that the burden of proof in respect of the adjustment always rests upon the plaintiff. In principle, one can say that the plaintiff must adduce evidence of contingencies that can increase damages and the defendant of contingencies that can reduce damages. The measure of proof also is relaxed in cases where uncertainty prevails, for instance in the case of future loss...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on the {{relevant}} psychology literature, three procedural variables that could influence the auditors' information processing when making going concern opinion decisions were identified. These procedural variables are the decision frame, {{the order in}} which evidence is evaluated and the initial belief held by the auditor. With respect to the decision frame, it was predicted that belief revision after processing contrary information (mitigating factors) is higher for auditors who frame their initial hypothesis in terms of viability (failure). This prediction hinges on the assumption that more weight is put on disconfirmatory information than on confirmatory information, holding "information content" constant. Second, denoting P(C) as the auditors' judgment just before processing contrary information (mitigating factors), it was hypothesized that contrary information (mitigating factors) has a bigger effect on belief revision as ex ante P(C) increases (decreases). Finally with respect to the order of evaluating evidence, it was posited that recency effects occur in belief revision and that these recency effects will be manifest in the auditors' opinion decision. These predictions were tested in a field experiment using 70 experienced auditors from four Big Eight firms. Results of the experiment provided support for the predictions relating to the initial belief and {{the order in which}} evidence was evaluated. However, the predictions relating to the decision frame were not supported. Furthermore, the study indicated that auditors exhibited considerable variability in their interpretation of substantial doubt (the standard of proof in SAS 59). Whereas some auditors interpreted this requirement as the <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability,</b> others required a substantially higher level of probability as a threshold of proof for issuing unqualified opinions. Incidentally, it was discovered that this variability was partly accounted for by auditors' firm affiliation. Implications of these results for the audit review, the standard setting process and the nature of expertise in auditing are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In civil disputes, the {{plaintiff}} must prove his case by the <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the evidence. To reach this standard, {{the plaintiff}} accumulates evidence by combining facts. I compare two models of this process. Decision makers can adapt their behavior for improved results, as assumed in some psychological models. Adaptive models predict that court practice {{will allow the}} plaintiff to combine facts according to relatively simple rules. Alternatively, decision makers can optimize their behavior for best results, as assumed in most economic models. Optimization models predict that court practice will require the plaintiff to combine facts in ways that conform to the laws <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> theory. The two predictions contradict each other when simple, adaptive rules violate the laws <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> theory. I show that actual practice in a California court allows the plaintiff to combine facts according to relatively simple rules that sometimes violate the laws <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> theory. Adaptation is, consequently, a better descriptive theory than optimization. Procedures that violate the laws <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> theory, however, are vulnerable to withering criticism. Given that trials proceed with deliberate speed under expert guidance, suboptimal adaptations are irrational. Optimization, consequently, is a better normative theory than adaptation...|$|R
