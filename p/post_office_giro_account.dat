50|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, most {{countries}} in continental Europe had a postal giro service. The world's first <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>giro</b> banking system was established in Austria in the late 19th century by the Österreichische Postsparkasse. By the time the British Postgiro was conceived, the Dutch Postgiro was very well established with virtually every adult having a postgiro account with very large and well used postgiro operations in most other countries in Europe and Scandinavia.|$|R
50|$|After the {{election}} for the Løgting in November 1974, the government {{decided that the}} postal service in the Faroes should {{be taken over by}} the Faroese Home Rule. In 1975, the Danish government and the Faroese government began negotiations on the takeover issue. The results of these negotiations led to the Faroese government taking over the postal service in the Faroes as of 1 April 1976. This new institution received the name Postverk Føroya (Post of the Faroes). A ram's horn was chosen as the institution's logo. As a natural consequence of the takeover, two new departments were established within the Faroese postal system: the Postage Stamp Department and the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Giro.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bundespost was {{developed}} {{according to a}} three-tier principle common in public administration in the Federal Republic of Germany. The upper stage consisted of the federal ministry for the <b>post</b> <b>office</b> and telecommunication system. The middle stage consisted of regional directorates (Bundespostdirektionen) and the state <b>post</b> <b>office</b> management (Landespostdirektion) under western Allied authority in West Berlin (see Deutsche Post Berlin (Deutsche Bundespost Berlin)) as of 1949/1955). The <b>post</b> <b>office</b> technical central office, telecommunication engineering central office, postal administration social <b>office,</b> and <b>post</b> <b>offices)</b> were on an equal level with the directorates. The lower stage consisted of <b>post</b> <b>office</b> branches, postal <b>giro</b> (akin to a checking account) savings bank offices and telecommunications office branches.|$|R

50|$|The term Girocheque {{quickly became}} {{associated}} with welfare dependence. Worse still, {{the name was}} often associated with Girobank in the public psyche, making little distinction between the welfare cheque and the business. Having a <b>giro</b> <b>account</b> meant writing one's own girocheques and although recipients of girocheques {{did not need to}} have (and most did not have) a <b>giro</b> <b>account,</b> girocheques issued by personal customers were sometimes viewed with suspicion by the recipient. They also carried the name and address of the issuer, making them very noticeably different from the cheques issued by other banks and noticeably similar to welfare girocheques.|$|R
