5|$|Albeit disorganized, Emily and its {{remnants}} dropped extensive precipitation {{across the}} Dominican Republic, with maximum totals {{of up to}} 21inches (528mm) recorded in Neiba. Among other consequences, severe flooding and isolated mudslides left 56 communities isolated from surrounding areas. The storm displaced up to 7,534 <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> the country, of which 1,549 sought refuge in storm shelters. Consecutive hours of rainfall resulted in the overflow of some rivers, although no significant damage was reported to adjacent areas. Offshore, squalls generated rough waves that briefly affected boating operations and oceanside homes. To the east of Santo Domingo, two men drowned after getting caught in a swollen river.

The studio looked at several different engines for building the game, but opted with Unity early on as it had a low barrier of entry, provided support for the main mobile platforms, and some members of the development team had previous experience creating projects in the game engine. An initial working prototype and a basic level editor were developed in a few days and after two weeks the first version of the game was presented to the remainder of the studio.|$|E

Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the government more accessible to the <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> the state.|$|E

5|$|September 17, 2003– Hurricane Isabel tracks {{south and}} west of the state, causing {{moderate}} to severe damage. Along the Eastern Shore, the hurricane produces a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay side in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The large size of Isabel causes strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and a gust of 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge. Over 1.4million <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> the state lose electric power {{at some point during}} the storm. One death in Maryland is attributed to the hurricane, and over 200injuries are reported. In all, damage is estimated at over $530million (2003USD, $621million 2008USD).

5|$|The 1909 Monterrey {{hurricane}} {{was one of}} {{the deadliest}} Atlantic tropical cyclones on record, killing an estimated 4,000 <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> Mexico. Originating from a tropical storm east of the Leeward Islands on August20, the storm tracked west-northwest, entering the Caribbean Sea as a minimal hurricane the next day. After striking Hispaniola on August23, the hurricane made another landfall in eastern Cuba before reentering the Caribbean. Once back over open water, the storm intensified into a Category3 hurricane and moved across the northern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula. By August26, the storm had emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a weakened, but regrouping system. It attained its peak winds of 120mph (185km/h) that evening. Maintaining this intensity, the system made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas late on August27 and rapidly dissipated the following afternoon.|$|E

5|$|The church {{held the}} right to conduct the marriages of <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> Manchester, not only from within its parish, until 1874. Despite this, there were no such {{services}} for the first 35 years of its existence, {{perhaps because of the}} continued popularity of the Collegiate Church as a venue for weddings but probably because the latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other local churches, which effectively doubled the cost of being married at St John's rather than at the Collegiate Church. Later, after the rights of the Collegiate Church were curtailed, some weeks saw more than 100 marriage services at St John's in the years just before 1874.|$|E

The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> the San Juan Basin.

5|$|Arlene brought strong {{thunderstorms}} and showers to much {{of eastern}} Mexico, with gale-force winds along adjacent coastlines. Upon landfall in Veracruz, Arlene produced wind speeds to 60mph (100km/h) and up to 9.11in (231.5mm) of rainfall. The winds and rain uprooted trees and caused extensive flooding, prompting at least 1,786 <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> the state to evacuate their homes. A total of 67 landslides {{took place in the}} state; one such landslide collapsed two houses in Tlalnelhuayocan, killing one inhabitant and injuring 10others. Mudslides and rockfall also uprooted trees and damaged eight cars in Banerilla, though no injuries were linked to the incident. In Tihuatlán, a rescue worker was killed during the passage of the storm. Overall, Arlene affected 3,358residences across 50municipalities in Veracruz; about 2,000homes were damaged in El Higo. Continued downpours brought on the overflow of 28rivers, as well as the isolation of 116communities statewide. Other effects in Veracruz included considerable infrastructural failure, localized land subsidence, and three damaged schools in Coacoatzintla. The costs of road reconstructions totaled Mex$126million (US$10.2million).

5|$|The 1909 Grand Isle {{hurricane}} was a {{large and}} deadly Category3 hurricane that caused severe damage and killed more than 400 <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> Cuba and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Forming out of a tropical disturbance just south of Hispaniola on September13, 1909, the initial depression slowly intensified as it moved west-northwest towards Jamaica. Two days later, the system attained tropical storm intensity and turned northwestward towards Cuba. On September16, it attained {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale and further strengthened to attain winds of 100mph (155km/h) before making landfall in Pinar del Río Province, Cuba on September18. After a briefly weakening over land, the system regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico, with peak winds reaching 120mph (195km/h) the following day. After only slightly weakening, the hurricane increased in forward motion and made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana on September21. The system quickly lost strength after moving over land, dissipating the following day over Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Thurman {{played an}} active role in {{establishing}} international student organizations to help prevent foreign students feeling isolated while studying abroad. She organized one of the first international scholarship programs for African-American women. She studied racism and the effects of prejudice on various <b>people</b> <b>throughout</b> the world, making two round-the-world trips in her lifetime. She wrote books and newspaper articles to preserve black heritage, and initiated the publishing efforts of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) by founding the Aframerican Women’s Journal. In addition to writing the second ever history of black Californians, in 1958 Thurman published a cookbook laced with historical information about black professional women at a time when African Americans had few civil rights. Recognizing that there was little academic interest in black women's history at the time, Thurman used the marketing ploy of food to report on the lives of black women who were not domestics. She participated in international peace and feminist conferences, and in 1945 attended the San Francisco Conference for the founding of the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. Thurman also established museums such as the Museum of Afro-American History in Boston in 1963.|$|E
