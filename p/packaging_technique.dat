50|$|Wafer-level {{packaging}} {{is implemented}} before wafer dicing, {{as shown in}} Fig. 3(a), {{and is based on}} anodic, metal diffusion, metal eutectic, glass frit, polymer adhesive, and silicon fusion wafer bonding. The selection of a wafer-level <b>packaging</b> <b>technique</b> is based on balancing the thermal expansion coefficients of the material layers of the RF MEMS component and those of the substrates to minimize the wafer bow and the residual stress, as well as on alignment and hermeticity requirements. Figures of merit for wafer-level packaging techniques are chip size, hermeticity, processing temperature, (in)tolerance to alignment errors and surface roughness. Anodic and silicon fusion bonding do not require an intermediate layer, but do not tolerate surface roughness. Wafer-level packaging techniques based on a bonding technique with a conductive intermediate layer (conductive split ring) restrict the bandwidth and isolation of the RF MEMS component. The most common wafer-level packaging techniques are based on anodic and glass frit wafer bonding. Wafer-level packaging techniques, enhanced with vertical interconnects, offer the opportunity of three-dimensional integration.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, perfect {{magnetic}} conductor (PMC) -based <b>packaging</b> <b>technique</b> {{was used}} to improve the isolation performance among various microwave circuit components such as high-gain amplifier chains.

These mechanical systems contain electronics that may operate {{during and after}} the high shock environment and that must be protected from the high shock environments. A study has been started to improve the <b>packaging</b> <b>techniques</b> for the advanced electronics utilized in these mechanical systems because current <b>packaging</b> <b>techniques</b> are inadequate for these more sensitive electronics. In many cases, it has been found that the <b>packaging</b> <b>techniques</b> currently used not only do not mitigate the shock environment but actually amplify the shock environment. An ambitious goal for this packaging study is to avoid amplification and possibly attenuate the shock environment before it reaches the electronics contained in the various mechanical system. As part of the investigation of <b>packaging</b> <b>techniques,</b> a two part study of shock mitigating materials is being conducted.
