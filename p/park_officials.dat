5|$|Since the {{national}} park's creation, debates have arisen on its {{management and the}} impacts on {{the population of the}} upland. Inhabitants of the area criticized management for not respecting their history and traditions, and cited farming activities banned on several occasions. <b>Park</b> <b>officials</b> maintained that every activity was possible under certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; <b>park</b> <b>officials</b> have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. <b>Park</b> <b>officials</b> are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E

5|$|Cedar Fair {{purchased}} the park from Six Flags in 2004 for $145 million. They announced intentions of returning {{the park to}} its roots as a family-oriented amusement park. The efforts to downsize the park eventually led to X-Flight's removal. On November 22, 2006, Geauga Lake <b>park</b> <b>officials</b> announced that X-Flight was being dismantled {{to be sent to}} another unspecified Cedar Fair property. Moving the ride would take some time, as the final sections of track and supports wouldn't be removed until March 2007.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, <b>park</b> <b>officials</b> implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, the {{conservative}} {{majority in the}} Regional Council of Réunion with president Didier Robert announced plans to transform the national park into a regional nature park. Too restrictive rules, which hindered tourism development, was cited as a motive. A regional nature park, unlike a national park, functions {{on the basis of}} mutual agreements and has no power to establish its own regulations. <b>Park</b> <b>officials</b> and opposition politicians rejected the plan, saying it would threaten the island's biodiversity, the World Heritage listing, and critical access to state funding. It would be the first case of a national park in France being downgraded. In September 2016, the national park's director, Marylène Hoarau, announced her withdrawal upon pressure from Ségolène Royal, head of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. This led the park's president, Daniel Gonthier, to suspect political interference; Hoarau had criticised Robert for launching a call for proposals {{on the future of the}} park. In an interview,Robert denied involvement in Hoarau's departure and criticised the minister for her decision.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} history of the park, {{visitors}} were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. Visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the bears, who had learned to beg for food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, <b>park</b> <b>officials</b> changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe bears in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. The eighth recorded bear-related death in the park's history occurred in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because {{of their ability to}} produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after <b>park</b> <b>officials</b> deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
5|$|The United States Forest Service made {{it their}} highest {{priority}} {{fire at the}} time because of the threat to local communities and its proximity to Yosemite National Park. Though Giant Sequoia trees, {{some of the biggest}} and oldest living things on Earth, are very fire-tolerant and need fire to reproduce, concerns rose as the fire approached them. <b>Park</b> <b>officials</b> set sprinklers to help protect nearby Sequoia trees, but the sprinklers were later removed and careful low-intensity prescribed burns were used. Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the fire perimeter where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area. Smoke from the fire caused unhealthy air conditions in Reno, Nevada, and the Lake Tahoe area {{during the first week of}} the fire, forcing the cancellation of several outdoor events. School children were sent home due to smoky conditions as well. From Yosemite to the San Joaquin Valley, air quality reached unhealthy levels several times according to the National Weather Service. Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, a family camp operated by the city of Berkeley, established in 1922, was burned to the ground. Nearby Camp Tawonga suffered some damage, including the loss of three buildings. Camp Mather, operated by the city of San Francisco, suffered minor damage, as did the San Jose Camp run by the city of San Jose.|$|E

5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced <b>park</b> <b>officials</b> to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.|$|E
