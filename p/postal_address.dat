5|$|The club crest {{has been}} a rampant lion since 1936, which was also {{introduced}} by Charlie Hewitt. There have been many variations of the lion; {{the first was a}} single red lion, often mistakenly said to be chosen because of the club's Scottish roots. The lion bore a striking resemblance to signs used by pubs named The Red Lion. From 1956 to 1974 Millwall's crest was two leaping red lions facing each other. Former chairman Theo Paphitis brought back the badge in 1999, where it was used for a further eight years. The current crest is a leaping lion, which first appeared on a Millwall kit in 1979. It remained until 1999 and was re-introduced again in 2007. The club mascot is a giant lion called Zampa, so named after Zampa Road, the <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> of The Den.|$|E
