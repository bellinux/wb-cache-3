This paper analyzes the Galapagos Sea cucumber fishery {{over the past decade}} and the reasons for its management pitfalls and chronic over fishing, and proposes an improved strategy for estimating stock size and harvest potential. Based on the historical distribution of the fishing fleet and past fishery surveys, 15 macrozones were defined; their areas were estimated from the coastline to the 30 m isobaths and the numbers of sample replicates per macrozone were calculated for a density estimate precision of ± 25 %. Overall stock size was calculated by summing over all macrozones and was multiplied by 0. 122 to obtain the annual quota. This multiplier was derived by inserting an exploitation rate of E= 0. 3 and a published natural mortality value of M= 0. 17 into Cadimas formula, thereby obtaining a more conservative <b>precautionary</b> <b>quota</b> estimate. Pre-fishery stock densities in 2009 were below the legal threshold value and the fishery remained closed. Mean densities were significantly lower in the deeper (> 15 m) than in the shallower (< 15 m) stratum, contrary to fishermen expectations.

Management {{strategy}} evaluation (MSE) is {{a methodology}} which allows {{to compare the}} efficiency of different management strategies {{in order to ensure}} the sustainability, in particular those based on viable control theory. Classic strategies (like precautionary approach of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES) were compared to strategies defined from a viability control model for the Peruvian anchovy, which provides the biomass levels B which can be sustainable managed (viability kernel) and its related sustainable yields. Five management strategies (E 1 [...] E 5) were considered to define the total allowable catch Y* for the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) : E 1) social quota (Y* = Ymin), E 2) ICES <b>precautionary</b> <b>quota,</b> E 3) maximum viable quota Y*=Ymax(B), E 4) maximum precautionary viable quota and, E 5) half precautionary viable quota. We used five indicators for sustainability, related to the risk of collapse and the mean and variability of yields and biomasses. Two scenarios for initial biomasses were considered (healthy stock and postcollapse recovering stock). The analyses were done with Monte Carlo simulations, with 10 000 simulations per scenario and strategy. Uncertainty was incorporated in the quota implementation, simulating the variability of discards and illegal catches. The effect of the enviroment during 1963 [...] 1984 was considered by changing the stock-recruitment parameters during El Niño events. We found that the half precautionary viable quota (E 5) could avoid the anchoveta fishery collapse in 1972 [...] 1973, allowing yields greater than the social quota. Also, the ICES precautionary strategy (E 2) did not ensure the sustainability of the stock during El Niño events. We determine that a one year fishery moratorium after the fishery collapse would have been necessary to return to the viability kernel, allowing a sustainable management thereafter. We conclude that the viability kernel and viable yields are useful tools for designing management strategies which ensure the sustainability of natural resources...|$|E
