40|$|Most recent {{research}} in the synthesis of separation systems {{has been focused on}} the development of more rigorous procedures for the design and synthesis of specific unit operations, rather than the synthesis of these units {{as a part of the}} overall flowsheet. Furthermore, many of the chemical process used in the production of commodity and specialty chemicals are characterized by many reaction steps with separations required between each step. The coupling of the reaction and separation steps has a significant impact on the recycle and separation system structures. A completely integrated hierarchical procedure has been developed for the conceptual design of vapor-liquid separation systems found in multiple reaction step processes. ^ A new decomposition procedure is presented for determining the general structure of the separation system for processes involving reactions which occur in vapor-liquid-liquid-solid phase mixtures. The interactions of the separation subsystems for; vapor recovery, solid recovery, and liquid separations are identified, including process recycles between subsystems. The vapor recovery system and distillation sequence are then synthesized, the dominant process design variables are identified, the size and cost of the process units are determined, and the economic potential is calculated. Alternatives can then be quickly compared and ranked. Design procedures have been implemented in an expert system environment for the synthesis of gas membrane, condensation (high pressure or low temperature), and complex distillation columns (sidestream, side rectifier, and side stripper columns) separations. ^ Finally, a procedure is presented for assessing the incentive for the combining of distillation systems in multiple step reaction processes. Dilute mixture separations generally represent the highest separation costs in the distillation system. The <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> distillation separations can lead to better separations by reducing flow imbalances and dilute mixtures in the separation system feed. ^ A hybrid of object-oriented and rule-based techniques has been used in the development and implementation of the procedure in PIPII, a computer-aided design tool which can rapidly generate process flowsheet alternatives and estimate the optimum range of the process conditions. The hierarchical nature of the procedure quickly prunes the number of viable alternatives which must be examined for a given process. The procedures, reasoning, and methods are thoroughly discussed within. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRural {{areas have}} been {{subjected}} to a strong pressure of urbanization which reorganizes landscape mosaics in creating new ecological interfaces: garden/fallow land. These latter are the place of specific floristic dynamics through the movement <b>of</b> cultivated <b>plants</b> from garden to neighboring habitat. In order to understand these ecological processes, the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> cultivated <b>plants</b> was firstly characterized in Mediterranean gardens. Then, the escaped garden plants and the factors explaining their presence in post-cultural fallow lands were identified with a spatial analysis of two hierarchical levels: the local structure of fallow lands is related to a well adapted <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> escaped garden <b>plants</b> to the Mediterranean climatic and edaphic constraints. The species richness <b>of</b> escaped garden <b>plants</b> in fallow lands was also mainly associated with four landscape variables (41 %) corresponding to the proximity and the density of gardens and the openness of landscape around the fallow lands. The dispersal process occurs mainly over short distance. Three local factors related to vegetation structure and topo-edaphism conditions explain 4, 8 % of total variation.

30|$|The {{nitrogen}} use efficiency (NUE) by the wetland vegetable crops {{could conceivably}} limit {{the loss of}} N from applied manure through gaseous emissions of N 2 O from soil. N is often cited as a limiting factor for vegetable growth in sub-tropical Africa. However, under conditions of elevated soil N, vegetable crops exhibit luxury consumption of N, leading to elevated tissue N concentration. While this <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> N may have benefits for vegetable plants if light levels change, it may also {{increase the risk of}} vegetable aboveground biomass quality (De Lannoy 2001). The differences between dry matter and uptake of N by the crops subjected to single basal applications and those receiving split applications of manure was smaller {{at the end of the}} experiment. This trend in the uptake of N by the crops is attributable to the initial abundance of N-rich easily decomposable organic compounds in the manure in plots that received single applications of cattle manure in four cropping events. Available forms of N became abundant in the wetland soil upon microbial decomposition of the nitrogenous compound pools, which increased root growth for the uptake of N.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the seasonal dynamics <b>of</b> biomass and <b>plant</b> nitrogen (N) content under three grazing intensities (light grazing – LG: 1. 2, moderate grazing – MG: 2. 0, and heavy grazing – HG: 2. 9 yaks ha– 1) in representative alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Differentiation in grazing intensity in the study area started since 1997 and has continued to the present time. Plant samples were collected in the middle of June, August and September. The highest aboveground biomass occurred at the MG site for both August and September. Over the growing season, belowground biomass (0 – 30 cm) increased as grazing intensity increased. The total belowground biomass averaged over all sampling dates was 1226, 1908 and 2244 g m– 2 for LG site, MG site and HG site, which accounted for 75, 81 and 88 % of total biomass, respectively. The results suggested that grazing intensity changed biomass allocation pattern between aboveground and belowground parts <b>of</b> <b>plants.</b> Higher grazing intensity resulted in higher N concentration in both live and dead aboveground biomass over the study period. Increased grazing intensity tended to increase plant N content averaged over all sampling dates, which were 17. 9 g m– 2, 23. 8 g m– 2 and 27. 6 g m– 2 in LG site, MG site and HG site.

Effective chemical control of the CLM is limited as the feeding larvae are protected by the leaf cuticle mainly in mines of immature foliage and the pupal stage is also protected by the rolled leaf margins (Jones 2001; Beattie 2004). Several pressures as pesticide resistance has accelerated the search for safe environmentally, toxicologically, selective and efficacious pesticides (Weinzierl and Henn 1991; Dias et al. 2005; Amiri-Besheli 2008, 2009). Biopesticides, including botanicals, can offer a safe and effective alternative to conventional insecticides controlling major insect pests. Botanicals are a promising source of pest control compounds. The <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> possessing insecticidal substances is enormous (FAO 1992; Jacobson 1989). These have generated remarkable interest in recent years as potential sources of natural insect control agents. Over 2000 species <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> are known to possess different degrees of insecticidal activity (Jacobson 1975). However, a few plant-based pesticides have already been utilized as plant protection products (Isman 2006). Several secondary plant products represent a large reservoir of chemical structures with biological activity against pests in form of pesticides (Grainage and Ahmed 1988; Schmutterer 1990; Lowery and Isman 1994; Miller and Uetz 1998). Throughout history, plant products have been successfully exploited as insecticides, insect repellents, insect antifeedants (Lydon and Duke 1989) or as altering insect feeding behavior, growth, development, and behavior during mating and oviposition (Yang and Tang 1988).|$|R

40|$|International audiencePlants {{constitute}} key nutritional {{resources for}} many organisms on Earth and therefore interact with multiple biotic partners ranging from antagonists to mutualists. Plants are under selection pressure to enhance interactions with mutualists while reducing interactions with antagonists. As allocation strategies are constrained by a limiting <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> nutrients, <b>plants</b> {{are faced with}} a trade-off between allocation of resources to growth versus defence (Herms & Mattson 1992). In this context, it is interesting to see that plant growth and defence can be regulated by similar phytohormones (Fig. 1). Various community members can contribute to plant growth, while others attack plants and need to be countered by effective defences that may be induced by the attackers. Interactions <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> with members <b>of</b> their ecological community, once perceived by the plant, can lead to a profound metabolic reconfiguration <b>of</b> the <b>plant</b> physiology, which favours beneficial organisms and deters antagonists like pathogens or herbivores (e. g.

40|$|Aim: Interspecific {{hybridization}} {{can promote}} invasiveness of alien species. In many {{regions of the}} world, public and domestic gardens contain a huge <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> non-native <b>plants.</b> Climate change may relax constraints on their naturalization and hence facilitate hybridization with related species in the resident flora. Here, we evaluate this possible increase in hybridization risk by predicting changes in the overlap of climatically suitable ranges between a set <b>of</b> garden <b>plants</b> and their congeners in the resident flora. Location: Europe. Methods: From the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> alien garden <b>plants,</b> we selected those which (1) are not naturalized in Europe, but established outside their native range elsewhere in the world; (2) belong to a genus where interspecific hybridization has been previously reported; and (3) have congeners in the native and naturalized flora of Europe. For the resulting set of 34 alien ornamentals {{as well as for}} 173 of their European congeners, we fitted species distribution models and projected suitable ranges under the current climate and three future climate scenarios. Changes in range overlap between garden plants and congeners were then assessed by means of the true skill statistic. Results: Projections suggest that under a warming climate, suitable ranges <b>of</b> garden <b>plants</b> will increase, on average, while those of their congeners will remain constant or shrink, at least under the more severe climate scenarios. The mean overlap in ranges among congeners of the two groups will decrease. Variation among genera is pronounced; however, and for some congeners, range overlap is predicted to increase significantly. Main conclusions: Averaged across all modelled species, our results do not indicate that hybrids between potential future invaders and resident species will emerge more frequently in Europe when climate warms. These average trends do not preclude, however, that hybridization risk may considerably increase in particular genera...|$|R

We compared ecosystem C and N pools to 1 m depth among historically grazed Wyoming big sagebrush, introduced perennial crested wheatgrass, and invasive annual cheatgrass communities, to examine whether {{the quantity and quality}} <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> inputs to soil differs among vegetation types. Natural abundance δ 15 N isotope ratios were used to examine differences in ecosystem N balance. Sagebrush-dominated sites had greater C and N storage in plant biomass compared to perennial or annual grass systems, but this was predominantly due to woody biomass accumulation. Plant C and N inputs to soil were greatest for cheatgrass compared to sagebrush and crested wheatgrass systems, largely because of slower root turnover in perennial plants. The organic matter quality of roots and leaf litter (as C:N ratios) was similar among vegetation types, but lignin:N ratios were greater for sagebrush than grasses. While cheatgrass invasion has been predicted to result in net C loss and ecosystem degradation, we observed that surface soil organic C and N pools were greater in cheatgrass and crested wheatgrass than sagebrush-dominated sites. Greater biomass turnover in cheatgrass and crested wheatgrass versus sagebrush stands may result in faster rates of soil C and N cycling, with redistribution of actively cycled N towards the soil surface. Plant biomass and surface soil δ 15 N ratios were enriched in cheatgrass and crested wheatgrass relative to sagebrush-dominated sites. Source <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> available N could become 15 N enriched if faster soil N cycling rates lead to greater N trace gas losses.

40|$|Higher plants {{assimilate}} inorganic sulfate into cysteine, {{which is}} subsequently converted to methionine, {{and into a}} variety of other sulfur-containing organic compounds. To resist sulfur deficiency, plants must demonstrate physiological flexibility: the expression of an extensive set of genes and gene regulators that act in the affected pathways or signalling cascades must be delicately tuned in response to environmental challenges. To elucidate this network of interactions, we have applied an array hybridisation/transcript profiling method to Arabidopsis plants subjected to 6, 10 and 13 days of constitutive and induced sulfur starvation. The temporal expression behaviour of approximately 7200 non-redundant genes was analysed simultaneously. The experiment was designed in a way to identify statistically significant changes of gene expression based on sufficient numbers of repeated hybridisations performed with five uniform <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> material. The expression profiles were processed to select differentially expressed genes. Among the 1507 sulfur-responsive clones implicated in this way, 632 genes responded specifically to sulfur deficiency by significant over-expression. The sulfur-responsive genes were grouped according to functional categories or biosynthetic pathways. As expected, genes of the sulfur assimilation pathway were altered in expression. Furthermore, genes involved in flavonoid, auxin, and jasmonate biosynthesis pathways were upregulated in conditions of sulfur deficiency. Based on the correlative analysis of gene expression patterns, we suggest that a complex co-ordination of systematic responses to sulfur depletion is provided via integration of flavonoid, auxin and jasmonate pathway elements. Plait concept for transduction of specificity via the main non-specific signalling stream is proposed. [References: 77] 7...|$|R
40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> {{diversity}} on aboveground {{organisms and}} processes was largely studied {{but there is}} still a lack of knowledge regarding the link between plant diversity and soil characteristics. Here, we analyzed the effect <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> identity and diversity on the diversity of extractible soil organic compounds (ESOC) using 87 experimental grassland plots with different levels <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> diversity and based on a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> over 50 <b>plant</b> species. Two <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> low molecular weight organic compounds, LMW 1 and LMW 2, were characterized by GC-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. These pools include specific organic acids, fatty acids and phenolics, with more organic acids in LMW 1 and more phenolics in LMW 2. Plant effect on the diversity of LMW 1 and LMW 2 compounds was strong and weak, respectively. LMW 1 richness observed for bare soil was lower than that observed for all planted soils; and the richness of these soil compounds increased twofold when dominant plant species richness increased from 1 to 6. Comparing the richness of LMW 1 compounds observed for a range <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> mixtures and for <b>plant</b> monocultures <b>of</b> species present in these mixtures, we showed that plant species richness increases the richness of these ESOC mainly through complementarity effects among plant species associated with contrasted spectra of soil compounds. This could explain previously reported effects <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> diversity on the diversity of soil heterotrophic microorganisms...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} quantifies {{the impacts}} of climate change on the dynamics of wetland vegetation under the effect of multiple stresses, such as drought, water-logging, shade and nutrients. The effects of these stresses are investigated through a mechanistic model that captures the co-evolving nature between marsh emergent plant species and their resources (water, nitrogen, light, and oxygen). The model explicitly considers the feedback mechanisms between vegetation, light and nitrogen dynamics {{as well as the}} specific dynamics <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> leaves, rhizomes, and roots. Each plant species is characterized by three independent traits, namely leaf nitrogen (N) content, specific leaf area, and allometric carbon (C) allocation to rhizome storage, which govern the ability to gain and maintain resources as well as to survive in a particular multi-stressed environment. The modeling <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> growth incorporates C and N into the construction of leaves and roots, whose amount of new biomass is determined by the dynamic plant allocation scheme. Nitrogen is internally recycled between <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> litter, humus, microbes, and mineral N. The N dynamics are modeled using a parallel scheme, with the major modifications being the calculation of the aerobic and anoxic periods and the incorporation of the anaerobic processes. A simple hydrologic model with stochastic rainfall is used to describe the water level dynamics and the soil moisture profile. Soil water balance is evaluated at the daily time scale and includes rainfall, evapotranspiration and lateral flow to/from an external water body, with evapotranspiration loss equal to the potential value, governed by the daily average condition of atmospheric water demand. The resulting feedback dynamics arising from the coupled system of plant-soil-microbe are studied in details and species' fitnesses in the 3 -D trait space are compared across various rainfall patterns with different mean and fluctuations. The model results are then compared with those from experiments and field studies reported in the literature, providing insights about the physiological features that enable plants to thrive in different wetland environments and climate regime...|$|R
40|$|A {{transformant}} of the fungal endophyte Acremonium lolii, strain Lp 19, {{containing the}} gusA gene {{under the control}} of the constitutive Pgpd promoter was generated, and assigned the name KS 1. Analytical digests and Southern hybridisation showed that this transformant contained a single chromosomally integrated copy of the gusA gene. The transformation frequency of Lp 19 was found to be very low, and attempts to increase the transformation frequency were unsuccessful. KS 1 was used to artificially infect seedlings of several different genotypes of Lolium perenne, all of a single cultivar, 'Nui'. These seedlings were grown into mature plants, and the endophytically produced GUS enzyme was extracted from individual plant tissues. Assays were performed on the enzyme extracts, and the levels determined were used as a measure of endophyte metabolic activity. Alterations of the gusA gene in some plants was detected by Southern hybridisation. One alteration was found to result in loss of GUS activity, the other did not appear to alter gusA expression. Levels of transformed endophyte GUS activity were initially compared between clonal <b>plant</b> material <b>of</b> a single genotype. Statistical analysis revealed that no significant differences were detectable for a particular tissue between the different plants. This showed that <b>plant</b> material <b>of</b> identical genotype could be pooled for analysis without the <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> the individual <b>plants</b> having an affect on the outcome of the analysis. Next, levels of the transformed endophyte GUS activity were compared between genetically diverse perennial ryegrass <b>plants</b> <b>of</b> cultivar 'Nui'. Significant differences in GUS activity were detected in most tissues tested between the different genotypes, with only the most mature tissue displaying no detectable differences. Finally, a single <b>plant</b> <b>of</b> each of two individual genotypes was divided into several clonal plants, and the resulting mature plants were pooled in their genotypes for analysis of GUS, peramine, ergovaline and lolitrem B levels. The F test was not particularly sensitive in this experiment, and only one major difference between genotypes could be detected. Despite this, some trends emerged which were found to be consistent with those found in other studies. Metabolic activity and peramine levels were shown to be highest in the leaf sheath tissue, with levels generally decreasing with increasing tissue age. Lolitrem B was found to be highest in leaf sheath tissue also, but with levels increasing in general with tissue age. Ergovaline levels were very low in all tissues. The results presented show the potential of the use of the GUS reporter gene system to study endophyte gene expression in planta, and <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> can be carried out to allow simultaneous study of toxin expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} a new experiment, set up in Jena in spring 2002, are the effects of {{biodiversity}} on element cycles and the interaction <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> diversity with herbivores and soil fauna. The experimental design explicitly addresses criticisms provoked by previous biodiversity experiments. In particular, the choice of functional groups, the statistical separation of sampling versus complementarity effects, and testing {{for the effects of}} particular functional groups differ from previous experiments. Based on a species <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> 60 <b>plant</b> species common to the Central European Arrhenatherion grasslands, mixtures of one to 16 (60) species and of one to four plant functional groups were established on 90 plots (20 in x 20 m) with nested experiments. In order to test specific hypotheses 390 additional small-area plots (3. 5 m x 3. 5 m) were set-up. Exact replicates of all species mixtures serve to assess the variability in ecosystem responses. In a dominance experiment, the effects of interactions among nine selected highly productive species are studied. Each species is grown as monoculture replicated once...|$|R
