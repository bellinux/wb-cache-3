25|$|In the {{traditional}} retail model, borrowers visit a payday lending store and secure a small cash loan, with payment due in full at the borrower's next paycheck. The borrower writes a <b>postdated</b> <b>check</b> to the lender {{in the full}} amount of the loan plus fees. On the maturity date, the borrower is expected {{to return to the}} store to repay the loan in person. If the borrower does not repay the loan in person, the lender may redeem the check. If the account is short on funds to cover the check, the borrower may now face a bounced check fee from their bank in addition to the costs of the loan, and the loan may incur additional fees or an increased interest rate (or both) {{as a result of the}} failure to pay.|$|E
5000|$|Licensed payday advance businesses, which lend {{money at}} {{high rates of}} {{interest}} on {{the security of a}} <b>postdated</b> <b>check,</b> are often described as loan sharks by their critics due to high interest rates that trap debtors, stopping short of illegal lending and violent collection practices. Today's payday loan is a close cousin of the early 20th century salary loan, the product to which the [...] "shark" [...] epithet was originally applied, but they are now legalised in some states.|$|E
5000|$|Share {{dealings}} using postdated checks {{created a}} huge unregulated expansion of credit. The {{crash of the}} unofficial stock market finally came in August 1982, when a dealer presented a <b>postdated</b> <b>check</b> from a young Passport Office employee for payment and it bounced. A house of cards collapsed. By September 1982, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Finance ordered all dubious checks to be turned in for clearance, and shut down the Souk Al-Manakh. The official investigation summed the value of worthless outstanding checks at the equivalent of US$94 billion from about 6,000 investors. Kuwait's financial sector was badly shaken by the crash, as was the entire economy.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with s Kris Aquino in early 2009, Nina stated that she would file an estafa (fraud) case against ex-boyfriend Nyoy Volante's parents Evangeline and Oliver for not paying their debts. She added that in 2007, the couple borrowed ₱1.4 million from her. The following year, Oliver issued several checks as payment for their debt. Some of the checks, however, bounced, she said. She further stated that in July 2008, she entered into a compromise agreement with the couple under which Evangeline immediately paid her ₱300,000 in cash. The couple also agreed {{to settle the balance}} of ₱1.1 million in monthly installments—from August 20, 2008 to February 20, 2010. They later gave her nineteen <b>postdated</b> <b>checks</b> which were signed by Oliver. Nina said that although she was able to cash some of the checks, some—which totaled ₱550,000—were not honored due to insufficient funds.|$|R
5000|$|For U.S. tax purposes, cash {{payments}} {{generally are}} taken to occur {{at the time of}} payment. Payment may also occur when a person transfers property or performs a service to the payee in satisfaction of an obligation. A payment by check is normally deemed to occur when the check is delivered, as long as the check is honored on presentation by the payee. This rule also generally applies where the check is not presented to the bank until the next taxable year, and even though the payer could stop payment on the check in the meantime. [...] <b>Postdated</b> <b>checks,</b> however, are not considered payment when delivered. [...] Generally, payments by credit card take effect at the point of the sale and not when a payer is billed by the credit card company or when the payer pays the credit card company's bill. A business that reports on an accrual basis, would report income in the year of sale though payment may be received in a subsequent year.|$|R
5000|$|Nonetheless, if [...] "the {{customer}} {{has given}} notice {{to the bank}} of the <b>postdating</b> describing the <b>check</b> with reasonable certainty" [...] the Uniform Commercial Code requires that the notice to be honored. In practice, whether the check writer has any redress against the financial institution where the payee deposited the check may depend on whether it can be shown that the check was accepted over the counter without examination.|$|R
