5|$|Although {{he focuses}} on the French Revolution, the story ends in the 1880s, shortly after the Second French Empire, closely {{following}} the evolution of society and women (see also Historiography of the French Revolution). Later, he republished what was essentially is the same book but with a different title, in both French and English: La Femme et la mode. Métamorphoses de la parisienne de 1792 à 1892 or Woman and Fashion: Metamorphoses of the Parisienne 1792–1892 in the English version (1892), and Les Modes de Paris. Variations du goût et de l'esthétique de la femme, 1797–1897 (1897). According to the Westminster Review, the English edition was <b>practically</b> <b>a</b> facsimile of the French, and the translator literally wrote the sentences {{to the point of}} unintelligibility.|$|E
5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already <b>practically</b> <b>a</b> mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E

5|$|Aubame {{served as}} foreign {{minister}} under the coalition government, though in early 1963 he was {{dropped from the}} Cabinet for refusing to create a single-party Gabon. To oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February, <b>practically</b> <b>a</b> powerless post. M'ba supporters tried {{to pass a bill}} that declared that a member of parliament could only hold a single role in government. The president claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with the functions of the assembly. Aubame, however, unexpectedly resigned from the Supreme Court on 10 January 1964, complicating matters for M'ba. In a fit of rage, M'ba dissolved the National Assembly on 21 January 1964. The New York Times speculates that this was due to it not supporting M'ba in Aubame's removal.|$|E

In fact, China has always been <b>practically</b> <b>a</b> republic. It has had its dynasties of rulers, but the political unit of China has always been the village.

There was little doubt that at the time English common law crimes were recognized in these territories. However, due to problems such as doubts as to the applicability of Indian Acts, in 1871 the Straits Settlements Penal Code 1871 was enacted. It came into operation on 16 September 1872.

25|$|As {{could be}} {{imagined}} many communities were {{vying for the}} new college after the bill became law on May 22, 1895.

Fulton had the Mississippi River. But DeKalb had only the Kishwaukee River, <b>practically</b> <b>a</b> creek compared to the Rock and, of course, the Mississippi.

25|$|Archduke John {{ordered his}} {{demoralized}} army into a retreat. Moreau pursued slowly until 8 December. Then, in 15 days, his forces advanced 300km and captured 20,000 Austrians. General of Division Claude Lecourbe's Right Wing brushed aside Riesch at Rosenheim on 9 December. At Salzburg on 14 December, the archduke held off Lecourbe in a successful rearguard action. However, {{in a series}} of actions at Neumarkt am Wallersee, Frankenmarkt, Schwanenstadt, Vöcklabruck, Lambach and Kremsmünster during the following week, the Austrian army lost cohesion. Richepanse greatly distinguished himself in the pursuit. On 17 December, when Archduke Charles relieved his brother John, the Austrian army was <b>practically</b> <b>a</b> rabble. With French forces 80km from Vienna, Charles requested an armistice, which Moreau granted on 25 December. The decisive French victory at Hohenlinden set Moreau up as a potential rival to Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|E
