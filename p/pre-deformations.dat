40|$|ABSTRACT. We give a first {{contribution}} to the homogenization of many-body structures in terms of large deformation mechanics by considering some idealized many-body structures resembling so-called cordbelts like {{they are used to}} reinforce pneumatic tires. We establish and analyze a model for these structures, the subbodies of which we assume to be hyperelastic with some polyconvex energy density and moreover to initially exhibit a brittle bond with their neighbours along contacting surfaces. Kinematically, noninterpenetration of matter is accounted for by the Ciarlet-Nečas condition and we demand deformations to preserve the local orientation. As the structures compose of more and more bodies, we identify homogenization limits of the associated total energies in the sense of Γ-convergence over those special functions of bounded variation complying with the aforementioned kinematic constraints. Depending on the geometry of the considered many-body structures, their homogenization limits are subject to newly found anisotropy or even feature additional kinematic constraints. We furthermore introduce the concept of <b>pre-deformations</b> to provide approximations within the special functions of bounded variation while preserving the natural kinematic constraints of geometrically nonlinear continuum mechanics. 1...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{cause for}} interior noise in vehicles is structure-borne {{sound from the}} engine. The vibrations of the source (engine) are transmitted to the receiver structure (the vehicle) causing interior noise in the vehicle. For this reason the engine is supported by rubber isolators for passive isolation in especially the high-frequency region. To make a good judgment {{of the characteristics of}} a vibration isolator in the design process, it is useful to use numerical models. In this paper a cylindrical vibration isolator is modelled numerically with the Finite Element package ABAQUS. The investigation is split in two parts: first a nonlinear analysis is performed for different <b>pre-deformations</b> of the mount. After that, a linear harmonic analysis is superimposed on the pre-deformed isolator. The structure-borne sound is transmitted by the isolator by six degrees of freedom, so the harmonic analysis must be performed for different excitations. With the results the behavior of the isolator can be represented by dynamic stiffness matrices as function of the frequency and predeformation. These matrices can be used to model the passive isolation components as part of numerical models of hybrid isolation systems. These isolation systems describe a combination of active and passive isolation to reduce the structure-borne sound transmission to receiver structures...|$|E

Pre-strains of 6. 5 and 20 % are imposed using [1 0 0] tensile testing. During tensile <b>pre-deformation,</b> several slip systems are activated and irregularly spaced slip bands form. A trace analysis revealed the presence of several slip bands on the tensile specimen near the grips while one family of slip bands parallel to the (1 1 1) crystallographic plane were detected {{in the middle of}} the tensile specimen. From the middle of the pre-deformed tensile specimens double microshear samples were prepared using focused ion beam (FIB) machining such that the [0 - 1 - 1] (1 - 1 1) slip system could be directly activated. The results show how microshear behavior reacts to different levels of tensile <b>pre-deformation.</b> Sudden deformation events (SDEs) are observed during microshear testing. The critical stress associated with the first SDE is shown to increase with increasing <b>pre-deformation</b> as a result of an increasing number of slip bands introduced during <b>pre-deformation</b> per shear zone.

For the extraordinary mechanical properties of the composite, fiber and matrix {{as well as their}} interface are responsible [1 - 3]. The interface properties can be adjusted by a different final heat treatment temperature (HTT), the so-called graphitization, which additionally leads to cracks in the matrix due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of matrix and fibers.

The classic reference [7], describes four typical buckling modes for such structures: plate between 2 reinforcements, Flexural bending of stiffeners, torsion of stiffeners, and Total deflection of the panel. Formulations were implemented for each buckling mode. The reviewed formulae for estimating critical load for buckling of reinforced panels were implemented, and after varying the geometric parameters were set four panels, each of whom had at least the effort {{of one of the}} critical modes of buckling and described. Then, using stainless steel plate 1. 5 mm thick, were built two specimens of each type of panel, with a maximum length of 1. 20 m, considering the available equipment. Before developing the test, thickness and the resulting pre-deformation were measured. Thickness had little variation but <b>pre-deformations</b> were high, in the order of the thickness of the plate The experimental tests were conducted in the Universal Testing Machine of FIMCP, and determined the maximum force that bore the specimen. On the buckling of the plate between stiffeners, the experimental results are larger than the analytic, because the edges of the plate are welded to the reinforcements, while the analytical model considered simply supported. On the Flexural Buckling of longitudinal reinforcement, the theoretical results are higher than experimental ones, because of local failure between flange and web of the reinforcements, the distance between welds. In the torsional buckling, the plate twisted instead of the stiffeners, because side edges were not stiffen enough, and this substantially reduced the experimental effort critical. In total buckling of the panel, the longitudinal reinforcements flexes in parallel, since the edge stiffeners were not enough, resulting in a substantial difference between the results...|$|E

Dynamic feedback control methods are applied to adaptive panels using piezoelectric actuators and sensors. The investigations comprise modeling and discretization of the coupled electromechanical/aeroelastic problem as well as control feedback design and numerical simualtions. The panel is modeled as a con Karman plate with <b>pre-deformations</b> to account for geometrical imperfections. Composite structures with piezoelectric material layers are described using classical laminate theory. Aerodynamic loads are based on linear and nonlinear piston theory. Using the Finite Element Method, discrete equations of motion are derived. Flutter analysis techniques are briefly discussed and applied to two- and three-dimensional expamples. Standard state feedback control methods are investigated as candidates for panel flutter suppression. They are based on reduced modal representations of the panel linearized about its undeflected position. For direct state feedback the modal states must be known from sensor measurements. In this case a linear optimal regulator yields robust closed-loop systems. As an alternative, linear state observers are applied. Control designs based on the Linear Quadratic Gaussian / Loop Transfer Recovery and the Normalized Left Coprime Factorization methodologies are presented. They exhibit poor robustness properties {{in the face of}} parametric uncertainties such as structural nonlinearity of flight parameter variations. To avoid these disadvantages a novel output feedback approach is proposed based on collocated actuator/sensor pairs. It is designed to compensate destabilizing aerodynamic stiffness terms, whence follows its name ACAS (Active Compensation of Aerodynamic Stiffness). ACAS control is found to be robust regarding geometric structural nonlinearity and flight parameter variations. Due to its simple feedback scheme it can be implemented using an analog circuit. Two- and three-dimensional ACAS design examples are presented. Further robustness investigations include the influences of static pressure differentials, static membrane loads, geometric imperfections, in-flow angle variations, and nonlinear aerodynamic effects.

40|$|Modern inland {{vessels are}} open-top double-hull ships with {{an unusually large}} aspect ratio, a shallow draught and an {{extremely}} long cargo hold. These ships have a very low bending and torsional rigidity. Due to minor collisions, grounding in shallow water, corrosion and fatigue {{the state of the}} ship structure changes appreciably in course of time. These imperfections reduce the stability and strength of the structure. The safety against total collapse decreases. This thesis is showing the results of a systematic investigation of typical ship-constructions with the Finite-Ele-ment-Method (FEM). The failures of a complex structure like a ship hull is not entails by one item. Usually more than one negative factors are responsible. For example these are an unfavourable cargo distribution, the reduction of the plate thickness and the large imperfections during ser-vice. Normally ships are construct for a relative long working season (20 - 30 years and more). In course of this long term the features of the structure are changing considerably. Already the dimensions of new components must take care of it. As an example, the traditional calculations methods recognize an extra charge for the corrosion. To investigate the structure stability {{it is very difficult to}} take into account the imperfections (e. g. <b>pre-deformations)</b> with analytical calculation methods. This is a typical application for the FEM. The introduction part of the thesis will showing different possibilities to calculate the structural stability and strength of an inland vessel. On account to the points mentioned above (imperfections, load distributions) the traditional calculation methods are not sufficient. Using the Finite-Element-Method (FEM) a new calculation concept will be introducing to achieve these elaborate analyses. In future the influence of local damages to the global structure should be a minimum. The heart of the procedure is the registration and numerical consideration of typical damages. It is to investigate which imperfections are important to consider and which are negligible. A classification of the imperfections will support this. To consider these imperfections the mentioned calculation concept will be used. First, the simple example of a stiffened plate and a box girder will be using to discuss the influence of imperfections on the structure behaviour. Later this knowledge of these investigations will be utilizing for the analysis of typical inland vessels. The FE-models of a pusher barge and a modern inland container vessel will be introducing and their calculation results will be showing. These are deformations and stresses for various cargo distributions. Additionally the non-linear results for extreme loads will be presenting to simulate the collapse behaviour of the vessel.

40|$|The present work {{reports on}} the effect of small {{deformations}} on the natural and artificial aging behaviour of two industrial aluminium alloys. The main focus has been on the mechanical properties response of these alloys, supplemented with microstructural and thermoanalytical investigations. The investigated alloys were AA 6060 and AA 6082 which both represent high volume production in the extrusion of alloys in Al-Mg-Si system. The objective of this work has been to get a better understanding and quantitative description of the aging behaviour in the investigated alloys as a function of processing conditions. The amount of introduced deformation and storage at room temperature prior to artificial aging have a significant importance in industrial practice and they are often unavoidable in the manufacturing processing line. Therefore, the effect of predeformation followed by natural aging on the mechanical properties as strength, ductility and work hardening of an AA 6060 and AA 6082 alloy has been thoroughly investigated by tensile testing. It was found that in samples with no <b>pre-deformation</b> the hardening after natural aging is achieved mostly due to a higher density of Mg-Si coclusters while in samples with introduced <b>pre-deformation</b> the hardening is due to the increased dislocation density. In the latter case, the precipitation hardening is suppressed, most probably due to loss of quenched-in vacancies to dislocations sinks. In order to investigate the effect of <b>pre-deformation</b> on the artificial aging response of the AA 6060 alloy, a series of hardness measurements and tensile tests were designed and carried out. In addition to the mechanical properties tests, transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry were used to characterize dislocation evolution, microstructure and precipitation state for various combinations of predeformation and aging time. The artificial aging part of the investigations individually considered two different routes of applying the <b>pre-deformation,</b> i. e., sequential mode and simultaneous mode. It was found that for the AA 6060 alloy processed in sequential mode of predeformation and artificial aging, increasing <b>pre-deformation</b> accelerates the kinetics of the precipitation sequence, increases both yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, and changes the nucleation mechanism for precipitation from homogeneous nucleation, as observed in undeformed material, to heterogeneous nucleation. Both nucleation mechanisms, homogeneous and heterogeneous, were supposedly taking part during simultaneous mode of <b>pre-deformation</b> and artificial aging of AA 6060, which resulted in the best performing alloys with respect to yield strength and ultimate tensile strength among all the investigated alloy conditions. It was shown, that these superior final mechanical properties depend on a careful configuration of aging parameters (aging temperature, aging time, and strain rate) and chosen amount of predeformation. Further improvement in mechanical properties has been achieved with use of split aging procedure, when an additional aging after simultaneous mode of aging was performed in the way that after reaching the desired <b>pre-deformation,</b> the specimen was kept at the temperature with no prior change in temperature and aged for an additional time Based on the work of this thesis, it may be concluded that small deformations prior to or together with artificial aging generally leads to improved strength of the investigated Al-Mg-Si alloys due to the combined effects of strain and precipitation hardening, and that this fact should be taken into account when designing the processing routes of extruded products of these materials.

The investigations have been performed in three levels of <b>pre-deformation.</b> Cyclic deformation following <b>pre-deformation</b> was carried out in tension-compression fatigue test experiment at room temperature. The <b>pre-deformation</b> was induced on the specimen by a tensile test under strain control at 5 %, 8 %, and 12 % strain level at a strain rate of 10 − 4 s− 1, respectively. In this paper, the effects of the cyclic deformation behaviors with different pre-strain levels were compared with the fatigue responses without pre-strain. Based on the comparison, it is found that the pre-strain caused evident changes in fatigue behaviors such as cyclic softening response, cyclic creep response, and cycles to failure. Generally, as compared to the as-received material, the softening response increased with increasing pre-strain level. A pronounced cyclic compressive creep occurred in the specimen with and without pre-strain level effect in all applied loading cases. This could be attributed to an-isotropy between tension and compression, resulting in the occurrence of compressive cyclic creep on the tested material during cyclic loading. Moreover, the stable total compressive creep strain scaled with increasing tensile pre-strain level for same cyclic loading. For the effect of pre-strain on fatigue resistance, a decrease in the number of cycles to failure was observed and the extent of the decrease also increased with increasing tensile pre-strain level under the same loading amplitude condition. In this paper, three damage parameters, ΔWp, Wf, and σaεa, are respectively used to predict the number of cycles to failure of the tested material with tensile pre-strain effect. In the plot of observed versus predicted cycles, it is observed that most of the data points are located within the bound of factor two for the three damage parameters.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} free form {{surfaces}} {{and the challenges}} of construction due to the complex geometry. A unique approach is proposed that incorporates attributes of form, material selection and fabrication methods of free form surfaces into the early stage of design in aid of optimum mesh generation towards redesigning a practically constructible structure. Free form surfaces need to be discretized into panels with manageable sizes so that the surface can be fabricated in smaller pieces that are all assembled on site. Planarity {{has been a significant}} constraint for free form discretization because brittle materials, such as glass, can fail suddenly, without any warning. Triangulation has been a common pattern for free form surface discretization, where the panels are always planar. Due to node complexities of triangulated meshing, quadrilaterals are considered as an alternative pattern for free form surfaces. However, the biggest problem with quadrilaterals is that quadrilaterals do not always form planar faces. A method to generate and apply quadrilateral meshing on free form surfaces is introduced in this study where pre-deformed (non-planar) quadrilateral panels are proposed to be used at high curvature areas of the complex surface where planar meshing is not possible. In this study, structural tests and simulations are conducted on quadrilateral panels to find out the limits of surface curvature allowed for specific materials.

Generally, the higher the attained temperatures are, the less susceptible the other parameters become, while the sensitivity due to strain rate and <b>pre-deformation</b> for the same temperatures was higher for the retained yield stresses.|$|R

Therefore, it can be defined from anywhere {{on the basis of}} the deformed intermediate state. So, this strain is an effective notation to describe the phenomenon that depends on the deformation history such as the plastic deformation. In this paper, the shape of the yield surface generated after applying the <b>pre-deformation</b> of large simple shear is estimated {{on the basis of the}} Natural Strain theory. Using the test pieces made of pure copper, which is already subjected to the <b>pre-deformation</b> of large simple shear, the proportional loading tests for combined loading of tension and torsion are carried out beyond the elastic region. The yield stress for each direction in the stress space is determined by investigating the tangent modulus of deviatoric stress- deviatoric strain curve, and the shape of yield surface is elucidated by comparing with the shape by conventional proof stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the initial fiber orientation distribution on the ballistic performance of a needlepunched nonwoven polyethylene fabric was analyzed. To this end, ballistic tests were carried out in specimens pre-deformed along the machine or the transverse directions and the {{influence of}} <b>pre-deformation</b> on the fiber orientation was measured by means of wide angle X-ray diffraction. It was found that <b>pre-deformation</b> along the machine direction (the soft orientation of the fabric) led to more isotropic in-plane mechanical response and to a marked increase in the specific ballistic limit and in the energy dissipated by unit weight while the opposite behaviour was found after stretching the fabric along the transverse direction. These differences were accompanied by changes in the penetration mechanics from extensive fiber pull-out to slippage between fibers in the network. These results highlight how the nature of the nonwoven microstructure (connectivity of the entanglement points and fiber orientation distribution) can be tailored to improve the impact performance...|$|R

50|$|A flaw of viscoelastic-plastic {{models of}} {{exoplanet}} geodynamics {{is in order}} for plate tectonics to be initiated, unrealistically low yield stress values are required. Additionally, plates in viscoelastic-plastic models have no deformation memory, i.e. {{as soon as the}} stress on a lithospheric plate drops below its yield stress it returns to its <b>pre-deformation</b> strength. This stands in contrast to Earth-based observations, which show that plates preferentially break along preexisting areas of deformation.|$|R

We present an algorithm for polycube construction and volumetric parame-terization. The algorithm has three steps: <b>pre-deformation,</b> polycube construction and optimization, and mapping computation. Compared with existing polycube mapping methods, our algorithm can robustly generate desirable polycube domain shape and low-distortion volumetric parameterization.

The metamorphosis has in most cases taken the form of ductile deformation and serpentinisation. In many cases the rocks have also been subject to varying degrees of later brittle deformation. <b>Pre-deformation</b> {{they would have been}} a combination of undepleted mantle in the form of lherzolite peridotite and depleted harzburgite mantle from whichbasaltic phases had been removed.|$|R

At different temperature, the sine sweep frequency test is done with different structural parameter MR isolator.

40|$|AbstractNiTiNb {{shape memory}} alloys have {{attracted}} much attention in pipe coupling or sealing system because of their large transformation hysteresis upon a proper <b>pre-deformation.</b> In order to clarify the effects of adding Nb on the mechanical properties {{as well as the}} transformation behavior of NiTiNb shape memory alloys, Ni 47 Ti 44 Nb 9 and Ni 49. 8 Ti 45. 2 Nb 5 alloys with different microstructures but with similar martensitic transformation start temperature, are prepared. Comparative studies on the microstructures, mechanical properties and transformation characteristics are conducted by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), phase transformation measurements and mechanical property tests. It is found that Ni 47 Ti 44 Nb 9 and Ni 49. 8 Ti 45. 2 Nb 5 alloys possess similar transformation hysteresis in the as-annealed state. However, the presence of Nb and its status exerts important effects on the mechanical properties, especially the yield strength and the yield behavior of the alloys. Ni 49. 8 Ti 45. 2 Nb 5 alloy exhibits remarkable increase in the yield strength than the Ni 47 Ti 44 Nb 9 alloy. The transformation hysteresis of both alloys under <b>pre-deformation</b> is characterized and the relative mechanism is discussed...|$|R
