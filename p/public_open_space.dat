5|$|By {{the end of}} the 14th century, these {{religious}} {{houses were}} regarded by City traders as interlopers — occupying what had previously been <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> nearby one of the City gates.

By 1405, a stout wall was built to protect the property and maintain the privacy of the Order, particularly its church where men and women alike came to worship.|$|E

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> {{are often}} used as a mode to make cities {{sustainable}} from all its three counts; economic, environmental and social. Most of contemporary urban planners, designers, and landscape architects use the <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> as a mode to increase the urban quality of life, improve aesthetic attractiveness, improve the environmental health, growth of economy, and to increase the walkability, liveability and vitality of a city which direct towards the sustainability. However, sustainable development should also encompass the enhancements of disaster resilience. Yet, the use of <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> as a strategy for disaster resilience, still remains largely unrehearsed when planning and designing sustainable cities. Accordingly, {{the aim of this}} paper is to emphasize the need of planning and designing <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> with a focus on disaster resilience; as an agent of recovery, to provide essential life support, as a primary place to rescue and for shelters and potential for adaptive response. Further, this ongoing research study analyses the current literature and presents the significance of combination of disaster management strategies with urban planning and designing strategies in order to make cities resilience to disasters. Finally, the analysis suggests a framework to plan and design <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> for sustainable disaster resilience cities, proposing set of concepts; loose space concept, Urban Sponge Park, Network of <b>Open</b> <b>Spaces,</b> which can be potentially used when planning and designing <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> for disaster resilient citie...|$|R

5|$|With few fixed {{structures}} in the main marketplace, the plain traditionally served as a <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> on days when the market was not operational. Before the Reformation in the 1530s, its main use was as a venue for religious festivals, particularly the annual procession of the Craft Guilds at Corpus Christi. Most public religious festivals were abandoned following the Reformation and the subsequent dissolution {{of many of the}} mediaeval guilds, and the leading event on Norwich's civic calendar became the annual inauguration of the mayor, which took place each May.|$|E
40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> of {{the living}} {{environment}} are {{an essential component of}} sustainable understanding of home. In large housing estates it is an environment where everyone expands their sense of a home, through daily activities transferring it from their dwellings to <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> Today large-scale housing estates are considered to be a serious problem involving spatial, social and economic issues with technical, aesthetic and social aspects. All these aspects are reflected in the problems pertaining to the <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> of the housing estates. As a result of denationalisation and privatisation processes, the original spatial composition of the districts was disarranged, thus creating a legal basis for new construction in the <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> of large-scale housing estates. Currently the overall quality of public space of large-scale housing estates does not meet the social and recreational needs of the inhabitants.

The churchyard was used as a burial ground and as a <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> As with other City churchyards, as the amount of available burial space in London failed {{to keep pace with the}} growing population it came to be used exclusively as a burial ground.|$|E
5|$|Castle Park (sometimes {{referred}} to as Castle Green) is a <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> in Bristol, England, managed by Bristol City Council. It is bounded by the Floating Harbour and Castle Street to the south, Lower Castle Street to the east, and Broad Weir, Newgate and Wine Street to the north. Its western boundary is less obviously defined and {{has been the subject}} of controversy, perhaps because the area around High Street and St Mary-le-Port Church, though not part of the park and always intended for development, is often considered at the same time as the park. The park was completed and opened on 30 September 1978, and occupies most of the site which had contained Bristol's main shopping area. Much of this area was heavily damaged in the Blitz during the Second World War, and that which remained was subsequently demolished.|$|E

The Church of St Bartholomew the Less is located next to the King Henry VIII Gate, the hospital's main entrance. The north and south of the square are now closed to through traffic, as part of the City's security and surveillance cordon known as the Ring of steel. Security for the market is provided by its market constabulary.|$|E

5|$|There were {{a number}} of {{development}} schemes for the head including a major railway and docks scheme proposed in 1885, proposals for housing and a golf course were also put forward before World War I, though none of these schemes came to fruition. In 1919 the head was sold by Sir George Meyrick to Harry Gordon Selfridge with plans to construct a grand house. These plans also came to nothing, apart from the establishment of a nursery garden. Bournemouth Borough Council purchased the head in 1930 for £25,200; although plans for housing existed west of double dykes, the head itself was to be kept as <b>public</b> <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> During World War II the head was closed to the public and was occupied by the army, becoming home to a number of installations including a radar station. The area was also extensively mined. The head was finally cleared of the military defences by the 1950s.|$|E
