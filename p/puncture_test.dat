50|$|Sensory {{assessments}} of the hardness, stickiness and elasticity of mochi and their relationship with solute concentration and heating time were performed. Similar to the <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> results, sensory tests determine that hardness and elasticity increase with increasing time of heating and solid concentration.

50|$|Many {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} on the factors that affect the viscoelastic properties of mochi. As puncture tests show, samples with a higher solid (polysaccharide) content show an increased resistance and thereby a stronger and tougher gel. This increased resistance to the <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> indicate that an increase in solute concentration leads to a more rigid and harder gel with an increased cohesiveness, internal binding, elasticity and springiness which means a decrease in material flow or an increase in viscosity.

40|$|The {{puncture}} {{resistance of}} geotextiles in Australia {{is measured in}} terms of the G-Rating, which is the product of CBR and drop cone <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> results. CBR and drop cone puncture tests were conducted on 24 geotextiles to provide up-to- date results, and to evaluate the G-Rating. CBR puncture tests using modified plungers were also conducted to assess the accuracy of shape factors quoted in the literature- 3. 0 for angular aggregate and 0. 8 for rounded aggregate. Wide strip tensile tests were also conducted to compare with CBR <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> results. The results of the testing program show no relationship between wide strip tensile test results and CBR <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> results. The modified plunger CBR <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> results show that shape factors are not only shape dependent, but are fabric dependent as well, with the results somewhat different from those commonly quoted. The exponent used to calculate the G-Rating varies for the same fabric tested at different drop heights in the drop cone <b>puncture</b> <b>test.</b> Also, the restriction of elongation in CBR puncture tests to 80 per cent by the G-Rating classification system, was found unnecessary for all the geotextiles tested, as elongation at failure in all cases did not exceed 80 per cent. A Rupture Index classification is proposed, being the product of failure load and vertical plunger displacement at failure in a CBR <b>puncture</b> <b>test.</b> It is considered to be simpler than the G-Rating as it relies on the results of only one test. The Rupture Index calculated for a given fabric will not vary by more than the inherent variability of the specimens tested.

40|$|Changes in the composition, {{physical}} and mechanical properties occur in grape berries during the ripening process, but {{the heterogeneity of}} the grapes harvested at different ripening stages affects {{the reliability of the}} results obtained. The characterization of the mechanical properties of grape berries seems to be an important parameter for understanding grape ripening. In this work, these changes were studied in seven grapevine varieties (Riesling, Blaufränkisch, Pinot Noir, Cerason, Malverina, Laurot, and Hibernal) harvested during six consecutive weeks. Mechanical behaviour was measured using compression and puncture tests using of TIRATEST 27025 testing machine. Skin mechanical properties were evaluated using a <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> carried out on the equatorial side. The dependence of these properties on the chemical composition has been evaluated. These parameters of force/time curves were studied by puncture test: the berry skin break force, the needle displacement at the skin break and the berry skin break energy. The crushing force, the plate displacement at the crushing strength and the berry crushing energy were studied from force/time curves by compression test. Results of the <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> shows that there the skin break strength and the acidity content are monotonic functions of the time.

40|$|ABSTRACT Eggshells were {{subjected}} to puncture tests and the microstructure of the resulting fractures examined by scanning electron microscopy. The shell material fractured in a manner typical of brittle materials where a cone of material is forced inwards. According to established theory the fractures are due to tensile stress. This explains why the forces required to puncture the egg and to fracture the egg by quasistatic compression between flat surfaces are related; both tests respond to {{the resistance of the}} shell material to tensile fracture. Tests using a punch and die to impose shear fractures showed that the shear strength of the shell is greater than the tensile value. Furthermore, the shear strength of the shell material is directionally dependent with the shell showing greater resistance when punched from the outside. The findings show that comparative studies using the eggshell <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> must be carefully interpreted, since unknown and confounded factors affect the puncture force.

The olives were brined with two different NaCl concentrations, 4 and 7 %.

40|$|International audienceA {{near-field}} acoustic (NFA) {{method was}} applied to characterize viscoelastic properties of mango pulp tissue. The developed sensor was a stepped horn consisting of a cylindrical body and a coupled cylindrical tip to be inserted into the pulp sample. The properties of the pulp altered the mechanical resonance of the horn and the electrical resonance of the piezoelectric element, which served as both input and output port. The measured acoustic parameters represented the shift of the resonance frequency (Δf) and the attenuation of the peak amplitude (Δ(l/Z)) of the probe when its vibrating tip was immersed in air, the reference medium, and then inserted into the pulp sample. Acoustic testing was carried out on each fruit at four locations evenly distributed in the middle parenchyma tissue of an equatorial section. The acoustic data were then compared to the 10 mm depth penetration force values obtained for the same four pulp locations. The results obtained for 45 mangoes {{with a wide range}} of maturity showed that Δf was very sensitive to the quality of the probe-medium interface, especially for unripe fruit, and poorly correlated with <b>puncture</b> <b>test</b> values.
