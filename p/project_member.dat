5|$|Woodenlegs, {{unsure what}} to do with the material, passed them to Weist, who at the time was writing a Cheyenne history for use in {{reservation}} schools. The negatives were contained in a battered shoebox, and some were in poor condition. Weist involved photographer Jerry Mader to work on their restoration. Weist, Mader, and Woodenlegs began a project in the 1960s to make the images available in reservation schools. Without funds for publication, however, the project was abandoned in 1981 on the death of Woodenlegs. Weist died in 1994. The negatives were passed to anthropologist Margot Liberty in 1998 by a remaining <b>project</b> <b>member,</b> Elizabeth Wilson Clark, shortly before her death. Liberty had been a teacher at the Northern Cheyenne reservation in the 1950s, and she agreed to edit the material into a book for the University of Oklahoma Press. Finally, 142 of the images were published in 2006 as A Northern Cheyenne Album. The book includes a commentary from Woodenlegs recorded years before.|$|E

Walker presented the concept at the History Project meeting on Sept. 5, 1984, and with encouragement from the project, Walker, Pennington, <b>project</b> <b>member</b> Eric Garber and several others held five working meetings before deciding that the plan would require a much larger and more diverse organizing group.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2005 NerdTV {{interview}} {{which is}} available as a bonus feature of the DVD Steve Jobs - The Lost Interview (2012), Macintosh <b>project</b> <b>member</b> Andy Hertzfeld relates an anecdote about Raskin's reputation for often inaccurately claiming to have invented various technologies. [...] Raskin's resume from 2002 lends credence by stating he was [...] "Creator of Macintosh computer at Apple Computer, Inc." [...] Raskin did create and solely supervise the Macintosh project for approximately its first year; however, Hertzfeld describes Raskin's relationship to the drastically different finished Mac product more like that of an [...] "eccentric great uncle" [...] than its father. In Jobs's [...] "Lost Interview" [...] from 1996, he refers to the Macintosh {{as a product of}} team effort while acknowledging Raskin's early role.|$|E

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{one important}} question concerning ancient Chunchucmil is {{how such a}} large population could have survived {{in one of the}} poorest areas for agriculture. [...] According to bone isotope studies conducted by Pakbeh Regional Economy <b>Project</b> <b>member</b> Geni Mansell, the diet of the ancient inhabitants may have been more diversified than {{in other areas of the}} Maya region. [...] When compared with skeletal remains from other parts of Yucatán, Belize and the southern Maya lowlands, human remains from Chunchucmil indicate that their diet included significantly less corn (maize, the staple crop for most communities in the Maya area). [...] Access to the more ecologically diverse wetlands and coastal resources, as well as access to inter-regional trade routes and a centralized marketplace, may have been critical to ancient subsistence at Chunchucmil.|$|E
2500|$|On Mars, Tacto meets Mori (from [...] "4/4"). Mori, stunned at the {{resemblance}} between Tacto and Trill, {{falls in love}} with him. Tacto does not feel the same way and is engaged to Merimé, the cousin of Tako <b>Project</b> <b>member</b> Zazz. This angers Mori, and after their talk Tacto loses all memory of him. The project requires bringing water from Jupiter, and the group goes to nearby planet Mimas. To regain Tacto's affection, Mori invites him on a scooter tour across Jupiter's rings and they have an accident. Mori, seriously injured, wakes up in an emergency room and goes to search for Tacto who has been missing for 16 hours. He rescues Tacto, they bond emotionally, and Tacto breaks his engagement to Merimé. Moonsault arrives at the request of George's wife, An-An, to help Tacto (who is genetically a woman) decide whether to use female hormones. The doctor explains that Tacto changed his sex frequently, and says that the decision is Tacto's—who remains a man. When his father reveals what happened to Marble, he regains the ability to understand his feelings and knows that he loves Mori.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{software}} documentation in open source projects is often poor and incomplete. Open source communities are generally driven by <b>project</b> <b>members</b> doing what they want to do, and because few programmers enjoy writing documentation, many open source projects are poorly documented compared to proprietary projects. This does not mean that documentation is any less important in open source projects, and this thesis looks at why it is so hard to provide good documentation. Findings from this thesis shows that even if all <b>project</b> <b>members</b> agree that documentation is important, resource constraints mean that the time and effort necessary to create quality documentation it is not necessarily provided. How lack of documentation is affecting new <b>project</b> <b>members</b> who try to contribute to a project is also described in this thesis. Several new <b>project</b> <b>members</b> found the given documentation to be messy and outdated, making it hard to contribute. Poor documentation can also influence the number of <b>project</b> <b>members</b> willing to contribute to the open source project. The thesis is based on an action research project where the author has participated {{in the development of a}} health information system, District Health Information System version 2 (DHIS 2), within the Health Information System Programme (HISP) network...|$|R

40|$|Projects of {{all kinds}} {{generate}} documentation {{that needs to be}} organized and stored for future use. Well adapted tools, together with a unified modus operandi need to be available for both the <b>project</b> <b>members</b> and those having a more organizing role if an organization is to be effective. A study of the tools available to <b>project</b> <b>members</b> at Svenska Kraftnät have been performed along with an analysis of the guidelines for the tools' usage. The study has focused on the needs of the <b>project</b> <b>members,</b> not the organization as a whole, thus providing a bottom-up approach to the problem instead of the more organizational top-down approach. Interviews of around 20 <b>project</b> <b>members,</b> whose roles include project leaders, technical experts and documentation supervisors, have been conducted {{to get an idea of}} the practical problems that exists. All systems, except for a local network storage device, were found to at least meet Svenska Kraftnät's current demands. The usage guidelines, however, covers only the general process that a project should follow and lacks detailed information on a per system level in several areas. The information gathered through the interviews shows that the guidelines are poorly rooted among the <b>project</b> <b>members.</b> The thesis concludes that a problem does exist and that the main reason is the lack of details in the guidelines combined with the fact that the current guidelines are not spread enough throughout the organization...|$|R
