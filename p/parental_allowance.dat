25|$|Under Olof Palme's premiership tenure, matters {{concerned}} with child care centers, social security, {{protection of the}} elderly, accident safety, and housing problems received special attention. Under Palme the public health system in Sweden became efficient, with the infant mortality rate standing at 12 per 1,000 live births. An ambitious redistributive programme was carried out, with special help provided to the disabled, immigrants, the low paid, single-parent families, and the old. The Swedish welfare state was significantly expanded from a position already {{one of the most}} far-reaching in the world during his time in office. As noted by Isabela Mares, {{during the first half of}} the Seventies “the level of benefits provided by every subsystem of the welfare state improved significantly.” Various policy changes increased the basic old-age pension replacement rate from 42% of the average wage in 1969 to 57%, while a health care reform carried out in 1974 integrated all health services and increased the minimum replacement rate from 64% to 90% of earnings. In 1974, supplementary unemployment assistance was established, providing benefits to those workers ineligible for existing benefits. In 1971, eligibility for invalidity pensions was extended with greater opportunities for employees over the age of 60. In 1974, universal dental insurance was introduced, and former maternity benefits were replaced by a <b>parental</b> <b>allowance.</b> In 1974, housing allowances for families with children were raised and these allowances were extended to other low-income groups. Childcare centres were also expanded under Palme, and separate taxation of husband and wife introduced. Access to pensions for older workers in poor health was liberalised in 1970, and a disability pension was introduced for older unemployed workers in 1972.|$|E

For the three-year parental leave option, the possibility of returning to the employer the mother was employed by before her parental leave, the possibility of placing the child in a kindergarten at the age of three, the satisfactory amount of the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance,</b> and the sufficient time for taking care of and upbringing the child are the most significant determinants. Mother's family and child dedication and the option itself are the most significant factors for the four-year parental leave and allowance receipt option.

40|$|The {{unfavourable}} {{development of}} the Austrian labour market in the 1990 s is attributable {{to a number of}} macro-economic factors. The rise of unemployment {{is a reflection of the}} relatively low average rate of economic growth and the 1993 recession. The productivity of labour increased at an accelerated pace in the course of Austria's growing integration with the economies of Western and Eastern Europe. Unemployment failed to decline even during the period of relative boom in 1997 - 98. This development is due, above all, to the following causes: • increased supply of labour as a result of the shortened period of entitlement to <b>parental</b> leave <b>allowance,</b> and a more restrictive policy with regard to early retirement; • the rate of unemployment has not reacted noticeably to high employment growth in the service sector, because the quality of the new jobs created fails to meet the expectations of the unemployed in terms of working hours and wages. (Many part-time jobs have been created in retail trade and other service sectors, but the majority of job-seekers are looking for full-time employment.) • A persistently high rate of unemployment in Vienna, a region particularly affected by staff cuts in the public sector, restructuring measures taken by major industrial and service enterprises and subsequent relocation, and a high share of private-sector service enterprises. The rise of unemployment between 1996 and 1998 was most pronounced in three areas: higher age groups, women, and Vienna. It should not, however, be taken as an indication of a general deterioration of the labour-market situation: finding a job was certainly easier in 1998 than before, as is indicated not only by the development of employment, but also by the number of vacant jobs. The rise of unemployment was due, above all, to institutional factors. Cuts of special support measures and a more restrictive policy with regard to early retirement meant that older job-seekers remained on record as unemployed, instead of retiring from working life. At the same time, the shortened period of entitlement to <b>parental</b> leave <b>allowance</b> resulted in a strong increase in the number of women wanting to re-enter the labour market. Hence, the rise of unemployment in 1997 and 1998 is primarily attributable to the fact that beneficiaries of social services, whose availability to the labour market is very limited or non-existent, have become more highly dependent on unemployment benefits for their subsistence since the adoption of the "austerity package". The impact on unemployment figures has been largely statistical in nature and can therefore be qualified as a form of "re-labelling".

40|$|Taxes {{and cash}} {{transfers}} reduce income inequality more in France than {{elsewhere in the}} OECD, {{because of the large}} size of the flows involved. But the system is complex overall. Its effectiveness could be enhanced in many ways, for example so as to achieve the same amount of redistribution at lower cost. The French tax code should be simplified and changed less frequently. High statutory rates are coupled {{with a wide range of}} effective tax rates resulting from a multitude of tax expenditures. There is a need for base broadening combined with lower rates throughout the system, including VAT. The tax wedge on labour is high, except at the bottom of the wage distribution, which can reduce worker participation and job offers. Greater neutrality both across different capital asset classes but also within specific taxes, and shifting taxes from labour and capital inputs to environmental and property taxes would improve economic outcomes. Likewise, the system of social and family benefits should be simplified to enhance transparency and consistency. Eliminating schemes that let people leave the labour market early, abolishing the pension privileges of specific occupational groups and internalising the costs of survivors 2 ̆ 019 pension benefits would increase fairness while at the same time generating savings.

50|$|A {{number of}} factors caused the {{increased}} frequency of divorce. One was that an increasingly secularized society viewed marriage, more often than before, as an arrangement that could be ended {{if it did not}} satisfy its partners. Another reason was that a gradually expanding welfare system could manage an ever-greater portion of the family's traditional tasks, and it made couples less dependent on the institution of marriage. Government provisions for <b>parental</b> leave, child <b>allowances,</b> child care programs, and much improved health and pension plans meant that the family was no longer essential for the care of children and aged relatives. A further cause for weakened family and marital ties was seen in the unsettling effects of the Great Migration and in the economic transformation Finland experienced during the 1960s and the 1970s. The rupture of established social patterns brought uncertainty and an increased potential for conflict into personal relationships.|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} the state social support was {{established}} on 1 st October 1995 when Act No. 117 / 1995 Coll. on social state support took effect. This Bachelor´s thesis, the title of which is "Development of legal regulations of <b>parental</b> <b>allowance</b> in 1996 { [...] } 2009 ``, {{is focused on the}} key benefit of the state social support - the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance.</b> It is a benefit independent on the height of income of the qualified person and is intended for a parent who personally and duly cares for a child while meeting other requirements needed to draw this allowance such as child´s age and health condition. The introduction of the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance</b> pursued an aim to make care for a child better and to improve social conditions of families with small children. The aim of the thesis is to map the development of the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance</b> since its beginning and to point out pros and cons of the legal regulations contained in Act No. 117 / 1995 Coll., on state social support. Since 1995 the legal regulations of the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance</b> have undergone a lot of more or less fundamental changes. Originally the height of the allowance was dependent on the living minimum and on the fact whether a parent is supported or not. Afterwards the amount of the allowance was determined by the height of the average salary in the non-productive sphere of the economy. The last big change brought about an allowance provided at several rates that are set at fixed amounts according to duration of drawing whereas the parents elect the period and amount of the allowance. In January 1998 a new system was established - a child may attend a day care centre or other pre-school facility in the maximum range stipulated by law, without a parent losing a claim to the payment of the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance.</b> The law has not forgotten about disabled children and their parents. It goes without saying that a disabled child requires more financial resources from a family. The attitude to the earning power of a parent has changed as well. Since January 2008 parents have been able to select the period of the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance</b> providing they are entitled to get a maternity benefit. Experience has shown that it was a correct step. The parents who had been working before their child was born have a better position. The purpose of the thesis was fulfilled: the most important changes of the legal regulations of the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance</b> have been mapped and analyzed in details since the <b>parental</b> <b>allowance</b> was established in 1995. Then based on the analysis of documents, it was found out that the last amendment to Act No. 117 / 1995 Coll., on state social support effective as of 1 st January 2008, had led to better directness of the allowances and to stagnation of the volume of financial resources used for payments...|$|E

When the idea of a national family policy was introduced in the United States during the 1970 s, the discussion centered on the provision of universal supports, such as income maintenance, health care, and child care, that would benefit all families, regardless of income, but particularly those families who are most in need.

40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal determination of family allowances {{in a model}} {{where some of the}} parents have higher ability to raise children than others. First-best policy gives both types of parents the same level of utility. If neither parental ability nor parental actions are fully observable, however, the policy maker has {{to take into account the}} incentive-compatibility constraint that more able parents should not find it profitable to mis-represent their true ability by investing less in their children, and having a lower number of children. The second-best policy induces more able parents to have the first-best number of children, and to invest in each child at the first-best level. Less able parents are induced to have fewer children than in first best, and will underinvest in each child. Whether the government should subsidize more the more able parents, or the less able ones, depends on the properties of the cost function. In second best, however, less able parents will end up with lower utility than more able parents whatever the cost function.
