No general hospitals may refuse a patient treatment for intoxication or alcoholism, and all individual and group health insurance plans which are regulated by the state of New Jersey are required to offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment for alcoholism. Under federal law, all group health insurances plans for private companies with more than 50 employees must offer insurance coverage for alcoholism that is equal to their insurance coverage for other medical conditions.|$|E

Bennett also published The Good Life: The Autobiography of Tony Bennett in 1998. A series of albums, often based on themes (such as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, blues, or duets), has met with good acceptance; Bennett has won eleven more Best Traditional Pop Vocal <b>Performance</b> <b>or</b> Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammys in the subsequent years, most recently for the year 2016. Bennett has sold over 50 million records worldwide during his career.|$|E
5|$|Storm and the Hurricanes {{received}} the most votes in the first Mersey Beat magazine poll, but many votes were disqualified {{as they had been}} posted from the same {{place at the same time}} and were written in green ink; although never proven, it was thought that Storm had posted the votes. This meant that the Beatles reached the top position, with the Hurricanes coming fourth, even though the Beatles had also been sending in extra votes themselves. Storm was often photographed for the magazine, such as being surrounded by nurses when he left the hospital after breaking a leg during a <b>performance,</b> <b>or</b> playing for the Mersey Beat XI football team.|$|E

5|$|The {{curriculum}} emphasizes writing; {{students are}} required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and are required to complete a research paper during their third year. All students must pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually in their area of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis is required of all students. Usually an analytic or expository essay, it may also be a piece of original fiction, poetry, a <b>performance</b> <b>or</b> work of visual art. Students are encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public is invited to the presentations.|$|E
5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the Charity Commission is concurrent {{with that of the}} High Court of Justice. The High Court possesses all the powers of the Commission, who only exercise theirs on application of the charity or Attorney General, or trustees, beneficiaries and interested people when the charity has an income of less than £500. The Commission, under Section 29 of the 2011 Act, also keeps the register of charities. Under Section 110 of the Act, the Commission is tasked with giving advice or opinions to trustees relating to the <b>performance</b> <b>or</b> administration of their charity. The Commission also acts as the Official Custodian for Charities, who acts as a trustee for charities at the direction of the Commission.|$|E
5|$|The operas listed {{cover all}} {{important}} genres, and include all operas regularly performed today, from seventeenth-century works by Monteverdi, Cavalli, and Purcell to late twentieth-century operas by Messiaen, Berio, Glass, Adams, Birtwistle, and Weir. The brief accompanying notes offer an {{explanation as to}} why each opera has been considered important. For an introduction to operatic history, see Opera. The organisation of the list is by year of first <b>performance,</b> <b>or,</b> if this was long after the composer's death, approximate date of composition.|$|E

Failure to meet these requirements may result in either limitation of future funds or termination of assistance. Specific requirements for matching, level of effort, and earmarking are unique to each federal program, and are described in the laws, regulations, and contract or grant provisions that pertain to the program.|$|E
5|$|While {{the music}} {{industry}} has long been open to having women in <b>performance</b> <b>or</b> entertainment roles, women are {{much less likely to}} have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation chief design engineer, John L. Savage, {{surveyed}} {{the area and}} drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'. Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next. In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving <b>performance</b> <b>or</b> because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river {{above and below the}} dam too great for alternative methods. Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, {{in the midst of the}} Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.|$|E

5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight {{but it is also a}} masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic <b>performance</b> <b>or</b> masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period, editions have moved {{increasingly}} {{to reflect the}} performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra. In the 21st century editions continue to be produced, often for use {{in conjunction with a}} particular <b>performance</b> <b>or</b> recording.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn's {{interest}} in baroque music {{was not limited}} to the Bach St Matthew Passion which he had revived in 1829. He was concerned in preparing and editing such music, whether for <b>performance</b> <b>or</b> for publication, to be {{as close as possible to}} the original intentions of the composers, including wherever possible a close study of early editions and manuscripts. This could lead him into conflict with publishers; for instance, his edition of Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt for the London Handel Society (1845) evoked an often contentious correspondence, with Mendelssohn refusing for example to add dynamics where not given by Handel, or to add parts for trombones. Mendelssohn also edited a number of Bach's works for organ, and apparently discussed with Robert Schumann the possibility of producing a complete Bach edition.|$|E
