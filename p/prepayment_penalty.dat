40|$|Abstract: A {{dramatic}} rise in subprime foreclosures {{over the}} past several years has led to calls for restrictions of, or prohibitions against, a range of lending practices loosely termed “predatory. ” Several cities and states have enacted legislation or regulations aimed at eliminating predatory practices, and some advocacy groups have endorsed action nationally. This working paper uses data from the Chicago metropolitan area to examine the impact of two frequently cited predatory lending practices, long <b>prepayment</b> <b>penalty</b> periods and balloon payments, on the probability of foreclosure on subprime refinance and home purchase mortgages. This paper also examines the impact of low- and no-documentation, and how combinations of low- and no-documentation, long <b>prepayment</b> <b>penalty</b> periods, and balloon payments affect foreclosure rates. Findings indicate that the impact of each of those loan features on the probability of foreclosure varies by loan category, meaning whether the loan is a refinance or a home purchase loan, and whether the loan is a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) or an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). Taken individually, long <b>prepayment</b> <b>penalty</b> periods and low- or nodocumentation are associated with a greater or lesser probability of foreclosure, or have n...|$|E

We also analyze the influence the <b>prepayment</b> <b>penalty</b> and partial prepayment have on the yield, duration and convexity of a mortgage, and provide lenders with an upper-bound for the mortgage default insurance rate. Our model provides portfolio managers a useful framework to more effectively hedge their mortgage holdings.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{practice}} of mortgage refinancing in a dynamic competitive lending model with risky borrowers and costly default. We show that <b>prepayment</b> <b>penalties</b> improve welfare by ensuring longer-term lending contracts, which prevents the mortgage pools from becoming disproportionately composed of the riskiest borrowers over time. Mortgages with <b>prepayment</b> <b>penalties</b> allow lenders to lower mortgage rates and extend credit to the least creditworthy, with the largest benefits going to the riskiest borrowers, who have the most incentive to refinance in response to positive credit shocks. Empirical evidence from more than 21, 000 non-agency securitized fixed rate mortgages {{is consistent with the}} key predictions of our model.

40|$|The current {{scale of}} {{mortgage}} delinquencies and foreclosures - {{particularly in the}} subprime market - has sparked a renewed debate over the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and the regulations governing home mortgage lending. On one side, detractors argue that the CRA helped to precipitate the current crisis by encouraging lending in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods (Walker 2008). On the other side, advocates of the CRA point {{to a number of}} reasons why the regulation shouldn’t be blamed for the current subprime crisis.; What has been missing in this debate has been an empirical examination of the performance of loans made by institutions regulated under the CRA, versus those made by independent mortgage banks. The ability to conduct this research has been limited by the lack of a dataset that links information on loan origination with information on loan performance. In this study, we use a unique dataset that joins lender and origination information from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) reports with data on loan performance from Lender Processing Services, Inc. Applied Analytics (LPS). 2 We thus have access to information on borrower characteristics (including race, income, and credit score), loan characteristics (including its loan-to-value ratio, whether it was a fixed or adjustable rate mortgage, and the existence of a <b>prepayment</b> <b>penalty),</b> institutional characteristics (whether the lending institution was regulated under the CRA and the loan source), and loan performance (delinquency and foreclosure).

40|$|Another {{achievement}} {{of this research}} is to elaborate the modified concept of Cash Rebate Mortgages. To examine the difference between Cash Rebate Mortgages and standard mortgages, we have built a simulation model to study the behavior of these two types of mortgages. The results indicate that the value of Cash Rebate Mortgages is higher than that of standard mortgages, but is more sensitive to embedded options. If the probability of exercising an option is higher, then the value of Cash Rebate Mortgages will drop at a faster rate than that of standard mortgages. Several findings are elaborated in this dissertation. Our model has identified the major contributors to mortgage prepayment, and has developed a logistic regression model to describe prepayment behavior. We further illustrate that prepayment and default behavior are associated with financial reasons: the value of the refinancing incentive is usually greater than the <b>prepayment</b> <b>penalty</b> plus the transaction cost for refinancing mortgages, and the outstanding balance of the mortgage is higher than the current market value of the underlying property minus the transaction cost. The final objective of this dissertation is to develop an option model for MBS issuers. Most previous studies that have developed MBS models have focused on investors, but the model that is presented here is specifically for MBS issuers. The current study develops a risk management tool for issuers and guarantors to monitor their MBS portfolios. The model projects the cash inflow of mortgages and the cash outflow to MBS, alters the traditional model by introducing decision trees, and uses a simulation program with multiple path generation to develop a model for issuers to manage their MBS portfolios. According to the results of the model, issuers can manage the risk level of their portfolios by determining the Collection Account Balance, the Overcollateralization Ratio, the Net Residual Value, and the Liquidity Advance. Finally this paper also provides suggestions on risk management for MBS issuers. The objective of this dissertation is to develop an option model for residential mortgages and Mortgage-Backed Securities. Previous studies in the literature have identified several research opportunities that have not yet been explored. The current study attempts to fill the research gap, by altering the traditional model of mortgage valuation with a trinomial tree. We combine the prepayment, delinquency, default, and recovery of delinquency into a single model, to build a simulation program to generate different cash flow scenarios. The industrial data of the Korea Mortgage Corporation and a medium sized Hong Kong bank are used as empirical evidence for the model. by Yat-ming Lam. "February 2003.
