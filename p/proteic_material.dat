40|$|Photo-Thermal Induced Resonance (PTIR) nanospectroscopy, tuned towards amide-I absorption, {{was used}} to study the {{distribution}} of <b>proteic</b> <b>material</b> in 34 different HeLa cells, of which 18 were chemically stressed by oxidative stress with Na 3 AsO 3. The cell nucleus was found to provide a weaker amide-I signal than the surrounding cytoplasm, while the strongest PTIR signal comes from the perinuclear region. AFM topography shows that the cells exposed to oxidative stress undergo a volume reduction {{with respect to the}} control cells, through an accumulation of the <b>proteic</b> <b>material</b> around and above the nucleus. This is confirmed by the PTIR maps of the cytoplasm, where the pixels providing a high amide-I signal were identified with a space resolution of ∼ 300 × 300 nm. By analyzing their distribution with two different statistical procedures we found that the probability to find protein clusters smaller than 0. 6 μm in the cytoplasm of stressed HeLa cells is higher by 35 % than in the control cells. These results indicate {{that it is possible to}} study proteic clustering within single cells by label-free optical nanospectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the adult}} pigeon ciliary ganglia {{peculiar}} membrane-limited structures were constantly {{observed in the}} peripheral cytoplasm of choroid neurons. They are continuous with profiles of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or interconnected with each other. In addition they contain a marked acetylcholinesterase histochemical reaction. These data on the whole suggest that these structures {{are an integral part}} of the endoplasmic reticulum system, possibly acting as storing sites of <b>proteic</b> <b>material</b> moving along the pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum system...|$|E

We studied {{the nature and}} the ultrastructure of the typical stromal deposits by means of histochemical methods and of electron-microscopic examination. These deposits did not stain with Alcian blue, periodic acid-Schiff, Mallory, van Gieson, von Kossa or Congo red {{so that they are}} not constituted of proteoglycans, collagen, calcium or amyloid. They probably contain a <b>proteic</b> <b>material.</b> At the electron-microscopic level we observed electron-dense material which was made up of filaments immersed into an amorphous matrix...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} meant to provide a {{contribution}} in recent developments of biodegradable polymeric materials applied in agricultural practices with particular reference to the mulching segment. Special attention {{has been devoted to}} material based on renewable resources or utilization of waste products from agro-industrial activities, thus suggesting cost-effective and environmentally sound solutions to specific social needs. In the present contribution PVA solubility at room temperature has been improved by premixing with chemical additives and <b>proteic</b> <b>materials.</b> Waste materials from ethanol production by corn fermentation and from wood industries have been used as, respectively starch-based and lignocellulosic additives. The prepared formulations were applied on the soil by conventional spraying agricultural equipment. Time of permanence of the film formed on the soil was monitored as well as the effect on corn growth and yield production. Finally, in order to investigate the final fate of the PVA applied on the soil, a test was performed in lysimeters cropped with maize plants. PVA amount applied for the mulchin test was in order of 5 - 10 g PVA/m 2; under those conditions it resulted completely absorbed and no presence of PVA was recorded in the leached solutions...|$|R

Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} an attempt to reveal the {{decorated}} earthen plaster of Ajanta. The mud plaster of Ajanta caves has been analyzed with the help of physical and analytical tools. The results indicate that high silt (> 70 %) low clay soil may have been mixed purposefully with lime (calcite) for the reason to enhance the cementing characteristics. The presence of calcium oxalate was detected from FTIR spectra may have been the resultant product of <b>proteic</b> <b>materials</b> presented in mud plaster. Ferrugineous silicate along with rarer gluconite–celendonite and white zeolites were also perceived from SEM and FTIR spectral analysis. The existence of quartz and sepiolite in mud mortar was also detected from XRD and SEM studies. The vegetal matter might have been added to tailor the construction behavior. The analytical results authenticate the similarity of earthen plaster of Ajanta and alluvion deposits of Waghura River just in front of caves, probably used as raw material in improvement of new material that suits for restoration for optimize performance and compatibility with the existing materials...|$|R
40|$|Gelatin, {{a natural}} {{macromolecular}} <b>proteic</b> <b>material</b> from renewable resources, {{is widely used}} in many industrial applications. In this study gelatin scraps, deriving from pharmaceutical capsule productions, were turned into films by casting water solutions or suspensions producing flexible and consistent films. Gelatin was blended with poly(vinyl alcohol), a biodegradable synthetic polymer, {{in order to improve}} mechanical properties in the films. Gelatin was blended also with sugar cane bagasse, a lignin cellulosic waste from sugar cane processing. These blends showed good interface adhesion between gelatin and sugar cane fibers and mechanical properties of practical interest for up to 20 % of sugar cane content by weight. Glutaraldehyde was used in different amounts as a cross-linking agent increasing elongation at break especially for amount above 1 %. Morphology, thermal, thermomechanical, and mechanical properties of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), and tensile tests, respectively. Cast films presented thermal and mechanical proper-ties, which make them good candidates as biodegradable self-fertilizing mulching films...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{towards a}} quick, easy and reliable {{solution to the}} quite complex problems connected with the Amadori's compounds and furosine formation in several foodstuff is here proposed and based on enzymatic reactions, either as far as L-lysine release after partial hydrolysis from <b>proteic</b> <b>material</b> of the food matrix (bioavailable L-lysine), or {{as far as the}} determination of total and free L-lysine is concerned. The contribution proposes the use of specific L-lysine sensitive bioelectrodes for the evaluation of the possible heat damage through the rapid measure of L-lysine consumption. The L-lysine biosensor has been realized by immobilizing the enzyme L-lysine-α-oxidase (LOx) on an amperometric H 2 O 2 sensitive electrode. The bioelectrode-enzymatic reaction arrangement allows to perform determinations of L-lysine and bioavailable L-lysine in foodstuff from different sources and after different thermal treatments in a very rapid inexpensive and reliable way in the range 1. 0 - 33  ppm, with a limit of detection LOD = 0. 5  ppm, so that a considerable number of samples can be easily monitored quickly and with very low costs. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of {{maternal}} proteic desnutrition on the neurons of the myenteric plexus of the jejunum of rats from Rattus norvegicus species. It was used litters of female rats which received diet with normal proteic level during gestation and lactation (group NN), normal diet during gestation and hypoproteic diet during lactation (group ND); hypoproteic diet during gestation and normal diet during lactation (group DN); hypoproteic diet during both gestation and lactation (group DD). After weaning all the animals received diet of normal proteic level until the 60 th day of age, when they were killed. The jejunum of the animals was subjected to whole-mount preparations stained by the method of Giemsa and used for the morphologic and quantitative analyses of the neurons of the myenteric plexus. We verified that maternal proteic malnutrition does not cause decrease {{on the number of}} myenteric neurons per unit area of jejunum in rats, but elicits mechanisms which assure that, when the animal again receives normal proteic level diet (22 %) there occurs storage of <b>proteic</b> <b>material</b> on the cytoplasm of the neurons, thus rendering them larger and strongly basophylic...|$|E
50|$|A {{commonly}} used synthetic material is PLA - polylactic acid. This is a polyester which degrades within {{the human body}} to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Similar materials are polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their degradation mechanism {{is similar to that}} of PLA, but they exhibit respectively a faster and a slower rate of degradation compared to PLA. While these materials have well maintained mechanical strength and structural integrity, they exhibit a hydrophobic nature. This hydrophobicity inhibits their biocompatibility, which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of biocompatibility, much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior biocompatibility, they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA. By combining the two different types of materials, researchers are trying to create a synergistic relationship that produces a more biocompatible tissue scaffolding.Scaffolds may also be constructed from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. <b>Proteic</b> <b>materials,</b> such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains.

40|$|Modern oil paints, {{introduced}} {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th century, differ from those classically used in antiquity in their chemical and compositional features. The main ingredients were still traditional drying oils, often used in mixtures with less expensive oils and added with several classes of additives. Consequently, detailed lipid profiling, together with the study of lipid degradation processes, is essential for the knowledge and the conservation of paint materials used in modern and contemporary art. A multi-analytical approach based on mass spectrometry was used for the study of original paint materials from Munch's atelier, owned by the Munch Museum in Oslo. The results obtained in the analysis of paint tubes were compared with those obtained by characterizing a paint sample collected from one of the artist's sketches for the decoration of the Festival Hall of the University of Oslo (1909 - 1916). Py-GC/MS was used as screening method to evaluate the presence of lipid, <b>proteic</b> or polysaccaridic <b>materials.</b> GC/MS after hydrolysis and derivatization allowed us to determine the fatty acid profile of the paint tubes, and to evaluate the molecular changes associated to curing and ageing. The determination of the fatty acid profile is not conclusive for the characterization of complex mixtures of lipid materials, thus the characterization of the triglyceride profiles was performed using an analytical procedure based on HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF. This paper describes the first application of HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF for the acquisition of the triglyceride profile in a modern paint sample, showing the potentialities of liquid chromatography in the field of lipid characterization in modern paint materials. Moreover, our results highlighted that the application of this approach can contribute to address dating, authenticity and conservation issues relative to modern and contemporary artworks...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteria}} in implant-related infections can evade host defenses by forming biofilms. The more we understand biofilm behavior, the better we can fight against then clinically. In vitro models for biofilms allow tests simulating in vivo conditions. In {{this study we}} evaluated the Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration-High Throughput Plates (MBEC™-HTP) as biofilm in vitro model for studies of implant associated infections. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms were grown on MBEC™-HTP. To ensure the biofilm formation, antibiotic susceptibility tests and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out. Susceptibility tests were carried out using gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampicin, fosfomycin, clindamycin, and linezolid. Colony forming units counting were carried out. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC) were estimated. The CFU counting showed potency of rifampicin and daptomycin against S. epidermidis biofilms and rifampicin against S. aureus biofilms. SEM images showed <b>proteic</b> <b>material</b> in contact with cells. The differences between BIC and MIC demonstrated the biofilm formation {{as well as the}} SEM images. Rifampicin and daptomycin are good choices against biofilm related infections. Moreover, after suggested modifications, the model used in this study is eligible to further studies of implant associated infections. © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Estudamos os efeitos da desnutrição protéica materna sobre os neurônios do plexo mientérico do jejuno de ratos da espécie norvegicus. Utilizamos filhotes de ratas que receberam dieta com teor protéico normal durante a gestação e a lactação (grupo NN), dieta normoprotéica durante a gestação e hipoprotéica durante a lactação (grupo ND); dieta hipoprotéica durante a gestação e normoprotéica durante a lactação (grupo DN); dieta hipoprotéica durante a gestação e lactação (grupo DD). Após o desmame todos os animais receberam dieta com teor protéico normal até os 60 dias de vida ocasião em que foram sacrificados. Preparados de membrana do jejuno foram corados pelo método de Giemsa e foram utilizados para análises morfológicas e quantitativas dos neurônios do plexo mientérico. Verificamos que a desnutrição protéica materna não provoca redução no número de neurônios mientéricos por área do jejuno de ratos, porém desencadeia mecanismos que fazem com que quando o animal volta a receber dieta com teor protéico normal (22 %) ocorra acúmulo de material protéico no citoplasma dos neurônios, o que os torna maiores e fortemente basofílicos...|$|E
