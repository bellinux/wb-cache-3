5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than {{demolishing}} vacant buildings, which drew criticism, as Housing Commissioner Daniel P.

O'Malley promised to enforce provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which require banks to invest in <b>poor</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> Tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore Teachers Union and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and after-school programs, while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro promised to continue the city's needle exchange program.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} ecological predictors of {{the trajectory of}} effortful control (EC) across ages 4, 5, and 6 in a community sample of young children (N = 796). The specific goals {{of the study were}} to examine <b>poor</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality as a predictor of EC development, to evaluate the moderating role of supportive and hostile parenting in relation to <b>poor</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality and EC development, and to determine if the interaction between <b>poor</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality and parenting predicted change in children’s social competence through the mediating role of EC. Data were analyzed using latent growth curve modeling (LGM). Results of the LGM analyses indicated that children experienced steady and significant improvements in EC across ages 4, 5, and 6. <b>Poor</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality {{was a significant predictor of}} the intercept of EC (EC at age 4) and the growth in EC across the three years of study. There were significant direct effects of supportive and hostile parenting on EC intercept. Hostile parenting emerged as a significant moderator of the relationship between <b>poor</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality and EC intercept. Neither of the mediated moderation analyses supported an indirect effect of EC on the interaction between <b>poor</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality and parenting predicting change in children’s social competence. However, several significant direct effects between supportive/hostile parenting and social skills at age 6 and between EC and social skills at age 6 emerged. Overall, the current study provides information regarding ecological predictors of EC and of the influential role of EC during early childhood...|$|R

25|$|There is a {{constant}} public debate about tracking students by ability into several types of secondary school (i.e. Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule). Opponents of streaming by ability claim that streaming is unfair, that parents from higher socio-economic groups are more effective in sending children of similar aptitude to higher-level schools (Gymnasium). Proponents of streaming claim that it limits income segregation {{between rich and poor}} areas, as wealthier parents in <b>poor</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> may still send their gifted children to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area. They also say that potential access to a Selective school would allow gifted children of lower-class parents living in <b>poor</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> better educational opportunities than if they were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.|$|E
