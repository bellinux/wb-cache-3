The Bollywoodesque production Bride and <b>Prejudice,</b> which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.|$|E

An unprejudiced firm with <b>prejudiced</b> neighbors employs more Red workers than its neighbors; it also earns more profits than its neighbors (as it hires more Red workers) and earns more profits than if it had located in an area with non-prejudiced neighbors. The new firm thus benefits from the presence of <b>prejudiced</b> firms in its immediate neighborhood.|$|R

Through these explanations, a <b>prejudiced</b> individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup behaviors to external causes and positive ingroup behaviors to dispositional causes.|$|R

5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected.

To determine the precise degree of <b>prejudice</b> sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of <b>prejudice</b> arising from its denial.|$|E
