5|$|Nigeria is the 12th largest {{producer}} of petroleum {{in the world}} and the 8th largest exporter, and has the 10th largest proven reserves. (The country joined OPEC in 1971). Petroleum plays a large role in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40% of GDP and 80% of Government earnings. However, agitation for better resource control in the Niger Delta, its main oil <b>producing</b> <b>region,</b> has led to disruptions in oil production and prevents the country from exporting at 100% capacity.|$|E

In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha. The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn <b>producing</b> <b>region,</b> also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E

25|$|The region's {{economy is}} rurally based with {{pastoral}} and horticultural farming providing {{a major source}} of income. The modern inhabitants, as their forebearers, continue to utilise the marine resources available. Lake Grassmere is the country's only salt works, producing 50% of the countries total salt requirement. Fishing and mussel farming are also extremely important in the region. Viticulture also has a very large impact on the local economy both directly, by way of employment and servicing required, and also by way of 'wine tourism'. The local cellars attracted hundreds of thousands of domestic and international tourists every year. The area also hosts the annual Marlborough Wine & Food Festival. Marlborough is now New Zealand's largest wine <b>producing</b> <b>region,</b> receiving worldwide recognition for its sauvignon blanc wines. Olive growing has also become popular in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Sommers, who {{graduated}} from UC Davis in the early 1950s, brought Pinot Noir cuttings to Oregon's Umpqua Valley in 1959 and planted them at HillCrest Vineyard in 1961. These first Pinot noir cuttings came from Louis Martinis Sr.'s Stanley Ranch located in the Carneros region of Napa Valley. The first commercial vintage from these grapes was the noted 1967 Pinot noir although test bottlings were made as early as 1963. In the 1970s several other growers followed suit. In 1979, David Lett took his wines to a competition in Paris, known in English as the Wine Olympics, and they placed third among Pinots. In a 1980 rematch arranged by French wine magnate Robert Drouhin, the Eyrie vintage improved to second place. The competition established Oregon as a world-class Pinot noir <b>producing</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

The government quickly put down the Nsala rebellion, reaffirming the Kongo-Dutch alliance. King Garcia II paid the Dutch for their services in slaves taken from ranks of Dembos rebels. These slaves were sent to Pernambuco, Brazil where the Dutch had taken over {{a portion of the}} Portuguese sugar <b>producing</b> <b>region.</b> A Dutch-Kongo force attacked Portuguese bases on the Bengo River in 1643 in retaliation for Portuguese harassment. The Dutch captured Portuguese positions and forced their rivals to withdraw to Dutch forts on the Kwanza River at Muxima and Masangano. Following this victory, the Dutch once again appeared to lose interest in conquering the colony of Angola.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The herbs from {{different}} <b>producing</b> <b>regions</b> have {{differences in the}} active constituents and efficacy. The quality of the herb from the authentic region is better than other <b>producing</b> <b>regions.</b> Nowadays, many peddlers substitute non-authentic herbs for authentic-region herbs {{in order to make}} more money. So it is important to distinguish herbs between different <b>producing</b> <b>regions.</b> This paper studies the data preprocessing and classification of taproot site data sets of Panax notoginseng from three different <b>producing</b> <b>regions.</b> Compare the effect of data preprocessing includes data standardization, instance selection, attribute selection and try to find out the best method and parameter settings for the data sets. Finally, we use different classification algorithms to classify the preprocessed data and compare the classification performance to find the optimal classification algorithm for the data sets. The classification performance in the experiment was evaluated by Percent Correct (PC), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Kappa Statistics (KS), Area Under ROC (AUR), Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results shows that using decimal scaling to standardize the data and choose the subset of attribute { 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 }is suitable for the data and Random Forest algorithm and AdaBoost.

25|$|In California, the {{influence}} of Italian immigrants in {{the early history of}} the state's wine industry introduced Nebbiolo to the United States in the 19th century. As Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot increased in popularity in the 20th century, Nebbiolo (as well as other Italian grape varieties) steadily decreased in plantings. Today there are scattered plantings of Nebbiolo throughout the state with the majority located in the jug wine <b>producing</b> <b>region</b> of the Central Valley. As California wine producers aim for producing higher quality wines, there has been difficulties in locating ideally suited sites for Nebbiolo and the progress in producing world class California Nebbiolo is considerably behind that of other Italian varietals like Sangiovese, Primitivo and even Barbera and Dolcetto. In Washington State, Nebbiolo was first planted in the Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1985 with the first varietal release in 1987. As in California, Washington producers are {{still trying to figure out}} which sites are best suited to grow Nebbiolo. While the wine is mainly produced as a varietal, some producers make blends with Dolcetto and Syrah added in.|$|E
500|$|The {{hurricane}} was {{the first}} to directly strike Miami since Hurricane King in the 1950 season. Cleo intensified rapidly just prior to landfall, bringing sustained winds of 100–105mph (160 km/h–170km/h) with gusts to 135mph (215km/h) to the Miami area, due to moving over water temperatures of 30 to 32degrees Celsius and its compact size. [...] Lightning was observed within the eyewall at the National Hurricane Center. [...] The pressure fell to 967.6mb (28.57inches) in North Miami. [...] Major damage was constrained to a 20–35mile (30km–50km) wide strip from Miami to Melbourne, [...] in the form of broken glass, interior flooding, uprooted trees, overturned aircraft, power failures, and agriculture.
