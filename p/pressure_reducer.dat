50|$|A rod-in-tube type <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> is {{the most}} {{effective}} method of pressure reduction. As per the latest technology, a variable rod-in-tube <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> with thermal and safety relief valve device (VRTS) is considered to be the most reliable and safe device. Variable Rod in Tube System (VRTS) is a system in itself that takes care of some important aspects of sample conditioning. The <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> in the VRTS is rated for high temperature up to 550 Deg C and high pressure. There is no need of filters before the VRTS, as cleaning is on-line, without using any tools. For maintenance, no-shut-down is required. Cleaning can be done simply by rotating knob for 20 turns and re-applying the pressure. During high temperature cut-off, the operator can collect the sample through separate port. It's an energy saving device as it operates without any external electrical power. There is built-in safety for the operator, as a safety valve is built-in with the system.|$|E

The lower bulkhead of the inner assembly structure provides mounting space for all LSS equipment. The oxygen supply system operates through these loops and includes a 4.5 cm³ capacity oxygen bottle, a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> and regulator, an artificial lung, CO2 absorber, and water supply.

5000|$|The valve {{assembly}} is the appliance {{which will make}} {{the connection between the}} cylinder and the hose (which will send the air to a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer).</b> It is constructed of forged aluminum alloy, and is angled to reduce stress of the connection made between the high-pressure female coupling of the high pressure hose. Newer cylinders contain a [...] "tri lobe, ergonomically designed hand wheel."This hand wheel is a one-way, ratcheting type knob which is a push to close style knob. This protects the user from unwanted accidental shutoff during use.|$|E
40|$|A {{pneumatic}} {{hand spray}} pistol for applying coloured lacquers has separate pipelines (3, 4, 9) for the medium to be applied, atomising air and pressurised air. At {{least in the}} pipeline for the pressurised air and/or the one for the medium, there are devices (6, 8) controlled by a unit (2) which influence the spray geometry and/or the flow rate. There is another such device in the pipeline for the atomising air. The control unit has a store for different settings for the devices and these settings can be called up by the user. The devices comprise solenoid valves, <b>pressure</b> <b>reducers,</b> <b>pressure</b> controllers, metering units or proportional valves.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} minimization of printed-wiring conductors {{the detection of}} particle numbers and sizes {{is becoming more and}} more important in the semiconductor industry. Particle sources are, among others, components (as e. g. valves, mains, <b>pressure</b> <b>reducers,</b> filters, etc.). It will be a main task in the future to measure the particle generation of these components. The target of the guideline is to provide a standardized basis for particle determination in order to be able to compare different components and their particle emission. This proposal has been worked out and tested at the IPA within the joint project Media Supply. The project was carried out at the IPA together with the 34 participating companies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo phase (water and {{supercritical}} CO 2) residence times {{close to}} and {{further away from}} injectors depend on heterogeneous flow fields and mineral reactions. Residence times are here shown to be sufficiently long for fast reactions like carbonate dissolution or salt precipitation to occur fairly close to the injection well, while slower reactions like silicate dissolution may be sufficiently fast only in far-field locations. Significant poroperm changes in the near-well area are thus only likely to be observed in sediments with a considerable carbonate content, and in sediments with very saline formation waters. Sufficient proton comsumption for pressure dissipation will only occur at a considerable distance from the injection point, but since pressure transfer is fast, mineral induced pressure dissipation is likely to affect injection rate in storages with a significant content of immature mineral components. CO 2 storage filling patterns will thus rely on both fast and slow reactions. The impact of fast reactions is to modify porosity and permeability in the near-well zone, while slow reactions in the far-field zone have an influence on injectivity and flow directions through their feedback on CO 2 partial pressure, {{and they may be}} important <b>pressure</b> <b>reducers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Water {{pressures}} vary {{in different}} locations of a distribution system. Water mains below the street may operate at higher pressures, with a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> located at each {{point where the}} water enters a building or a house. In poorly managed systems, water pressure can be so low as to result only in a trickle of water or so high that it leads to damage to plumbing fixtures and waste of water. Pressure in an urban water system is typically maintained either by a pressurised water tank serving an urban area, by pumping the water up into a water tower and relying on gravity to maintain a constant pressure in the system or solely by pumps at the water treatment plant and repeater pumping stations.|$|E
50|$|Where {{there is}} a {{plentiful}} head of water {{it can be made}} to generate compressed air directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> at the high level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air {{in the top of the}} chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the Montreal River at Ragged Shutes near Cobalt, Ontario in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.|$|E

40|$|Why is {{understanding}} hydraulics important? The {{science of}} hydraulics {{is as old}} as civilization itself. For centuries, engineers have succeeded in making water flow {{from one place to another}} with as few hitches as possible. When problems do occur, they are usually related to the hydraulics involved in pipe flow. Liquids in motion produce forces and pressure whenever the velocity, flow direction, or elevation changes. Knowing pipe pressure and flow at certain points along the pipe’s path can help determine pipe size and capac-ity. It also can help in determining what pipe material would work best in given situations. Further, having an understanding of hydraulics can help system managers decide if <b>pressure</b> <b>reducers</b> or pumps are necessary to transport water in an efficient manner. Most small water and wastewater systems do not have an engineer on staff, or even one they can consult, who might be able to answer simple or basic questions about hydraulics. And the cost of engineering advice can quickly add up. Because many small systems are on tight budgets, understanding hydraulics can save money. Units and Variables First of all, understanding that water has a unit weight is important. System designers need this information to calculate other variables. The physical and hydraulic behavior of wastewater is so similar to that of clean water that there is generally no difference in the design or analysis of systems involving these two liquids. For practical purposes, water and wastewater are considered to be incompressible liquids because their volume does not change significantly with changing pressure. Water or wastewater has a unit weight of 62. 4 pounds pe...|$|R

To prevent {{degradation of the}} monodisperse aerosol, it is dispersed by entrainment in a high velocity gaseous stream. To provide an interface for direct injection into a mass spectrometer or to interface a liquid chromatograph with a mass spectrometer, the generator {{is followed by a}} desolvation chamber operating at about atmospheric pressure and a multistage <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> which evacuates solvent vapor and gaseous medium to form a high momentum, solvent-depleted solute aerosol beam which is input into the mass spectrometer.

An initially significant decrease in intraocular pressure after removal disappeared exponentially with a half-time of 9. 6 minutes, indicating that the benefits derived from the Honan balloon do not result from a sustained reduction in intraocular pressure. Measurements made on a phantom eye showed both marked variability and unexpectedly high intraocular pressure during typical preoperative digital massage {{by a group of}} ophthalmic surgeons. Measurements made on a cadaver eye after application of the Honan balloon showed that very high intraocular pressures may be achieved under some conditions...|$|E

This was carried out at the TONI dairy in Zurich, Switzerland, by replacing a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> with a turbine-generator set, thus adding a ""micro-hydroelectric generating station"" into the supply line of its water reservoir. The turbine-generator set consists of a standard pump with an asynchronous motor which is driven in reverse direction.

40|$|Irrigation {{has been}} an {{essential}} part of Utah’s agriculture since pioneer days. Over half of Utah’s 1. 3 million irrigated acres are watered using surface methods such as flood, furrow, border, or basin irrigation. About 40 % of the irrigated acreage is under some form of sprinkler irrigation, including hand move, wheel move, center pivot, and other types. Low flow or micro-irrigation systems, including drip emitters, emitter tubes, drip tapes, bubblers and micro-sprinklers (sprays) are currently used on {{only a small fraction of}} the total irrigated area, but will become more common as water becomes more scarce and expensive. Currently, low flow and micro-irrigation is primarily used in orchards, vegetables and landscapes. When designed and operated properly, low flow or micro-irrigation systems apply water more efficiently and uniformly than sprinklers or surface irrigation systems, conserving water and generating higher yield per unit of water applied. Most low-flow systems are designed to operate at pressures of 10 to 25 pounds per square inch (psi). Municipal water systems typically deliver water at 50 to 70 psi. Water pressure can be tested with a pressure gage designed for water systems. Some gages are designed to test static pressure and can be fastened directly onto the hose bib or pipe. Other gauges are designed to test the pressure of flowing water, such as in a sprinkler nozzle, by inserting the tester directly into the stream of water. Simple pressure gages can be purchased at a local plumbing or irrigation supply store. For most low-flow systems, a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> will need to be installed to provide the manufacturer-recommended pressures for low-flow components and fittings. Be sure to install the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> before testing for flow rate...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{reducing}} {{devices are}} the essential and critical {{components of a}} pneumatic system. But the energy lose due to the pressure reducing process is considerably huge {{when there is a}} high pressure difference. Aiming at this issue, firstly, the mechanism and quantification method of the energy loss in the throttling reducing process is analyzed based on pneumatic power theory. Then, a power recovery type (PRT) <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> which can output shaft power during the reducing operation is proposed. The basic mechanical structure and the working principle of the PRT reducer are described. For evaluating the feasibility of the design, a thermodynamic model of the PRT reducer is established. And under specific parameter settings, simulations on the PRT reducer’s power output characteristics and the pressure regulating ability are carried out. On this basis, the principle structure of an energy recycling high pressure pneumatic system is proposed. This research is the theoretical foundation of the prototype design of a PRT high pressure reducing device...|$|E
40|$|Alternative fuels such as {{compressed}} {{natural gas}} (CNG) have lately gained an increasing interest due to the even more stringent emission regulations and environmental policies. Considerable R&D activity {{has been carried out}} in order to enhance the mixture formation and to improve the after treatment efficiency. The achievement of these goals cannot disregard the importance of the injection system and of its component (common rail, injectors and pressure reducing valve) on the air-to-fuel mixing. The amount of injected fuel should in fact be properly targeted by the ECU basing on the estimation of the induced air and accounting for the embedded closed-loop strategies. Still, these latter are normally derived from engine-base routines and totally ignore the injection system dynamics. The present paper aims at developing a thorough model of the injection system with specific attention to the one component which significantly contributes to fully defining its dynamic response, i. e. the pressure reducing valve. The <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> is made up of various elements that retain diverse weights on the valve behavior and should consequently be differently addressed to. The research has been focused on defining the set of parameters to be precisely reproduced in the 0 D- 1 D simulation so as to match the injection system experimental behavior. A refined model of the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> has hence been proposed and the model has been calibrated, tested and run under various operating conditions so as to assess for the set-up validity. Comparisons have been carried out on steady state points as well as through out a vehicle driving cycle and the model capability to properly reproduce the real system characteristic has been investigated into. The proposed valve model has proved to consistently replicate the injection system response for different speed and load conditions. A few methodological indications concerning modeling aspects of a pressure regulator can be drawn from the present study. Finally, the model has been run in a predictive mode so as to inquiry into the response of the system to fast transient operations, both in terms of speed and load. The model outputs have highlighted mismatches between the ECU target mass and the actually injected one and have hinted at the need for dedicated and refined control strategies capable of preventing anomalies in the mixture formation and hence in the engine functioning...|$|E
40|$|The use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as {{fuel for}} spark {{ignition}} engines {{originally designed to}} be gasoline fuelled is common practice in many countries. Despite this, some questions remain still open. The present paper deals with the two main problems related to LPG port-fuel SI engines: the volumetric efficiency drop and the LPG evaporator device performance. A passengers car SI engine equipped with a “third generation” kit for the dual-fuel operation was tested using a dynamometer test rig. A single-stage <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> was selected as LPG evaporator, {{to take advantage of}} an additional pre-heating of the liquid LPG that allows higher power output than a two-stage device of the same size. Engine performance, volumetric efficiency and change of LPG thermodynamic states in the evaporator were measured both in steady-state and transient operation of the engine. Steady-state measurements show the advantage of LPG in terms of engine efficiency, and quantify the drop in steady-state brake torque due to the volume swept by gaseous fuel in the fresh charge admission process. On the other hand, transient measurements show that a single-stage evaporator device is capable to match overall simplicity and satisfactory performance during strong changes in engine load...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} propagation and burned-gas expansion {{processes in}} a bi-fuel CNG SI engine {{were characterized by}} applying a newly developed diagnostic tool, {{in order to better}} understand how these processes are related to the fuel composition, to the engine operating variables {{as well as to the}} exhaust emissions. The diagnostic tool is based on an original multizone heat-release model that is coupled with a CAD model of the burned-gas containing surface for the computation of the burning speed and the burned-gas mean expansion velocity. Furthermore, the thermal and prompt NO sub-models, embedded in the diagnostic code, were employed to study the effects of NO formation mechanisms and thermodynamic parameters on nitric oxide emissions. A previously developed multivalve bi-fuel SI engine has been upgraded to take a wide experimental database of in-cylinder pressure time-histories, engine performance and pollutant emissions throughout an extended air-fuel ratio interval for both fuels, i. e., gasoline and CNG (up to the lean-combustion stability limit) and an enlarged speed range for CNG (up to 6500 rpm). In particular, the CNG <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> upstream of the injection system was replaced to deliver the gaseous fuel at higher pressures and the CNG injectors were replaced with new injectors purposely designed and realized with larger flow nozzle areas. Experimental tests have thus been carried out in a broad interval of speeds (n = 2000 - 5500 rpm), loads (bmep = 200 - 790 kPa), relative air-fuel ratios (RAFR = 0. 80 - 1. 60) and spark advances (SA ranging from 8 deg retard to 8 deg advance with respect to MBT timing). One of the main findings was that the ratio between the burning speed Sb and the laminar flame speed SL, at the point of the engine cycle where Sb peaks, scales with n. The scale factors were worked out for both gasoline and CNG operations. The effects of operating engine variables on flame propagation parameters were analyze...|$|E
40|$|CNG is {{at present}} {{retaining}} a growing interest as a factual alternative to traditional fuel for SI engine {{thanks to its}} high potentials in reducing the engine-out emissions. Increasing thrust into the exploitation of NG in the transport field is in fact produced by the even more stringent emission regulations which are being introduced into the worldwide scenario. Specific attention is also to be devoted to heavy duty engines given the high impact they retain due to the diesel oil exploitation and to the PM emissions, the latter issue assessing for the need to shift towards alternative fuels such as natural gas. A thorough control of the air-to-fuel ratio appears to be mandatory in spark ignition CNG engines {{in order to meet}} the even more stringent thresholds set by the current regulations. The accuracy of the air/fuel mixture highly depends on the injection system dynamic behavior and to its coupling to the engine fluid-dynamic. The amount of injected fuel should in fact be properly targeted by the ECU basing on the estimation of the induced air and accounting for the embedded closed-loop strategies. Still, these latter are normally derived from engine-base routines and totally ignore the injection system dynamics. Thus, a sound investigation into the mixing process can only be achieved provided that a proper analysis of the injection rail and of the injectors is carried out. The first part of the present work carries out a numerical investigation into the fluid dynamic behavior of a commercial CNG injection system by means of a 0 D- 1 D code. The research has been focused on defining the set of parameters to be precisely reproduced in the 0 D- 1 D simulation so as to match the injection system experimental behavior. Specific attention has been paid to the one component which significantly contributes to fully defining its dynamic response, i. e. the pressure reducing valve. The <b>pressure</b> <b>reducer</b> is made up of various elements that retain diverse weights on the valve behavior and should consequently be differently addressed to.

The model outputs have highlighted mismatches between the ECU target mass and the actually injected one and have hinted at the need for dedicated and refined control strategies capable of preventing anomalies in the mixture formation and hence in the engine functioning. The second part of the present work aims at deeply investigating into the potentials of a heavy duty engine running on CNG and equipped with two different injection systems, an advanced SP one and a prototype MP one. The considered 7. 8 liter engine was designed and produced to implement a Sigle-Point (SP) strategy and has hence been modified to run with a dedicated Multi-Point (MP) system so as to take advantage of its flexibility in terms of control strategies. More specifically, a thorough comparison between the experimental performances of the engine equipped with the two injection systems has been carried out at steady state as well as at transient operations. Better performances in terms of cycle-to-cycle variability were proved for the MP system despite poorer mixture homogeneity. Attention has also been paid to the different engine control strategies to be eventually adopted in compliance with the constraints set by the two different layouts. A 0 D- 1 D model has also been built and validated on the experimental data set to be hence exploited for investigating into different strategies both for the SP and for the MP layout. An extensive simulation has been carried out on the effects of the injection phasing on the SP system performance referring to the engine power output and to the air-to-fuel ratio homogeneity amongst the cylinders. Finally, as far as the MP injection system is concerned, the innovative fire-skipping (DSF) or cylinder deactivation has been considered and deployed by means of the numerical model, assessing for an overall decrease in the fuel consumption of 12 % at part load operations...|$|E
