5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E
5|$|<b>Probably</b> <b>because</b> {{he was one}} of the few Eastern Roman Emperors {{widely known}} in the West, the Late Antique Colossus of Barletta was {{considered}} to depict Heraclius.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E

25|$|The name Chantilly was <b>probably</b> used <b>because</b> the château {{had become}} a symbol of refined food.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} <b>probably</b> declining <b>because</b> of habitat loss but is fairly {{adaptable}} and is probably still common.|$|R
5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> it was widely thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> they are vulnerable to pollution. This may make the population of Coptothyrus adamsi useful {{as a measure of}} environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> {{of the success}} of {{infantry}} tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
50|$|By default, WASTE {{listens to}} {{incoming}} connections on port 1337. This was <b>probably</b> chosen <b>because</b> of 1337's leet connotations.|$|R

50|$|The {{question}} {{over the}} location of the Irminsul is however, <b>probably,</b> misleading; <b>because</b> there may have been several of them.|$|R
5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In general, ticks are to {{be found}} {{wherever}} their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> of the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E
5|$|Siward {{is said to}} {{have built}} a church {{dedicated}} to St Olaf at Galmanho, York. The record of his burial in this church is the only notice of a non-royal lay burial inside a church in pre-Norman England. Siward's Howe, i.e., Heslington Hill near York, was most likely named after Earl Siward, although <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> Siward held popular courts there rather than because it was his burial place.|$|E
5000|$|..... that {{a return}} to 'free' {{competition}} means for the great mass of people a tyranny <b>probably</b> worse, <b>because</b> more irresponsible, {{than that of the}} state.|$|R
50|$|The next EP, Leave Me No Choice, had {{the same}} tracks, but <b>probably</b> re-recorded, <b>because</b> the line-up was {{composed}} by Garvey and newcomers Tony Friel and Karl Burns.|$|R
5000|$|If he {{only gets}} a few {{incorrect}} keys, then the bit is most <b>probably</b> valid, <b>because</b> his calculated keys {{and the public}} keys {{seem to be the}} same.|$|R
5|$|The rebels {{abandoned}} their fortified camp on Mount Bábolna, most <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> they needed new provisions. They moved towards Dés, pillaging the noblemen's manors during their march. They threatened all {{who did not}} support them with severe punishments. They established a new camp on the Szamos (Someș) River near the town. A new battle was fought between the rebels and their enemies near the camp in late September.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{distribution}} stretching discontinuously across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to western Siberia. The subspecies S. a. mauritanica extends the range into northwest Africa. This essentially non-migratory owl is absent from Ireland (<b>probably</b> <b>because</b> of {{competition from the}} long-eared owl), and only a rare vagrant to the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|The underdrawing {{is visible}} through modern {{technical}} analysis, revealing the main group of figures and contour {{lines in the}} folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> of later overpainting. In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends {{far to the left}} of the angel, but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution.|$|E

30|$|Panner’s {{disease is}} <b>probably</b> underdiagnosed, <b>because</b> the {{symptoms}} and findings on radiographs can be subtle [13, 27]. In some cases in this review, OCD could be misnamed Panner’s disease.|$|R
50|$|Hagelschloss is <b>probably</b> named <b>because</b> of its {{position}} dominating the Hagelthal valley. In the 19th century, {{it was known}} as Waldberg and is mentioned as such in certain historic documents.|$|R
5|$|Vahan was {{instructed}} by Heraclius {{not to engage}} in battle until all avenues of diplomacy had been explored. This was <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> Yazdegerd III's forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, though their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, to a similar end. These negotiations delayed the battles for a month.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Cardiff Castle {{escaped the}} slighting, or {{deliberate}} damage and destruction, that affected many other castles. <b>Probably</b> <b>because</b> {{of the threat}} of a pro-Royalist invasion by the Presbyterian Scots, a Parliamentary garrison was installed instead and the castle remained intact. The Herberts continued to own the castle as the Earls of Pembroke, both during the interregnum and after the restoration of Charles II. The castle's constable continued to act as mayor of the town of Cardiff, controlling the meetings of the town's burgesses, bailffs and aldermen; the Herberts usually appointed members of the more important local gentry to this position during the period.|$|E
5|$|Although a 2007 study {{estimated}} that introducing DST to Japan would reduce household lighting energy consumption, a 2007 simulation {{estimated that}} DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither study examined non-residential energy use. This is <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> DST's effect on lighting energy use is mainly noticeable in residences.|$|E
50|$|Ch. braunii {{has been}} placed on a “red” list of {{endangered}} algae in Poland in the category “indeterminate”, but <b>probably</b> simply <b>because</b> of poor investigation of the species in Poland.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{the reason}} why these deluded creatures {{supposed}} trees to grow out of the ground, instead of out of the air, is <b>probably</b> only <b>because</b> they saw their roots there.|$|R
30|$|Now, we {{announce}} {{our first}} result (<b>probably</b> new <b>because</b> {{of using the}} new lemma, Lemma  2.1 with the comparison function). It generalizes several known results in the literature [9 – 12].|$|R
5|$|Edward {{married his}} second wife, Ælfflæd, {{at about the}} time of his father's death, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> Ecgwynn had died, {{although}} she may have been put aside. The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, Ælfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred. Edward had several daughters, perhaps as many as nine.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{gave the}} ruins to the Carey family, who {{retained}} {{it until it}} passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families. The castle {{was not involved in}} the events of the English Civil War in the 17th century, and escaped the slighting that affected many similar properties, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> the collapse of the outer walls had already made it indefensible and of little military value. In 1737, after the death of Edward Coke, the castle and the surrounding manor were bought by Thomas Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, for £22,500.|$|E
5|$|In 1216, when a Scottish army {{invaded the}} Eden valley and Alan of Galloway {{occupied}} Westmorland, Brougham Castle played {{no part in}} the county's defence, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> it was unfinished. Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217. Vieuxpont received control over the king's revenues from Cumberland, and these helped fund {{the construction of the}} castle. Brougham Castle was constructed {{in the northern part of}} the old Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228, his only son John was a minor, so his property was taken into the care of a warden.|$|E
50|$|A Volcanic {{eruption}} {{took place}} in 1222 at a volcanic field in Northern Syria near Killis (also Kilis), Turkey. The volcano <b>probably</b> formed <b>because</b> of a regional Graben. The Volcano is Andesitic-Basaltic in composition.|$|R
5000|$|Wells' {{subsequent}} {{career was}} undermined {{both by the}} increasingly unaffordable ethos of the Arts and Crafts movement after 1918, but <b>probably</b> also <b>because</b> of his perceived role in {{the failure of the}} Nobles' marriage.|$|R
50|$|It {{was removed}} in 1886. Its use was <b>probably</b> {{discontinued}} <b>because</b> the installation had lost both its novelty and usefulness through {{the more general}} availability of Greenwich time, and the greater accuracy of public clocks.|$|R
