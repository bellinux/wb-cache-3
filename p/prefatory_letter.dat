6000|$|Your letter, {{like all}} the best, and even kindest things in this world, is both painful and pleasing. But, first, to what sits nearest. Do you know I was {{actually}} about to dedicate to you,--not in a formal inscription, as to one's elders,--but through a short <b>prefatory</b> <b>letter,</b> in which I boasted myself your intimate, and held forth the prospect of your poem; when, lo! the recollection of your strict injunctions of secrecy as to the said poem, more than once repeated by word and letter, flashed upon me, and marred my intents. I could have no motive for repressing my own desire of alluding to you (and not a day passes that I do not think and talk of you), but an idea that you might, yourself, dislike it. You cannot doubt my sincere admiration, waving personal friendship for the present, which, by the by, is not less sincere and deep rooted. I have you by rote and by heart; of which ecce signum!

5000|$|Most major humanists were {{prolific}} letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in {{the case}} of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, {{only a small portion of}} his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, <b>prefatory</b> <b>letters</b> (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called [...] "prison-letters" [...] (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution. More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet Germain de Brie, which culminated in the publication of de Brie's Antimorus (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of Poggio’s {{literary}} production, his activity as translator from Greek to Latin covered only a short period, from 1443 to around 1450. These years saw the translation of Xenophon’s Cyropaedia, two dialogues of Lucian (the Ass and the Cynic), and the first five books of Diodorus Siculus’ Bibliotheca historica. Moreover, in MS Pal. lat. 1552, Lilius Tifernas’ translation of Lucian’s True History is erroneously ascribed to Poggio. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine Poggio’s translation theory through an analysis of the <b>prefatory</b> <b>letters</b> that accompany his translations. It will be shown that his ambitions and methods as a translator are closely connected to those advocated and practised by his friend and role model Leonardo Bruni. In Poggio’s own words, he expressed “not each little sentence, but followed the narrative”, and acted “not merely as a switcher of words, but as a conveyor of meaning. "status: accepte...|$|R
6000|$|The second defect I can generalize with {{tolerable}} accuracy, if {{the reader}} will pardon an uncouth and new-coined word. There is, I should say, not seldom a matter-of-factness in certain poems. This may be divided into, first, a laborious minuteness and fidelity in the representation of objects, and their positions, as they appeared to the poet himself; secondly, the insertion of accidental circumstances, in order to the full explanation of his living characters, their dispositions and actions; which circumstances might be necessary to establish {{the probability of a}} statement in real life, where nothing is taken for granted by the hearer; but appear superfluous in poetry, where the reader is willing to believe for his own sake. To this actidentality I object, as contravening the essence of poetry, which Aristotle pronounces to be spoudaiotaton kai philosophotaton genos, the most intense, weighty and philosophical product of human art; adding, as the reason, that it is the most catholic and abstract. The following passage from Davenant's <b>prefatory</b> <b>letter</b> to Hobbes well expresses this truth. [...] "When I considered the actions which I meant to describe; (those inferring the persons), I was again persuaded rather to choose those of a former age, than the present; and in a century so far removed, as might preserve me from their improper examinations, who know not the requisites of a poem, nor how much pleasure they lose, (and even the pleasures of heroic poesy are not unprofitable), who take away the liberty of a poet, and fetter his feet in the shackles of an historian. For why should a poet doubt in story to mend the intrigues of fortune by more delightful conveyances of probable fictions, because austere historians have entered into bond to truth? An obligation, which were in poets as foolish and unnecessary, as is the bondage of false martyrs, who lie in chains for a mistaken opinion. But by this I would imply, that truth, narrative and past, is the idol of historians, (who worship a dead thing), and truth operative, and by effects continually alive, is the mistress of poets, who hath not her existence in matter, but in reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|In 1819 he {{was sent}} back to Salem to school, and in the {{following}} year he wrote to his mother, who had remained at Raymond (the boy had found a home at Salem with another uncle), [...] "I have left school and have begun to fit for college under Benjm. L. Oliver, Lawyer. So you are in danger of having one learned man in your family.... I get my lessons at home and recite them to him (Mr. Oliver) at seven o'clock in the morning.... Shall {{you want me to be}} a Minister, Doctor, or Lawyer? A Minister I will not be." [...] He adds, at the close of this epistle--"O how I wish I was again with you, with nothing to do but to go a-gunning! But the happiest days of my life are gone." [...] In 1821, in his seventeenth year, he entered Bowdoin College, at Brunswick, Maine. This institution was in the year 1821--a quarter of a century after its foundation--a highly honourable, but not a very elaborately organized, nor a particularly impressive, seat of learning. I say it was not impressive, but I immediately remember that impressions depend upon the minds receiving them; and that to a group of simple New England lads, upwards of sixty years ago, the halls and groves of Bowdoin, neither dense nor lofty though they can have been, may have seemed replete with Academic stateliness. It was a homely, simple, frugal, [...] "country college," [...] of the old-fashioned American stamp; exerting within its limits a civilizing influence, working, amid the forests and the lakes, the log-houses and the clearings, toward the amenities and humanities and other collegiate graces, and offering a very sufficient education to the future lawyers, merchants, clergymen, politicians, and editors, of the very active and knowledge-loving community that supported it. It did more than this--it numbered poets and statesmen among its undergraduates, and on the roll-call of its sons it has several distinguished names. Among Hawthorne's fellow-students was Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who divides with our author the honour of being the most distinguished of American men of letters. I know not whether Mr. Longfellow was especially intimate with Hawthorne at this period (they were very good friends later in life), but with two of his companions he formed a friendship which lasted always. One of these was Franklin Pierce, who was destined to fill what Hawthorne calls [...] "the most august position in the world." [...] Pierce was elected President of the United States in 1852. The other was Horatio Bridge, who afterwards served with distinction in the Navy, and to whom the charming <b>prefatory</b> <b>letter</b> of the collection of tales published under the name of The Snow Image, is addressed. [...] "If anybody is responsible at this day for my being an author it is yourself. I know not whence your faith came; but while we were lads together at a country college--gathering blueberries in study-hours under those tall Academic pines; or watching the great logs as they tumbled along the current of the Androscoggin; or shooting pigeons and grey squirrels in the woods; or bat-fowling in the summer twilight; or catching trout in that shadowy little stream which, I suppose, is still wandering river-ward through the forest--though you and I will never cast a line in it again--two idle lads, in short (as we need not fear to acknowledge now), doing a hundred things the Faculty never heard of, or else it had been worse for us--still it was your prognostic of your friend's destiny that he was to be a writer of fiction." [...] That is a very pretty picture, but it is a picture of happy urchins at school, rather than of undergraduates [...] "panting," [...] as Macaulay says, [...] "for one and twenty." [...] Poor Hawthorne was indeed thousands of miles away from Oxford and Cambridge; that touch about the blueberries and the logs on the Androscoggin tells the whole story, and strikes the note, as it were, of his circumstances. But if the pleasures at Bowdoin were not expensive, so neither were the penalties. The amount of Hawthorne's collegiate bill for one term was less than 4l., and of this sum more than 9s. was made up of fines. The fines, however, were not heavy. Mr. Lathrop prints a letter addressed by the President to [...] "Mrs. Elizabeth C. Hathorne," [...] requesting her co-operation with the officers of this college, [...] "in the attempt to induce your son faithfully to observe the laws of this institution." [...] He has just been fined fifty cents for playing cards for money during the preceding term. [...] "Perhaps he might not have gamed," [...] the Professor adds, [...] "were it not for the influence of a student whom we have dismissed from college." [...] The biographer quotes a letter from Hawthorne to one of his sisters, in which the writer says, in allusion to this remark, that it is a great mistake to think that he has been led away by the wicked ones. [...] "I was fully as willing to play as the person he suspects of having enticed me, and would have been influenced by no one. I have a great mind to commence playing again, merely to show him that I scorn to be seduced by another into anything wrong." [...] There is something in these few words that accords with the impression that the observant reader of Hawthorne gathers of the personal character that underlay his duskily-sportive imagination--an impression of simple manliness and transparent honesty.|$|E

I met all of the principals, heard Ginsberg, Snyder, Whalen and McClure read in Berkeley in April, 1956, and continued to write, mostly poetry, in that vernacular and (I thought) oracular mode."

She then dismissed any errors she might make as trivial, asserting that she did not mean her text to be taken as truth. Rather, she wrote simply to pass time and expected that her work would be read for the same purpose. This epistle was also the contained her explanation for writing in verse. She stated that poets were thought to write fiction, and that fiction was aligned with pastime, not truth. Verse, then, was expected to contain errors. Cavendish lamented that her work was not more entertaining and advised readers to skip any part of the book that they did not like.|$|E

By 1560, Laura had assembled almost 200 poems and published {{her first book}} of poetry, The First Book of Tuscan Works, dedicated to the Medici duchess, Eleonora de Toledo. The book was an anthology classified by Petrarchan sonnets. It won praise from poets across Italy. She was sought after for membership in several Italian academies, a remarkable feat for {{a woman at the}} time. In 1560, she accepted entry into the most prestigious of the academies, “the Intronati,” becoming the first woman ever admitted to an Italian academy. Each member of the Intronati adopted a humorous, antiphrastic pseudonym, Laura’s being “la Sgraziata” or “the Graceless,” a characteristic contrary to her critiques. She published her second book, The Seven Penitential Psalms… with some Spiritual Sonnets in 1564 and dedicated it to the duchess of Urbino. In it, she proved successful as a biblical translator and exegete, both being skills typically reserved for men.

The nature of this teaching may be gathered from a series of eighty-five questions drawn by Thomas for the king, and still preserved, along with a <b>prefatory</b> <b>letter,</b> in his own writing at the British Museum; they were printed in Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials. Another autograph manuscript in the same collection contains six political discourses confidentially written for the king. These were published in their entirety, while that treating of foreign affairs was summarised by Burnet, and printed by Froude. Some further commonplaces of state drawn up by Thomas for the king's use are also printed in Strype. Froude suggests that Thomas's teaching, if not his hand, is also perceptible in the king's journal. He also dedicated to the king as [...] "a poore newe yeres gift", probably in January 1551, an English translation from the Italian of Josaphat Barbaro's account of his voyages to the east, which had been first published in Venice in 1543.

50|$|In December 1547 {{employed}} in conveying treasure to his father, Sir Edward Wotton, at Calais, and in 1551 succeeded to his estates, his father having procured two acts of parliament ‘disgavelling’ his lands in Kent. Edward VI had intended making him K.B., but after Mary's accession {{the council on}} 19 Sept. 1553 wrote him a letter ‘discharging him from being knight of the Bath, whereunto he was once appointed and written unto’ (Acts P. C. 1552-4, p. 351). On 16 Jan. 1553-4 he was summoned before the council, and on 21 Jan. ‘for obstinate standing against matters of religion was committed to the Fleet, to remain there a close prisoner’ (ib. pp. 385, 389). Walton in his ‘Life of Sir Henry Wotton’ (Reliquiæ Wottonianæ, 1685, sig. b4) declares that the council's action was due to Nicholas Wotton, who had twice dreamt that his nephew {{was in danger of}} participating in some dangerous enterprise, apparently Wyatt's rebellion, and secured his temporary imprisonment to save him from worse perils. The date of his release has not been ascertained; but on 23 Nov. 1558, six days after Elizabeth's accession, he was made sheriff of Kent. For nearly thirty years he was regularly included in the various commissions for the county, such as those for the peace, for taking musters, gaol delivery, examining into cases of piracy, and fortifying Dover. In July 1573 he entertained Queen Elizabeth at Boughton Malherbe, when he declined an offer of knighthood, and in 1578-9 again served as sheriff. He was a person of ‘great learning, religion, and wealth,’ and a patron of learning and Protestantism in others. Thomas Becon dedicated to him his ‘Book of Matrimony,’ and Edward Dering his ‘Sparing Restraint.’ William Lambarde also dedicated to Wotton in 1570 his ‘Perambulation of Kent,’ which was published in 1576 with a <b>prefatory</b> <b>letter</b> by Wotton.|$|E
