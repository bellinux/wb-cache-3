5|$|Nawaz Sharif {{resigned}} as <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> on 29 July 2017 and nominated his brother Shehbaz Sharif as his successor, but as Shehbaz {{was not a}} member of the National Assembly, he could not be immediately sworn in as <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister.</b> Therefore, Abbasi was chosen by Sharif as a temporary <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> for 45 days, which would allow two months time for Shehbaz to contest elections from Nawaz's vacated constituency in Lahore, be elected to the National Assembly, and become eligible to hold the office of <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister.</b>|$|E

5|$|The President must {{declare the}} office of <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> vacant if the <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is {{satisfied}} that the <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> has ceased to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> of his evaluation in this regard, and if the <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> requests him to, the President may dissolve Parliament instead of making a declaration of vacancy. A general election must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament.

5|$|The <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> of the United Kingdom is {{the head}} of the Government of the United Kingdom, and chairs Cabinet meetings. There is no {{specific}} date when the office of <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time. The term was used in the House of Commons in 1805 and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s, and in 1905 the post of <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> was officially given recognition in the order of precedence. Modern historians generally consider Sir Robert Walpole, who led the government of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742, as the first <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister.</b> Walpole is also the longest-serving <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> by this definition. However, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the first <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> and Margaret Thatcher the longest-serving <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> to have been officially referred to as such.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} of the <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> have varied through the years.

5|$|As a young woman, Razafindrahety {{married an}} Andriana (nobleman) named Ratrimo (Ratrimoarivony). Her husband died {{several years later}} on May 8, 1883, aged 22, leaving Razafindrahety a {{premature}} widow. According to rumor, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Rainilaiarivony may have arranged to have Ratrimo poisoned for political reasons. The Aristocratic Revolution of 1863, which had been orchestrated by Rainilaiarivony's older brother, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Rainivoninahitriniony, had replaced the absolute rule of the Andriana with a constitutional monarchy in which power was shared between an Andriana monarch and a Hova (freeman) <b>prime</b> <b>minister.</b> This arrangement was to be cemented by a political marriage between the <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> and a ruling queen effectively selected by him. As Queen Ranavalona II neared death {{and the search for}} her successor began, Rainilaiarivony may have had Ratrimo deliberately poisoned so that Razafindrahety, the most eligible successor, would be free to marry the <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> and succeed to the throne.|$|E

5|$|As the {{composition}} is not precisely defined, some states {{which have a}} considerable division of executive power can {{find it difficult to}} decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that {{there was no need for}} the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.|$|E
